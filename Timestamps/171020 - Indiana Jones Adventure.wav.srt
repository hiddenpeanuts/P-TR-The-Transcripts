00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Warning, the following podcast includes high octane Harrison Ford impressions, unadulterated adoration for the character Mutt Williams, and a pulse-pounding discussion of the Indiana Jones Adventure.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Strap in for Podcast the Ride.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Podcast the Ride, the show about theme parks hosted by three childless men in their 30s. I'm Scott Gardner joined by Mike Carlson.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hello.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And Jason Sheridan.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hi.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We are part of the Feral Audio Network, home to Doughboys and many other great podcasts, and we are the one about theme parks, as I said.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes, we are.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's been an exciting time in the world of theme parks lately. We're going to talk about the D23 Expo, which one of the three of us went to.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And our topic today is the Indiana Jones Adventure, aka Indiana Jones Temple of the Forbidden Eye, one of the great theme park rides of our time, of the time in which we've been alive.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Very excited.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So, yeah, welcome.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So, Mike, as I said, you just went to the D23 Expo, which for anybody listening who doesn't know it, it's the Comic Con of Disney, basically.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah, it's three days, three wonderful days in Anaheim. It's right by Disneyland. It's at the Anaheim Convention Center.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And yeah, if you know what Comic Con is, a Comic Convention, it is that, but just exclusively Disney.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So, like, you're getting panels from Imagineers, you're getting, like, big stadium filling events where they bring out movie stars and showing Disney and Pixar movies.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And the, you know, the thing that I was most excited about is the Parks and Resort presentation, where they announce all the fun rides and things coming to the Disney parks in the next few years.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And resorts.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And resorts.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There are cool resorts coming up.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah, there are different resorts. So it's crazy. So, yeah, so it's three days of that. And it's like, in addition to that, you're also going, like, table to table and seeing, like, people selling old merchandise.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So there's people, like, first of all, they'll have, like, old Fred McMurray Disney posters for movies that he made that you've never heard of.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He's the guy from The Absent-Minded Professor and My Three Sons.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Other films.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah, there you go.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Double Indemnity is a very famous, not a Disney movie, but a famous movie he was in.

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That famous Disney movie, Double Indemnity.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Well, Disney bought the theme park rights, but they did not.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
They have not. You made it the Double Indemnity ride, but.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Or a live show or a firework show.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The Double Indemnity stunt show, I believe, is what they would have to do.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You have to throw a body off a train caboose.

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Can we get a volunteer?

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You could get a job as a Double Indemnity stunt double.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
They had a big Fred McMurray picture, like, it was just a giant, like, it was probably, like, 10 feet by 10 feet picture of him.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And I go, what the hell?

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And I walked over and it's like, oh, it's he's like one of the first Disney legends, which is a distinction they give a lot of different people, like, that have, like, made a difference in the Disney, you know, whether it's movies or theme parks.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And they shed his footprints and handprints on display.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
OK. Oh, the Disney Legends ceremony is a thing that happened at this event.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yes.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Oprah is a Disney legend now.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Because she has a movie coming out this year that Disney made.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And she was well, she was syndicated, but she was on ABC stations.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Is that part of it? Maybe.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I think that's right.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
She was joined by who else?

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Stan the Man Lee and Jack Kirby, which is funny because now these these people, the Star Wars and Marvel have been bought by Disney.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So now they have to retroactively sort of be Disney legends because of their contributions to the IPs that Disney bought.

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So they were also part of the ceremony.

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
They ride around in like a little weird parade.

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So like there's little cars and like it's Mark Hamill having to wave to people inside the convention center inside and out.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes. I do not see them.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Not on to Catella Avenue.

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
They don't go into a main drag.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
There are no no main drags for the parade.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The parade is mostly just on the sidewalk outside the convention center by the right by like the Sbarro's pizza.

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Is where the cars drive by and like everyone waves.

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah. So that happens.

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I mean, there's so much stuff they have.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The big thing was that they were showing off the model for Star Wars land, which is now called Star Wars Galaxy's Edge, which is not as good as Star Wars land as far as the name is concerned.

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So, yeah. So to back up a little bit, Star Wars is coming to Disneyland and Disney World.

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
There's going to be a huge like is it 14 acre part?

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
14 acres. 14 acres.

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Cars land is 12 acres.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This is 14 acres.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So there's 14 acres of like a dedicated Star Wars land, which has like it's going to have restaurants like a cantina.

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's going to have two giant crazy cool rides like the like cutting edge technology.

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Droids walking about the land.

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Characters wandering around accosting you.

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah. There's going to be like flash mob things and like yeah.

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Like it seems like it seems like fun and then it also seems like man, if there's constant street performers like hassling you, you're like, OK, guys, can you sign up for an option in which you just do the ride like a regular person?

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You don't have to.

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I think spoken to.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No, there is not.

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'll stay out of it.

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Well, they're in Florida. There's going to be the announced there's going to be a hotel in Florida, a Star Wars themed hotel, and there are no windows in it. It's all just like fake space.

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So like when you look out your window, it just looks like it's space.

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It looks it feels like you're like living in space for a couple days.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And like I think you have to it's like going to be expensive as shit.

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And you're going to have to like take part in a whole thing where like you get a knock at the door like 8 a.m.

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And he's like, come quick, pedo on.

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We have to. And you're like, oh, my God, like you have to like.

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah, it's like these college no more times a thousand.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So also for families and humidity.

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah, it does. It seems fun.

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And also like maybe like once you're there, you're like, oh, this is a big pain in the ass.

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Like some college student knocking at your door at 8 a.m.

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Being like, hey, we must go quickly. Boba Fett is on our trail.

91
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And you're like, OK, hold on, man.

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
My wife hasn't even taken a shower yet.

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
OK, but another 45 minutes.

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We will need our sustenance.

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Keep in mind, there is an excellent, affordable buffet bar at the.

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yeah, yeah. But we brought those little cereal things, man.

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We're just going to eat the cereal. Yeah, no, no, no.

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Without seven choices of juice, you will not be able to withstand the IG eighty eight.

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We'll be waiting for you by the steam trays of pancakes.

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You know, I don't even like Star Wars land that much.

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's just not a busy season right now.

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And there was deals for this hotel.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You guys paid for this, though.

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You really should be playing along. Yeah, I don't know.

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I just thought this would be like how that boardwalk hotel looks like an old timey boardwalk.

106
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I just thought this would have like Han Solo boardwalk.

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What is a boardwalk? What's a boardwalk?

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
These words do not exist in our world.

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And then the college students just like, come on, fucking do just play along.

110
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm getting eight dollars an hour to do this. I'm being secret shopped.

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I have a body cam on me. If I don't do the skit, I get fired. Please.

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:39,000
If you like haunted houses, really intense haunted houses where they put a bag over your head and make you crawl around on the floor,

113
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
but always wish there could be a squid man knocking at your hotel room door.

114
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This Star Wars hotel is for you.

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I will say all the stuff we were talking about, I feel like is too much.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And then you said a squid man at the door. And I'm kind of sold on that.

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If they do get it, if an alien is the one, if an Admiral Akbar brought you your room service, I do like that.

118
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That is cool. Because there's a problem with your Visa card.

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Do you have another one we can use for incidentals?

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That's pretty good Akbar. Oh, thanks.

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Would you like a USA Today?

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It is an archive of Earth news from 2017, which is not this time. But if you're curious.

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And it's a future news because you know the crawl. You've seen the crawl of the movies. It's the future.

124
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
There's a picture in the Star Wars land they had in the display of like a street vendor selling meat.

125
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And it's an alien. And he looks a little similar to Unkar Plutt, the famous Force Awakens character, the portion quarter portions guy.

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And he looks very similar. And I was thinking because as a kid, I always want I almost like wanted Mickey to be working at Disneyland.

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I wanted all the characters to be doing the jobs like and this was I was like, wow, if this is this might be the first time when I will get a full character.

128
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Selling me some meat, which is I think I was literally like, oh, that's great.

129
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Like I would like to hand this, you know, again, poor college student in a full alien suit my card.

130
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
They swipe it and they hand me like, oh, this is meat from Alderaan.

131
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And it's like, of course, you're like, well, what is it, though? I have like an allergy.

132
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
There's a hamburger like it's a normal beef. Yeah.

133
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So I am excited about that part. It costs two hundred thirty nine Gleap Naps.

134
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
How much in Earth dollars is that we couldn't tell you?

135
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
We don't know. Get credit card statement later.

136
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Fifty bucks. I'm interested in this because the food in the Star Wars movies always looks disgusting.

137
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yes. Like the food besides the blue milk, which I think we all want to drink that sweet, sweet blue milk.

138
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Everything else is just like bowls of goo or bread that bubbles, bubbles up from nothing.

139
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Well, they're doing. Yeah. I mean, they're doing the thing because in Avatar land, which opened in Florida a couple of months ago,

140
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
they're none of the food is called like a conventional like, you know, Earth food.

141
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I mean, obviously it is all Earth food, but they're calling it other things or like a something pod or whatever.

142
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So they're going to have to have the weird goop.

143
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:17,000
They have to make human normal food look like a bunch of goop or some of the thing that like Luke is eating on and Peru,

144
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
like whatever and Peru prepared will be eating.

145
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So just put a bunch of eyeballs in it or just like some stray wookie fur on the rim of the plate.

146
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't know that anyone ate wookie fur in the movies, but maybe. Yeah, maybe that's a delicacy.

147
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yeah, there's a bunch of weirdo creatures. One of them might like hair.

148
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Hair might be the top delicacy. Sure. He's one of these dude ad guys.

149
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't know Star Wars. I should stay out of all.

150
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll skip the Star Wars land episode when it eventually occurred.

151
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You may not know it, but in 2019, you'll be living it.

152
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I guess I'll have to learn. I'll have no choice.

153
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
As far as the D23, though, they have there was a whole section like devoted to pirates.

154
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And like I was very excited because two years ago at the convention, they had a big Imagineering Pavilion and it showed like it was just like the actual animatronics.

155
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So you would see like stuff from Peter Pan. You would see stuff from Haunted Mansion.

156
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And it was like the real stuff. And then this one, I was like, oh, pirates.

157
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And I knew there was going to be like some movie stuff, which I was less enthused about.

158
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's like, look at Barbosa's coat from the first film.

159
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I was like, yeah, yeah, OK, which I actually also snuck into this because I didn't want to wait in line.

160
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Wow. Congrats. I actually stuck into a few things.

161
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's a behavior. Jack Sparrow would have been exactly.

162
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah, I felt like I would have made Will Turner proud.

163
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Right. Oh, everyone's favorite character worldwide sensation, Will Turner.

164
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But they did have some. So there was not enough, you know, rides.

165
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
There were some animatronics. They had the dog with a key in his mouth.

166
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
They had like one of the pirate robots with a frosty ale in his hand.

167
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Most of it was like, here's the here's the sword that Jack Sparrow used to like whatever the day.

168
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I guess Davy Jones like plunge through Davy Jones or whatever.

169
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But they but I will say the cool thing was they had this is this is so funny.

170
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
This is the thing that I like the most. They had memos like from Imagineers to each other.

171
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Like, here's what we want to do. And then there was an outline of the ride of the original Pirates of the Caribbean.

172
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And it's like it looked whether it was real or not, it looked old.

173
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So I was like, wow. And like you're imagining some short sleeve dress shirted old men like holding these pieces of paper and like passing it along and going, all right.

174
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And then there's a scene where the dog's got a key in his mouth.

175
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And like so I was very I have many pictures we can post that on all the social media.

176
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I saw pictures of I don't know if it was that but something down there of like old documents.

177
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And it said OK Walt on them like Walt had written in pencil OK and signed his name.

178
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yes. And they kept these like perfectly preserved him approving the right approving like yes.

179
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Scene outlines or that sort of thing. Wow.

180
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So if you were there with a child who was excited to see Barbosa's coat, you would have been like shut up.

181
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Keep moving. We got memos to see. Yes.

182
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I was very much excited more about the memos than any of the pirates movies, which I like some of the pirates movies.

183
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But like you're not you're not a D23 for the movies.

184
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You're there for the for the 50th anniversary of that ride, which is this year.

185
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Right. Which you could you could go on the ride several feet away or you could read memos about the making of the ride.

186
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But I've been on the ride so many times now I need to read.

187
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You've been on the ride now. Experience the memos.

188
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You need to know how long all the electrical cords that they bought for it were.

189
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Look at some drawings. Remember that pirate that's right handed in the ride in the drawing.

190
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That pirate is left handed. There is a cool there's a cool piece of art at the end of it.

191
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
There was an idea that as you were leaving the ride, you would look through a little peephole and there would be pirates behind it.

192
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And the pirates would all look and see you because they were like plotting.

193
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But that would never obviously came to fruition. But like they have art of like some some like abandoned things that they were going to do, which is really cool.

194
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So, you know, you know, D23 was cool.

195
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And then there's also a lot of like are there a lot of aftermarket like secondary markets that there's people selling like Disney paraphernalia.

196
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Right. Like, oh, yes, like this was the sign in the park or this was a thing.

197
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And I I've been at like smaller Disney fan conventions and there's there's some of that stuff.

198
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But it's very interesting to think about, like, how did you get this?

199
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Because there are some authorized auction houses that like sell pieces of like Disneyland, Disney World attractions.

200
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And then there's also other people who are like, yeah, this is this is from the fucking park.

201
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And it's clearly just like an eBay guy. Yeah.

202
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And it's just like a trash can they bought from somewhere else.

203
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah. Yeah. It's really hard to verify that some of these things were like the real this is the real Tiki sign from nineteen seventy five.

204
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It was the period where the Tiki sign didn't have the the font quite as big as it does now.

205
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And it's like it's like got a picture, but you're not quite sure.

206
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I mean, a lot of most of the places just have like old merch. Yeah.

207
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You know, they had like a if you're a Captain EO fan, Fuzzball, the flying character, they had a Fuzzball gasp there.

208
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Yeah. Scott is a big Fuzzball fan. Oh, boy.

209
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And they had like an old the real it was it was not the real Fuzzball, but it was it was a piece of merch from who knows?

210
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Twenty five years ago. Although did they bring them when they brought the ride back?

211
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Maybe they had a new Fuzzball made. I think they had a they had a lot of made.

212
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't think they had a new bag. So like you'll get stuff like that.

213
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And then like it's interesting to see some of the old merchandise because they certainly did not have the likenesses of the characters down yet.

214
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So it's like a Donald Duck hat. But Donald looked like he was in a fire or something like his beak just as very I mean, it's also, you know, sixty years old.

215
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But it's just like he's he's Donald Duck, but he's like Nightmare Donald Duck.

216
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And you were wearing on your hat before there were branding standards.

217
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Damn. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, well, speaking of artifacts from the past.

218
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh, what a very good. Yeah. What a transition. Oh, I thought so.

219
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Oh, there's one guy who would always make sure to verify what he found because he broke into a temple and found it himself.

220
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What am I talking about? You ask. Well, I could tell you or I could let a special guest tell the tale.

221
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm here in front of one of the great archaeological discoveries of our time.

222
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
The mysterious Temple of the Forbidden Eye. Hello, Michael Eisner, head of the Walt Disney Company.

223
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:54,000
An unprecedented move. The Walt Disney Imagineers have brought piece by piece this incredible treasure to America.

224
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You can now tour the Temple of the Forbidden Eye at Disneyland and Anaheim, California.

225
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:12,000
First of all, you choose to explore the temple. Be aware that some say evil and treacherous curse hangs over this ancient buildings.

226
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Enter at your own risk. And I'm out of here. He does not react to the snake. That was the reaction to that was it.

227
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It is an upsetting looking snake. That is that's the it is very upsetting.

228
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Yes. And that's like an Academy Award level performance on the spectrum of Michael Eisner performances.

229
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm making the presumption that anyone listens to who's listening to this knows about all these very stiff Michael Eisner intros to various specials, which are my favorite things ever.

230
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Michael, he really thought he was the heir to Walt Disney. Michael Eisner, when he was the head of the company.

231
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
He's like, I'm going to I'm going to be in the TV, too. I'm going to be introducing stuff like what you still didn't know.

232
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Mike, he didn't quite have the folksiness as old as Walt did.

233
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I have to admit, I do not I do not really watch the program Bojack Horseman, of which he is a producer, but he doesn't introduce every episode of Bojack Horseman.

234
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I wish he sounded like Michael Eisner when you play again.

235
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
So I was like, when you played that clip for the first time, I thought it was Trump for a second.

236
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Really? Hello. Hello there. There's a rasp that I always thought was similar.

237
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I see. This is the second episode now we've played an old man phoning in an introduction to an attraction.

238
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You know, I don't know if it is a classic, if there isn't a very stiff, sleepy intro to it.

239
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
If you don't have like a real big money, if the ride is not being introduced to you, buy a billionaire.

240
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Buy a billionaire. Is it worth my money? A sleepy billionaire. Forced to do this.

241
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I was meetings all day surrounding this intro.

242
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Hey, Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Forbidden Eye.

243
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's what we're talking about. Or the Indiana Jones Adventure.

244
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It has something else in common with the last one we talked about, the ET Adventure.

245
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Actually, a couple of things. It is a Steven Spielberg property made into a ride that is called an adventure,

246
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:14,000
in which, at least at one point, AT&T handed you little cards that did something for you in the line.

247
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Do you remember that about this attraction?

248
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I had not been on it. I was in it, excuse me, I didn't go on until my late 20s.

249
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
But I know of the, you're talking about the decoder cards.

250
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
This is something people might not know actually about the ride,

251
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
but the hieroglyphics that you see throughout it are a language that they sorted out.

252
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
They call them mauraglyphics because you were in the Temple of the God Mara.

253
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So there is a language that makes sense. And it actually just looks like English if you squint.

254
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's like pretty English-esque. It's not some super-Klingon-y tough-to-decode thing.

255
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
But they'd hand you these little cards so that as you went along, you could decode the language as you went.

256
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And none of it was profane or Disney, imagine you're trying to sneak something dirty in.

257
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Because this ride has one of the longest lines ever. Maybe the longest? I should have looked that up.

258
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It is half a mile long.

259
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
The line is?

260
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,000
The line is half a mile long. And it is very interesting, but the show building is so big

261
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and so far back from where you enter, they had to build this giant long queue. And it is cool.

262
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Because the space was occupied by the Jungle Cruise, so they had to figure out a way to weave you in this area

263
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
between the Jungle Cruise and Pirates of the Caribbean. That's kind of where you're going.

264
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
They built this show building on top of a portion of the old Eeyore parking lot.

265
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And there is a little hidden Eeyore somewhere in this ancient temple that you can find.

266
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I've always heard that. I've never seen it.

267
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I know where it is because a guy showed it to me one night.

268
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Which now that I said that, it sounds like he dropped his pants for me one night.

269
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Want to see my donkey?

270
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It was very late. It was close to park closing. We were waiting to go on the ride.

271
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And some college student, fresh out of college student, he goes, hey, you want to see something cool?

272
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And we said, of course, yes. And he took his flashlight and right before, it's the part where they're showing the old news reel

273
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and the line, the queue. He's showing his flashlight to the very back of the thing and you can see it right back there.

274
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
But it's very hard to see because it's very dark in that room.

275
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Yeah. The rare hidden Eeyore. There's a lot of hidden Mickey's. It's the only hidden Eeyore.

276
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Well, what do we know about this ride? Are we describing the ride to people?

277
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Scott, I wanted to ask you because you grew up in Southern California.

278
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Did you ride this ride soon after it opened?

279
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Because I know when it first opened, it was like three or four hour waits for this ride.

280
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
People loved it right out of the gate.

281
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Yes. Yeah. And that entire temple was full. Now they kind of like hold people and you do most of the line outside

282
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
and then they send you into the long. You kind of walk straight through all the temple.

283
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But it was like all the way out, I think when it opened, maybe all the way to Main Street

284
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
and then you would wind through Adventureland and Frontierland.

285
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And it was like a three to four hour.

286
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So you remember waiting that long?

287
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah, I did. Yeah. And there's no fast pass back then. I had to just do it.

288
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I remember and my wife also grew up around here and she because that line was so crazy, she hated the ride initially.

289
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It would have had to have been so incredible to make up for a four hour wait.

290
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It ended up letting her down. But if you don't do a four hour wait, it's obviously one of the greats.

291
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,000
The first time I rode it would have been like 2006 when I was out here for college.

292
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I didn't wait that I probably waited only like an hour, but I waited most of it in that that outside portion.

293
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That's kind of a jungle. And in the middle of summer, that is kind of miserable.

294
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Like you're very close to everyone. It is it is not.

295
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
There's a little bit of theming, but like nowhere near as much as when you get inside.

296
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And it's just kind of rough. Let heat.

297
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It is. Yeah, it can get really bad as far as heat. Let's let's back up and go to the story of the ride and then walk through it.

298
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Because so so I learned a few things, honestly, I've been on it a ton of times, but I didn't notice a few things.

299
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So so the story is that we're going into the Temple of the Forbidden Eye and we're supposed to be in India.

300
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Although Michael Eisner in that video says that likely they constructed the temple in Disneyland.

301
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Yeah, I just a little confusing that premise until that video that the Imagineers took it apart piece by piece and brought it here.

302
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And I guess the did they pick up the curse along the way or did the curse just get retained from India to that making of TV special does not make a lot of sense.

303
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
OK, it's sort of narratively a lot of. Yeah, it's kind of all over the map.

304
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So I think that might not be canon. I think the Michael Eisner.

305
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
So I think we just are in every Michael Eisner.

306
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
If if if Winnie the Pooh or Robin Hood meets Michael Eisner before the movie, that's part of the movie.

307
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Michael Eisner exists in every single cinematic universe.

308
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
He is a character in the Disney. They could probably still use him.

309
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
That like like Disney still owns the character Michael Eisner.

310
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Michael Eisner does not own Michael Eisner. Right.

311
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
The character Michael Eisner is still IP. The Disney Disney's ruthless.

312
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Don't sign a contract with them.

313
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So so the ride is where that's the Temple of the Forbidden Eye.

314
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
And Indiana Jones has found like parts of a map and he's located this this temple.

315
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And the ride, the story goes that Sala, which is Jonathan Rice Davies, India's run out of money for his expedition.

316
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And Sala, I did not know this until I started looking at Sala has been conducting tours of the temple to make money.

317
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So to keep funding Indies research.

318
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:09,000
The reason that any tourist is allowed in there is because we're paying to keep Indies adventure going on.

319
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And also maybe they'll find him. Like that's why I learned that about this, too.

320
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:25,000
The back door involves all of the main characters of Indiana Jones that are like in the movies a little or mentioned because like Abner Ravenwood is involved.

321
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Marcus Brody is also Marcus Brody per the Wikipedia entry.

322
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Marcus Brody has asked Sala to continue conducting the tours in the hope that they may locate Dr.

323
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Jones and keep funding. Right.

324
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:46,000
So I think in the narrative of the ride, there was a time when Indy was just going through the temple and everything was fine and he was running tours safely.

325
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And then something happened.

326
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And for whatever reason now, Sala wants a bunch of tourists to take one of these ride vehicles, go into the temple and see if they can find Dr.

327
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Jones, who's been lost for a week.

328
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
We're supposed to find Indiana Jones.

329
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Yes, that's what we're trying to do.

330
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So which they don't they could convey that by telling us.

331
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Right, because we've all been out in a million times and we did not know that.

332
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
If we don't know this fact, then how could anyone?

333
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So that's the story of the ride.

334
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And what was Indiana Jones, was he after something in the temple or he just found the temple and liked it, wanted to hang out in it?

335
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
He's looking for what is it called?

336
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
The Jewel of Power.

337
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Yeah, there you go.

338
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Quote, Abner Ravenwood believed to be within an immense cavern beyond the Gapes of Doom.

339
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Who's Abner Ravenwood?

340
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Ravenwood was Indiana Jones's often mentioned but never seen mentor.

341
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And he is the father of Marion, the character played by Karen Allen.

342
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
That's why they know each other through the dad.

343
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So he hooks up with the daughter of his mentor, which is real fucked up.

344
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Everyone's dream.

345
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Let's be honest.

346
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It's really messed up.

347
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
He shouldn't have done that.

348
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
It was the guy dead, though.

349
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
The guy was dead.

350
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It was fine.

351
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Well, they talked about putting him.

352
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
He was going to show up in the movies at some point and then it never happened.

353
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I think he's long dead by Crystal Skull.

354
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Well, sure.

355
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And Marcus Brody is also long dead by Crystal Skull because he has that, Indy has that picture of him that he picks up and looks at at one point.

356
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Or is that Sean Connery?

357
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
He looks up longingly at Sean Connery.

358
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
He looks at Sean Connery.

359
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Maybe that's what I'm thinking of.

360
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
As we all should each morning to get some mojo for the day.

361
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
There's a statue in Crystal Skull, I think, of Brody in the middle.

362
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
This is the second Steven Spielberg movie with a character named Brody in it.

363
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I'm just realizing.

364
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Yeah, Brody from Jaws.

365
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And then of course Brody in Mallrats.

366
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
In Mallrats.

367
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Hey, all right.

368
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Where's that ride?

369
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Snoochy Boochies.

370
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Smithland or View-Isc Universe.

371
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
View-Isc Uland.

372
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
A movie that ends at Universal Studios Florida.

373
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Mallrats ends with Jason Lee's character getting married on the ride.

374
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Right?

375
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Although I think it's filmed in Hollywood.

376
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Right.

377
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
They say it's in Florida.

378
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Yeah.

379
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Oh, View-Isc Universe.

380
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
That's maybe that's an episode.

381
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
You get to part of it's like the heavens open.

382
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:22,000
You get to go in the church where you get to obviously eat at movies.

383
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Oh, yeah.

384
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Yeah.

385
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
You get absolved of your sins.

386
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
That's what I'm trying to say.

387
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
So you get to like visit the convenience store and absolved of your sins by that smiling Jesus guy.

388
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Let's make sure to mark this down.

389
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Two episodes in we've gotten into a discussion about the View-Isc Universe.

390
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
So I feel like that's inevitable on any new podcast.

391
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Tally number one.

392
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Tally number one.

393
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Probably 20 or 30 times eventually.

394
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Yeah.

395
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
We'll keep building that View-Isc Universe, the place, which of course is in Jersey.

396
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Oh, man.

397
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Oh, it's got a Jersey represent.

398
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Hell, yeah.

399
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Keep it at Gnome land.

400
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yeah.

401
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So there is so as far as Indiana Jones ride, it is like an extensive back story with a lot of like a lot more moving parts than I even thought at the time because it was just I thought it was just like, oh, you're some tourists going through and oh, yeah, watch out for Indiana Jones.

402
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
There he is.

403
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And then but no, no, there's like a whole thing.

404
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So don't if you're listening to this, don't ever go on this ride again, just not knowing the full story.

405
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
You won't enjoy it.

406
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You won't ever be able to just purely if you don't know about Brody's involvement.

407
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Sure.

408
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And despite despite all of that back story, there is one glaring omission from this ride.

409
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Harrison Ford.

410
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Ah, good point.

411
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Yes, that is true.

412
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Do we know why do we know why no Harrison?

413
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I am not sure.

414
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
He was also not present for the grand opening.

415
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Hmm.

416
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Well, he was having a dispute with Disney.

417
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Right.

418
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Wasn't it over?

419
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
There was some sort of an advertising thing.

420
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It was I feel like it's a similar situation where Robin Williams was like, I don't want using my voice to advertise.

421
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And then something happened.

422
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:15,000
It makes sense that we get from poking around because this is if we ever meet a famous person or somebody who's been in a Disney ride, a question is like, hey, what's up with that?

423
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
They like treat you well.

424
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Is it a good situation?

425
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'm not sure it is.

426
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I don't know that you're like paid a fortune to do a voice or act in something that people that millions of people see every day.

427
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Yeah.

428
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I think Disney has a feeling of like you should be so lucky to be here.

429
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And then it's also like the no guild covers theme park performances.

430
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Sort of its own specific area.

431
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Allow me to say that if I ever got to participate in a ride or do a voice or something in anything, I would pay them upwards of 10 grand for this.

432
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Negative dollars is fine.

433
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
A lot of them.

434
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
We would all pay, I think, to just have like a speaking role in one of those pre-ride videos.

435
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Oh, sure.

436
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Look out.

437
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I'm not behind you.

438
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Anything.

439
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Just one word.

440
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
So that I could bring uninterested relatives constantly and pointed out to them and have them say it's not you.

441
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
This hasn't worked great before, folks, but I'm sure it's going to go fine this time.

442
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Yeah, that would be great.

443
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You just casted yourself way up.

444
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
That's a very meaty role.

445
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Yeah, that would be a starring role.

446
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
The most crucial piece of information in any ride.

447
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:37,000
No Indiana Jones, though you do get John Rhys Davies in the he does play Sala, although sometimes it's not his voice, but he does appear in it physically.

448
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So you do have a representative from the movie.

449
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
He's the only one, right?

450
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
There's no.

451
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Yeah.

452
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Yeah.

453
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
There's a voiceover in that.

454
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
This is a side note.

455
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
There's a voiceover in that newsreel by a woman named Tress McNeil.

456
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Oh, yeah.

457
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Who is a very famous voiceover actor.

458
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Voice of Babs Bunny and.

459
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Docs from Animaniacs.

460
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Lindsay Nagel on The Simpsons.

461
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Yeah.

462
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
All like business ladies on The Simpsons.

463
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
She does a lot.

464
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
She's great.

465
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
A regular Simpsons reference too.

466
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And she does a voice on this.

467
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Right.

468
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
A lot of Tress McNeil references in a few seasons of The Simpsons.

469
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And she does a voice on the ride.

470
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Yeah.

471
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:20,000
So, yeah, we only see one character as far as in those early videos on the queue.

472
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Maybe, you know, since I bring up John Rhys-Davies, it might be a good time to play a little pod

473
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
exclusive that I made.

474
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
We were referencing a special that was made promoting the opening of the ride.

475
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I think it was just called The Making of Indiana Jones Ride.

476
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
As Jason was saying, it has a very confusing story and timeline where the temple is real

477
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
and John and Karen are trying to find Indy.

478
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
So, Indy is real, but it's Karen Allen, the actress, looking for him.

479
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Playing Karen Allen.

480
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Like, John Rhys-Davies shows up in the special as himself, but they also play the old timey

481
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
newsreel clip where he is Sala.

482
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
But Karen Allen is only ever Karen Allen.

483
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
That said, she, like her character Marion, is very thirsty for treasure.

484
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Like, she keeps trying to leave and John Rhys-Davies.

485
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Like, at one point he says, like, did I tell you about the treasure?

486
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And she turns around and goes, like, treasure?

487
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And at another point she's like, I've had enough.

488
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I'm going to go.

489
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And he goes, like, but what about the gifts?

490
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And she goes, gifts?

491
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Like, and that's extremely my shit because I love treats.

492
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Like, I love presents.

493
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I love treats.

494
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Treasure.

495
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And Karen Allen, a beautiful woman.

496
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
That's your dream girl.

497
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yeah.

498
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Marion was a favorite character.

499
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
A pretty greedy lady.

500
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
That's very odd.

501
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:56,000
But yeah, they go on the ride and like there's a part where they're about to get on and then a ride vehicle returns and it's just full of skeletons.

502
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Yeah.

503
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And Karen asks John, are you like, is this supposed to happen?

504
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Like, does anybody ever come out of this thing alive?

505
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And he says, yes, one time.

506
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I think last Thursday somebody came out alive.

507
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
There's a lot of crazy implications of danger in these theme park specials.

508
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Yeah, that is crazy because like all the there a lot of these things it's like, well, you may not survive.

509
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And it's like, there have been a couple incidents in parks where somebody hasn't survived.

510
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Maybe we should joke about that.

511
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Although usually on extremely innocuous things.

512
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Yes, it's usually like a weird mundane.

513
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
The less dangerous the ride, the more likely you'll die on it.

514
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
But it's like a fun thing now.

515
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
It's like a fun secret.

516
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Anyway, they go on the they go on the ride and the danger is real apparently.

517
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And I just I found the way that John Rhys Davies screams to be really infectious.

518
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
So I made a pod exclusive super cut of John Rhys Davies.

519
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Excellent screaming.

520
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Oh, wow.

521
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Enjoy.

522
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Get this fuck out of here.

523
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
That at the end is not a scream.

524
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It's him say what sounded to me.

525
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I know it's not this, but it's it almost sounds like he's saying, oh, let's get the fuck out of here.

526
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It does sound like that.

527
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Yeah, it does.

528
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It's kind of fading away.

529
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
So it's ambiguous.

530
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I thought he said, ah, you get that's how you start the cars.

531
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I really liked those screams.

532
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I just like they're so like warbly and admittedly the screams of a larger gentleman.

533
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And it really reminded me of the Orson Welles outtakes like, wow, the French.

534
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Yeah.

535
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Yeah.

536
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Like like a cool fat guy. Excellent. Excellent screaming, John.

537
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You've set a precedent now.

538
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I think we have to have like a screaming super cut for a lot of different rides for people for reactions for pre shows and yeah.

539
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Which you pro. All right.

540
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So now we got to do that every time.

541
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Now we got a segment caked in.

542
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I did it to myself.

543
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Are they actually on the ride at that point?

544
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Like in that special, I because I watched it last night and it looks like they might be in a different vehicle.

545
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Like it looks to me or it just might be in the station and it's rocking.

546
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I think some of it is I think you're right.

547
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
They filmed it in a studio and they're just shaking a car around flashing lights on it.

548
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Some of it I think is on the real thing, but maybe with stunt doubles with the indemnity doubles.

549
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Also a lot more sparks like there's a lot more spark.

550
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Yeah, they should shoot some serious pyro on the gang and make it look a lot scarier than it is in real life.

551
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Let me say this, though.

552
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
This was a this ride did terrify me as a kid and the idea of it.

553
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I remember in probably if that line was three hours long, first time I went on it, I think an hour of it.

554
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I screamed.

555
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I was like such a baby to where my dad was like, Jesus, like cool it, which I confirm my wife did, too.

556
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I'm not the only one, but she was a young girl and I was a young boy.

557
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
So speaking of fear on this ride and Mike, you were also there for this.

558
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Mike and I were on this ride when it broke down once.

559
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Yes.

560
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And the dream of any theme park goer to have be on a ride that breaks down.

561
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
That's yes.

562
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
And here is my recollection of it.

563
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,000
We broke down, the ride vehicle came to a stop directly next to the giant snake animatronic.

564
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
And the snake kept moving.

565
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
The snake kept opening its mouth.

566
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
The movement of the snake is that it kind of rears back a little bit and then goes like rears.

567
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It goes towards you, towards the car.

568
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I don't remember you being that scared.

569
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Were you secretly scared while we were sitting there?

570
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Well, I'm not super fond of snakes.

571
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
So I was just kind of a little like.

572
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
So you were having a panic attack and I didn't even realize it.

573
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
That was a little scary, but what really scared me was I was like, oh, we're going to get walked off this.

574
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
And then a cast member walked up to the car, right?

575
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
We were hoping because, yeah, as Scott was saying, a dream of a Disney fan is for a car to break down

576
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
and then you get to walk through the attraction because then you get to see like details that you would never see

577
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
because the lights come on and it's pretty incredible.

578
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Or maybe get taken through some secret backstage park nobody else would get to see.

579
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Which happened to me on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad once and was very neat.

580
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:44,000
This time what scared me is when the cast member walked up, I went, oh, she's a lot farther down than I thought I was.

581
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Like, I never realized how far up you are on that ride.

582
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
All right. Well, that's a good point because the ride vehicle.

583
00:38:51,000 --> 00:39:00,000
This was a big thing at the time that the Jeep itself is elevated up and you're kind of on a Star Wars type simulator ride

584
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
with a lot of hydraulic arms.

585
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
So it's it is a car that's moving around, but it's a hydraulic or it is a simulator on top of the.

586
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
So do you remember what happened, like how we got off it?

587
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Yeah, well, they ran us just they with the lights on and the whole place lights on.

588
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:24,000
We just kind of slowly drove to the end of the thing with the work lights on and the ride still kind of like half jerking.

589
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And some of the sound effects playing. Right. It was weird.

590
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
It was unnerving. And then we got to the thing and they're like, all right, we got to figure it out.

591
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Do you guys want to go through again? And we're like, well, yeah, sure.

592
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And that time it went fine. But like it was a very weird experience.

593
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
You got to see the lazy version of the Jones ride.

594
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I am. I will say this. I I have no recollection of you having like a terror attack.

595
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I don't think I don't think it was that bad. I was just more like, oh, God, I didn't realize we were this high up

596
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
because like I was like, oh, it's a car. You were just playing it, playing it cool.

597
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
You were playing it cool. You brush it off. You're a real hero.

598
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
You didn't want to freak out the kids on the car. No. Even though you yourself were dying inside.

599
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Yeah, it was a car full of adults. Yeah.

600
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
No children. There are rarely any children on the rides when I go to Disney.

601
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Yeah. Can we not be with him, please? That alone man.

602
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
What else about this ride? Going a lot, I guess.

603
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Yeah. Well, going back to the queue, the queue is awesome.

604
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Like there's some there's like a rock area and then there's a part where

605
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
which I don't think there's a lot. Well, there's a couple of maybe other queues like this.

606
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
But there are things that say do not touch in the queue, but they mean touch.

607
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Like there's a room where there's a bamboo like pole keeping up the ceiling

608
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and there are spikes coming through the ceiling. And the idea is that if you touch this,

609
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
all of a sudden the spike ceiling is going to come and murder everyone in the room.

610
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Obviously, it doesn't it hasn't enough the capability to murder.

611
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
But if you touch that bamboo thing, you'll hear like rumbling and then you'll see that the spikes

612
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
will come down a little bit. Like these are like a bunch of cool interactive things

613
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
going on there. Do they all still work? I feel like they worked.

614
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
They worked Friday. I was on it Friday. Yeah. And the guy

615
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
touched it and we hadn't seen it work in a while because some of these effects go in and out of working

616
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
because there's so many of them. But it did work and I was like, oh, yeah, we haven't seen that in a while.

617
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
So, you know, periodically these things work. There's also the well. Yes. Like, yeah,

618
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
there's a guy. There's like a well with a bunch of ropes on it.

619
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And if you like grab the rope or something, you will hear a voice

620
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
going like, hey, I'm down here. You also hear him fall.

621
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Oh, OK. The idea is that you've, I guess, killed or really heard a guy

622
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
who is hanging onto a rope dropping into a well. So, you know,

623
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
that's another thing where it says do not touch. But then you quickly learn like you just grab the rope

624
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
and shake it. And then, yeah, you hear like, hey, what are you doing? Or you hear like, ah!

625
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
And then you get to cause a Chilean mine disaster

626
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
type of event. You get to really play God in that

627
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
scenario. I think probably narratively they have to be like, well, you know, he

628
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
wasn't that far from the ground or the water. But it just startled him.

629
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
That's why he screamed. He didn't break both arms

630
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
and his spine. But, yeah, let's be honest. You killed that guy.

631
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Yep. Kids kill that guy hundreds of times a day. That man

632
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
dies hundreds of times a day at the hands of tourists. Maybe it's given a

633
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
real child practice in murder, in which they're able to

634
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
actually inflict later in their lives. Yeah, that sensitizes us.

635
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
It's dark. It's a dark riot, folks. Yeah, incredible line.

636
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Probably one of the first rides where the line was really amazing

637
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
and engrossing before you even got there. The riot itself.

638
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
You know, I just wanted to point out, I don't have

639
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
any particular deep observation about this, but just when

640
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
you get on the right... Well, first of all, maybe a lot of people don't know that you are

641
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
given the choice of these three tunnels. Which one is riches, one's eternal

642
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
youth, and one's... See the future. See the future, yeah.

643
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
But that is in effect and it's always the same door and it's an illusion

644
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
that swings all of those doors around. So that's

645
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
cool. But I just like... In thinking about this ride, I was just

646
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
recalling how that moment where you're not supposed to look into

647
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
the eye of the god Mara, when you do, Mara gets angry,

648
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
which they just enhanced with these really cool projection effects in the last few years.

649
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And then when you whip around the corner into that room that reveals

650
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Indiana Jones at the door, like fending off all these evil spirits,

651
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
that whip around the corner, I would argue, is one of the most exciting

652
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
moments in any ride. And I think... I like it

653
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
because it shows that the car has personality. That was the thing

654
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
they pushed in a lot of the specials and everything around the time the ride came out.

655
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
The car will struggle and the car will recoil

656
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
as if you were scared of the snakes.

657
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
As opposed to Pirates of the Caribbean or Haunted Mansion or something where it's just an evenly moving

658
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
vehicle that isn't really doing anything or reacting. Like the fact

659
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
that the car has trouble with stuff and struggles, I think, is a really

660
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
neat innovation. And that's followed by, once you go

661
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
past Indy trying to keep the doors closed, you go

662
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
into a room with a giant

663
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
temple rockwork skull that's shooting

664
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
lasers at you. It is so exciting. And a fireball.

665
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
It's great. And the music cue is great. Yeah, that big

666
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
chorus hit that happens that reveals that.

667
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
You never get tired of it. It's cool every single time.

668
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
My girlfriend and I went on it Friday night and with this podcast, I always

669
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
would like to look for things that maybe we can make some fun of or light of.

670
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
And every time I go on the ride, I'm like, this is the fucking greatest ride. This is

671
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
so goddamn cool. Yeah, this one doesn't have the hokey-ness that you

672
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
can poke fun at so much. It is such a legitimate

673
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
incredible technical feat and probably the best thing Disney landed

674
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
done up until that point. There is a funny story because there was two years ago I went

675
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
to this event at Disney, which was the 20th anniversary of the ride, and Tony

676
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Baxter, who is the lead Imagineer on this ride, who we'll probably talk about a lot,

677
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
was saying that for legal reasons,

678
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Mara, because we were talking about the Mara, which is a big head statue or whatever

679
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
you would call it, and there's three different things they can promise you like

680
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
eternal life, earthly riches, or seeing the future. And legally, Disney,

681
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
you cannot promise people something on the ride, so they had to

682
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
put in the thing. Because what happens is they say, do not look into the eyes of the idol. And Mara

683
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
is huge, so it's almost impossible not to look at the eyes of this person. So legally,

684
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
they had to do that so it would

685
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
rescind the offer of earthly riches or eternal life or whatever

686
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
they were promising because one person, at least in the car, would look into Mara's eyes

687
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
and then legally, the offer would be off the table. Because Disney Legal would

688
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
be concerned that somebody would come back and be like, well, I went on the ride, and

689
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I was offered a lot of money, which of course is dumb as shit, who would

690
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
do that. But that's a true thing that Disney Legal was like, well,

691
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
this is going to be a problem. So they had to add in the thing of don't look into Mara's eyes,

692
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
and then everything goes to shit. That's why that construct exists. That's pretty crazy.

693
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Wow. So if you were on the eternal life

694
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
track and everyone agreed to not look,

695
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
then what? That's a good point. I mean, maybe there's a case

696
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
we could build here if we can get, what is it, there's 16,

697
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
how many people on the ride? 12 people on the ride? 12 people, yeah. 12 people can be on the ride. If we get 12 of us

698
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
together, we close our eyes, never look into Mara's eyes, and maybe document

699
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
it, maybe we have a case for a shitload of money

700
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
from Disney. Okay, so the three of us, and then

701
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
the first nine fans of this podcast, because, as

702
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
with most things, our significant others will not agree to participate in this.

703
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
So the first nine people to respond, let's all

704
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
get in the car, we'll get up to the front, 12 please, we'll all

705
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
look around like I'll sly because we know the plan. We're going to

706
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
bilk Disney out of eternal life. A class action lawsuit for eternal life.

707
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
And probably the result of that is like, one

708
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
front of the line pass. But even that's worth it, I think.

709
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
We gotta try to bilk them for something. We would like a lot of money, they'd be like, well we can have one front of the line pass, and we go, done.

710
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Done! The end of the negotiations.

711
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
It was a pleasure facing off against you, Disney attorney.

712
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
They wouldn't even give us that.

713
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
So, well, okay, you said that there is not a lot that is hokey

714
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
about the ride, and easy to poke fun about the ride.

715
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,000
What are two? Well, let's hear what you're thinking.

716
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Okay, so, the effects and stuff, by and large,

717
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
get bigger and bigger, crazier and crazier as this ride goes on.

718
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
But there are a couple spots where the vehicle needs

719
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
to turn around. And so the first one is a

720
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
dark room where the headlights are flickering, and you realize it's filled with

721
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
bugs on the walls. And that's pretty good. And then you go over the bridge, and that's

722
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
really cool. And they're shooting lasers at you. And then you go by the snakes,

723
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
and that's really cool. And then you go through a giant room of skulls, that's really cool.

724
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
And then you go to a black room, like a pitch black room,

725
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
that just has the projection of a branch with some rats running

726
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
across it. And that's where it loses steam for a beat there.

727
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
And I'm pretty sure it's just a spot where it's like, well the vehicle needs to turn and also

728
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
go downhill a little. So it can't just be a pure dark room. We gotta

729
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
do something in there. I agree that effects, thinly

730
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
projected rats dropping is a little... I didn't even know that's what it was until

731
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
like two years ago. I was just like, oh it's a spooky fog area.

732
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
It's ghost rats. And some people are very scared of rats

733
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
and mice and stuff. So maybe, I guess, kind of. I would not like

734
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
rats and mice. But there's not, this is a question I have,

735
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
is there an effect like in like Honey I Shrunk the Audience on the

736
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
ride where it's supposed to like brush your legs? Yes. There is. In Honey I Shrunk the

737
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Audience, yeah. But not that, but I'm talking in the Indiana Jones card. Oh in this, no not in Indiana Jones.

738
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Because that would make sense then if it was like you felt a brush against your leg on the ride.

739
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I had wondered if they had had that effect at one point and then dropped it, but I don't believe it.

740
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I hated that effect as a kid. I always hated that. Because there's rats. I scared the shit out of me.

741
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
And then it was a snake. Then it was a giant snake. I hated it. I remember like putting my legs up

742
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
for the only I shrunk the audience. I always do. Even if you know that

743
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
it's not real insects or rats, it's still just unpleasant to get like

744
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
wildly tased in the butt by a little buzzer in your

745
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
seat. It's horrible. I think they do that at Shrek. There's like stuff like, there's a, like it pokes you in the back

746
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
or something. I can see it legitimately like

747
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
damaging a nerve. I can't believe it hasn't happened. And Bugs Life. The Bugs Life movie.

748
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Oh yeah, you get poked in the back too. You get poked by like stingers in the front of the chair.

749
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Yeah, that's weird. These are not my favorite things at any of the parks.

750
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Nor do I like that rats dropping. Say there aren't

751
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
rat droppings in it. But there are fake rats dropping on you. They should do a whole thing where

752
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
well maybe this is, we'll save that for later. What were you going to say, Scott? What were you going to say that?

753
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Oh, in terms of hokeyness, this is off of the ride. But it's

754
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
about the promotion of the ride.

755
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Do you guys recall or did you remember in your research

756
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
that to promote this ride, Disney staged an Indiana Jones Super Bowl

757
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
halftime show? I believe we have watched it.

758
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I believe we have watched it. Have the three of us watched it together? Maybe.

759
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. Several times. We might be repeating

760
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
life material here. That's fine. But I'd sort of forgotten about that until the other

761
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
night. I mean they threw so much at the wall promoting this thing. There were so many odd

762
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
specials and giant promotional budget. But that they did the Super Bowl

763
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
halftime show is, that's something for a theme park attraction.

764
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
And it's rough. It's not just rough. It's rough for

765
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
dinner theater. And this is the Super Bowl halftime show. This is before

766
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
the giant spectacle Super Bowl halftime show. This would have been like

767
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
1994 or so? Yeah. Or 95 potentially.

768
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
And it was post the Michael Jackson halftime show

769
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
which kind of defined the modern halftime show. Where now it's just a, it's a really good concert

770
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
that you get in the middle. Yeah. This is not that. No, no, no. It is not.

771
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
The halftime show is all kind of used to be more of a mess. Where there's a

772
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
zillion ideas all fighting each other. And here's this weird dance

773
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
part and then a singer you recognize but just for three minutes and then it turns into something

774
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
else. Disney had done a previous halftime show that's, it's a small

775
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
world themed but then the new kids on the block are in it for a second. Which I

776
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
would think, just give it, they're popular at the time. Just give them the whole time.

777
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
But there was all this like up with people bullshit. The Super Bowl

778
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
halftime shows were awful. I mean they're bad now sometimes but

779
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
it's a lot cleaner than it used to be. I just remember that Simpsons joke

780
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
where it was like, there was like a spaceship landing

781
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
on the aliens. The aliens coming out and like that's my idea of what the

782
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
halftime show used to be. It was like some. They kind of were, oh there was another Simpsons joke where

783
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
some up with people kind of. Was it Hooray for Everything? Yeah.

784
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
That was a different episode? And they sing Walk on the Wild Side by Lou Reed

785
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
but they don't realize it's an ironic. They just sing it as a face value cheery song.

786
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
So halftime shows were really bad. Disney had done a lot of them.

787
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
They did one for the Indiana Jones ride. It's really insane.

788
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Indiana Jones and Marion, a non-Karen Allen, Karen Allen

789
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
skydive into the stadium. Which is legitimately impressive because

790
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
they had to, like a skydive takes I don't know how long, I mean a number of minutes.

791
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
So they had to like time it out. Like when the quarter ended it was like go!

792
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
And then they jumped and they did land in the correct spot

793
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
which is pretty impressive. And then it switches out for the stunt performers.

794
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
They got stunt performers who were from the Indiana Jones

795
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
stunt show at Disney World in Florida which we haven't talked about

796
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
yet. But it was like, what I like about this is

797
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
that sometimes the Super Bowl halftime show is Michael Jackson

798
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
the most famous man in the world. And then in this case it's some guy.

799
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It's a stunt man. And he is the lead of

800
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
the show. And the idol they're trying to get is the

801
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
football, right? It is the Lombardi Trophy. Oh it's the trophy.

802
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
And for some reason it's not a lightweight version.

803
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
They're throwing around a real Super Bowl trophy. Oh my god.

804
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I don't know if there's only one in the world. I don't know if it's like the Stanley Cup. But it's definitely

805
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,000
a heavy Lombardi Trophy. There's a really great article about this on Bleacher

806
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Report you can look up. Which I think has the headline worst halftime show ever

807
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
question mark. Although spoiler, they determined it is not. If you haven't watched the Black

808
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Eyed Peas I would say it might be that one. Oh yeah that was pretty great.

809
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
But yeah they say that it is a real Lombardi Trophy. There were a lot of problems.

810
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
The stage was serrated and there were a lot of little holes in it.

811
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And the holes were exactly the size of Patti LaBelle's

812
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
high heels. So they had to change the whole stage because

813
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Patti LaBelle almost tripped and fell. Patti LaBelle is in it.

814
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Tony Bennett is in it. It's a very odd line up for 1995.

815
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
What is Tony Bennett singing it? I don't know what his first song is but at the end they all

816
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,000
sing Can You Feel the Love Tonight from the Lion King.

817
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Disney did another big mess of a halftime show a couple years later with Phil Collins

818
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
doing Tarzan songs and Gloria Estefan. This one features

819
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Miami Sound Machine without Gloria Estefan.

820
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
It's just the strangest line up ever. There's a really insane part

821
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
where Marion takes a torch and lights a guy on fire.

822
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
And it's not like a fire effect goes off under the guy and then he's on fire.

823
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Marion takes the torch, touches it to the guy's robe and he

824
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
lights on fire. Which when you're asking is this a bad halftime show

825
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I don't know. A guy got lit on fire like live between the

826
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
halves of a Super Bowl. That's pretty cool. Like what happens in it is cool

827
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
but when you put it all together it's just a big weird mess.

828
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. A lot of ideas that don't really mix and why Tony Bennett

829
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
and really hokey acting and they just couldn't help that a lot of punches

830
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
miss. There's like the Batman style just many feet away

831
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
from the punch connecting. But it's interesting to watch.

832
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I recommend looking it up. But here's the weird dark thing is that

833
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
they did pull it off and everybody felt really good afterwards and like maybe

834
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
stunt shows are what a lot of the halftime shows will be. Two years later they did one for the Blues

835
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Brothers and while rehearsing it a stunt person

836
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
died. So stunts were dead forever at the Super Bowl halftime

837
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
show or else you might still see them to this day. Wow.

838
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
But yeah, this opened up the path too. But they, you know, at least they could say

839
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
that it was in the surface of a Blues Brothers. They died

840
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
in service of a Jim Belushi concert. Why were the Blues Brothers in the

841
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
mid 90s? Blues Brothers 2000 were coming out. Well, but not even

842
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
years later. It was two years after the fact and this was a rare

843
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Blues Brothers lineup where it's three of them. It's not the

844
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
kid or the other guy. It's Akroyd, Jim Belushi

845
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
and John Goodman. It's the rare trifecta of Blues Brothers.

846
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
James Brown is in it. ZZ Top. That one is a big mess.

847
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
That one I would say, oh and it opens with a promotion for the

848
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
then new Fox News channel, which makes it extra

849
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
horrific. So I would rank that one below the Super, the

850
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Indiana Jones one, which is at least fun. You know, in the original Blues Brothers

851
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
there is a, it's not John Goodman, but there is a third Blues Brother in

852
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
the movie and you don't really see it. It's called Cocaine. Like

853
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Cocaine is the third Blues Brother that is in every scene

854
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
and driving all the action of a very odd movie

855
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
to watch many years later. Like I didn't see that until I was

856
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
in my mid-20s. It's kind of aggressive. It's almost a little like snuffy. It's very strange.

857
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Because all the accidents are like real and scary and it led to

858
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
later the Twilight Zone accident

859
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
of like striving for realism in the film

860
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
stunts. Because there's just real broken glass and violence in that thing.

861
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
We're going to have all these links in the metadata and on all the

862
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
social media. So if you want to watch all of these nightmare half-time

863
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
shows. If you want to buy the book about the Twilight Zone film disaster

864
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
the Amazon link will be provided.

865
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Talking about like all the promotion, this ride was promoted

866
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
a lot because it was very expensive. And

867
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
it was also part of the 40th anniversary of Disneyland, which is a big deal.

868
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
And I grew up on the East Coast. I grew up outside of Philadelphia.

869
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
And Mike you grew up in the Midwest outside of Chicago.

870
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
And I remember seeing the promotions

871
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
for this ride a lot. Like they weren't promoting it of like come to Disneyland

872
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
and see this. But it was, I remember that making of, I remember it being in

873
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,000
the holiday parades, which were very big in my house. Like we would

874
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
plan Christmas morning. It was like we'll get up, we'll unwrap presents, we'll watch the Disney Christmas

875
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
parade. If we sleep in we have the VCR set to record

876
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
it in case we miss it. And I remember it being a big part of those.

877
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
And Mike and I have talked about this before. We

878
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
just like as kids were like, man that looks really cool. Shame I'll never see it.

879
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I'll never complete this impossible task

880
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
of traveling to California. There was a book we had.

881
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
This really shows how we were raised and what our view of

882
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,000
like how many world travelers we would not become.

883
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Is that like, we had like a, I think it was cause we had stock. We have Disney stock

884
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
at the family. And yeah so in like 1994 I'm looking through like the, what's coming up

885
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
to the resorts. And there was a picture on the drawbridge I think there was a picture of.

886
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,000
You're talking about in the annual report. I got the annual reports too.

887
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,000
We have a couple of them still. He's such fucking nerd. These were big family things

888
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
for a while. That people would buy single shares of Disney stock or people would buy the like

889
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
commemorative annual report. And it was like keep saints

890
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
that people would have. And there was no internet at the time so it was a way to like look at real nice

891
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
photos of rides. Exactly. It was Indiana Jones. There I justified it.

892
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
It was Indiana Jones in Toontown. And I used to

893
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
look at those pictures and think wow that's so cool. I'll never go

894
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,000
there. There's no way I'll ever cause we go to Florida.

895
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
That's where we go. We go on a family vacation every three years to Florida. I'll never

896
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
leave Illinois otherwise. I'll never see New York. I'll never go out of the country.

897
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
I was raised to be very frightened of the world in California.

898
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
To not dream big. Something that ironically every

899
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Disney parade and show encourages you to do. Dream your dreams.

900
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,000
The message was lost on me. Leave that for the other kids.

901
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Yeah. You've told me stories of like you were 18

902
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
and going to like Largo and seeing John Bryan. And like I was

903
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
17 and 18. We didn't know a successful person. We didn't

904
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,000
know a person that lived anywhere. I was just literally like I don't

905
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
know what. I guess some people go out to California but you have to be

906
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
pretty special to do that I guess. You'll never see a man play a

907
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
guitar. Right. I was like you gotta be a Hollywood millionaire

908
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
to make that happen. I'm just here in Schaumburg. Yeah. I was like wow

909
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
big city folk. They got a lot of good stuff going on. I guess you know

910
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,000
what. There's a Portillo's hot dog. I'm gonna go hey maybe I'll get a large

911
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
cake shake tonight. Maybe one day I'll be I'll work at

912
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,000
the Portillo's and I'll put me in a commercial and then I'll be a big star

913
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,000
right here where it counts in Schaumburg. I'll get a five percent discount

914
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
on Italian beef at all my favorite restaurants. Don't tell me I

915
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
don't got dreams. I got big dreams. Hot dog dreams. It's like verbatim

916
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
what I was like. When I first came to California

917
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
I it was my first time flying alone. I would have been like 20

918
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
and it was my first time flying alone. It's my first time being on a flight longer

919
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,000
than two hours. I had been on one flight. Really? And since

920
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I like from age you know zero to twenty two

921
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
one flight. Wow. Did you drive to Florida? Yes. Oh fuck.

922
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Three times. Oh no no. How far is that? How far are we talking?

923
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Oh it's. I mean it would take a day two days. It would take two days.

924
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
It's not uncommon from the Midwest or the Northeast that people just drive down there.

925
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I've questioned my parents. I'd be like how much more money was it?

926
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Yeah. What were we. I know we were like middle class but my god

927
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,000
we couldn't pay the extra twenty five dollars a person and fly.

928
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
But I. We would have saved a day. I should also say like once I got out here

929
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
for this like school college program.

930
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
The first or second full day I was out here. I went to Disney. I was like

931
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
going to Disneyland. Like I could care less

932
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
about like seeing Los Angeles one of the greatest cities in the world.

933
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I mean I went. I think the first day I was here I went and saw like

934
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Hollywood Boulevard and Grailmans and I'm like oh this is upsetting. The other main

935
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,000
thing you need to see. Yeah. And so I knocked that out in two days and like

936
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Disneyland blew me away too because. Well and in

937
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Disney's California Adventure you can see all the best things Los Angeles and

938
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,000
California have to offer. All in just a couple acres.

939
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Yeah you covered it. Big dreamers here on the show.

940
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
All right. Yeah. Let's get out of the sad sack with Jason and I. Get back on the ride.

941
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Should we talk about the Japanese version

942
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
of this ride. Oh yes. The one in Tokyo Disney is a little different from the ride.

943
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
It is called the Indiana Jones Adventure Temple of the Crystal

944
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Skull. Was made a few years before the

945
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
movie Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. And has

946
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,000
some very strange little differences. For

947
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,000
one Sala is not in the ride. The ride spiel is

948
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
done. The ride doesn't take place in India. It takes place

949
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,000
in Mexico. And I believe you're looking for the fountain of youth.

950
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
And Sala does not do the spiel does not do the safety thing.

951
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
It is a new character who is simply named Paco. But it is

952
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
portrayed by a Japanese actor who is speaking in Japanese.

953
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Sure. So he is some blend that is neither

954
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
here nor there. Yeah. Also there is no Mara. It is

955
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
literally a giant glowing crystal skull. And then

956
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
throughout the ride there's just little differences. When you go into the big room with

957
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,000
the giant skull and the bridge you go over there is like a little

958
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
tornado going. There's a little steam tornado. Oh yeah.

959
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Kind of this like otherworldly glow sort of thing. Yeah. Looks cool. Yeah. And then

960
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,000
after you they also have the dark room with the projection of

961
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,000
rats on a branch. But then they have a giant skull who blows

962
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
fire at you. Yeah. And their room where they shoot darts at you

963
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,000
is much cooler. Yes. Like a lot

964
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,000
less black paint and a lot more practical like effects. We should also

965
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,000
say that we have not been on this ride. We've just watched YouTube. We have

966
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
also never been on a flight outside of the country. So we've all we've watched

967
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,000
a lot of things to sort out. But we all watch this on YouTube so this is where we're getting this information.

968
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,000
We watch the video of the ride. Right. I mean that's an interesting point is

969
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,000
that you're right that if there's anything to be desired in the

970
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
current ride maybe that arrow room is

971
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,000
an area. I mean if you guys want to talk about our

972
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
system the plus it up. Let's do that

973
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
and then we'll talk about a few other indie things at different parks. Sure. So yeah we

974
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
have where they yeah we have a system where we say you know what

975
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
we would do with the ride if we were in charge and one choice is

976
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,000
keep it as is. Two would be to plus it up do something to it

977
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
and three would be to have it burned down in a mysterious fire

978
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,000
for insurance purposes. Yeah. So we'll go

979
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,000
around the room. We'll each say what we would do to the Indiana Jones Adventure. Temple of the

980
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Forbidden Eye. Let's start with Jason. Sure.

981
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,000
OK. I mean I think I would definitely keep it like this is

982
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,000
hands down as close as you can get to objectively

983
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
one of the best rides there is.

984
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
And I never gave too much thought to like the last little bits

985
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,000
of the ride. I mean obviously the very end of the ride where the giant boulder comes

986
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,000
out and Indies hanging from a rope and then you come around the corner and

987
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,000
you see he's OK. Which interesting fact the ride vehicle

988
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,000
is not moving backwards. The ride vehicle can only move forwards like the

989
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
walls are moving backwards as the ball

990
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
is rolling towards you. I didn't know that. That's cool.

991
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
That part still scares me. Still scares me. To this day that boulder

992
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
flying I still go well this is the time it's going to happen and I'm going to get crushed. Yeah. Sorry.

993
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Assuming it's heavy it could be an illusion. It's probably an illusion. It's probably

994
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,000
ride magic. So I never really gave much thought to

995
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,000
plusing it up. But then watching the ride through of the

996
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Tokyo Disney One it did make me think about like yeah there is that one

997
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,000
dead spot where it's a black room with a projection of a branch full of rats.

998
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
And then the dart room which I think is really cool like the sound effects

999
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,000
and the air shooting at you like the darts. But like the

1000
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Tokyo Disney One which is in Disney Sea in

1001
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Tokyo just looks so much cooler. Like it's like there's a bunch of

1002
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,000
little rock work. It's got this just Incan overlay

1003
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,000
and this cool like crystal blue lighting effects.

1004
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
That's pretty neat. Yeah. So that's my that would be my only thing. It's like

1005
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
little touches like that. And in all fairness they have like just recently

1006
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,000
even though they didn't have to they added some rear projection

1007
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
effects in the early rooms of the ride.

1008
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Not rear projection. Whatever that projection map.

1009
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Yeah. Put a lot of nice sparkles on Mara's face in that room. It looks cool.

1010
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Yeah. So but yeah I think you keep it and

1011
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,000
you really don't have to do much to it. I think it's great. Sure.

1012
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I as I was saying I think we have talked

1013
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,000
about and you might have some points about this about that that arrow room is kind of the

1014
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Yes. That's the that's the spot where because it's towards the end of the ride too after you've seen so much

1015
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:55,000
spectacular crap. And then there's a room where it's just flat and they're like

1016
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
skeletons are painted on the wall as opposed to like real skeletons. It looks like

1017
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,000
the club in Batman Forever or Robin

1018
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,000
or whichever wherever Coolio is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Where Coolio is in Batman

1019
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Forever. I think most people remember that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know the Dayglow Club

1020
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
which maybe is what it's called. Yeah.

1021
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,000
My idea there I don't know if you have an idea regarding that

1022
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
room as well but I you know I think

1023
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
one thing that Disney's had a lot of success with in terms of plussing up

1024
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,000
is adding more recent characters who people know

1025
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
you know kids understand kids look at

1026
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Johnny Depp and C Jack Sparrow and pirates and hey it's for my

1027
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:43,000
generation now. And I think if there's any let down in there I can only assume for

1028
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,000
people younger than I it's that they are missing their favorite beloved

1029
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,000
character Mutt Williams portrayed by Shia LaBeouf.

1030
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I'm sure by that point it get there's a little bit of a lull that Arrow Room is

1031
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,000
only so exciting and people are probably thinking where is Mutt. So

1032
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
my solution here is that those are no longer

1033
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,000
arrows. Those are Mutt's famous switch blades.

1034
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Oh man. And he's whipping them past your head.

1035
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I don't know if it now I don't know. I'm on board for Mutt baby. Mike gave me a Mutt Williams action

1036
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,000
figure for my birthday. Oh man. Oh you're a Mutt head. Oh boy.

1037
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Sign me up. Real Mutt hands. I was on board for that Mutt Williams

1038
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,000
solo movie. A greaser who's good at sword fighting?

1039
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Wild. And good at like sliding around through

1040
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
low corridors. So just so I'm clear I'm clear what

1041
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,000
you're pitching me here. Towards the end is will there be Mutt animatronics?

1042
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Because like as it is now there's like multiple you know skeleton or

1043
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,000
whatever people that are shooting you know darts at you. Will Mutt be

1044
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,000
just painted on the wall or will there be like a Mutt two Mutt robot like one Mutt robot

1045
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
running up and down throwing switch blades at the off. That's a good question. I mean

1046
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,000
I just figure that effect could be easily amended to be a famous Mutt

1047
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,000
switch blade whipping by your face. But then what does that require that there are

1048
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,000
a lot of Mutt's. I imagine he has the ability to like ping it

1049
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,000
back and forth on the wall. Oh okay. And make it go back

1050
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,000
and forth. So maybe you still have those voodoo priest kind of guys.

1051
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,000
And maybe it's a little like he interrupts the ride that we think we know. Like you're heading

1052
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,000
into the arrow room and then Mutt's like okay not so fast huh.

1053
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
And then he whips that knife back and forth and

1054
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
they all get punctured right in the middle of the skull. He just wants to show you

1055
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
a cool trick or he saves you or he just wants to show you a cool new knife trick. I think

1056
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:39,000
he's saving you or maybe there's another little additional

1057
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
sound effect and he is slicing the arrows in half

1058
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,000
right as you're driving through. So right in front of your face right as the arrows

1059
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,000
whiz by you. Also the switch blade is perfectly going back and forth

1060
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,000
cutting them in half deflecting them and saving you. Huh. I mean

1061
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,000
this is cool. I mean this is going to be an advanced animatronic technique because I would like to see

1062
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,000
like if you could digitally show me that the knives cutting it in half

1063
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,000
I think we'd be in business. Well maybe it's a I mean like the arrows

1064
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I think it would have to be an imaginary a sensory an auditory experience.

1065
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,000
But right before you went in there I think Mutt would be

1066
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
casually leaning up in the side of the road or like if you just be in the corner

1067
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:23,000
you think it's just dark and there's nothing over there and then he leans out like

1068
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
hey not so fast voodoo guys. Do you encounter Mutt's

1069
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
skull a trick up his sleeve. Is he Barbarino from Welcome Back Hotter?

1070
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
He is a he

1071
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,000
in my shared universe theorizing he is the

1072
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,000
father or grandfather of Barbarino.

1073
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Hey Wubba Balu Bop. Yeah he had that sweat he had the swag that

1074
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:51,000
would eventually birth the sweat hogs. So the sweat hogs are ultimately a

1075
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,000
tribute to Mutt. And then maybe you also

1076
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,000
add him into the next room where Indiana Jones is hanging off the dangling off

1077
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
in front of the boulder. Maybe he doesn't know what he's going to do and then old Mutt's like

1078
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
hey I got you back me and my monkey pals and then he goes swinging by

1079
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I guess the monkeys these would also be the most

1080
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
sophisticated animatronics in the world but I think it'd be worth it to have a bunch

1081
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
of monkeys all together grab Indiana Jones take him to safety

1082
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,000
and then you just crash into the boulder

1083
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,000
and he isn't there to deflect it. So you die but Indy is safe.

1084
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,000
That's my new ending. Okay I like the idea that in one of the

1085
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,000
most urgent rides of all time both times you see Mutt he's just kind of leaning

1086
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,000
he's like hey what up what are you doing? Up your nose with a rubber hose.

1087
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Sit on it. Which I guess is Potsies from Happy Days.

1088
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Ain't no big thing I got this I'm not like a control freak like my dad.

1089
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
So okay we're going to plus it up with Mutt

1090
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,000
you want to plus it up with Mutt. Plus it up Mutt it up. This universally

1091
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,000
reviled character. Is he? I don't know

1092
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I think the youngster maybe it's like us old fogies

1093
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,000
don't get the minions but I think maybe the kids are all big Mutt hounds just like

1094
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,000
you. Mutt madness? I mean Jason calls himself a Mutt man.

1095
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Yeah. Just a dirty dog like Mutt.

1096
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,000
If I could just get some of that Mutt strut. Oh man.

1097
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I could face the day. Mike?

1098
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I mean I don't have a suggestion as good as that but I do

1099
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,000
as we said before a pretty almost perfect ride I would

1100
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I would put Indy on the ride a few more times honestly. Sure.

1101
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Cause you see Indy at the start he's holding the door trying to hold it closed and that's about it

1102
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,000
and then you really only see him on the rope at the end and I feel like at least

1103
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,000
we see Captain Jack like three times at the very least right? Three or four?

1104
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,000
One might almost call it excessive. Oh well you sure?

1105
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Someone special guest recently had an extra appearance

1106
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,000
by a not animatronic Captain Jack. Right. Oh yeah.

1107
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,000
The real man. The real abusive man.

1108
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I'm saying too many dark things in this episode.

1109
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,000
So I feel like there's opportunities to see Indy like

1110
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,000
one instance like maybe like the hood of the car opens

1111
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,000
and he's in there somehow like his head pokes out and he's like ah I got stuck in the car

1112
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I got stuck in the engine or there's a part where you're on that bridge

1113
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,000
and he's in the big stone face and he's like

1114
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I'm in the mouth or something like I'm trapped in this mouth.

1115
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Maybe isn't you know I don't think I could write the next

1116
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,000
film or be part of the creative of this franchise but isn't he he might he'd probably

1117
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
be like oh this is good or right like oh I'm

1118
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,000
in the mouth again. I'm glad about this. I'm in Mara's mouth.

1119
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Giant mouths. Why did it have to be giant

1120
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,000
mouths? So like I think you know. He's a wry sarcastic

1121
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,000
man. That's true or yeah like he could be I mean you could put

1122
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,000
him anywhere. You could put him in the skeleton room. I'm getting

1123
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,000
so old I belong in a museum. Yeah quips like

1124
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:11,000
that. I guess that I'll be joining you soon brothers

1125
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:15,000
he says to the skulls. Oh Indiana Jones

1126
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,000
like okay with his mortality. Kathleen Kennedy

1127
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
and the people of Lucasfilm call us. Call us. He's just

1128
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,000
resigned to it. Oh boy. Oh brother.

1129
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000
That means an old crank right. Just like the real Harrison.

1130
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Then that brings me to my next point. Let's get that real Harrison

1131
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,000
voice on the ride. Yeah. There's a TMZ

1132
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
picture from a few years ago of him riding this ride with Calista and the kids.

1133
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:47,000
He knows it exists. He's been there. He's gonna do another

1134
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Indiana Jones. While he's there get the sound guy to mic

1135
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,000
him and get him to do 10 lines and let's record it so we can have the real

1136
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Harrison there. Especially because you know he's gonna have to do all this extra crap

1137
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,000
on that set anyway like I'm Harrison Ford and you're watching a Yahoo

1138
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,000
exclusive sneak peek of my new movie. Yes. So like if you're gonna

1139
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,000
force feed all these horrible promos into his mouth do

1140
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,000
something that the fans would really appreciate. Tell me that wasn't

1141
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,000
big fun. Which like you're gonna have to get him to give like that energetic

1142
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,000
performance that like. Part time. Part time. Hey. Oh if we could add part. Hey

1143
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Snatchatters. Check out my old Indiana Jones.

1144
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,000
That. Okay you said that line. Indy at the

1145
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,000
end. On Wikipedia it says like there's like eight things he can say

1146
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:39,000
to you. Eight quips he can say. And the most two most upsetting

1147
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,000
ones to me are don't tell me that wasn't big fun. Like it's not

1148
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,000
a phrase. Yeah it's not a good phrase. And the other one was

1149
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,000
you were good in there. You were very very good. And I don't

1150
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,000
know why but I find that upsetting. That was the one clip

1151
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,000
of the real Harrison Ford. You were good in there. You were very very good.

1152
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,000
It might be maybe because it reminds me of it. Did you guys ever

1153
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,000
see The Good Dinosaur? No. The Pixar movie. Yeah the Pixar movie.

1154
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,000
It's pretty rough but

1155
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,000
the tagline that is constantly repeated

1156
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
throughout it I believe is

1157
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,000
like the father dinosaur who eats shit and

1158
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,000
dies pretty quickly says to the main character child dinosaur

1159
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,000
like what is he oh god I can't remember it perfect

1160
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,000
now but it's like you're me and more.

1161
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Or it's like you're me and so much more. It's something

1162
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,000
where they like try to really make it like hit and it

1163
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,000
did not and they say it so many times through the movie. It's the only movie

1164
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,000
I've ever gone like should I leave? Like

1165
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
I don't think I need to see the rest of this.

1166
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
That reminds me of when the old dog in Homeward Bound

1167
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
when he returns to his family the Hume Cronin voiceover

1168
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,000
is like I'm home.

1169
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
You're my boy. I'm back. You're my special boy.

1170
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,000
It's a like real creepy old line. I have a real problem

1171
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,000
with people saying boy that weirds me out.

1172
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Old grandfather love I think

1173
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
I find to be a little creepy in this film. I just looked it up. The line is

1174
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
you're me and more. So let's add this to

1175
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Harrison's reference. You're me and more.

1176
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:39,000
He says by the broken boulder. I feel like you should get like 30 lines

1177
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:43,000
for him to say at the end there too. Like really change it up. Make him holiday specific.

1178
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Like oh good thing we got out of there and Merry Christmas.

1179
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Good way to spend an Easter.

1180
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Happy Halloween. Like and really like make it specific.

1181
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Yeah I give thanks for that. Check out the

01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,000
100%. Hey we'll be right back.

1188
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Alright we're back. And brace yourself because

1189
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,000
right now we're gonna go to a dark secret

1190
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
corner of the theme park world that most

1191
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:39,000
people are not brave enough to venture into. It's an area people

1192
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,000
don't talk about very often and it's called Confessionland.

1193
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Now in Confessionland a bunch of guys

1194
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,000
tell unpopular opinions to each other. And then

1195
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,000
we judge each other based on those opinions. We're going to confess

1196
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,000
things that we as Mega Theme Park fans

1197
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,000
have probably just shut up about. And we say

1198
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,000
oh yeah we like this or we don't like that. But we actually have opinions that might

1199
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,000
really rock the boat of theme park fandom. And this tone of

1200
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,000
voice that we're using is making it seem a lot sleazier than it's

1201
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
actually going to be. Get ready it's gonna be real dramatic.

1202
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Because it's probably gonna be not terribly eventful.

1203
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,000
But I think we should keep in mind though this is something I would not say if I

1204
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,000
met a bunch of like Disney fans in the park I would not lead

1205
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,000
with this piece of this opinion. You're not gonna make friends

1206
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
with these opinions. Because people in the park would be probably mad I think. So let's

1207
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
go around the room and give our unpopular

1208
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
opinion. Here in Confession.

1209
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,000
We were just talking about which one would be called and that's both of them.

1210
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Alright look.

1211
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,000
All things going off the rails. Okay I'll come into it.

1212
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:03,000
My confession is I don't like the shows.

1213
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:07,000
There it is. I don't. A big part of

1214
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,000
theme parks is parades and shows

1215
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,000
and fireworks. And I don't like any of it.

1216
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,000
I think it's very rare that I enjoy any of the

1217
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,000
like to me they are kind of a waste of time.

1218
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,000
They only get in the way of the rides. I like that they exist because

1219
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
they eat up people and prevent them from going on the rides and make the lines

1220
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,000
shorter. But you know what I mean like all these Disney attractions.

1221
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,000
So you're saying shows meaning you don't like the fireworks at the end of the night. You don't like most parades.

1222
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,000
You don't like the Aladdin Stays show. You don't like Fantasmic. You don't like any of that.

1223
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I would I'd give it to Fantasmic. I'm fond of Fantasmic and I'm sure

1224
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,000
we're gonna talk about it at some point. The show along the rivers of America

1225
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:55,000
at the end of the day at Disneyland. But that one I'd bump up because

1226
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:59,000
it's so spectacular. But like yeah I don't know a lot of them I find

1227
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,000
to be sort of over underwhelming. You know it's

1228
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,000
it's like the to me they like trade these things

1229
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,000
out every year and they're all like just

1230
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,000
different shades of the same thing. Like you know

1231
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:19,000
the one year they'll put in a new thing and it's called like Wishes. A magical

1232
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:23,000
celebration of dreams. And then they and then that's done. Wishes is closed.

1233
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,000
We're opening dreams. Celebrate your magic

1234
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,000
wishes. Like they're all so generic. Right now. Not really get to

1235
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,000
anything. And it's all just you know it's the same songs over and over.

1236
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,000
It's always gonna be a whole new world. It's always gonna be

1237
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,000
now let it go. They've jammed

1238
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Let It Go in every corner of that park. I don't discount that children

1239
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,000
enjoy these things. Families like going to them. But I sort of don't like World of Color.

1240
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I don't know. I don't I don't ever watch any of these things. Cause they have

1241
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
I watched the fireworks on Friday. I believe it's called Remember Dreams Come True.

1242
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,000
It's the name of the show. And the

1243
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,000
sixtieth anniversary had this fireworks show that was very like you know you played the songs

1244
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,000
from the party world or whatever and all that. And I like those songs

1245
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,000
or whatever. And I was a bit underwhelmed. But the show they have now Remember Dreams Come True

1246
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:19,000
has all of the theme park songs in it. So you've got Haunted

1247
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Mansion. You've got Tiki Room. And to dismiss

1248
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,000
fireworks shows wholesale. I mean this show was

1249
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,000
great. I had not seen it before. The fireworks go all the way around. I'm getting upset

1250
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,000
now that I'm thinking about it. Okay. Well there we go. It's a great

1251
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
show. Exactly the right kind of opinion for

1252
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Confession Lad.

1253
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Yeah I don't know. Look it's personal taste. I

1254
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,000
admit that fireworks are very impressive.

1255
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,000
I am not discounting the work of all the firework-ticians

1256
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
out there. They do a great job. I don't know what it is. I find

1257
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:03,000
standing and waiting for fireworks to be very unpleasant. Even something

1258
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,000
like Phantasmic I don't like that you're jamming into some

1259
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,000
you know little brick space and pretending it's a seat.

1260
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Or maybe you don't have a seat at all. A lot of this stuff is outside. And the

1261
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,000
time of year can make it exponentially worse.

1262
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Especially oh god on the other coast in Orlando

1263
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,000
like watching fireworks or watching the

1264
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,000
like the Phantasmic in Orlando is at Hollywood Studios. It's in a giant

1265
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,000
open amphitheater. It's insane. And it's

1266
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:39,000
hot. It's 10 o'clock at night and it's

1267
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:43,000
still 80 degrees and humid. Super humid. And it's

1268
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I definitely just fell asleep from exhaustion there

1269
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,000
once. In all fairness I fell asleep a lot of places. That being said you beat me to it.

1270
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,000
You've been in my apartment. You've fallen asleep at the weirdest times in the weirdest

1271
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,000
like we watching something exciting. You turn your eyes are closed like my grandfather

1272
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,000
or something. Like you fall asleep everywhere. In college I fell asleep

1273
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:07,000
in class once with a pen in my mouth. Wait wait wait wait. Like a pen

1274
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:11,000
like you were like. Like I was chewing on a pen and I fell asleep with it

1275
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:15,000
like hanging out of my mouth. Like sitting up like a horse. Yeah I was sitting in like a giant lecture

1276
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:19,000
hall and I had both feet up on the seat in front of me and I

1277
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,000
fell asleep with a pen hanging out of my mouth. A little fact about me I've never fallen asleep

1278
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:27,000
in a public place ever. Oh. I'm too scared to.

1279
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Well I've made up for it. For you. You fall asleep in a lot of public places.

1280
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:35,000
The average of the room is high still thanks to Jason. Thanks to me.

1281
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I want to fall asleep when I go to see these

1282
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:43,000
shows. I don't need to hear about wishes and dreams and journeys

1283
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,000
anymore. I don't even really like the Epcot one.

1284
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Which I admit is very impressive. Oh illuminations. Illuminations. Oh wow.

1285
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:55,000
The thing with the globe opens up. It's a beautiful moment.

1286
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:59,000
But what is it? It's like a bunch of children being projected.

1287
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Oh yeah. I mean. I don't. There's a lot of. They're all too generic. I want

1288
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,000
some more specific points and theories in these shows. I also

1289
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,000
I don't think I'm that into the trend of projecting the stuff onto the buildings.

1290
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,000
There's a thing that a lot of the Disney shows are doing these days where

1291
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:19,000
like we took the castle and we turned it into Iron Man's house.

1292
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:23,000
And it still juts out like a castle.

1293
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:27,000
But I don't know. I feel like it's a trick. I feel like that effect

1294
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,000
must be kind of cheap to do because they're doing it everywhere.

1295
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,000
It's very new and trendy. It's very much like the thing at the moment.

1296
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Yeah. Yeah. But like a Spago kind of restaurant

1297
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:43,000
that's going to have its peak and then it'll

1298
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:47,000
be done. Well drones will be the new thing. I'm pretty excited for the

1299
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,000
So maybe drones will bring you back to being into all these shows. I think so. A bunch of coordinated

1300
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,000
drones. Do you know there's drone racing? Have you seen drone racing? No. Oh boy.

1301
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Like on Deep ESPN there's drone racing. Oh wow. It's like very very

1302
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,000
excited. They book out an entire stadium and they leave the stadium empty and drones

1303
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:07,000
like weave through the tight corridors. It's very cool.

1304
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,000
So I think you're right. Give me some drones and then I'm back in. You got me back.

1305
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,000
I'm back in the crowd of hundreds of thousands of people

1306
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,000
watching the fireworks. Jason, what

1307
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:23,000
was the segment called again? Confession Land? Confession Land.

1308
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:27,000
What's your next Confession Land?

1309
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Okay. Well we're all Southern California based. The three

1310
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,000
of us. We live in Los Angeles. Yes correct. So one

1311
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,000
of the parks we end up in a lot is Disney's California Adventure.

1312
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,000
And you know they did that billion dollar, multi-billion dollar

1313
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:47,000
over redo of it a few years ago.

1314
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Mike and I went opening weekend. We were there opening weekend

1315
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,000
for it. And you know I love

1316
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,000
all the new stuff they add it. I think it's great. It's a much better

1317
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,000
park. But every now and then man I miss that old

1318
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:07,000
California Adventure. What? What really? Yeah

1319
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,000
because I in all fairness I did not see it

1320
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:15,000
like I saw it in 2006. So it was like there

1321
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:19,000
some holes in the rowboat had been plugged at that point.

1322
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Like they had thrown Bugs Life in there for kids. They had thrown Tower

1323
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:27,000
of Terror in there for everyone else. But I just like the fact

1324
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:31,000
that you because Disneyland to me has always

1325
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,000
felt like there's so much stuff.

1326
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:39,000
And when the first few years of going like I really wanted to see a lot

1327
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,000
and see like the limited stuff and the stuff that they didn't have in Florida

1328
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:47,000
and the like little hidden secrets that like I would read about

1329
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:51,000
online. And then when I needed a break I just go over to

1330
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,000
California Adventure where there was no lines and there's like not that many people.

1331
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:59,000
And you just walk around and you could knock it all out in like two and a half

1332
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
hours. So it was I found it very relaxing. You felt it was like a

1333
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:07,000
waiting room for Disneyland. Yeah kind of. It's

1334
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,000
relaxing to me in a way that like

1335
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Walt Disney World is very overwhelming. Right?

1336
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Like if you go there and you spend a few days there like even if you try

1337
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:23,000
to like well maybe I'll just go to the pool for a little while. Like my instinct is

1338
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,000
go like but I should be out there. I should be at one of these parks.

1339
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,000
I should be doing something. But I feel a similar way about like

1340
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Universal Orlando where if you stay on site you can walk

1341
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:39,000
to everything. The parks aren't open very late.

1342
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,000
If you stay at some of the hotels you get an express pass and you can kind of just walk on

1343
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:47,000
to a lot of stuff. So you knock it out very quickly and it's kind

1344
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,000
of relaxing. And as I get older I do like

1345
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,000
relaxing a little at these places where when I was younger. This is

1346
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,000
crazy. This doesn't explain to me why you like like a big

1347
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,000
postcard that came to life or like the Whoopi

1348
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Goldberg movie about the history of California. I never saw that. I never did watch

1349
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,000
that. I never watched it either. I never watched it. It was always there and I didn't watch it. It was always there. I don't know why I

1350
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,000
never watched it. Well if you like being asleep then that's

1351
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,000
the perfect spot for it. You would rather have a shittier park if it meant that you were like less

1352
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:23,000
comfortable. No. I just sometimes like when you're

1353
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,000
crushed like when you're in the queue for Cars Land or like

1354
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,000
when it's really crowded in this park I do long for the days when it's like

1355
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:35,000
well there used to be like no one here. But you know what was there

1356
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:39,000
was a parking lot. Like it doesn't it replaced nothing.

1357
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:43,000
It's not like there was some cool ride that just nobody knew about. Oh well that

1358
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:47,000
yeah. But I didn't know it then either. I also did not know the

1359
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:51,000
first gen. There's also a part of me that wishes I could have seen like

1360
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,000
the superstar limo where you race through Hollywood and terrifying

1361
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,000
puppet people talk to you and the ABC

1362
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:03,000
soap opera cafe. Like I wish I had seen the first generation

1363
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,000
catastrophe Disney California Adventure. See it yes.

1364
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:11,000
But you didn't want to be there. Now it's this lush the Buena Vista Street

1365
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:15,000
the great restaurant. That's one of my favorite places. Oh yeah. No it's

1366
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:19,000
great. It's much better now. But every now and then I do kind of like

1367
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:23,000
I kind of miss when this was. But name one thing you liked

1368
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:27,000
that they took out. I like the ice cream parlor that was inside

1369
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:31,000
of a train car. Yeah that's pretty

1370
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:35,000
good. But you can get the same ice cream they have.

1371
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:39,000
All the pun based signs like Burbank ice cream.

1372
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,000
You still have photos of them. You can read them. This reminds you of some like garbage Jersey

1373
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:47,000
shore shit you like visited as a kid. You watch your mouth.

1374
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:51,000
You were used to some trash and you want to feel like there's some trash down at Disney that's more

1375
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:55,000
suited to you. I oh maybe. And also

1376
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:59,000
you've told me like your family when you would go on trips would have days of decompressing

1377
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:03,000
before you'd even step foot in the park. Like there was so much relaxing.

1378
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Well no after the park. I thought it was before. After you go go go. You told me there would be a

1379
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,000
day after the flight to recover from the flight. Then there would be the trip.

1380
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Then there would be another day to recover before you got on another flight home.

1381
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:19,000
No. We would deke. I mean we were kids. We didn't have

1382
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,000
to. We would do it in the summer. So like we were off all summer. But

1383
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:27,000
yeah after like five days of like sun up to sun down

1384
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,000
like in the parks. Like yeah we would want to decompress

1385
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,000
a little. You know if you want to take a nap go to your home. Leave the

1386
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:39,000
cool feet park to us awake folks. Yeah.

1387
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:43,000
I am amazed that this is a more unpopular opinion. I thought this wouldn't be

1388
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:47,000
that controversial. No you're going to win I think. This segment will tear us apart.

1389
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:51,000
We'll see what everyone thinks of mine. It's much better now. I'm glad we have it now. But every now and then

1390
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:55,000
it's like man I remember when there was just a bunch of fucking tractors here.

1391
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Here's what I like is that we set this up in a way of like we're going to say these things that would make people

1392
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:03,000
pretty mad. And then we are mad. Yeah we are now mad. We're moving what

1393
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,000
works for you. I've also like clarified what I've met a lot.

1394
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Like yeah no it's much better now. I don't want it to come back.

1395
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:15,000
But it was kind of funny to walk around. It was

1396
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,000
it was kind of different. Go to the Santa Monica Pier. Yeah.

1397
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Mike confession. Mine might be the mildest now that I think about it.

1398
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:27,000
I don't love I don't even really like Jungle Cruise.

1399
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Sure. Is that that's not unpopular. Maybe mine is the weakest

1400
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:35,000
because it's like I kind of find it boring. I find the punny punny stuff

1401
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,000
with the tour guides. I think that's lame.

1402
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I think that it's outdated. It feels you know it feels like there's not enough

1403
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,000
robots on it. It's just I never go on it. I don't have an

1404
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,000
urge to go on it. Well yeah I agree. I think that I think the joke

1405
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,000
stuff. I mean yeah it's it's I know it's tradition it's been around forever.

1406
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:59,000
I think you're right. It's the kind of thing like you know watch a video of it if you like it.

1407
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:03,000
But maybe there's a way to make that ride better. I would I would gut it.

1408
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I would make it like I would make the shore much closer to

1409
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:11,000
the boats. I would make like crazy robot animals like I would

1410
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:15,000
make it serious. I would take all that jokey crap away. I think that's

1411
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,000
sacrilege to a lot of people because it's you know putting day wall thing. But like

1412
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,000
I never go on it. But it's one of the ones that everyone considers like a classic.

1413
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,000
That line is is kind of murderous. It's a really boring one.

1414
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,000
I think you may have presented the opinion we all agree with the most but anyone listening

1415
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,000
would be furious. Oh oh oh oh oh oh. I very much like that

1416
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:39,000
turn of the early 20th century explorer kind of aesthetic.

1417
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Sure. I like the radio. I like the old timey music. Sure. Playing

1418
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:47,000
I like that adventurer sort of

1419
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:51,000
stuff. I agree with that all of that. Yeah the puns can be a little

1420
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:55,000
much. I am not a fan of when any when guests

1421
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:59,000
speak along to stuff. And now I feel like a lot

1422
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:03,000
of really die hard fans will like speak along with like

1423
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,000
the backside of water. And that always kind of make makes me cringe.

1424
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:11,000
But it may also just be like being in comedy

1425
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:15,000
and seeing like more hokey or stuff.

1426
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:19,000
It can be a little crazy comedy. Now that you're a comedy expert you feel.

1427
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Now that I am yes. Now that I am a. See comics

1428
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,000
can't stand hearing somebody else do a joke because you wish you thought of it.

1429
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Yes. Which jungle cruise joke did you wish you thought of?

1430
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:35,000
The backside of water is a beaut. Two of his hits. Two of his hits.

1431
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:39,000
We all know it. We wish we wrote it. Ah son of a bitch.

1432
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Man that's a classic. I wish I thought of shooting that gun.

1433
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Sometimes I do like the gun. I like the gun on the ride.

1434
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:51,000
I do like that the original concept was like we got to scare off that

1435
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,000
hippo. Shoot it in the fucking face. Yeah I like

1436
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:59,000
that. So I'm not saying you get rid of the name jungle cruise but like

1437
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,000
I would gut the whole thing. I would reimagine it in a new way.

1438
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Well aren't there rumors. You might be getting that. Dwayne the Rock Johnson.

1439
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:11,000
There was an Instagram to this effect. It's public. Yeah but I think that

1440
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:15,000
very quickly Disney was like that's not happening. Like I feel like Rock has just ushered into rooms

1441
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:19,000
and like he's like posted an Instagram of like yeah I'm making the new

1442
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:23,000
jungle cruise ride. And then like he's ushered out and then people are like what was he talking about.

1443
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Like he might have misheard someone say something and he posted a big thing

1444
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:31,000
about it. Because I don't think. But maybe I mean maybe if this movie. Because there is a jungle cruise movie

1445
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,000
which is something they reiterated they were doing at D23.

1446
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,000
And that is the rock. It is the rock. So that is happening. So maybe

1447
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,000
if the ride, excuse me if the movie does very well

1448
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:47,000
and it's a very exciting adventure they'll change it.

1449
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Chances are though they'll do this Jack Sparrow thing and like the rock will be on.

1450
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:55,000
The robot rock will be on it now. Yeah. Now that you've talked about changing it I don't like

1451
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:59,000
that change. I don't like that change either. I mean if it's a fully new badass

1452
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:03,000
jungle cruise I guess then like a rock animatronic.

1453
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Jungle cruise reloaded. Jungle cruise lock and load.

1454
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Jungle cruise lock and load. The gun they shoot in the sky just gets a lot

1455
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,000
bigger. That's how they change. Most of the ride is taken up by adding pieces

1456
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,000
to the gun.

1457
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:23,000
It won't be able to fit as many people in the boat because there's so many chambers. There's like a shoot out between

1458
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,000
the rock and a rival jungle gang. Yeah.

1459
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,000
So maybe in that instance. Two crews. Two crews. Two jungle crews.

1460
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Ooh jungle crews. Plan words.

1461
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Cruise and cruise. Oh yeah. Wait what's the plan words?

1462
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Like crew like a crew of guys C R E W

1463
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:47,000
and then cruise jungle cruise. Ah I see. So you could go both ways. I mean it's not like

1464
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:51,000
a crew. It just happens to be. Oh is that a leaf? Yeah I think it's a leaf.

1465
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:55,000
I need you to be part of my jungle cruise.

1466
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,000
So we'll change the name of the ride to jungle cruise C R E W

1467
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:03,000
S and we'll at least preserve the name, the sound of the name but it'll be

1468
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,000
a whole new imagined action adventure ride for the rock and

1469
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Kevin Hart or somebody. Will that make you happy Michael?

1470
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:15,000
No. Maybe I'll shut up about the jungle cruise for once.

1471
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:19,000
You don't like the old puns so you thought of a way better one to name

1472
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:23,000
the ride. Oh that's a good point. I'll tell you what you know I'd like to see

1473
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:27,000
maybe let's you know there's already water in that play. I want to see

1474
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:31,000
old Mitch Buchanan from the Baywatch

1475
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:35,000
team. Maybe he's on the jungle cruise. Sure.

1476
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,000
An old shirtless Zac Efron with his 19 pack

1477
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:43,000
his scary amount of abs. Is Hobbs the rock's

1478
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,000
character's name from Fast and Furious? Yes. And Hobbs will be there. Hobbs

1479
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:51,000
will also be there. Alright let's get out of it.

1480
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:55,000
You survived podcast the ride. Thanks to Feral Audio and everybody we'll see you next

1481
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:59,000
time guys. So long.

1482
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,898
