Forever.

00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,920
Warning, the following podcast may contain

00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,560
all-knowing drifter dogs, Popeye-themed toilets,

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,660
and a particular host trying to keep his cool

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,480
around the man who makes his Ninja Turtles.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,400
Trevor Zammit from NECA Toys talks all things turtle

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,600
and growing up at Canada's Wonderland on Podcast The Ride.

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,600
["The Ride Theme Park Theme Song"]

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,600
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a theme park podcast

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
hosted by three men who would have had a better time

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,840
at their high school prom if they were dressed and styled

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,440
by a group of adorable woodland creatures.

14
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,400
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Scott Gairner.

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,160
Yeah, well I mean, in what, I think if woodland creatures

16
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,600
are doing anything to help you, it's better.

17
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,440
I think that's a plus up for any of life's.

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,120
You mean like if you're cleaning out your car,

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,520
if there's a bird that comes by

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,360
and like picks up some trash with its beak, it's better.

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,240
Yeah, absolutely, bring a little magic into the process.

22
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,720
I don't wanna put animals to work doing anything gross,

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,440
but if they could just be part of the basic bathroom

24
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,560
process as well.

25
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,800
It's not like a full Flintstones

26
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,280
where the animals are being put to work.

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,720
They're sort of just helping because they're friends.

28
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,600
Yeah, I think so, and to like add a little,

29
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,480
because they're friends with me and us,

30
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,320
getting magic to our day.

31
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,320
So the bird would say something,

32
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,680
it would look at the camera and say, it's not a living.

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,440
I'm just doing it for fun.

34
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,600
Yeah, it's not a living.

35
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,280
I'm not getting paid for this, therefore it's not a living.

36
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,320
Right, Jason Sheridan is also here too.

37
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,400
Yeah, I have to think the woodland creatures

38
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,880
would have better taste than like whatever

39
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,160
suburban Philadelphia comfort bone.

40
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,600
You wore for prom?

41
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,040
Yeah, tuxedo rental.

42
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,960
It's like a fashion forward sparrow or something.

43
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,080
Yeah, yeah, he's getting you the shawl collar,

44
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,040
the kind of rounded lapels, you know,

45
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,160
just for a little, zhuzh it up, you know.

46
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,080
More styling too.

47
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,560
Yeah, who wears, is there, can you give me an example

48
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,600
of somebody who wears what you're talking about?

49
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,440
You say it on red carpets and stuff,

50
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,640
it's just as opposed to like peaks,

51
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,360
as opposed to point it, like a lapel.

52
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,480
Oh, it's like more of a rounded.

53
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,200
It's more of a rounded.

54
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,640
It's sort of what Big Bird wears,

55
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,840
but he only wears that like dicky part of it,

56
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,680
is that what you're talking about?

57
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,080
Yeah, I think that's right.

58
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,920
Okay.

59
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,760
I don't know what you're talking about

60
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,520
because I've never worn a tuxedo in my life.

61
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,360
Really? Really.

62
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,400
I never have.

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,520
I'm going to a wedding later this year

64
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,400
where it will require me to wear one for the first time.

65
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,440
So your terminology's going over,

66
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,560
I'll hopefully be a tux expert

67
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,880
by the time this wedding rolls around.

68
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,960
You go to any Friar Tux location

69
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,480
here in the San Fernando Valley

70
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,640
and they'll take care of you.

71
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,480
Okay, okay.

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,240
Tell them Jason sent you.

73
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,160
Had a very nice experience there a number of years ago.

74
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,120
Have I said on the show there's a prominent

75
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,840
star of an indie movie from the 90s

76
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,560
who works at a suit store around here?

77
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,800
I don't want to say who it is, but I'll say off mic.

78
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,320
Is it a clerk or a mall rat?

79
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,960
No.

80
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,200
Okay, that pause made me think that maybe it was.

81
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,040
I don't think it was.

82
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,880
No, no, he's not.

83
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,720
I know who it is.

84
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,560
I went right at the target.

85
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,480
I know this cast.

86
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,600
I shouldn't have thought that long.

87
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,880
But I just wanted to make sure.

88
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,440
I know clerk's a mall rat's cast.

89
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,360
Not even a peripheral mall rat.

90
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,520
I don't think so.

91
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,040
But possibly a mall rat?

92
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,880
I don't think so.

93
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,920
Keep your eyes out at tux stores.

94
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,760
Let's bring our guest on,

95
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,280
see if he has any thoughts about tuxedos.

96
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,120
He is the brand manager of Nekatoys Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle

97
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,400
action figure line.

98
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,840
This is Trevor Zamet, ladies and gentlemen.

99
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,240
Hey, hello. Welcome to the podcast.

100
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,320
Hi, Trevor. Hi.

101
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,280
How are you doing? Thanks for having me.

102
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,960
Of course, yeah, thanks for doing it.

103
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,360
Tuxedos, just in general.

104
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,520
We have so much to talk about,

105
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,800
but for some reason we're stuck in tuxedos right now.

106
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,640
Yeah.

107
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,440
How do you feel about formal wear?

108
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,920
You know, they're great on penguins.

109
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,720
You know, it was always cute when the Muppets

110
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,400
would wear their tuxedos.

111
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,240
Well, of course.

112
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,280
You know, making an effort, you know, dressing up.

113
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,720
If they're on the Oscars or something, that's always nice.

114
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,560
Yeah, exactly.

115
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,400
Yeah, yeah.

116
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,720
Yeah, because yeah, I was saying Big Bird earlier

117
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,840
and I always loved it when Big Bird,

118
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,520
he would just have like that one little piece here.

119
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,360
Looks great.

120
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,200
It looks great.

121
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,240
He's naked except for the little piece,

122
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,080
which I don't think Scott is going to do that look at the.

123
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,280
Yogi Bear just wears the collar with a tie, you know.

124
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,160
Yes.

125
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,200
Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get away with it.

126
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,520
A collar and a tie.

127
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,520
It's a Sesame Street slash Anna Marbera reference

128
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,600
as I'm getting pulled into the police car.

129
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,280
Yeah, well, the police will understand,

130
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,920
I think, eventually down at the station.

131
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,880
You have to have the cap, though.

132
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,720
If they're a fan.

133
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,680
I think the cap and the collar and the tie.

134
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,600
Completes the outfit.

135
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,040
Completes it, yeah.

136
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,480
Otherwise, you'd just be your run-of-the-mill pervert.

137
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,480
You'd look weird without the cap.

138
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,800
Without the cap, yeah.

139
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,080
Justifies it totally, yeah.

140
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,400
Okay, so we have so much to talk about.

141
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,240
I want to set, Trevor, I want to set you up a little bit here

142
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,880
of how we met, how I learned about you.

143
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,720
On this show, oftentimes I talk about this hobby of mine,

144
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,560
collecting.

145
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,320
These two gentlemen are, I would say casual,

146
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,440
like action figure guys, casual toy people.

147
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,000
I have some, but yes, but I, no, it's not even,

148
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,960
I don't think I'm 1% what you are.

149
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,800
Right.

150
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,120
With your life. You know of toys.

151
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,800
Yes, yeah, yeah, and I've bought them as an adult.

152
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,640
Oh, okay.

153
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,400
Yes, yeah, yeah, and I have some neck of stuff.

154
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,240
I've got, yeah, I got you a couple

155
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,280
of the Back to the Future things.

156
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,120
Oh, those are great.

157
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,680
Yeah, yeah. Which are great.

158
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,360
Jason, Jason will collect what he likes.

159
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,560
Jason has a maggot toy from the X-Men,

160
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,400
one of his favorite characters.

161
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,600
Oh, from the Marvel Legends.

162
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,760
He's got some Marvel Legends.

163
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,640
He just got Wimpy in the mail from the company Boss Fight.

164
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,520
Oh, that's a good one.

165
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,960
So he's very excited about that.

166
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,040
Yeah.

167
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,360
You have Popeye and Wimpy now?

168
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,720
I have Popeye and Wimpy now.

169
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,960
Yeah, so they can hang out.

170
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,160
That's how it starts.

171
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,240
Wimpy's just, he's lonely and he needs friends.

172
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,680
That is true, and that's how the Marvel, you know.

173
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,680
I don't have the room for this, this problem,

174
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,360
but I have a lot of tabs open on my computer.

175
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,800
Mike makes the room.

176
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,720
You'll have it whether you have the room or not.

177
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,720
You will carve some space out of wherever you're living.

178
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,800
We have a garage now, which is dangerous for a collector

179
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,520
because a lot of stuff goes into little bins that I buy.

180
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,320
So this is the plight of the collector.

181
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,760
So anyway, for many years at the company you work for,

182
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,600
NECA, which I've talked about before,

183
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,280
you would do one fun Ninja Turtles release a year,

184
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,120
usually Comic-Con, and it'd be like, oh, this is fun.

185
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,960
This is great to get a little retro Ninja Turtles thing.

186
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,520
Once a year, that's a fun little treat.

187
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,960
And it was about, the first one was the,

188
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,000
or no, the first one was the original comics, I believe.

189
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,040
That was a long, that was before me.

190
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,960
That was a long time ago.

191
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,000
Yeah, those were awesome.

192
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,960
That's what really started it.

193
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,120
And then they went away for a little while.

194
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,640
And then when I started working there,

195
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,480
there was an opportunity that popped up

196
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,200
to do the arcade figures.

197
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,080
Right, which was, yeah, so they have kind of pixelated,

198
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,400
look to them, and that was great to get those.

199
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,160
And then I think you did the movies, the movie figures,

200
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,080
which I believe you sculpted, is that correct?

201
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,760
Yeah, and the arcade ones too.

202
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Oh, you did both of them, okay.

203
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,920
Because yeah, you're an artist and a sculptor.

204
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,600
How it started was just like,

205
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,480
I was sculpting some of this stuff for fun,

206
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,280
and it sort of turned into work stuff.

207
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,760
But yeah, so I had worked on the arcade stuff,

208
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,600
the early movie stuff.

209
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,520
There was a bunch of us that were working on it.

210
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,280
But then it went into the cartoon.

211
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,440
We did a cartoon set the following year.

212
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,820
A great retro package that looks like the old cases

213
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,080
that you would get back in the old days.

214
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,920
I don't know if you guys ever had a turtle,

215
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,120
big plastic case where you'd keep your figures in it.

216
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,560
The Playmates.

217
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,400
Yes, the Playgirl turtles.

218
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,680
Like an old vinyl carrying case.

219
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,160
So that was where you got these cartoon figures in.

220
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,520
And again, it's like, this is the fun, once a year fun

221
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,640
that I get to have a comic on.

222
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,840
And then I guess it's what, three or four years ago

223
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,480
at this point, something changed.

224
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,240
And my life would never be the same.

225
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,960
Men of my age's lives would never be the same.

226
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,640
Mostly men, I'm sure there's women out there,

227
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,960
but I'm in a lot of toy Facebook groups where I lurk,

228
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,040
and it is mostly men.

229
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,880
That's why I say that.

230
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,160
But of course there are women out there.

231
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,760
And so you guys started doing everything, essentially.

232
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,020
Every version of the Ninja Turtles possible.

233
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,560
The cartoon, the Fred Wolf stuff,

234
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,320
I'm just talking by the way, feel free to interrupt me.

235
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,560
I'm getting on a roll here, I think.

236
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,600
No, yeah, it's cool.

237
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,000
The movie stuff, the Mirage comic, and then recently,

238
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,600
which of course I've talked about before,

239
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,220
the specific Archie comics Ninja Turtles

240
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,000
that I read as a kid and I felt was the main canon

241
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,840
of the turtles.

242
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,320
I think that is one of the happiest moments

243
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,520
I've ever seen Mike.

244
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,880
He came to a recording one day,

245
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,640
and I forget whether we were arriving

246
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,360
or it was on our way out,

247
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,400
and he went, NECA is doing the Archie comics Ninja Turtles.

248
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,520
It's one of the most requested things we got

249
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,280
when we were doing the,

250
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,600
because that year when we made that carrying case,

251
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Ken Metroni, who was one of the Archie pencilers, right?

252
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,640
He did the art for the carrying case.

253
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,000
So that was a cartoon set, but with Archie artwork,

254
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,360
and everyone was like, the Archie comics are so great,

255
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,080
when are you gonna just do Archie figures?

256
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,960
And so it was a long time to,

257
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,200
because that was a separate deal we had to negotiate,

258
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,960
and it took a while, but yeah,

259
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,400
we're finally doing proper Archie turtle figures,

260
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,200
which is cool.

261
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,240
For again, men like myself, very exciting.

262
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,760
So this guy Ken who drew the comics,

263
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,000
he's like, he designed a berserk from Toy Story 2?

264
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Ken has got a really insane, amazing career.

265
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,320
And yeah, I think he was drawing the Archie turtle comics

266
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,280
on his lunch break from working on Tiny Toons.

267
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,920
And so that was like, he would just kind of knock those out,

268
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,680
but he did the early run of the comics,

269
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,200
and they're just beloved by people of a certain age.

270
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,760
So yeah, Ken is like, but after,

271
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,800
he was just kind of doing them as a side gig,

272
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,800
and then when he had worked on the Back to the Future cartoon

273
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,920
for a little bit, he did that, he just started naming stuff.

274
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,040
I'll ask Ken, we found this weird show called Fish Police,

275
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,880
I don't know if you guys remember.

276
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,520
Oh yeah, I remember, Prime Time bomb.

277
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,760
Like Post Simpson's.

278
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,120
Yeah, like Capital Critters and all those.

279
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,400
Yeah, yeah.

280
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,440
And I was like, I gotta find,

281
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,600
I'm sure Ken worked on Fish Police,

282
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,000
and he's like, oh, he's like, yeah, I remember that show.

283
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,960
He's like, I didn't do the show, but I did those comics too.

284
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,840
And then like. Fish Police comics?

285
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,160
Yeah, there was a run of Fish Police comics,

286
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,160
and he did gargoyles, and then he went to Pixar,

287
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,360
and he was working, I don't think he worked

288
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,680
on the first Toy Story, but he definitely had

289
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,080
like a big presence on the second one,

290
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,680
created Emperor Zerg.

291
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,600
I think he storyboarded that entire scene

292
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,320
when they're under the parking cones,

293
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,840
like running across the street, like causing chaos.

294
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,240
Oh, what a sequence, that's incredible, wow.

295
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,760
I think Ken did all of that stuff,

296
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,400
but he's just, he's kind of been everywhere

297
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,240
and done everything.

298
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,000
He's got crazy stories about hanging out

299
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,760
with like Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird

300
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,520
back in the height of like the turtles.

301
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,360
Right.

302
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,680
Ken's just a fascinating guy.

303
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,760
He's just got a million stories.

304
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,760
Wait, what's the last name again?

305
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,600
Mitroni.

306
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,440
Mitroni.

307
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,280
Mitroni.

308
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,120
Yeah.

309
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,240
So, yeah, so I brought a couple things,

310
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,800
just to show my coasts here.

311
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,240
I just wanted to show the range of stuff you do,

312
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,440
because it is pretty crazy.

313
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,320
Like this is Toca from Secret of the U.S.

314
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,160
Oh yeah. I mean, it's like.

315
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,880
You need gloves to handle the show.

316
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,960
I know, I wanna peel the back of it.

317
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,720
It's a murder weapon, really.

318
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,560
Yeah, geez.

319
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,320
Yeah, Jason Fraley sculpted that one.

320
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,320
He's got articulated mouth and the beak,

321
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,520
and the eyebrows are articulated,

322
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,600
so you get all kinds of cool expressions.

323
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,920
So you can pass these around.

324
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,760
It feels like close to being on set, you would think.

325
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,680
Like, I mean, it is small,

326
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,120
but in terms of like texture and realism,

327
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,240
it's as close as we can come to like,

328
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,520
he's saying hi to me on his lunch break.

329
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,600
And his beak moves.

330
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,480
I mean, it's like, these were maybe

331
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,960
my favorite figures that year.

332
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,360
Yeah, that was, Toca and Ra's are a great set.

333
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,200
Yeah, Jason gets like crazy obsessive

334
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,000
with all the details and stuff.

335
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,160
Yeah, this is Usagi.

336
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,480
He's from Usagi Ujumbo.

337
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,720
That's from the Fred Wolf cartoon,

338
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,080
and this is from Coming Out of Her Shells.

339
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,080
So like, the difference in the styles is really remarkable,

340
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,960
which is what makes people like me nuts about this stuff.

341
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,920
What's this frog?

342
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,320
That's one of the punk frogs.

343
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,200
Oh boy, which one is that? From the Fred Wolf.

344
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,960
I always forget which one is which, so that's a blessing.

345
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,080
It's not Genghis.

346
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,360
It's, oh boy, that's Napoleon.

347
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,240
Okay. Yeah.

348
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,920
So yeah, there were four punk frogs, which were like the,

349
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,640
they're like sort of-

350
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,960
They were bad for a little while, but then they-

351
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Yeah, they were kind of counterparts.

352
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,840
Like, Shredder wanted his own team of mutants

353
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,320
that he could train in the evil arts or something.

354
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,240
So he named them all like Genghis, Attila, Rasputin,

355
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,720
and Paul the Author, after his heroes.

356
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,560
Right, of course.

357
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,040
Oh yeah, bad as Fred Wolf figures.

358
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,840
They're called the punk frogs, but they're just not,

359
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,240
like they're from, like they just wear these Hawaiian shirts

360
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,840
and like the shorts, like there's nothing really

361
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,320
that punk about them, you know?

362
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,200
Yeah, I know that the people making it

363
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,600
like knew what punk meant.

364
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,960
Maybe not, I don't know.

365
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,720
And that all their voices, they sounded kind of

366
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,800
like gym neighbors.

367
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,520
So like their voices were all hilarious on the show.

368
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,120
And like the frogs are some of my favorite characters

369
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,040
from the cartoon.

370
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,440
Yeah. Yeah.

371
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,760
So it's, yeah, so you're doing this, like just even

372
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,520
to describe what you do, I think you do a lot of things,

373
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,000
but like you're watching old cartoons for references.

374
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yeah, I just get paid to watch cartoons

375
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,040
and old turtle movies and bi comics.

376
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,640
You have what sounds like a six year old

377
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,160
from 1989's Dream Job or.

378
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,560
Yeah, definitely very close to that, yeah.

379
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,520
So. Just get to make toys and play with stuff.

380
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,800
And you're looking for details basically,

381
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,280
because like right now I'm holding the,

382
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,760
coming out of our shells, Michelangelo

383
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,640
with a shredded jean vest.

384
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:52,520
And on the back is a poster for the musical mutagen tour.

385
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,200
Just like the degree of detail fit onto this,

386
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,160
this single action figure is nuts.

387
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,560
Yeah, I sculpted the socks.

388
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,360
No, no, not the socks.

389
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,480
No, those are the fabric leg warmers.

390
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,280
I sculpted the shoes on that guy.

391
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
Wow.

392
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,800
Jason that did Toca, he sculpted the head for that one.

393
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,880
That one's got a hinged mouth and the creepy like giant eyes.

394
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,080
Oh yeah, it does perfectly reflect

395
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,600
how those turtles are kind of off.

396
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,120
Yeah, like you incorporate that they're weird suits.

397
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,040
Yeah, we try to capture like kind of the fun weirdness of.

398
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,880
Yeah.

399
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,600
So many, that's incredible that you're,

400
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,640
that's the goal because like a more corporate way

401
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,600
of doing these toys would smooth it out

402
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,880
and not embrace the odd.

403
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,280
No, we have to, it's, yeah, it's just too fun.

404
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,960
We have to like, we're just making the toys that we want.

405
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,000
So like. Yeah.

406
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,080
Even when that became a possibility,

407
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,920
it was like, we really have to,

408
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,840
we just need to go all out and make it crazy.

409
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,520
So like. Yeah.

410
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,520
That's when I remember Lindsay said to me, she goes,

411
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,680
oh, you're like, these are, you're so happy about these,

412
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,880
these coming out of her shoulder,

413
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,080
she didn't call them that, but I go,

414
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,360
I go, you know what this means?

415
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,960
This means anything is possible.

416
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,040
Like I give a very dramatic.

417
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,640
It was a turning point for us.

418
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,040
Yeah. I give a very dramatic thing.

419
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,280
Most optimistic thing I've ever said in my life.

420
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,800
All of a sudden the skies were blue.

421
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,920
So. And then your next thing out of your mouth,

422
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,200
let's have a child.

423
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,240
Yeah, it inspired us to have a child.

424
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,080
Yeah. Oh wow.

425
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,480
Brett, I have a photo that says NECA,

426
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,120
if you could bring it up whenever you get a chance.

427
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,920
So I've, you know, I've been watching all these videos,

428
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,720
like anytime you guys do a thing,

429
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,640
this is by the way, what one of my displays look like.

430
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,920
I've become a display guy.

431
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,760
Okay. Yeah. You gotta have the display.

432
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,120
I've become a shelf.

433
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,120
Right. So now I'm like displaying things.

434
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,480
I have my own light.

435
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,920
Well, I've put some lights under the shelves to display things.

436
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,960
I've always smoked.

437
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,320
So I've turned into like Reverend Lovejoy with his trains.

438
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,880
You're in too deep now.

439
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,280
You're just gone.

440
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:56,840
Oh my God.

441
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,720
You're in too deep.

442
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,520
Are you kidding me?

443
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,760
When Jane and I got to your birthday party,

444
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,360
we were some of the first ones there and we somehow this came up,

445
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,400
but you were like showing us on your phone on Amazon.

446
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,680
Like I bought these.

447
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,640
Oh, the little lights.

448
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,000
I bought these little lights.

449
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,560
Oh yeah.

450
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,560
You have the accessory set.

451
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,400
You got the TV with a stock and everything.

452
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,880
Oh my God.

453
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,760
I'm I'll tell you how crazy I am later

454
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,200
because we have so much stuff to get to.

455
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,720
But wait a minute.

456
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,920
Wait, jump.

457
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,480
Give us one taste of what is later.

458
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,840
Well, I have a couple, there's a couple of guys,

459
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,240
a couple of toy dudes that I text with and we're always sort of on top of like,

460
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,200
okay, it looks like stuff's hitting this week.

461
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,640
So I happen to be a bunch of your stuff came out at once in March or so.

462
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,520
And I'm in Facebook groups and I all of a sudden you see a bunch of guys start posting about it.

463
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,720
So I go, hmm.

464
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,240
And this is like, baby, I'm watching the baby.

465
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,920
I just by luck had like a lunch meeting to go to

466
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,600
and I built 30 minutes in to go to the North Hollywood Target.

467
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,640
Get the closest target.

468
00:17:59,640 --> 00:17:59,880
Yeah.

469
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,360
Yes.

470
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,840
And I went to North Hollywood and boy, I ran into the guy stocking.

471
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,400
Oh, wow.

472
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,360
As soon as like it was, I almost fell over.

473
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,320
Yeah, perfect time.

474
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,040
And he was uncomfortable because I was just standing there.

475
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,400
I was trying not to be rude, but he felt like I was about to steal everything.

476
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,920
I was like, I'm not taking everything.

477
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,760
I just want one of each.

478
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,280
For a couple of friends, I was getting two things.

479
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,680
So I was just standing there.

480
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,880
I'm late for the lunch meeting, but I cannot believe my luck.

481
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,960
And I just, I got most of the stuff that was released.

482
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,520
So I got that like that week that it came out.

483
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,760
And that employee is safe, healthy.

484
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,920
He's been released.

485
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,320
Non-hospitalized.

486
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,400
His limbs all function.

487
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,280
Because he's in witness protection from me.

488
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,160
So he requested like, hey, is it OK if I transfer to another target?

489
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,360
No, to another country.

490
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,640
I will put my hand on a Bible.

491
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,440
I did not like stalk him or put like one of the Apple tracers on his car or something.

492
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,400
I just it was pure luck that I was there the time he was.

493
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,040
He does not accept your Facebook friend requests, though.

494
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,600
Nobody should.

495
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,880
I don't know you, man.

496
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,440
Just by luck.

497
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,280
I'll take some of the heat off you and tell an embarrassing story.

498
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,840
Kind of a seminal embarrassing story.

499
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:20,280
I don't think it's come up on the show before, but the presence of Usagi Ujimbo is a big,

500
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,840
plays a big part of this.

501
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,280
Go ahead.

502
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:30,440
Which was, it was a day in the summer when I was very young.

503
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,280
And, you know, I was up before my mom and I was like,

504
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,920
I think she said we're going to Woolworths today.

505
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,920
And I was like, pacing around, pacing around.

506
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,880
Were you gritting your teeth?

507
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,720
I was just like, OK, they have that whole aisle of action figures.

508
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,360
And I was like, I'm pretty sure they have Usagi Ujimbo.

509
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,720
And if they do, maybe I'll get it today.

510
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,280
And I couldn't wait any longer as I went in and I kind of woke her up.

511
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:58,840
I was like, hey.

512
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,520
Are we going to Woolworths today?

513
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:03,880
Woolworths?

514
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,520
She's like, what?

515
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,520
She's like, what?

516
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,680
Is everything OK?

517
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,720
I'm like, yeah, I just, what are we doing today?

518
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,560
And she kind of like, eventually was like, why do you, what?

519
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,240
And eventually got out.

520
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:25,880
And she's like, I don't, please don't ever wake me up again to figure out where we're going

521
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,720
that you can look at action figures.

522
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,320
Did you listen?

523
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,120
I did listen.

524
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,200
You're a good boy.

525
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,160
I think, hey, what's the deal?

526
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,880
Did you get him?

527
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,800
No, I never got him.

528
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,360
I never got him.

529
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:45,000
So then I, last night as I'm looking at all the NECA stuff and looking at some of

530
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,440
what Mike had talked about and stuff, I have like all of the generate,

531
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,600
because I know there's NECA, Usagi, Ujimbo's.

532
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,360
I'm on eBay and I'm like, how much does the Playmates want?

533
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:05,160
It's like, oh, inbox, still $50 for the old one that may well be rotting with some plastics,

534
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,080
the packaging or stuff.

535
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,160
But the NECA one looks great.

536
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,760
He looks like picture perfect of the Sein Sakae comic.

537
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,320
Do you want to hold?

538
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,360
Did you want to stay with him?

539
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,200
Yeah, put him, give him to Jason.

540
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,200
This is a thing that you should have, you were denied as a kid.

541
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,840
He looks great.

542
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,120
Yeah, look into his eyes.

543
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,800
Yeah, just bring him next to you.

544
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,960
If you want to cuddle, whatever needs to happen here, we'll give you the space.

545
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,640
I have not read a lot of Usagi, Ujimbo.

546
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,200
It's a thing that's been going for decades and there's phone book size collections.

547
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,600
Yeah, it's digital collections.

548
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,160
Yeah, he's been doing it 40 years next year.

549
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,760
Yeah, and you've gotten to work with Stan Sakae, who did, yeah, which is pretty crazy.

550
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,400
Stan's awesome.

551
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:51,880
Yeah, when we were doing that figure, it was pretty regular emails back and forth

552
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,320
with Stan's people and Stan directly and creating the artwork for the box and everything.

553
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,800
He's got to approve every stage, the sculpt, the paint, the packaging, all of it.

554
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,760
Yeah, Stan's super cool and great to work with.

555
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,600
He was at WonderCon a couple of months ago and I got to meet him in person and actually

556
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,880
talked to him for a minute or two and yeah, it was cool.

557
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,240
Got him to sign some stuff.

558
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:17,560
Sure.

559
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:17,960
Great.

560
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,520
That's awesome.

561
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,480
So yeah, so all this to say, this turtle, you know what, I'll throw one more turtle

562
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,680
thing out real quick and then we'll explain how we got to Canada's wonderland.

563
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,400
Brett, that link I just sent you, a lot of these interviews you do with toy

564
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:37,560
people that I end up watching, a common thing happens and I kind of feel some sympathy too

565
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:42,520
because I feel the urge that the interviewers, well, they'll just be like, do you think maybe

566
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,400
there's a chance you could make and then they'll just list one of the characters they want.

567
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:45,640
Yeah.

568
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,520
Which of course I get that, but also you're like, well, I'll show, like when it happens,

569
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,160
it happens is usually how you can answer that question.

570
00:22:53,160 --> 00:23:01,400
But I will say, is there a chance we could ever get the Disney MGM studio specific characters

571
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:08,600
and with Alan Thicke singing a song, a five pack.

572
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,760
This is, I'm pushing everybody over at Target.

573
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,760
Any employee I'm pushing over.

574
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,840
If I get my turtles era Alan Thicke.

575
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,000
I've never seen anyone asking about this.

576
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,500
Yeah.

577
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:25,880
It was only in all honesty, a couple of weeks ago when internally we were talking about this very

578
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:34,280
thing and kind of joke, like it's probably never ever going to happen, but if I could sculpt

579
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,720
another turtle, it would be like those big kind of puffy like walk around suits like from MGM.

580
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,680
And there's the, they did a video with like the LA transit or something.

581
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,160
Yes.

582
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,760
You know, so there's pictures of like, we were just talking about this the other day.

583
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,760
Like, yeah, those suits would be so, so much fun to do.

584
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:01,800
And it's again, it's a weird crazy thing that kind of perfectly shows like the height of the

585
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,600
nineties, like the early nineties, like turtle mania.

586
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,080
Yeah.

587
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:11,320
And like no one's ever thought to sculpt like one of those costumes, like that giant costume

588
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,520
was shrunk down to an action figure would be so cool.

589
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,080
It'd be great.

590
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,920
It's a lot of forms doubling in.

591
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,880
Yeah, we have to wait a second.

592
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,680
Yeah, play a little bit.

593
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,880
I think it's like 38 seconds.

594
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,360
It starts.

595
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,120
We should get a booth at Comic-Con.

596
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,080
You can sell it there.

597
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,120
Sure.

598
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,960
So, cause it's like a theme park thing.

599
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,440
Oh yeah.

600
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,440
38 seconds or so is when Alan starts singing with a rap.

601
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,120
I mean, we're going to, well, aren't we, we've been talking about doing a full episode about

602
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,600
We will do a full episode about this, but yeah, we'll show a little clip, right?

603
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,640
Yeah.

604
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,840
I mean, leather jacket, sunglasses clad, Alan Pick, kind of Terminator ish.

605
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,800
Yeah, I was going to say it's half Terminator and half like David Hasselhoff, like Knight Rider.

606
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,040
Yeah.

607
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,440
Yeah.

608
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,120
With the red shirt and the jacket.

609
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,760
Oh, those, they're so great.

610
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,120
They make like dopey smiles.

611
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,120
Turtles I met at like Cub Foods when they signed my cookie box at age five.

612
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:07,480
Yeah.

613
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,960
They're still different than like the turtles who might be at, you know, a market opening

614
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,760
or a movie theater opening or the ice capades.

615
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,080
There's a lot more to go.

616
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,840
So yeah, you can stop playing it.

617
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,800
That's the only thing I'll say.

618
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,800
You can also, also bread, feel free to leave this cool Alan Thicke still

619
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,960
where he's looking out into the Florida sun.

620
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,040
I think until we change topics entirely, I would like this to be on screen.

621
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,080
RIP Alan.

622
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,080
I've gotten so much joy out of Alan Thicke.

623
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,760
This is a perfect piece of footage because like, I love 90s Turtles.

624
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,040
You really love 90s Turtles.

625
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,360
I, on top of that, love Alan Thicke's music.

626
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,800
And the music career of Alan Thicke.

627
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:47,960
Yeah.

628
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,480
Also coming, all coming to the show.

629
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:55,400
But yeah, I don't know if this helps, if this like, this random focus group,

630
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,560
I was talking to these three random guys who all thought this would be a good idea.

631
00:25:59,560 --> 00:25:59,880
Yeah.

632
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,560
They said it was, yeah, they okayed it.

633
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:06,440
I'll just tell my boss Randy, it's like, yeah, podcast the ride said it's like, it's gold.

634
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:07,880
It'll sell.

635
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,760
These will sell.

636
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,280
Yes.

637
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,800
So I'll calm down now and then say that one of these interviews you were doing,

638
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,520
I perked up when I heard you say, I grew up in a theme park.

639
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,120
Yes, that is true.

640
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,080
And I was like, whoa, that phrase again, another child's dream

641
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,040
was your experience growing up.

642
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,640
And that was Canada's Wonderland.

643
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,000
Yeah, that's right.

644
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,200
So yeah, I mean, just where does that mean?

645
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,080
What does it mean?

646
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,480
Tell us.

647
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,960
So basically I wasn't there every day, I didn't live there, but like, yeah, my dad,

648
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,760
the park opened in 81 the same year I was born.

649
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,960
My dad worked there since, you know, he got hired in like 1980.

650
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,000
So he was there like building, helping like just assemble, like get everything together.

651
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,120
So all through the 80s, he was like the games manager at Canada's Wonderland.

652
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,160
So we were just there all the time, like my sister and my mom,

653
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,320
we would just go and hang out like all through the summer and stuff.

654
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,440
I just grew up at Canada's Wonderland.

655
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:12,940
Wow.

656
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,840
So and actually, and a crazy thing because he would go to toy fair every year.

657
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,120
And this is how like this, it's weird that this probably formed like me, you know?

658
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,760
Like he would come back from New York toy fair with stacks of like toy catalogs.

659
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,920
And then my friends and I would just sit there and just like look through like the Kenner

660
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,720
catalog. It's like you'd see all the new Ghostbusters coming out for like this year.

661
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,040
And so all the Mattel catalogs, you see all the He-Man toys and like it's just,

662
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:50,280
so my whole life, and then they would send like, they knew my dad, like they knew he had a kid that

663
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:55,400
was like the perfect age for all of that 80s stuff. So like he would just come home with like

664
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:00,920
sales samples of, I would get like boxes of Ninja Turtles and like Toxic Crusaders and like,

665
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:07,640
we just had so many toys, you know? They would just, so yeah, I was like some weird like kind

666
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:14,680
of test subject kid or something for all this, all the 80s toy mania. I was just like completely

667
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,440
like surrounded by it.

668
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,960
So would he tell people like, oh, my son really responded to Toxic?

669
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,000
I'm sure he did. Yeah.

670
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,360
He was giving feedback on stuff.

671
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,880
There probably was some of that. Yeah. But yeah, we would just get like,

672
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,200
I remember getting like a turtle blimp, but it was like this, it was all incomplete.

673
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,520
It was just like in a box, you know? Wow, really?

674
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:37,880
Yeah. And so I'd have to like build the missing pieces for it. And I got a general

675
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:43,240
trag that just came with a Ziploc bag full of weapons, you know? It was like weird samples

676
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:49,640
that someone had laying around an office and I'd either get like a full fresh case of Toxic

677
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,920
Crusaders or I'd just get like any weird random toy they had like lying around. So I just had like

678
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,960
all this stuff. So did you have, do you still have any of that stuff?

679
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:05,160
I have a couple of the toy catalogs still. A lot of my old, like a lot of my 80s toys are gone.

680
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:10,920
It's a very tragic story. And then a lot of, I know I had the Cranks Android body like

681
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:16,360
for a long time and I'm pretty sure my mom like just took it to the thrift store, you know,

682
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,120
took it to Goodwill or something. My mom gets rid of a lot of that stuff.

683
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,520
Right. Oh geez, Toy Story 3 nightmare.

684
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,800
Yeah. That's not trash.

685
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:31,640
When you said your dad was the games manager. So that was like the throw the ball.

686
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,840
Yeah. He like built like the Skeeball machine. I was talking to him before I got here and I was

687
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:42,440
like, he was one of the guys like, you know, they would just get a kit of like unassembled

688
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:48,280
Skeeball machines. And so they would just like unbox it, like, you know, screw them all together,

689
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,520
like set them up. Like he was building all of that stuff. And then, so all the stuff in the

690
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:57,000
arcades, like the redemption things where you get like a stuffed animal or like, you know,

691
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,280
there's like those duck races, like he was, he was kind of in charge of all of that stuff.

692
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:11,560
Wow. So geez, early eighties theme park, Canadian arcade. This is so many, so many keywords.

693
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,080
Yeah. There's a lot to unpack.

694
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,600
Lit up on every level.

695
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,440
So, so, so he, even when the park you were there, he was working there for many years. So he was

696
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,640
just like, he would check on which games were doing well, what was breaking down.

697
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,000
Yeah, probably. Yeah. Yeah.

698
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,040
It's probably all that stuff.

699
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:33,480
And then, yeah, like if, I don't know, it's like there's, when did the horse racing game with the,

700
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,200
you know what I'm talking about?

701
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,000
You were all the balls.

702
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,080
The roll the balls up. And that's one of my favorites.

703
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,640
With the tiered, where they kind of like step up, there's all the horses.

704
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,040
Yes. It's like, there's a three, there's like a hole that's called three points or like.

705
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,640
Oh yeah. The rings, like it's like, if you get it in the center.

706
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,560
Yeah. Well, I think, yeah.

707
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,200
No, that's no, I'm describing ski ball. Like you're just, yes.

708
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,400
No, no, which one are you talking about?

709
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,440
So there's like a power.

710
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:56,920
The horse is.

711
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,040
It's a little diamond, I think. And that usually, I think the top is like,

712
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:05,080
we're three like paces or three steps horse. And then the next one is like two.

713
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,880
And then the bottom one is maybe one. And so if you roll it and you get it up to in the third,

714
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,120
the horse will go one, two, three on the board and you're playing against everybody else.

715
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,720
Oh, I don't know that one.

716
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,760
I'm pretty sure this is the game I beat a bunch of little kids on the Santa Monica pier

717
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,160
and one Homer accidentally though, because I sat down first and then was like, ready to go.

718
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,720
Okay. Play. And then I looked to my right after I won and I went, uh-oh,

719
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,000
you're a man in your twenties who just beat a bunch of kids.

720
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,520
Yeah. He's, he's got stories about, you know, like the guy that invented like whack-a-mole or like.

721
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:45,080
There's like, he knows, I think he knows all of these people, you know, cause it's,

722
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,800
it's usually just a couple of companies that like, you know, they build all these games or

723
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:55,480
they come up with some new thing and it's sold to like all the parks, you know, so it's, um,

724
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,440
yeah, he's just, he's got a million, cause he's been doing this stuff since 1980. Like that was

725
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,160
his first, he's been working in like the amusement industry, like since then.

726
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,960
And still.

727
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,920
Yeah, still. Yeah.

728
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,840
Wow. Where is it? Where is he? What is he doing now? Is he, he's not at Canada's wonderland,

729
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:17,720
but. No, no, he left there. He now he, he works for, um, uh, a company that makes like the,

730
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,200
the stuffed animals. So he's like on the other side, like selling.

731
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,800
Ah, he switched to prizes.

732
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:27,960
Yeah. He switched to the prizes. So yeah, he's, he's probably a couple of years away from retirement,

733
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:34,120
but he just, that's all he does is just work. So he's in, he was just at Carowinds yesterday

734
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,360
or he's going there today. I don't, he was just at Dollywood.

735
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,480
Wow.

736
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,320
In the last, like, like I, when I was talking to him on the phone, he's like driving through

737
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,400
North Carolina right now, probably on the way to Carowinds or something.

738
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,880
Geez. Making the, making the round, which is like, like assessing like what's working. What

739
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:55,720
can we do different? Something like that. Yeah. Hanging out with a bunch of, you know, old, uh,

740
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,640
amusement buddies and stuff like just.

741
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,520
So he's like Dollywood needs a fresh batch of like raccoon plush.

742
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:07,000
Yeah. And he's the guy that'll, you know, go scrounge that up. You'll find it, get it on a

743
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,640
truck, get it shipped. Like how? And cause he does a lot of, he's a lot of his customers are,

744
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:16,760
you know, they'll, they'll do like the, like a state fair that's only there for like a couple

745
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,400
weeks or a month. So he's got to make sure like the product hits, like when they, when they're

746
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:26,120
going to be in town, like it's got to get to the destination. So he's got to coordinate, you know,

747
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:31,800
with like the shipping company and everything, like make sure they hit all their, their destinations,

748
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,920
like on the right dates. Cause yeah, some of them are like traveling shows and stuff. So.

749
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:42,840
I don't know. It's an interesting job. Probably. Yeah. That being a job. Yeah.

750
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,240
As a kid, were you so like, yeah, as a kid, what, I mean, obviously everybody's just like,

751
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,640
Oh, this is what my parents do. But did you kind of know like, it's kind of cool.

752
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:57,320
I knew it was unusual cause like all the other kids in school were just like,

753
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,400
your dad does what, you know? And then we would, you know, everyone would want to go to like

754
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:07,880
the park with us. And, you know, cause everyone else had, I think normal jobs, you know, so we just

755
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:13,000
work in an office or do whatever. And yeah, it was just, it was definitely, I knew it was a

756
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,280
weird thing because none of my other friends like kind of lived in an amusement park.

757
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,560
My sister and I were the only ones, you know, in the, in the neighborhood. So

758
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:29,320
you were really in like a, my uncle worked for Nintendo sort of scenario, but for real,

759
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:34,120
my dad works for an amusement park. In one of my dad's friends, like,

760
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:41,560
you remember in Pee Wee's big adventure, when he goes to that novelty, like joke shop and he's

761
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,720
just, Oh, what do you got? What's new this week? And he's got the, like, my dad had a friend like

762
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:51,960
that for years and he was like, he was one of my uncles, you know, like I think he got me the

763
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:58,440
Ghostbusters firehouse and all this stuff, but we would go to his guy named Solly and we'd go to his

764
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:06,040
warehouse where all he had was just novelty, like stuff, like whoopee cushions and like inflatable

765
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:12,520
rambos and like just, just like every weird thing, like he had all of it. And you know,

766
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:19,480
we'd get these weird, when Ghostbusters was like huge, he had these like, like a ghost in a can,

767
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:25,160
like these weird glow in the dark, like fake, but yeah, but it wasn't even that. It was just like,

768
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,080
it was this weird can that would like shake or something. You just find these weird things.

769
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:34,040
They put like a Ghostbuster logo on it or something. And like an old trick. Yeah. Yeah.

770
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,200
Just be like Ghostbusters. Yeah. This week it's Ghostbusters. Next week it's, you know,

771
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:44,120
it's Thundercats or whatever. Right. Kids wouldn't know. Yeah. So all of my dad's friends were just

772
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:50,040
like, they were all in like, you know, this, this industry. So it's just, yeah. So we would just have

773
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:56,680
all kinds of weird stuff and weird, just like fun, like experiences growing up. It was just crazy.

774
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:02,920
They were all in the serious business of fun. Yeah. Yeah. Would you go, like when you were going

775
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:08,280
to like that, that uncle, were you like, X-Trix, like, was there one even like guy you knew,

776
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,160
were you like, this is the best one of all these? That was the guy. It was that guy.

777
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:16,040
Sully was, it was always going to see him was like always the best. Yeah. Cause it was just,

778
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,800
you never knew what there was, what you're going to find. Cause it was really just a warehouse and

779
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,960
he just let you like dig through everything. And you know, it was, it was great. And there was like,

780
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:30,280
I remember some kind of a showroom or something, but yeah, it was just, it was all just like those,

781
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:36,600
those weird, like those finger puppets or like those weird ugly faces where you'd put like,

782
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,800
you get your thumb and fingers in there and like scrunch up the faces. And it was just like,

783
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:46,920
there's just all, he had all like the wacky wall crawlers and all that, all that sticky,

784
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:52,920
like gooey stuff. Like, like the hands that would like splat. And we had, my mom would like,

785
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,800
she never wanted us, wanted me bringing that stuff home. Cause I just stick everything to the wall

786
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:03,080
and get ground into the carpet and like ruin everything. Just pick up hair. If you're not

787
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:07,080
careful with that stuff. Yeah. It was good for about two minutes. Cause you drop it, it would

788
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:14,520
just be full of lint and dust and hair. Yeah. The scourge of moms in the nineties was any number of

789
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:21,080
sticky items. Like all that goo and slime. They're so happy. The kids are so happy. I don't

790
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:29,080
want to make them sad, but also our walls are atrocious now. Every good toy line had slime.

791
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:34,120
Yeah. And I think, yeah. What was like Flo was Floam one of them in the like late 90s.

792
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:39,800
That was an yeah, like a nineties Nickelodeon. Yeah. Yeah. Did you have Gack or, or ooze or?

793
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,320
I don't remember. I don't remember which one I did. I wanted to have all of them.

794
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,680
Floam feels very familiar where it has like the, it has the little, the little like dot seeds,

795
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:54,120
like a little granules or something. Yeah. Yeah. Then it would get, it would get so disgusting when

796
00:37:54,120 --> 00:38:00,680
it just like, yeah, yeah. Just, yeah. The dried up version of it was like, like old cat shit or

797
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:06,040
something. You guys did, uh, didn't Muck Man, didn't you put ooze in him? Yeah. I don't think

798
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:11,400
I've opened the ooze still. Um, it's probably dried up by now. You think it is? It may be.

799
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:17,880
Cause we, we've done two slime toys. We did a prop replica of the mutagen canister from the

800
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,920
first movie and that came with the jar of slime. And I have that sitting on my shelf at home and

801
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,360
it's just like a hockey puck now. It's just all, it's, it's all evaporated and just whatever

802
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,200
thing is left. But yeah, Muck Man was the other one we, we gave a little, um,

803
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,120
open that slime. Yeah. Now we know, yeah, now we know the shelf life of Muck.

804
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:45,560
Yeah. They were not proper. Yeah. I have a bag of that stuff. Cause the factory, yeah, they,

805
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,720
cause the factory, we're trying to get the right color, you know, or the right consistency or

806
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:55,720
something. So the factory will just send us like five different samples. I was just here, just

807
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:00,920
label them A, B, C, D, and I'll just pick the one I like best. And I have this also, I just found

808
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:07,880
the other day under my bed, there's like a, just a rubber made tub of like toys and stuff. And there's

809
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:14,440
a bag of slime jars. They've been sitting under there since we made the Muck Man figures.

810
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,960
Oh, those were just the samples. Those are the, those are the early samples where I had to just

811
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,680
pick the one I like best. So yeah, all mucks. Yeah. There's just a whole bunch of slime.

812
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:30,360
Rejected. So there's a factory that just makes slime still. Oh yeah, probably. It was probably

813
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:36,600
a few slimes. Big there's a, you ever go to power con? There was like the, I've never been to power

814
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:45,640
con. Okay. So I had a booth there like 2019 or 2018 or something like that. And we were kind of

815
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:51,400
into, it was in a little ballroom out in Torrance, like at a Marriott or something. So I was in like

816
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,680
the overflow section out in the hallway. I had a little table set up, I was selling like this

817
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:03,080
nonsense, like artwork and everything. And like two tables over from me, there was like a girl and her

818
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:11,400
dad and their booth was called the slime pit. And she just brought like homemade slime. Oh yes. That

819
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:18,120
was huge a few years ago. Right before the pandemic. Yeah. So she came in, her and her dad,

820
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:24,520
they set up this table of slime and every, everything was sold in like an hour or something.

821
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:29,960
Yeah. They just like, they came in like just sold all their slime and then they were just, they just

822
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:35,000
kind of hung it up and just walked her in. Like just, it was this little girl, she just made it

823
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,760
like a killing it. Like the family slime business. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. What can I, if I keep asking

824
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:45,560
questions, are we going to get down to some weird place? Like what is, what do people like slime?

825
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:50,920
What's the appeal? I think it was the same appeal as when it was big when, when like we were kids,

826
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:57,560
but I had a science teacher for a few years in elementary school and she, that was how she got

827
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:03,800
kids interested in science. She'd be like, who died in cornstarch and like everyone get a beaker

828
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:09,880
of water and you could just make slime. Right. It was like incredibly simple. Yeah. I guess I did

829
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,680
make it. I think I, I, even though I had it, I think I was maybe like, it felt messy to me

830
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:20,520
and maybe I didn't like. Oh, you're right. I was not. Yeah. Yeah. Like finger painting and

831
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:27,160
I didn't like any of that stuff when I was a kid. Yeah. Scott's slime pro. Pro. I feel like I liked

832
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:34,680
the idea of it more than the, than the messy reality. Like being slimed would scare me. Yeah.

833
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,840
Yeah. Or what, what, uh, you can't, did you watch, you can't do or no, not yet. Well, that's what

834
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:43,560
it's like, but, um, what would you do? Which is the game show on Nickelodeon that Mark Summers

835
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:49,080
hosted. Oh, double dare. No, no, this was the other game show. There's this other one where it was

836
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:54,200
just like, I, what is it? I don't know. Lots of excuses for slime and pies. Can we like reduce,

837
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,840
let's get those questions out of there. Just make it a big nightmare. Just being on one of those

838
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:04,520
shows where you're just like diving into a pit of like goo. I still kind of want it. I would do that.

839
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:09,800
I would do it now. But as a kid, I was like the idea of being messy in public. I didn't like that

840
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:19,000
at all. I had one thing of GAC that again was me, like as a kid, I knew I had seen so many

841
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,440
commercials for like the Chuck E. Cheese GAC tie in where you could, if you went to Chuck E. Cheese

842
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:30,360
and you got enough, you spent so much for enough tokens, you get a three free miniature thing of

843
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:41,080
GAC that smelled like pizza and we got it home and I was just so excited and my mom opened it up and

844
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:47,160
it was the most overwhelming garlic smell I've ever smelled in my life. And she's like, I'm sorry.

845
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:54,680
No, I can't. We're not. And she's like, I'm sorry. You won a lot of toys today. So you didn't come

846
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,040
home at the end of it, but like these have to go in the garbage because-

847
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,800
And you watched it be thrown away.

848
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:07,320
I could tell. Her side of the fact, like my grandfather, he hated garlic and he passed it

849
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,320
on to his kids. The hatred of garlic?

850
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:15,400
The hatred and smell of, taste of garlic, smell of garlic. So that you open this thing of GAC

851
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,960
and it smelled like garlic. I was like, oh no.

852
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:24,280
Also Chuck E. Cheese garlic is beyond, you know, it's not like fresh from the old country or

853
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:24,680
something. Yeah.

854
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,120
You may appreciate that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

855
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:30,600
At a nice restaurant, but I'm sure, I mean, cause that Chuck E. Cheese smell that that-

856
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:37,080
Oh, I didn't particularly like it either, but no, this was unopened Virgin GAC, promo GAC.

857
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:41,240
We gotta see if we can find a vintage sample of this and bring it back to life.

858
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:41,480
Yeah.

859
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,880
Of your Chuck E. Cheese GAC for Jason.

860
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,600
Mike, you were correct that if we kept talking about this, we'd get to something weird,

861
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,040
which is the phrase Virgin GAC.

862
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,120
It did. It was bound to happen.

863
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:57,480
Sure. Untouched GAC. I mean, who knows how long it had been there? Who knows how long

864
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,360
like it had been sitting around, but like, yeah, as soon as I smelled garlic, I was like, oh no.

865
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,320
Like I knew this was not- Dreams are crushed.

866
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:09,640
Dreams are crushed. Had not made an attempt to get GAC before this.

867
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:15,160
Maybe that's a side hustle for you is selling garlic GAC, garlic slime.

868
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,360
Maybe. Yeah.

869
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,200
I think I could, I think I could figure it out.

870
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,400
I think- With the smell, you can make it imbued with,

871
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,640
I mean, you just gotta keep it in a room, I guess.

872
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:29,800
I think the thing to do would be get that frozen cubes, you know, of like basil and garlic.

873
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,560
And you mix that in the slime.

874
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:35,720
Yeah.

875
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,720
Does he have to do this? Did you, okay. Do you, how much does Mike need it to happen

876
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,280
and how much does Jason actually want it to happen?

877
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,640
Well, you just saw how excited he was. He looked so happy.

878
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,840
I got kind of excited, yeah. Thinking about Jason selling garlic slime

879
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,480
at some convention somewhere. I think I really just like the idea of Jason with a little table

880
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,320
selling slime in general. Step right up, step right up.

881
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,560
Yeah. You could wear like the old timey outfit.

882
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,080
The barker. Yeah. Yeah.

883
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:05,000
The smelliest slime in town. And the straw hat and everything.

884
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:11,320
So how many times a week are you at Canada's Wonderland as a kid?

885
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,440
Oh, yeah. I wish I had kept a diary or some journal.

886
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:19,720
Yeah. It was, I know my dad said every birthday we were there.

887
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,280
Sure. And I think it was,

888
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:27,000
I remember my mom saying there were just days in the summer where if there was just,

889
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:31,320
everyone was bored, there was nothing to do. She'd just like pack us in the car and just

890
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,560
drive to Wonderland. We'd just run around.

891
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:37,720
So yeah, I just remember just always being there.

892
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,640
This is Toronto by the way. It's right outside of, yeah,

893
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:47,080
it's right outside north of Toronto. Which seems like, look, I soak up a lot of this.

894
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:51,320
I am not from Canada, but I'm jealous of people from Canada. I watch so much like,

895
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,440
do you watch that retro Ontario? It's a great channel. Yeah. Oh yeah.

896
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:01,560
Retro Ontario. That is a real, that is a true like just a blast from the past,

897
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:08,360
like watching old city TV clips and just all the weird random stuff that come.

898
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,240
Sometimes it's frustrating though, because they'll just have a clip of something.

899
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,640
Cause we'll just turn that on a night and start watching it. And

900
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:22,520
some weird thing will just pop on and then it cuts to the next thing. And I'm just like,

901
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:27,080
God damn it. I want to watch the entire, I just want to see the whole episode of,

902
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:34,200
there was like a grandpa rental thing on a, they had like a, it's not like a news show,

903
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,800
but it was some sort of like, there were people sitting in this room

904
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,360
talking about like the day's events and then they would have like guests on.

905
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:50,680
And I swear this happened. I know it was late at night, but like I'm watching this thing and they

906
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:55,640
brought on like a little boy and there was like this old man and there was like some sort of

907
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:03,400
service somewhere in Toronto or part of Ontario where like if your grandparents had like died or

908
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:08,920
they weren't around, like there was like a, it was almost like a, like not like a nanny or a,

909
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:14,280
you know, like a babysitter thing, but it was just specifically to go hang out with like old people

910
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:20,760
for the day. You could call a number and they would just send you a grandpa. And then it just

911
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:25,720
cuts. And then it goes to some other, like there's a guy reviewing movies or they're talking about

912
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:31,320
some other weird, there's like a parade for something. And I'm like, we got to finish this

913
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:35,720
grandpa story. Like, yeah. Oh my God. Did you find something? Is this the thing? Wait a minute. No,

914
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:40,200
this is, okay. I looked up grandpa rentals, restaurant, Ontario, and I'm, I found an ad.

915
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:44,920
I really excited because I found an ad with Ed Asner and suddenly I'm like, is Ed Asner the

916
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:50,680
spokesman for grandpa rentals, but it's something else called Granada rentals. It was kind of

917
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:56,280
a, did you mean he's like taking you into it? Like maybe a TV rentals, a movie rental store.

918
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:01,400
Cause if I was like, did I just find the greatest clip in history and Asner on behalf of do you

919
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:09,720
need a grandpa? But you don't want one long-term, you need a short term hang with a grandpa.

920
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:13,080
Don't have the money required to permanently buy a grandpa.

921
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:19,880
Well, we got to keep looking for that. Yeah. Yeah. I would like to, oh yeah. Yeah. Retro Ontario is,

922
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:27,080
that's a good channel. And the kids shows were you guys had Bowser on recently, right? And like

923
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:35,160
the Canadian kids shows like Mr. Dress Up and Fred Penner and like, they were so great. Yeah.

924
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:39,320
Sharon Lewis and Bram, Canadian. They were pretty Canadian. Yeah. Cause I had seen them

925
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:44,920
at Canada's wonderland. They had like an amphitheater. I was actually, I have one of

926
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:50,360
Bowser's shirts. There's a Sharon Lewis and Bram like concert t-shirt that he just made.

927
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:57,000
So I was wearing that at some other, there was like a banjo festival just like a week or two ago.

928
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:03,640
Sure. So I'm wearing my Sharon Lewis and Bram shirt waiting in line to buy some like barbecue

929
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:08,200
and some old guy comes walking over and he's just staring at like, he's like,

930
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:13,320
what is that shirt? And he's like, what year did you see them? I said, I don't know. I was like,

931
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,960
it's Bowser's shirt. You know, it's like maybe it was from the eighties. And this guy told me that

932
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:24,600
when his daughter got married, their first dance is like, was the Skinner Marinky Dinky Dinky.

933
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:29,080
The elephant song. Yeah. The elephant song. And this guy and his wife were just,

934
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:33,800
Bowser's shirt just brought so much joy to the banjo and fiddle festival. Oh my God.

935
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:38,600
I guess that, you know what? That's shocking, but also at the banjo festival, it just feels right.

936
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:44,680
Yeah. Yeah. It was great. Like a very low key. Did you watch the elephant show? Yeah. Yeah.

937
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,080
Was that Nickelodeon, I think, when we were kids? Yeah, it could have been.

938
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:53,800
It makes so much sense to me. Like, as a kid, I was like, so there's so many hours of shows made

939
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:59,080
just for us kids. How do they find the time? And then realizing, oh, a lot of it is repurposed

940
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:07,640
Canadian. Yeah. And especially if it's like very, you know, sweater and beard and brown, then you

941
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:13,080
know it's probably a Canadian export, which I liked anything like that. Very childhood affinity

942
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:17,000
for sure. For just like the calmness of the Canadian programming. Do you guys remember

943
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:23,080
Size Small? You ever seen that? No. That sounds so familiar. There's a guy, there's a giant record,

944
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:29,640
his name's Friend Record. It's like a human sized vinyl record. Nanthropomorphic record. Yeah. Oh,

945
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:36,280
Size Small is scary. Size Small is a crazy one. But yeah, Friend Record would come out and he'd

946
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:41,240
tap some, the spoons were named Tip and Tap and they would like, they'd sing some songs. But it

947
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:46,840
was a guy like in a black leotard that sort of like stepped through a record and then it was just

948
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:52,920
like a big smiling face and stuff. Kind of scary. I think just like the- Freaky. This big round shape

949
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:57,960
was kind of a blunt smile. And then he, Friend Record had a cousin named like Cousin Wagon Wheel

950
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:03,000
or something and they kind of repurposed the costume into a giant like wagon wheel. Wow.

951
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,960
And so this was too weird for Nickelodeon to buy the rights to show it? Yeah. They might have passed

952
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:14,280
on that one. But it was totally fine for Canada. They showed it in Ontario and like Manitoba and

953
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:20,440
everywhere. Let me ask something I can't now not ask about, and it ties into Canada's Wonderland.

954
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:25,720
Did you grow up with the show The Littlest Hobo? Well, we've got, we may have a clip or two.

955
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:30,360
Oh, okay. Good. Oh, really? Good. Good. Good. All right. All right. Well, thank God. I was

956
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:36,040
disappointed in myself. I didn't have them. Yes. Is now a good time. I mean, I guess you brought it

957
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:42,040
up. Wait, wait, sorry. What was your answer to that? Yeah. Who doesn't like The Littlest Hobo?

958
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:48,360
I did. Well, did you know? I heard it, I think, but I didn't know what it was until Trevor brought

959
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:53,240
it to my attention. About five years, 10 years ago, I learned about The Littlest Hobo. That's about

960
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:57,560
when I did too. Yeah. I had this big phase like seven, eight years ago. I think after I did a

961
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:04,200
trip to Toronto and enjoyed it so much and just wanted to soak up more Canadian stuff. You talk

962
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:11,800
about early 80s, pleasant Canadian aesthetic. This show, oh my God, had such a calming effect on me

963
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:17,000
for a while, just eating up these YouTube versions. The Littlest Hobo, for anyone who doesn't know,

964
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:25,960
was a show about the most trusty dog there could ever be, just a good, good dog. Very good dog,

965
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:36,040
who goes from town to town, encounters strangers, susses out the problems in their life

966
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:42,040
and with each other, fixes the problems by moving various objects around with his mouth,

967
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:47,080
solves everything that's going on in this family or this town or whatever,

968
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:52,440
real quick. Then it enters everybody's mind, this dog has been such a great presence in our lives,

969
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:58,200
maybe the dog should stay. Then there's always someone who knows, like, no, this dog just keeps

970
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:04,440
moving on because the dog is The Littlest Hobo and a hobo doesn't stick around. The hobo gets on the

971
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:11,800
train and keeps riding to the next spot where he's needed again. Six seasons. Wow. Of the 70s,

972
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:17,720
there was a 60s version I read. Oh, really? Two seasons for the 60s versions and six seasons for

973
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:23,560
the 1979 version. Yeah. Can I ask, we don't have this unless you said- Well, I have three clips

974
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:27,240
from an episode that I think you're probably talking about. Yeah, but now I'm like, I need the

975
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:31,400
song. Oh, I have it. Brett, you have the intro song? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Mike, thank you. You have-

976
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:36,840
Because I knew when we talked, heard Littlest Hobo, this is something, this is red meat for us.

977
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:44,040
Yeah, yeah, I can't. Littlest is a thing we like, hobo is a thing we like. The dog is a hobo. The

978
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:49,240
dog being a hobo, this is red. Yeah. And then this song is the, I might throw this in the

979
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:55,880
discussion of best theme song of all time. Yeah, Brett, it's hobo one is the clip. Oh, thank you,

980
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:01,560
Mike. It was my insecurity today. I feel like I'm prepared for the episode, but I didn't bother to

981
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:05,880
clip the Littlest Hobo theme. No, it's okay. Thank Trevor for this. Oh, good. Okay, well, yes. He's

982
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,200
the one who sent it to me. Oh, you're welcome. Oh, you're welcome. Okay, okay. Fascinating you know

983
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:16,520
this. I had such a big Littlest Hobo phase that I'm so fond of. I think we'll play it and we'll

984
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,400
edit it if it's not. I think we're good. Oh.

985
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,400
Starring London the dog. I love you, London.

986
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:48,120
Maybe tomorrow I'll want to settle down until tomorrow. Balloons and then pleasant shots of

987
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:54,840
the dog. The background horns there. Wonderful orchestration. Just grab your hat and we'll travel.

988
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:59,800
The light that's hobo style. Maybe tomorrow I'll want to settle down. And is this the one that has,

989
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,680
he's holding a rifle in his mouth. Oh, like a big gun. A big gun with a strap. The dog is running

990
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:12,600
with a rifle in its mouth as a party. Wow. There's so much to like about that. It's like smoking a

991
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:19,640
bunch of cigarettes. I don't, yes, a ton to like, can I also just say that this is how deep the

992
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:25,400
phase went that I had a tradition for a while of giving my wife birthday presents that were like

993
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:33,400
little custom videos of our cat at the time, Beanie, RIP Beanie. We love Beanie. And I recreated that

994
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:44,600
intro with the black squares and the yellow font with our cat. And with new lyrics based on our cat,

995
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:50,520
including I got a little like 99 cent store, little toy gun and tried to prop it up next to

996
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:56,760
the cat's mouth as best as I could. It was not happening. Did not take, but I tried. Yeah. Love

997
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:04,440
Lola Sobo. Wow. That's incredible. But you brought it up presumably because of the tie into Canada's

998
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:09,240
wonderland. Yeah. We actually go back to, sorry, we'll go back to the clip and play it after that

999
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:15,000
because I have some clips of the him going to the park. So, okay. Yeah. No, no. Yeah. I,

1000
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:21,960
my girlfriend and I, we were, we went down some rabbit's hole of like, just like weird,

1001
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:26,440
like Canada's wonderland stuff a couple of years ago, or maybe that's when we found like retro

1002
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:33,240
Ontario and I don't know. We were just, she's also fascinated just Canada stuff. And not from Canada.

1003
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:39,480
She's not, no, she's from here. Wow. Wow. Yeah. And just like weird, just, she's just fascinated

1004
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:45,400
by all this stuff. So yeah, we found this, this Canada's wonderland episode of the littlest hobo.

1005
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:52,840
And again, she just got sucked into this. It was just so strange. And it's like the whole episode

1006
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:58,520
is kind of, it's just so bizarre, you know, cause it's like the day before the park is opening and,

1007
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:04,920
and there's just no one in there, but this lady that's like has amnesia. And then she's very

1008
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:11,080
troubled. She like, she was in a car accident, scrambled her brain up and she knows enough

1009
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:15,800
people, there's enough awareness that she is not just an employee of Canada's wonderland, but like

1010
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:21,080
the employee misses wonderland or something. Yeah. Yeah. They can't open without her without her.

1011
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:26,280
Cause then once, once it's the day before, so it's like, they need her so badly. Yes. This

1012
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,040
cannot happen without her. Brett, just play that, play it right here from here. Cause this is like,

1013
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,080
the littlest hobo going into the park again, like at the start, I haven't seen a lot of little

1014
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:39,320
less hobo now, but this would be like the setup to, yeah, this is where little less hobo just sort

1015
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:44,920
of wanders up to the front gate. There's no one there. Right. One security guard and he's like,

1016
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:52,680
what are you doing here? Little hobo? And the little, this is like this little hobo would sense

1017
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:58,520
something was wrong and then he was needed. He gets it so fast, walks up to three people, figures

1018
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:03,000
out the problem in their lives. See how alert he is. He knows he just knows something's happening.

1019
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:09,800
And this is the entrance to Candice Wonderland that you remember. No, I don't remember this

1020
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:15,880
cause we always took the employee entrance. So like seeing the front gate is bizarre cause I just,

1021
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:21,240
like we never went in that way. So you didn't get to walk in the paw prints of the littlest

1022
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:29,000
hobo. Oh, I wish I could have. That sign, that lovely like rounded orange to yellow gradient

1023
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:35,400
so eighties. Yeah. So we have a couple more clips too. So yeah, you really get a good view of the

1024
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:40,120
park in a lot of different angles here. Yeah. Empty. It's a weird, I'm curious when they film,

1025
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:45,880
if this genuinely was before the park opened or did they like carve out a day and create a retroactive

1026
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:51,320
plot set before the park opened? I wonder what the air date of this episode was. I don't know

1027
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:56,040
the episode is the show is definitely on. It might've premiered in like this is one thing I

1028
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,880
asked my dad about. I was like, do you remember like this littlest hobo show? He's like, oh yeah,

1029
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:04,600
sure. Well, they filmed the whole episode of Wonderland. He goes, I don't know. Wow.

1030
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,360
No memory of this at all. Cause it seems like it would have been a big deal cause they have like

1031
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,920
cast members like going on the, you know, they have to set up cameras and like,

1032
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:18,280
they're filming all over the park. So they almost, they invent like a new, we have watched so much

1033
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:24,760
sitcom and TV show episodes, killing time at theme parks. It's some of our favorite where you don't

1034
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:30,040
have to worry about any of this meat, any of this story nonsense. You can just watch your friends go

1035
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:37,000
on rides and yell and laugh. But this is a rare episode where they find a new way to contextualize

1036
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,800
just a character going on a roller coaster because she has amnesia and she's flashing back to a bad

1037
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:46,920
car accident that just happened. So she gets on a roller coaster and then forgets why she got on it.

1038
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:53,160
And then she's like having an episode on the coaster. It's a horrible thing for her. Oh,

1039
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:57,720
it's bigger flashback to the car. Like usually it's not used for horror. Yeah. No, it's fun.

1040
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:02,840
It should be like inviting. It should be a good ad for the place. It's also strange that yes,

1041
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:08,200
this like, it's a big episode of this pleasant show set in a theme park where a woman's having

1042
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:13,000
manic episodes and where like, let's just say one thing we haven't said about Canada's wonderland,

1043
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:20,520
kind of their castle essentially is like a big fake rock mountain. Yeah. Wonder mountain.

1044
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:28,040
Okay. That looks fantastic. And they had cliff divers, which is sort of revealed in this episode.

1045
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:33,080
But part of her forgetting who she is or what's happening, she just kind of like starts climbing

1046
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:38,440
instinctually. Yeah. There's something leads her up that path to the top of the mountain.

1047
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:42,840
Yeah. For no reason. She's just walking up to it and then like teetering on the edge,

1048
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:46,520
which you're of course getting. I mean, some of it is just confusion, but you're certainly like,

1049
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:52,520
you're dancing on a suicide plot or that she might hurt herself somehow. And it's so funny.

1050
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:57,800
The theme park would go, yeah, this woman is having a, just a mental breakdown and might

1051
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:02,600
kill herself on our big famous cliff. Yeah. You would think they would just not have shown

1052
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:06,760
Canada's wonderland. Yeah. They would have called it something else. It would film there, but not,

1053
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:15,480
not like their logo proudly in the very first shot of the. Let's just real quick. Just hobo two

1054
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:21,880
clip brats, please. If you would. You know, a major head trauma. You usually want to avoid

1055
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:32,120
mountains, massive heights, a roller coaster. Oh, absolutely. So this is a clip of the littlest hobo

1056
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:36,840
sort of learning about this lady and her struggles. And then he helps her out. He makes an attempt to

1057
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:42,600
help her out here. So yeah, whenever you're ready. I don't seem to have a purse. He doesn't know

1058
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:48,520
where her purse is. And then we cut to. Where's my purse? We cut to a doctor's office.

1059
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:58,920
They have her purse at the doctor's office. Diabetic. I'm a severe one. I don't think she'll

1060
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:05,080
get very far without this. Concussion, severe diabetes and probable amnesia. In her state,

1061
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:08,680
there's no telling what she'd do. If she can't remember who she is, she's not going to remember

1062
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:14,200
she's a diabetic. You better call a personal physician, Dr. Klein, and find out what time

1063
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:18,040
of day she normally takes her injection and where she works. You got it? Yes, doctor.

1064
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:23,240
Stakes are high. Well, how does she feel about roller coasters?

1065
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:32,040
The little hobo knows this kind. He knows that she's diabetic somehow. He can sense it. Yeah.

1066
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:37,000
He doesn't have that doctor's information. Yeah. He might've read her chart. He's, you know,

1067
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,080
resourceful. Yeah. He might've checked on her before he even showed up here.

1068
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:44,520
It's possible it's practical and he just can smell the blood sugar level. Oh, yeah. And he

1069
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:49,160
knows that way. That could be. And now some real like muppets of construction workers.

1070
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:53,000
With their lunch pails. A pails and a hits. Yeah. So little

1071
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,040
fellow steals a sandwich from one of them. Oh, you want me to chase you now, huh?

1072
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:03,240
Forget it. I don't even like bologna and mayonnaise. Enjoy it. That's a very Canadian

1073
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:08,280
construction worker. He's not at all angry about the sandwich. He's happy. Yeah. He's happy. Oh,

1074
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,800
you think you can take my sandwich? Do you? Okay. Well, I hope you enjoy it.

1075
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:16,040
Give it a better home than I would have. Thanks for taking it from me.

1076
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:22,600
So then he walks and he feed the woman is gone. The whole water. Scope of that. Waterfall.

1077
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:26,360
Yeah. You see great shots of this. We can post some of this. You'll see shots of this part.

1078
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:31,480
Oh, this is great. It cuts off here, unfortunately, but then there's a bunch of pirates in a lake.

1079
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:36,520
Yeah. So you see, yeah, shots of the rides running. There's a dragon breathing fire.

1080
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:46,520
Everything at this theme park is triggering this woman. The dragon breathing fire is making her

1081
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:52,200
lose her mind. She's teetering on death because of all the fun stuff you can do. Right. Canada's

1082
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:58,440
Wonderland. So Trevor, you've been on all these rides, I assume? I saw a lot of them. The crazy

1083
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:04,360
thing is I was terrified of all these. Oh, really? My mom and I would just sit on the bench and watch

1084
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:10,360
them. My dad and my little sister would go on roller coasters. I was terrified. The bumper cars

1085
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:17,640
were fun. The little kid rides were mostly okay, but yeah, I was terrified of roller coaster until,

1086
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:25,560
boy, it was junior high school or something. I went on an actual roller coaster for the first

1087
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:32,440
time. But yeah, all these rides, the Ghoster coaster was the little kid Scooby Doo roller

1088
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:41,720
coaster and it was just too terrifying. It's a heavy duty coaster park to this day. I feel

1089
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:47,960
lame for how long I was scared of Space Mountain, which is a little dopey compared to, I mean,

1090
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:54,440
there's heavy duty coasters if you guys want to. In the 90s, they got a really cool one. There's

1091
01:04:54,440 --> 01:05:03,000
a Top Gun ride where your feet dangle. It's the tracks above your head. That one's got really

1092
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:10,280
tight corkscrews and loops and it's just crazy fast. That one I did go on eventually. That was

1093
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:16,680
a great ride. It's a little bit like the Raptor at Cedar Point. I don't know if you know Cedar Point

1094
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:23,400
too well. We have never covered Cedar Point. It's a big one. We're also not. Jason's the most brave

1095
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:28,040
of the three of us. We really all started out scared, a little scared, even though we're

1096
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:32,200
doing a theme park podcast and you would think we should be guys that go on everything.

1097
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:41,480
Yeah. The current count of this park is 18 coasters. It's only behind Six Flags Magic Mountain.

1098
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:47,720
That thing really ranks it in terms of number of coasters. I forget whether that's North America

1099
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:53,080
or worldwide, but this park has both a hyper coaster and a giga coaster.

1100
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,080
Oh, really? What are those?

1101
01:05:55,080 --> 01:06:01,480
A behemoth is the hyper coaster and then I think Leviathan opened. Only a few years later,

1102
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:06,600
this park has a behemoth and a Leviathan. That is the giga coaster.

1103
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:11,960
What is a giga coaster? I think it is however many hundred

1104
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:20,360
feet that initial drop is. I think hyper is 200 feet or thereabouts and giga coaster is maybe

1105
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:25,000
300 feet. Between 300 and 399 is giga. Oh my God.

1106
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:31,720
Yeah. This park has a very detailed YouTube channel where they put a high definition camera on

1107
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:35,400
every coaster. To do the POV stuff?

1108
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:45,560
Like you can sit and add a big TV and it is disorienting. Especially Leviathan is so large,

1109
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:52,040
it is unnerving to watch on a big television, but cool too.

1110
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:56,040
Sure. When you would go in real quick, the employee entrance,

1111
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:00,200
you would know the people working or did you have a pass of some kind?

1112
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:05,560
I do not remember us having a... That is the weird thing. I do not remember ever having a pass or a

1113
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:12,440
badge. My mom might have, but I do remember there is probably times where I was being a little brat

1114
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:20,600
and there would be a security person or someone just kind of... Because there was a fence or this

1115
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:27,080
wall with a little slit behind it and then another little fake wall and you just kind of

1116
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:30,680
sneak through there and then it would go into the back where the office is and the

1117
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:36,840
employee parking lot and everything was. But you just go around there and it is obviously

1118
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:41,880
restricted access and stuff, but we would just run in and out of there all the time. Because my

1119
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:47,160
dad's office was in the building behind there. But I am sure there were people that were like,

1120
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:53,240
hey kid, come back here. There were people try to stop us. But I think we were always...

1121
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:58,520
I do not know. I think my mom or someone was always around where they would let us go.

1122
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:01,160
Also, if it is Canadian security guards, then probably.

1123
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,840
Yeah. It was like that guy in the thing.

1124
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:07,640
It was like the guy. He was just, ah. He goes, I hope you enjoy the employee lot.

1125
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:13,960
Hope you have a good reason to be back there. No need to tell it to me. Just know it in your

1126
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,400
own heart. Yeah, exactly.

1127
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:19,720
I do like the idea that it would just be like everybody knows everybody. So it is like folks

1128
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,320
say, oh, you are back. Hey, good to see you.

1129
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:30,520
It was definitely a little folksy. There was like when we were in the office where my dad worked,

1130
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:36,280
I remember the lower... They were on the second floor maybe and underneath was like,

1131
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:43,240
it was where they were doing all the baking and stuff for all the restaurants. And there was like

1132
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:50,200
the head chef guy was always... We would go down there. I think his name was like Pat. But

1133
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:56,600
we would go down there and there would always be some giant cookie or like all this stuff. They

1134
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:01,160
would just see us and they would just give us all this stuff.

1135
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,720
Wow. Little street urchins.

1136
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:07,960
The dream. You were the littlest hobos.

1137
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,280
Yeah, I took over for the dog. Getting scraps from

1138
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:13,720
them. Stealing baloney sandwiches.

1139
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:17,480
What ages were you from when your dad started to when he was not?

1140
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:27,240
I was like from one to 10 or zero to nine or something. We moved to Ohio in like

1141
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:32,520
1990 or 91 maybe. So yeah, it was all through the 80s we were there.

1142
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:36,360
Wow. Seemed like the time to be there too from...

1143
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:39,800
It was like we were there before Paramount bought it.

1144
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:45,960
Yeah. I was going to ask because as a kid I knew about Canada's Wonderland because my family

1145
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:52,920
regularly went to King's Dominion in Virginia and they're like sister parks. And they did the full

1146
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:59,240
owned by Taft Broadcasting and that's when you had Hanna Barbera and the Smurfs.

1147
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:05,480
And then Paramount comes in in the mid 90s and that definitely elevated those parks in our

1148
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:10,600
in my mind. I think my family's mind too because we're like yeah, Paramount movie studio like

1149
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:16,760
Disney and Universal and MGM. And so like Yogi Bear would still be around, but there would

1150
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:23,960
suddenly be Nickelodeon stuff and like Wayne's World or like the days of thunder sim. I love

1151
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:31,800
the days of thunder motion simulator ride. And then for very briefly a Richard Scary restaurant.

1152
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:34,360
Oh, really? I missed that. Really?

1153
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,000
In this one or in King's Dominion? In King's Dominion.

1154
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:44,280
I think Nickelodeon had the cartoon for a number of years. So I think by that way,

1155
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:49,880
the Paramount connection. It seemed to me, I watched like a compilation of ads and they

1156
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:56,280
seemed to assert, it seemed like one thing they were pushing is if you go to this Paramount-owned

1157
01:10:56,280 --> 01:11:00,760
theme park and you get on a roller coaster, there might be a Klingon sitting next to you.

1158
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:05,960
Oh yeah, that was in those. Do you remember that really? Did that hit you like,

1159
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:08,920
I want to do that. I want to go on a ride with a Klingon.

1160
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:16,200
So I remember going back to visit in the 90s and the one thing I regret now more than ever was not

1161
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:20,440
seeing, I didn't see any Klingons on any of the roller, like Top Gun or any of those rides,

1162
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:28,200
which was a bummer, but not going to see the Star Trek on ice, like figure skating show.

1163
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,160
Oh wow. That's like a huge,

1164
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:36,200
huge regret that I wish I had appreciated that back then.

1165
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,800
Yeah, that's insane. I have a clip called Star Trek Ice.

1166
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Did we ever talk about this in any of this? We mentioned that it's come up, but we haven't

1167
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,240
done a lot. Because I saw it. I saw the one in King's Dominion.

1168
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:54,440
How was it? It was cool. I mean, it was people ice skating and like-

1169
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:59,640
It doesn't make a lot of sense for Star Trek, but it does look kind of cool.

1170
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,880
It looks cool. It's that we got here.

1171
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:05,560
It looks like the Thor in Star Wars. Yeah, it's kind of-

1172
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:08,920
More than it does Star Trek. Yeah, a little, especially with that window.

1173
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:12,360
But it could be a Klingon thing or something. That's true. Yeah, you're right. It could be

1174
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:18,440
a different. Yeah, so play this at the start whenever, just a little taste of what it-

1175
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:24,360
So they're playing the iconic Star Trek theme. They got that much right.

1176
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:28,200
Which is, yeah, you need that. This could be on the holodeck or something.

1177
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:34,440
Oh, that's true too. And it's basically like you would imagine people in Star Trek outfits

1178
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:38,920
just twirling around and doing all the things you do as an ice skater.

1179
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:41,880
Yeah, heavy on the fog. Lots of fog.

1180
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:47,640
Yeah. Is it imagining that there's an enterprise with an ice floor?

1181
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:53,000
Is that the idea here? Well, after this, and I don't have a clip of it, but after this,

1182
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,560
they switch to a very dark people flying portion of it.

1183
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,600
Where it seems like they're representing the stars.

1184
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,920
Each one of them is an M-class planet or something.

1185
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,440
Yeah. They switch from crew members to planets.

1186
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:11,560
Yeah. They kind of abandon a traditional narrative right away.

1187
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:16,120
And they go into something that's maybe more just ethereal sort of feeling.

1188
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,760
Abstract kind of. This is a daring show.

1189
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:23,320
Must have won awards, I'd imagine. Won Tonys, I think.

1190
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:27,880
We haven't done, I guess we haven't done, we've kind of a couple, we did the ice,

1191
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,760
the Mario on ice a couple of months ago.

1192
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:33,080
As we determined, there's more with ice capades.

1193
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,080
Ice capades in general we need to do more of too.

1194
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:38,600
I saw Ewoks on ice when I was a kid. I don't even know that one.

1195
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:42,360
Ewoks ice? Yeah, that was somewhere in Toronto.

1196
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,880
Really? Yeah, probably in like 85 or 86 maybe.

1197
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:50,760
Was it, did it feel like Return of the Jedi or was it more cartoon-y?

1198
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,960
Oh, this was like cartoon. Oh, here I see a TV ad.

1199
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,960
Oh yeah, there's a little. Oh wow.

1200
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:58,680
Oh, this looks good. We might have to do this.

1201
01:13:58,680 --> 01:13:59,720
Yeah, we do have to do that.

1202
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:04,440
The suits look good. Yeah, there was, they had all kinds of

1203
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,840
like those crazy ice shows back in the day.

1204
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,520
Like everything was an ice show.

1205
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:13,640
I don't want to go giving you more toy ideas, but ice skating Ewoks.

1206
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,000
Oh yeah, I know.

1207
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:18,360
Well that's, they just, what, Hasbro's doing some new Ewoks

1208
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,720
that are a little more cartoon-y I feel like.

1209
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:24,840
I think they just showed a few things that are like kind of like the Ewoks cartoon or droids.

1210
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,760
They've done, yeah, they've done a few things.

1211
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:33,480
Like there's a Boba Fett I think that's like either from like the droids episode

1212
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:35,960
or like the holiday special episode maybe.

1213
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:36,460
Oh cool.

1214
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:39,480
Real quick, real quick back to the turtles.

1215
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:43,960
What's happened now is that you guys have ruined me for other toy lines in the sense that like

1216
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:48,600
X-Men buying X-Men, I'm like, well I would like an X-Men in the style of Joe Manavarro.

1217
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,840
I would like X-Men in the style of this.

1218
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:54,360
So now I'm ruined forever because of the turtles.

1219
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:59,480
Yeah, yeah, there's two ways to kind of design those toy lines, you know, where it's,

1220
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:06,280
you can do kind of like a, I don't know, like just a generic looking version of like the characters

1221
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:09,640
or you can kind of go like source material specific.

1222
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:17,560
And like companies like DC Direct, they would do these like, you know, Darwin Cook figures

1223
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,880
or like Jack Kirby, like New God stuff.

1224
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:25,800
And I just always loved when like you'd get like a, you know, Jim Lee Batman or something.

1225
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:31,720
So yeah, it was, that'd be great to get some really cool like Joe Mad X-Men or.

1226
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,440
Yes, because they kind of did it in like old toy biz.

1227
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:35,640
I have a few of them back in the day.

1228
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,160
They were certainly inspired by him.

1229
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:37,880
Yeah, there was a few.

1230
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:43,480
Yeah, one of my favorite Green Goblins is based on the Humberto Ramos drawings.

1231
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,080
Yes, I remember this.

1232
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:47,080
Yeah, that was toy biz like way back.

1233
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:51,480
They did a couple, there was like Storm with the big hair and like the two-piece outfit.

1234
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:57,480
Yeah, there was like that monster series where like they had kind of like clip-on,

1235
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:00,120
like mutant armor, like kind of monster pieces.

1236
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:00,920
I remember that.

1237
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:05,880
Those were definitely more, you know, artist specific like sculpts.

1238
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,080
That's very cool.

1239
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:11,720
We've talked before on the show about like, because I kind of feel like collector wise,

1240
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:16,040
there is something that if they were made, everybody would become like a completist.

1241
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:18,520
I'm not fully complete with Turtles, but I'm close.

1242
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:22,360
Like Scott, we think we figured out that if it was like 80s architecture,

1243
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:25,880
if people recreated like 80s shopping malls or office buildings.

1244
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:28,360
Yeah, well, and I'll bring Toronto into it.

1245
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:34,360
If I could get a really well done Eaton Center or CN Tower or Sky Dome,

1246
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,280
I would gladly.

1247
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:38,200
Just like a play set or something or what?

1248
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,760
Yeah, no, they're just like a little model.

1249
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,040
I think a little model.

1250
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,360
I would take almost any size.

1251
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:49,800
Yeah, I'm trying to, I mean, of course I would love a Technodrome size.

1252
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:50,280
Yeah, yeah.

1253
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:51,880
But I'll take whatever.

1254
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:56,360
What's the other play, the CNE, like the Expo Center or something?

1255
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:56,840
What is that?

1256
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:00,040
That's somewhere in, I think it's around Toronto.

1257
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:04,040
They would have like Maple Leaf Wrestling and there's, it was an,

1258
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,760
an arena or a convention center more so.

1259
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:10,600
It's more like a, yeah, like I think it's an outdoor convention center place.

1260
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:11,160
Okay.

1261
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:14,920
But I think it's right around where like Sky Dome and.

1262
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:15,400
Oh, is it?

1263
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,080
It's in that sort of, yeah.

1264
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:17,720
I don't know.

1265
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:23,320
If I could get a Sky Dome with a retractable roof, which again, that's like,

1266
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:27,640
have you ever seen the opening of the Sky Dome with Alan Thicke?

1267
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,720
Oh, with Alan, oh my God, with Alan Thicke, no.

1268
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:30,680
It's another Alan Thicke.

1269
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:33,720
I was going to say, yeah, like I'd been to Blue Jays games and stuff, but.

1270
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:34,760
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1271
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,680
But I didn't, I wasn't there with Alan Thicke.

1272
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:40,360
I mean, the first opening of this guy, the first time they ever opened it,

1273
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:46,280
where there is an original long musical number sung by Alan Thicke and Andrea Martin, I believe,

1274
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:52,440
they had to make a long, long Broadway style song about retractable ceilings.

1275
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:59,240
They had to like, how many different ways can we reframe lyrics to be, to like,

1276
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,000
to focus on retractability?

1277
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,400
It feels like how they, you know, there's that thing of like

1278
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:06,200
50s and 60s, like trade show musicals.

1279
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:09,560
Everything's coming to a profit.

1280
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:10,520
Uh huh.

1281
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:13,000
Yes, it felt like a throwback to that.

1282
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:19,800
Like we have a long song about how it could be open when the sun is out and it can be closed.

1283
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:23,880
And then the whole thing was, all right, now let's open it.

1284
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:28,600
And it was raining so hard and they already had scheduled like skydivers

1285
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:32,520
who had to dive into the skydome in the rain.

1286
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:34,200
So there's tarps everywhere.

1287
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,080
Big disaster.

1288
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:35,880
That's some of the best.

1289
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,040
I'm no expert.

1290
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:41,640
I'm not from there, but in terms of Canadian entertainment, I've seen the skydome.

1291
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:41,960
You're in.

1292
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:44,040
That's one of the, oh, that sounds great.

1293
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:44,680
It's so funny.

1294
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:50,200
I wonder how long, like after you hit the open button, I wonder how long it takes to,

1295
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,600
like if you, oh, this was a bad idea.

1296
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:53,400
We should close it.

1297
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,760
And then you hit the close button.

1298
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:57,000
Like how long does it take to reset that?

1299
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,120
You know how like, uh.

1300
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,320
Pretty mighty.

1301
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:03,320
And especially what, you know, like once it starts moving.

1302
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:05,400
Yeah, I think we're talking half an hour.

1303
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:08,520
It's raining.

1304
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:08,920
Close it.

1305
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:09,400
Close it.

1306
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:10,200
Go, go, go, go.

1307
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:13,640
It's still got 15 minutes of like resetting and slowing down.

1308
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:14,600
It has to be.

1309
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:17,800
And if you pray, if you panic and press the button a bunch of times really fast,

1310
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:22,120
each one of those was a different, now it has to close a little bit and open a little bit.

1311
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:24,120
It's like the biggest garage door on earth.

1312
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,240
You can't like stop it at certain points, like a garage door.

1313
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:29,320
That's either it's all the way forward or it's all the way forward.

1314
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:30,840
Two spots where it could pause.

1315
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:31,960
Yeah.

1316
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:32,280
Yep.

1317
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:32,600
Yep.

1318
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:33,640
That's tricky.

1319
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,240
Tricky retractable ceilings.

1320
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:38,680
But anyway, if I could, I would like a playset, a detailed playset of

1321
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:42,920
everyone present at the opening of the Sky Dome in 1990.

1322
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:43,560
We should do that.

1323
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:47,480
Maybe I'm getting the year wrong, but yeah, again, I look, I'm just spitballing.

1324
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:50,600
I can't start demanding these things, but I, you know.

1325
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,360
Demand all you want.

1326
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:52,860
Yeah.

1327
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:53,360
No.

1328
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:58,140
Jason, of course, wants a complete set of original little rascals.

1329
01:19:58,140 --> 01:19:58,860
I think completely.

1330
01:19:58,860 --> 01:19:59,740
Oh, sure.

1331
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:01,180
Who's your favorite little rascal?

1332
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:01,820
Oh, God.

1333
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:07,580
That's, I mean, I feel like everyone is everyone going to say Alfalfa?

1334
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:08,620
Yeah, probably.

1335
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:09,900
Yeah, probably Alfalfa.

1336
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:13,340
If you have to pick between Joe Cobb and Chubby Chaney.

1337
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:17,100
I don't think I can go that deep.

1338
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:20,220
Oh, you know, do you know Brisbane?

1339
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:21,580
He's Brisbane's great.

1340
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:23,580
Is that your favorite little rascal?

1341
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:24,460
These are expanded rascals.

1342
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:28,380
Is this like the Curly Joe, like Three Stooges type rascals?

1343
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:30,060
He's way better.

1344
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:36,460
I did watch a little rascal short recently because it came on a DVD.

1345
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:41,260
Trying to remember what I was watching a bunch of the Presnitz Sturgis movies,

1346
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:47,580
but I also watched the Broadway melody of there were four of them.

1347
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:49,420
One was just in 1929.

1348
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:51,020
They just called it Broadway melody.

1349
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:56,220
One best picture that year, and it's incredibly upsetting because it's a sound.

1350
01:20:56,220 --> 01:21:00,220
It's a talkie, but they are still figuring out how to do that.

1351
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:01,340
So it's just a little weird.

1352
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:02,620
This is Brisbane.

1353
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:03,260
That's Brisbane.

1354
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:05,180
Oh, Brisbane looks like a bruiser.

1355
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:06,700
I don't want to make his mouth.

1356
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:10,780
He's got like his lips is all like, hey, I'm dead tired.

1357
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:11,660
How dare you?

1358
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:13,740
Jason does like little rascals.

1359
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:17,260
I will, full disclosure, that's not maybe his top pick.

1360
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:20,380
I was more of a joke, so I don't want to make him look like he was trying to pretend

1361
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:21,580
he was an expert and he wasn't.

1362
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:23,020
Scott is the truly the building.

1363
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:24,860
Do you have an answer for though what you're?

1364
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:29,580
No, I just I was trying to figure out in one of these Broadway melody movies are not very long.

1365
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:32,540
And by the by the last one, Fred Astaire's in it.

1366
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:37,980
A few of them have Elnur Powell, who they call the queen of tap dancing.

1367
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:39,900
She's very good tap dancer.

1368
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:45,820
But every one of these DVDs had like the other shorts that would pad out like a two hour runtime.

1369
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:53,420
And one of these DVDs I watched just had like a 25 minute movie called like

1370
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:55,420
The Stars and Palm Springs.

1371
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:58,140
And it's just walking around this property and it's like,

1372
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:00,620
oh, look, there's Catherine Hepburn.

1373
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:01,820
She's hitting the links.

1374
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:04,300
And and that was it.

1375
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:08,780
But there was a little rascal short where they're like, we want to make a movie.

1376
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:10,860
And then we want to screen the movie.

1377
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:11,900
That was the plot of it.

1378
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:13,420
That was the plot of it.

1379
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:21,340
And hijinks and so one of them gets their feet stuck in wet cement and can't make it to the screening.

1380
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:24,620
Well, that's a so that's a accessory you need.

1381
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:27,100
You want regular feed and you want cement feed.

1382
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:29,340
Yeah. Oh, no, they're putting on a little play.

1383
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:38,220
So it's like the play is held up because I think Buckweed is stuck outside the little junkyard theater

1384
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:42,700
and like can't get in to do the, you know, right play.

1385
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:47,180
You know, what's a good I sorry, I'm jumping all over the place here,

1386
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:50,300
but I'm realizing now a couple of years ago, I asked listeners on Twitter

1387
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:53,420
how much they would pay for an action figure of Jason.

1388
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:58,140
And overwhelmingly, they said, I think, fifty dollars are over.

1389
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:00,860
So they were talking for a premium overwhelmingly.

1390
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:03,260
How many people said they were fifty dollars?

1391
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:03,980
Look at this.

1392
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:05,660
I just I just totally remember this.

1393
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:06,620
Don't tell yourself sure.

1394
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:08,780
I think we were talking about all three of us.

1395
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:11,740
Well, we were, but I think my first question to the listener was just Jason.

1396
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:13,820
As far as an action figure was concerned.

1397
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:16,380
Yeah, we can do the you're the most toy.

1398
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:18,060
The word is toy addict, right?

1399
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:18,700
Of things.

1400
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:21,100
And Jason is the most toy addict of the three of us, I think.

1401
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:27,180
OK, but I think if anyone's after a Jason action figure and until we get our act together and do it

1402
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:30,620
in the meantime, I have found there are little rascals action figures.

1403
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:34,700
And I think you could just start with Spanky and say it's Jason.

1404
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:40,620
I mean, just just pretend, you know, he and I both get into lots of hijinks.

1405
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:41,100
Yeah.

1406
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,700
Well, you just OK, he seems to come.

1407
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:43,980
His accessory is a hammer.

1408
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:45,420
He's got a hammer in his hand.

1409
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:48,540
So just take out that hammer and put in a big old blunt.

1410
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:51,100
And then it's now we're talking Jason.

1411
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:51,820
That's Jason.

1412
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:59,500
I is that your answer?

1413
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,660
Is it the way we still don't know what's your.

1414
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:03,020
Oh, I said Alpha.

1415
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:04,940
It's my polar opposite.

1416
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:06,860
Very skinny, very tall.

1417
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:08,860
No, I mean, what's what action figures do you want?

1418
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:09,900
Is it Broadway melodies?

1419
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:13,900
Oh, yeah, I would take like Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly.

1420
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:14,940
Like I would take a pair.

1421
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:19,900
There's only there's only like one or two movies where they were ever in it together.

1422
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:23,260
One is called Ziegfeld Follies.

1423
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:27,820
And I think one of the that's entertainment compilations, they do a number together.

1424
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:29,980
Ziegfeld Follies series would be good.

1425
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:34,380
I sent you a picture because I just got the neck invisible man.

1426
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:37,340
I said this is my first Claude Rains figure and I was very excited.

1427
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:38,460
Sent it to Jason.

1428
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:38,700
Yeah.

1429
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:43,660
And I thought I before I looked at the picture, I thought it was going to be a.

1430
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:45,100
Casablanca.

1431
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:46,700
Casablanca series.

1432
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:47,180
Right.

1433
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:47,980
What do you mean?

1434
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:50,060
This is this is my first Claude Rains figure.

1435
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:53,180
You said that like that was not a really weird thing to say.

1436
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:55,340
My first Claude Rains figure.

1437
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:56,540
I knew what I was doing.

1438
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:01,020
This is a private communication between Jason and I shared it and I'm being ridiculed.

1439
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:02,860
It's a flip of a coin.

1440
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:07,660
I think of what do you associate Claude Rains with Casablanca or invisible man?

1441
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:08,380
Yeah, I mean.

1442
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:10,140
Or the third side of the coin.

1443
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:12,300
Do you not really know who Claude Rains is?

1444
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:13,420
Oh, he was a killer.

1445
01:25:13,420 --> 01:25:14,060
He was great.

1446
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:16,940
He was in Notorious, I believe, right?

1447
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:18,140
The Hitchcock movie.

1448
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:19,100
I think so.

1449
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:19,980
He's a lot of stuff.

1450
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:24,780
My girlfriend and I call it the four Jorleys, but that's not the name of the movie.

1451
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:27,500
It's like four sisters or something.

1452
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:30,780
He's the dad of like, they filmed it on the Warner Brothers lot.

1453
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:34,620
Like the house that's on this one corner is like their house.

1454
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:35,180
I've never seen.

1455
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:36,220
I know what you're talking about.

1456
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:42,460
We were watching all these old movies when the pandemic started and yeah, Claude Rains is great.

1457
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:43,100
He is great.

1458
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:48,380
When we got that universal license, I was immediately just asking,

1459
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:50,940
if like, oh, when are we going to do Edward Van Sloan?

1460
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:55,100
I just started naming all of the like, Uno O'Connor and like.

1461
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:56,300
Wait, who is Uno O'Connor?

1462
01:25:56,300 --> 01:26:00,780
Uno O'Connor, she's like the crazy lady in Invisible Man.

1463
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:04,380
She works in that bar, the restaurant.

1464
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:07,420
When she starts seeing stuff moving, she like freaks out.

1465
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:11,020
I think she's in like, they used her a few times, like Ghost of Frankenstein

1466
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:12,860
or one of the later Frankenstein movies.

1467
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:18,220
She's always like the old barmaid or something.

1468
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:22,140
But I just wanted to get the license, like the likeness rights for all of those

1469
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:26,460
really, really, really old like character actors.

1470
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:31,260
Everyone else just wanted like, let's make Dracula and Frankenstein's monster.

1471
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:32,220
Boring.

1472
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:36,780
You know, but it was like, we got to do all the other characters that like,

1473
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:40,060
you know, are classic in the movie that like no one's ever done figures for.

1474
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:40,620
Yeah.

1475
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:44,700
But then you got to find out who owns the estates and whatever.

1476
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:45,900
That's part of your job, right?

1477
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,900
Sometimes finding and getting rights.

1478
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:49,900
Yeah, that's more of my boss, Randy.

1479
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:50,860
That's more his job.

1480
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:53,420
But yeah, that's part of it when you're making figures is like,

1481
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:57,660
you know, you got to figure out like, because a lot of the time,

1482
01:26:58,140 --> 01:27:01,820
Star Wars, like Lucas got everyone's likenesses.

1483
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:05,500
Sort of like he had that master plan for merchandising and like

1484
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:09,260
every other movie is just not really structured.

1485
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:09,740
Doesn't walk down.

1486
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:10,240
Not really.

1487
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:11,180
Doesn't know those faces.

1488
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:12,140
Like sometimes it does.

1489
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:18,780
Like we were able to do, oh, well, like we did a bunch of Rocky figures

1490
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:24,220
from the Rocky movies, but then like we can't do Carl Weathers from like Predator

1491
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:26,220
because it's like the Predator movie.

1492
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:28,620
We can only do like Arnold and the Predators.

1493
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:31,740
Oh, so every movie is like structured differently, you know.

1494
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:34,700
But you've done Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed.

1495
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:35,340
Interesting.

1496
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:35,840
Wow.

1497
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:40,540
Any other dreams and any other that just calls to mind that question?

1498
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:43,980
Like any property that like that's the one.

1499
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:45,580
Maybe like unrealistic dreams.

1500
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:46,080
Yeah.

1501
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:46,940
Oh, unrealistic.

1502
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:53,580
It would be making like Maria Ospenskaya and like probably like we're doing like

1503
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:57,180
we do mashup figures of like the turtles and the Universal Monsters.

1504
01:27:57,180 --> 01:28:01,100
Like that's another subcategory of like all the turtle stuff.

1505
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:01,980
And it's like.

1506
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:03,020
Don't point at me.

1507
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:04,380
You make me do shit.

1508
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:04,940
I'm not.

1509
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:05,580
You know what?

1510
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:08,220
You look if you want to show it to me, you look it up.

1511
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:09,100
I do want to show it to you.

1512
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:12,220
But yeah, there's a lot of.

1513
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:15,980
I don't know what like another dream license would be like.

1514
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:22,780
I've said a couple of times, like I'd love to work on a lot of it is just 80s stuff.

1515
01:28:22,780 --> 01:28:28,540
You know, like the 80s cartoons that I liked, like Brave Star or Centurions, like.

1516
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:29,660
Oh, OK.

1517
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:30,060
Stuff like that.

1518
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:32,140
Thank you for looking at those.

1519
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:32,620
All right.

1520
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:33,580
They do look cool.

1521
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:36,220
That is a Rafael Frankenstein.

1522
01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:36,860
I see.

1523
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:39,900
Thanks for putting for moving your fingers around.

1524
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:40,380
Yeah, of course.

1525
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:41,580
Well, this was just in the way.

1526
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:42,780
So it's hard for me to get there.

1527
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:44,940
I can't imagine the journey to show me.

1528
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:45,260
It was.

1529
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:45,660
I agree.

1530
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:51,740
Trying to like all those old like now classic like B movies and stuff like.

1531
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:55,500
Like Ed Wood, like Plan 9 from outer space.

1532
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:58,540
Like there's no there's no paperwork.

1533
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:00,940
It's a miracle there's any prints of those movies.

1534
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:01,340
Right.

1535
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:02,140
So, you know.

1536
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:07,420
Yeah, those are those are tricky or they can be tricky, too, because it is just such a

1537
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:09,980
mess sometimes to know who owns what.

1538
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:15,020
And someone might have like distribution rights and then someone else is like retaining like.

1539
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:15,660
Oh, yeah.

1540
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:20,700
You know, the characters or the name or the story or something, you know, it's like stuff

1541
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:25,980
gets like sliced up like a bunch of different ways and there's all kinds of disputes and.

1542
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:26,620
Sure.

1543
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:30,540
Even like the big budget, like like let's say double indemnity.

1544
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:35,180
It's like, OK, well, we have to figure out what movie studio had that.

1545
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:36,380
And yeah, what distributor?

1546
01:29:36,380 --> 01:29:40,460
And then we have to find who has Fred McMurray and Barbara Stanwyck's license.

1547
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:41,820
Yeah.

1548
01:29:41,820 --> 01:29:43,340
Licenses, you know.

1549
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:47,340
My friend my friend was saying because I was really obsessed or I was

1550
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:51,820
am really obsessed with the idea of getting a really accurate Aunt Harriet figure from

1551
01:29:51,820 --> 01:29:52,700
the 60s Batman.

1552
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:54,140
Oh, that's that's a dream of mine.

1553
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:54,460
Yeah.

1554
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:54,780
Yeah.

1555
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:55,260
Great.

1556
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:58,380
And I was like, who owns the Madge Blake estate?

1557
01:29:58,380 --> 01:29:58,780
Yeah.

1558
01:29:58,780 --> 01:29:59,580
My friend's like, you know what?

1559
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:00,220
You would be the perfect.

1560
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:04,780
That's your perfect job is going to find out and talk to like Madge Blake's great granddaughter

1561
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:07,260
and convince her that we need to have a figure of her.

1562
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:12,460
There there was we did we did a couple like Batman 66 things a few years ago.

1563
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:17,260
And because because that was one thing that it took Warner Brothers forever to

1564
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:21,580
that was a great example of like CBS on this or Fox on that.

1565
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:24,780
It was and they finally got it.

1566
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:29,580
We had this list of like these are all the actors that you can't like there's Frank

1567
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:32,700
Orshan and like all the main characters, all the main villains.

1568
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:34,700
But they had likeness, right?

1569
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:37,900
Approvals for a bunch of the guest stars.

1570
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:42,460
And they gave us this huge list of every everyone we could potentially do.

1571
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:45,980
I'd love to go back and see if like Aunt Harriet was like.

1572
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:46,220
Yeah.

1573
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:49,500
On that list or not, because there was there's it was some stuff.

1574
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:52,940
It was like we were obviously never going to get to this, but that show just with all

1575
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:57,820
of the guest stars, I think it was just like a nightmare forever to, you know,

1576
01:30:57,820 --> 01:30:59,740
to work out the likeness rights.

1577
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:02,460
My dream is Liberace's character Shondell.

1578
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:05,180
Shondell, we said at the same time.

1579
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:05,580
Wow.

1580
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:07,500
I'm so glad you guys got together.

1581
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:08,620
This is important.

1582
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:08,940
It is.

1583
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:09,340
Yeah.

1584
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:10,620
I found it real quick.

1585
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:17,900
43% of out of 900 people voting said they would want a deluxe style Jason at 30 to 50 dollars.

1586
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:19,740
What were the other choices?

1587
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:20,060
Yes.

1588
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:22,300
Basic style like 15 to 25 dollars.

1589
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:23,340
Thirty three percent.

1590
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:26,300
And then no, I love Jason, but no, 24 percent.

1591
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:26,780
OK.

1592
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:27,420
Fair enough.

1593
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:27,980
So.

1594
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:30,140
But 50 bucks, we could get a lot of stuff in there.

1595
01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:30,940
You make a really.

1596
01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:31,820
A lot of accessories.

1597
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:32,780
A lot of fun.

1598
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:33,980
Yeah, it'd be a fun figure.

1599
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:35,420
What are the other Jason accessories?

1600
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:38,060
Slim Jims, snack cakes, you know.

1601
01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:43,820
Well, from what I understand in my limited knowledge about toys is that once the mold is made,

1602
01:31:43,820 --> 01:31:46,700
we can do a lot of different variants of you.

1603
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:47,180
Sure.

1604
01:31:47,180 --> 01:31:49,020
So mash him up with the.

1605
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:49,340
All right.

1606
01:31:49,340 --> 01:31:51,660
You know, the turtles are mashed up with the classic monsters.

1607
01:31:51,660 --> 01:31:54,140
He could be mashed up with the classic monsters.

1608
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:57,100
So like in any monster merger.

1609
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:57,740
Are you really?

1610
01:31:57,740 --> 01:32:00,140
Well, we had the we did the Rob Zombie one.

1611
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:00,700
Yes.

1612
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:01,100
Daniel.

1613
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:01,660
I showed you.

1614
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:01,900
Yeah.

1615
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:05,820
Oh, so you're responsible for the Daniel Roebuck grandpa.

1616
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:06,300
We did.

1617
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:07,820
The Counts, I mean.

1618
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:13,100
We did an episode about the late shift, which of course, Daniel Roebuck plays Jay Leno.

1619
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:13,180
Yeah.

1620
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:13,580
Oh, yeah.

1621
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:17,420
Because Scott and I specifically are obsessed with that movie.

1622
01:32:18,380 --> 01:32:20,860
And then we were just doing there's so much monster talk.

1623
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:23,980
And then all of a sudden, like eight months ago, it was like, did you know that Daniel

1624
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:26,140
Roebuck is playing grandpa monster?

1625
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:30,060
Because we did an episode about grandpa's restaurant from New York where he like was

1626
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:32,620
just the greeter and Italian restaurant.

1627
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:33,120
Yeah.

1628
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:36,780
Billy West has got great stories about that place.

1629
01:32:36,780 --> 01:32:37,180
Yes.

1630
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:37,340
Yeah.

1631
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:38,060
Yeah.

1632
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:39,260
Those are really great.

1633
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:42,140
So yeah, that was shocking when we learned that.

1634
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:46,460
So anyway, yeah, we'll we'll talk off air about getting the Jason in the tuxedo.

1635
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:48,140
Jason in the.

1636
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:48,780
Yeah.

1637
01:32:48,780 --> 01:32:56,140
Oh, wait, his the fake prom tux the fake photo tuxedo and then separately the tuxedo you

1638
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:57,180
were talking about earlier.

1639
01:32:57,180 --> 01:32:57,680
Sure.

1640
01:32:58,140 --> 01:32:59,660
Bathrobe bathrobe.

1641
01:32:59,660 --> 01:33:00,860
A different soft good.

1642
01:33:01,580 --> 01:33:05,180
Do we get shirtless Jason from when you weirdly took your shirt off at that live show?

1643
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:08,380
Well, I kept saying I was going to change and I just didn't.

1644
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:11,260
I was like, I don't think I'm going to take my shirt off.

1645
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:12,860
We can do a garlic scented one.

1646
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:16,620
Get a Chuck E. Cheese sponsorship.

1647
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:18,000
Yeah.

1648
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:20,540
A little bit of slime, a little covered in slime.

1649
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:23,660
You know, Chuck E. Cheese still around.

1650
01:33:23,660 --> 01:33:27,740
It's not exactly the same as when we were kids, but I don't know that they're giving

1651
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:30,140
away garlic goo anymore.

1652
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:31,660
For a chance.

1653
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:32,620
We have to bring it back.

1654
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:35,580
The only way we're getting garlic goods out into the market again.

1655
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:37,100
Yeah, that's too bad.

1656
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:38,540
Brett, could you bring up the picture?

1657
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:40,780
It says I think it's so long.

1658
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:45,580
It says Canada's Wonderland friends on it because I just think this is such a great

1659
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:46,140
picture.

1660
01:33:46,140 --> 01:33:46,700
Yeah.

1661
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:47,580
Oh, yeah.

1662
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:48,460
Look at these friends.

1663
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:49,660
Well, what friends do we see?

1664
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:52,860
It's we got we got Yogi.

1665
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:54,140
We got Scooby.

1666
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:55,740
We got Huckleberry.

1667
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:56,780
We got George.

1668
01:33:56,780 --> 01:33:58,060
George back there.

1669
01:33:58,060 --> 01:33:58,860
Jabberjaw.

1670
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:00,860
Jabberjaw is great.

1671
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:08,860
Jabberjaw was the best on the there's a carousel and it was all like Hanna Barbera characters

1672
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:11,020
and like Fred was like there's a picture.

1673
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:12,460
There's like a caboose or something.

1674
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:18,460
But like you could just sit on Jabberjaw's tail like it would sort of like curl over.

1675
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:19,340
Oh, that's a good carousel.

1676
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:24,620
And that was always like the number one like go to I got to get to Jabberjaw and like kids

1677
01:34:24,620 --> 01:34:28,140
would just like Brett Canada's Wonderland merry go is the name of the file.

1678
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:30,140
We have a picture of it here.

1679
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:33,900
Also, some Jabberjaw paintings at the Dolphin Show.

1680
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:34,460
There it is.

1681
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:34,780
Yeah.

1682
01:34:34,780 --> 01:34:35,100
See.

1683
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:38,540
So you could sit on like Yogi's lap.

1684
01:34:38,540 --> 01:34:43,180
You could go to Fred's like caboose thing.

1685
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:45,260
But Jabberjaw was just the greatest.

1686
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:49,020
You'd sit there and look up and have this like this huge mouth towering over you.

1687
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:50,060
Yeah, that's cool.

1688
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:56,140
So you can either sit on Yogi's lap or Fred has some very I'll be honest modern looking car.

1689
01:34:56,140 --> 01:34:59,180
Yeah, it doesn't quite fit with the bedrock.

1690
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:00,060
Scoobyville.

1691
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:03,100
It's a car that belongs somewhere else.

1692
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:03,900
They all get along.

1693
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:08,620
They mix up regardless of what time period it's like a weird MCU kind of thing where they're all.

1694
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:10,220
They're all together.

1695
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:10,620
Yeah.

1696
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:14,300
Fred is kind of like peeping in the window of the car too in a weird way.

1697
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:16,940
Yeah, he's not witnessing a murder.

1698
01:35:16,940 --> 01:35:22,860
Yeah, he seems like he's caught in the act of looking into this modern day Scooby car or

1699
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:24,540
whatever modern contraption.

1700
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:26,300
Yeah, he may be just confused by it.

1701
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:26,860
Maybe.

1702
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:28,060
All right, bud.

1703
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:33,900
You killed my wife and then I'll kill your wife and then we don't know each other.

1704
01:35:34,780 --> 01:35:37,740
It's the full Flintstones Strangers on a train.

1705
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:41,900
That was like going to be the second like Flintstones and Jetsons movie, I think, right?

1706
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:42,380
Yeah.

1707
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:44,140
Oh, the full genre exploration.

1708
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:45,020
Yeah, that's great.

1709
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:47,420
A train that has to be pushed.

1710
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:52,780
They have to pull off the murder but also push the train.

1711
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:53,280
Yeah.

1712
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:56,960
So it takes a lot of feet to do an entire train.

1713
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:03,040
So yeah, your favorite was the Jabberjaw car.

1714
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:04,080
Oh yeah, that's great.

1715
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:05,760
Whatever it is like rides wise.

1716
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:06,240
Oh yeah.

1717
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:10,160
I mean we're talking about a zillion things but like is there anything where like well

1718
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:12,400
if we're talking canon it's one thing you can't let that pass.

1719
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:19,920
Well yeah, my favorite place to go was the Smurf village or Smurf forest.

1720
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:21,200
Something like that.

1721
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:28,560
And it was a little different than the one in Kings Island in Cincinnati that I guess

1722
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:37,520
I couldn't find hardly any pictures of the Smurf village but I remember it being like a walkthrough

1723
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:44,240
and it was all like indoors and they had these little vignettes set up where you're like in

1724
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:50,480
the Smurf village and eventually you end up at Gargamel's castle and it turns into like a

1725
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:56,240
funhouse where like it's got crooked floorboards and so you're going through,

1726
01:36:56,240 --> 01:37:00,400
you're creeping through these hallways kind of zigzag around and like you just peek through

1727
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:06,080
these windows and there'd be like Gargamel and Asriel like making some potion or something.

1728
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:06,640
Oh fun.

1729
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:11,280
And there's like strobe lights and lightning and all this disorienting stuff.

1730
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:17,760
But yeah, it was like you guys remember like the Viewmasters, you know, they had the little discs.

1731
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:24,480
It was like walking through a Viewmaster because every room was just like one of these scenes.

1732
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:30,080
And it was just that to me was the greatest thing and like when you're outside

1733
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:37,280
just walking around the Smurf forest there's like giant snails so you're like the side,

1734
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:43,040
you're three apples high like a Smurf. You're just transported into this magical world and there's

1735
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:48,880
Smurfs like on the trees like kind of hanging up signs and welcome to Smurf village or whatever.

1736
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:56,720
So that area I loved as a kid and then boy what was better than that? I can't think.

1737
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:57,520
That sounds great.

1738
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:58,400
Yeah, I know.

1739
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:02,000
Gargamel's castle was just like the coolest part. It was just so awesome.

1740
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Yeah, yeah. I didn't know that.

1741
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:12,800
There was a whole bedrock area. They had like a little aquarium thing with like seals.

1742
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:18,480
I remember going there with my cousins one time and it was like the first time my cousin had

1743
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:23,360
seen like a seal and thought it was a guy in a suit because there's just no way an animal could

1744
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:28,880
like I don't know play basketball or whatever. Whatever the you know it was just but we were

1745
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:31,520
telling him that like this is like a creature you know.

1746
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:31,840
Right.

1747
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:32,080
Yeah.

1748
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:39,040
Do when you were like did you ever I guess since you were so little when you started going there

1749
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:41,360
was it did you get like bored by it ever?

1750
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,520
No, I don't ever remember really getting bored.

1751
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:46,080
You always felt like the magic was there.

1752
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,040
Oh for sure. Yeah.

1753
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:47,760
Yeah.

1754
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:48,320
Definitely.

1755
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:54,880
I just found something that seems to be called the heritage kids. There's these did you ever.

1756
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:57,840
Oh these the giant head things that kind of look like funko pops.

1757
01:38:57,840 --> 01:38:58,560
These are horrifying.

1758
01:38:58,560 --> 01:38:59,760
Those are really scary.

1759
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:04,400
Yeah big squarish heads they're kind of in the cabbage patch family but the heads are

1760
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:08,640
massive compared to them and they look really like pensive and upset.

1761
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:08,960
Yeah they're upset.

1762
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:10,320
Not one of them is smiling.

1763
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:12,320
They look like precious memories.

1764
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:12,960
Oh totally.

1765
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:14,640
Is that what they're called those ceramics?

1766
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:16,000
Yeah and they're happy.

1767
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:16,320
Yeah.

1768
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:21,440
These guys are all like they're they seem upset and they're all like side eyeing each other like

1769
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:24,000
do you want to be here? No. You want to be here?

1770
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:24,240
Yeah.

1771
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:29,040
I remember that like the Hanna Barbera land those guys might have been in like another

1772
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:30,720
part of the park.

1773
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:32,000
You stayed out of that territory.

1774
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,600
That was like the yeah scary.

1775
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:34,000
Yeah.

1776
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:34,480
Yeah.

1777
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:34,720
I just wanted to.

1778
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:38,240
Oh you never saw a heritage kid taking their head off backstage did you?

1779
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:43,680
If I did it's all like buried deep somewhere in the back of them.

1780
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:45,920
If you unlock it you'll just start screaming.

1781
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:47,280
Yeah it'll be like nightmares.

1782
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:48,960
Like that woman in the lowest oboe.

1783
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:49,120
Yeah.

1784
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:49,120


1785
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:49,120


1786
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:49,120


1787
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:49,200
Yeah.

1788
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:49,280
Yeah.

1789
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:49,360
Yeah.

1790
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:49,440
Yeah.

1791
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:49,520
Yeah.

1792
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:49,600
Yeah.

1793
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:50,000
Yeah.

1794
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:50,080
Yeah.

1795
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:50,160
Yeah.

1796
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:50,240
Yeah.

1797
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:50,560
Yeah.

1798
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:51,600
Heritage kids.

1799
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:54,880
Are they still around the heritage kids?

1800
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,880
It's a bad sounding name.

1801
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:58,160
Hope they burnt those costumes.

1802
01:39:58,160 --> 01:39:59,120
It sounds religious.

1803
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:05,040
I was going to ask if there I forgot I had answered my own question I was going to ask if there was

1804
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:09,760
a yogi's cave but I think by the time you might have been going that was flipped to the smurfs.

1805
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:10,400
It's yeah.

1806
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:17,600
So that I also just looking up stuff for this for this thing it was like it started the first

1807
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,600
year or two it was like yogi's cave.

1808
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:20,160
Yeah.

1809
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:26,160
I do not remember that at all and then yeah probably by 83 maybe it had they had

1810
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:31,520
they had switched it over to like the the smurfs you get like blue ice cream.

1811
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:31,840
Yeah.

1812
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:32,400
Oh wow.

1813
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:33,520
All that kind of fun stuff.

1814
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:38,720
That stuck around the yogi's cave at kings dominion stuck around until the 90s and I

1815
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:44,880
forget what eventually cleared it out but the smurfs were in another part of the park.

1816
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:45,760
You had both.

1817
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:50,240
Yeah so there for a time there was both is the way I remember it.

1818
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:51,520
That's my years developing.

1819
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:57,120
I wish there's a couple pictures where you it looks like they had like ranger smith's

1820
01:40:57,120 --> 01:41:00,480
cabin and stuff it looks like cool I wish I.

1821
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:00,720
Yeah.

1822
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:02,400
Remembered anything about that.

1823
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:05,520
I think a lot of that converted to gargamel's house.

1824
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:06,560
Probably yeah.

1825
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,640
Smurf forest and everything yeah.

1826
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:12,160
Yeah I don't know you know sometimes you just wish you had a time machine you go back.

1827
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:13,040
Oh yeah sure.

1828
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:13,760
My god.

1829
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:18,160
That occurred to me that like yeah I mean we think that all the time like to you know yeah do we go

1830
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:23,600
to some amazing thing in history no I would like to see Disneyland Tomorrowland in 1986

1831
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:28,000
is what I would waste time machine for sure on like really specific theme park slivers.

1832
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:28,320
Yeah.

1833
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:32,720
But it definitely occurred to me like what you got to early 80 I mean you were really

1834
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:39,440
little then but early 80s Toronto theme park is what I feel I would like this this this would be

1835
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:40,880
in my top 10.

1836
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:47,520
Yeah it was I in another just vague memory I remember seeing like that live he man like stage

1837
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:47,760
show.

1838
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:55,520
Oh yeah like they have yeah like I remember going to some kind of like live he man thing and it just

1839
01:41:56,080 --> 01:42:01,520
blowing my mind like it was I remember there was a there was like an act break or something where

1840
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:06,640
there's there's like a battle with like he man and Skeletor and there's like some kind of freeze

1841
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:13,600
sword or something and like Skeletor had this sword and like touched he man with it he man froze

1842
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:19,440
the whole stage just turned blue like this ice cold blue like music everything just stopped and

1843
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:25,360
that was like intermission or something and I was just like oh my god like what yeah it was

1844
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:30,400
like maybe five I was just like what the hell is going to happen to he man are we okay are we

1845
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:34,960
or and are like are we going to die yeah are we next that's it's like that's what I that's like

1846
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:39,120
my moment seeing the turtles live when I was whatever little and like shutters like I've

1847
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:43,760
locked the doors you can't get out and then it was like intermission and we left get some popcorn

1848
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:48,240
yeah and I was like wait maybe even the other door like the outside doors yeah yeah because

1849
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:51,680
I was trying to yeah make sense of what he just said because we went through the doors but I was

1850
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:54,720
legitimately like well this guy's gonna kill us yeah we're dead.

1851
01:42:54,880 --> 01:43:01,040
You can now with the action figures which I'm hold it like I got Michelangelo here you could do

1852
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:06,400
dark coming out of our shells where like yeah like okay the intermission's over you come back

1853
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:12,320
in you come back in just in time for the monitor to turn on and like oh good you're here and then

1854
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:19,200
he does shred Michelangelo's face yeah like you watch Michelangelo's face get covered yeah yeah

1855
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:26,000
all right eyes on the screen kiddies oh my god they're killing him in front of us

1856
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:31,440
it's really it would be kind of a therapeutic thing I think because it's an unresolved

1857
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:37,040
issue in my head yeah because I still was like thought it was real and I didn't I wasn't old

1858
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:41,840
enough to know it wasn't so maybe if I play out some of these nightmare scenarios maybe I'll be

1859
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:47,360
a better adult man yeah that's what we're making this stuff yeah right thank you so much

1860
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:55,040
they help you get over your child doesn't it certainly they don't make you stay in it forever

1861
01:43:55,040 --> 01:44:02,720
you know what swim in it no no no no I just go in there and stare every night nothing's weird

1862
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:08,720
about it lights on boys you know what do your show turtle friends well I just like yeah I don't

1863
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:14,080
when I'm not there like 1 a.m rearranging things that's not what I do no no no here when there's

1864
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:20,160
an earthquake I always stop and listen and like how many toys fell over like yes you know oh sure

1865
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:25,360
oh this wasn't a bad one because I only heard like yeah and sometimes I can pinpoint like I'm pretty

1866
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:31,040
sure that was like a spider-man that I knew was like kind of dangling on a ledge or something

1867
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:36,000
right weak legs is it anyway yeah those ankle joints will go you know what I'm trying to think

1868
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:41,360
you did the four turtles for the coming out of our shells in that video it's the behind the scenes

1869
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:48,560
with your guy Dave Rubrik oh yes we've talked about that too

1870
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:57,840
the first time my my wife bought an action figure

1871
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:05,920
you do variants super mario sweep dave and different sweaters sweaters actually doing just

1872
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:11,200
like generic like trying to do like like the um you know not specific contestants but like meld

1873
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:15,760
all the contestants oh yeah just into a couple like base bodies or something yeah yeah yeah and

1874
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:23,120
then do each type of sweater yeah yellow peach or i forget what they were but and they can all come

1875
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:28,960
with a different like you know like here's a big inflatable jolly green giant and that goes for

1876
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:33,280
that's a great idea too because you guys have done that where like the turtle wax you guys

1877
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:38,400
called turtle wax to get the official yeah right we have to use it as a little toy

1878
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:42,400
yep oh wow we did that so you could do this is easy oh sure this is a good one what were you

1879
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:46,320
going to say though but there was something else with rubric oh i don't know i was just saying all

1880
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:50,320
the version i think i said what i had to say about dave rubrik so okay well you could do yeah you

1881
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:54,800
do rubrics on supermarket sweet and rubrics the behind the scenes host of the coming out of it

1882
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:59,200
so rubric was i saying his name wrong i'm not sure rubric dave rubrik correct us we'll accept it we

1883
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:04,720
need to learn he's an important figure we need to learn i mean residual payments are such a crap

1884
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:12,080
shoot nowadays that would be great for actors you know just the the lightness rights for action

1885
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:18,240
figures like another revenue stream you know sure yeah and especially if yeah you were you hosted a

1886
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:23,840
game show in the early 90s or mid 80s and i'm sure all of those companies have protected you

1887
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:29,120
from having your image exploited yeah sure i'm sure you'll be completely properly you will get

1888
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:36,080
some money for the line of emily reasons why not the two three episode heather graham sitcom

1889
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:40,480
or drama from the 2000s that's a good poll jason yeah

1890
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:49,600

01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:39,520
get them over to canada's wonderland took them across the border and like yeah it was great yeah

1910
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:46,880
yeah kit was like and i uh when i was a couple you kit showed up at the mattel booth at san

1911
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:53,360
diego comic-con like i don't know a bunch of years ago and i was like hey dude remember me like i saw

1912
01:48:53,360 --> 01:49:01,360
you at like i met you at canada's wonderland uh in 1984 or whatever you were always my favorite

1913
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:06,880
trevor i wondered when you would return yeah i don't remember if there's any like if there's a

1914
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:12,160
william daniels voice or not there might have been or just a whoo that was definitely like

1915
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:18,400
yeah they had that that thing going on that yeah front but that was great that would be a good

1916
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:22,080
like donkey you know all you have donkey at universal and he's like there's a performer

1917
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:25,680
doing it yeah you could just have kit and there was a performer somewhere that would talk to

1918
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:31,760
people i was like well at universal um don't the transformers do that yes i think like megatron

1919
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:37,360
there's a guy on a microphone that'll just like interact is it recorded lines or is it actually

1920
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:44,000
somebody no it's a guy it is a guy yeah yeah yeah uh-huh because he felt i tried to say i think i

1921
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,440
said i tried to say i love you to one of them and it didn't feel like they reciprocated it

1922
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:54,880
so that may have been another therapy toy you're gonna have to go buy yeah buy a mega and i wasn't

1923
01:49:54,880 --> 01:50:00,000
even a transformer's kid oh dear wow but the ride means so much to me but now you yeah you weren't

1924
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:06,320
a transformer's kid but now your validation centers on uh being yes being being seen by

1925
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:11,280
optimus prime yeah but no it felt like that's how what i told myself is that it must be pre-recorded

1926
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:15,520
messages so they wouldn't be able to say something personal back to me they didn't record and i love

1927
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:19,920
you guess they thought it'd be weird they hadn't met me i would show them that it's not weird yeah

1928
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:28,720
so that's how i got through the day for up until now that's all ripped wide open yeah um i i mean

1929
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:31,840
yeah i got nothing i i mean i want to hear this popeye village thing i'm sure we should wind it

1930
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:35,760
down but yeah yeah so so you went to so we've talked we did an episode but we haven't talked

1935
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:07,040
just right before the pandemic started i was like october 2019 and we took a family trip out there

1936
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:13,680
because my last name is maltease like my my dad's dad he was from malta came to canada

1937
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:21,680
um so we had always heard about malta and just like never my mom just we should just it was

1938
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:26,800

1939
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:33,680

1940
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:39,120
have to go to popeye's village like that was the number one thing i wanted to do there so um

1941
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:44,080
yeah so we went and it was that was the last thing we did we were there for two weeks and

1942
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:49,280
that was the last thing we did on the trip on the last day and we spent the day there and it was

1943
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:55,440
like it's seriously like the happiest place i've this is the greatest place i've ever been

1944
01:51:55,440 --> 01:52:02,160
wow there was just enough um it's not like one of those weird derelict parks where everything's

1945
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:07,520
run down and it's all shambly and like falling apart and stuff like there was just enough of like

1946
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:14,080
they were keeping it up but just kind of barely you know there's like five people working there

1947
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:23,040
and like um it was just it was just it was just this wonderful place and uh um yeah so we spent

1948
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:27,040
we spent the day there there was a guy's popeye walking around a guy's bluto walking around

1949
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:33,680
and then um i had like the the pamphlet in my hand everyone was like we were having lunch and

1950
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:38,480
i was like oh my god like the the 115 puppet show is happening right now i was like i gotta go

1951
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:43,680
and i was like who's going to the puppet show with me and they're like we don't care like

1952
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:51,040
no so so i i just ran up the street it's like i think it's in um it's in the the family room of

1953
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:57,360
uh um of where olive oil lived like in the movie it's like olive oil's house or something right

1954
01:52:57,680 --> 01:53:04,640
it's at the end of the street castor oil yeah yeah and uh and so there's this so i i walk into the

1955
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:11,280
already happening like puppet show and um and it was like me and a couple of kids and maybe like one

1956
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:16,080
parent was you know they're just it's just the idea of like this puppet show happens like every

1957
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:22,800
half hour every day like there's maybe two people show up maybe there's just nothing going on right

1958
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:27,760
and uh and when i was like oh this is great so they're doing these like Popeye voices and stuff

1959
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:34,080
and then uh and when the show's over the puppet the puppeteers like come out from behind the

1960
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:41,280
curtain and it's just the guy in the Popeye suit like he was it was him and the girl playing like

1961
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:46,640
olive oil or something were the puppeteers so like he didn't change no they didn't change so then and

1962
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:50,080
when they were done they put the puppets away and then they went back outside and did like

1963
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:53,680
photos with people and then like you know it's just like it's just

1964
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:59,760
wimpy was probably at the grill like making hamburgers because there's there's no one else

1965
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:07,280
that works there and then we i just my friend is like a huge Popeye fan and so i just i pretty

1966
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:13,680
much bought up the entire gift shop when we left and like the guy was just like no this has never

1967
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:19,120
happened before like maybe they sell like a spoon or a t-shirt i bought like everything in there for

1968
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:25,360
me and all my Popeye obsessed friends and uh yeah it was it was just the greatest place but um

1969
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:31,600

1972
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:54,160

1973
01:54:54,160 --> 01:55:02,320
going into this bathroom and then um and then you know we moved and he like unbolted the toilet

1974

1976
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:18,800
goes and when i was at Popeye's village in malta i was like there's an actual Popeye bathroom i need

1982
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:52,880
uh brett i have in the Popeye folder it says Popeye bathroom but for some reason not loading so maybe

we'll have to just put it in later but i have it on my phone here there's a Popeye oh there it is

1984
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:02,080

1985
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:09,120
much but there's like like big towel and then he's on the shower door but then figures on every

1986
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:14,720
single nook and cranny of the wait and wait and the camera is blocking oh i see the toilet seat

1987
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:20,480

1994
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:07,360
sweet haven yeah pop i i cannot say enough good things about Popeye's village because it is just

2000
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:43,520
that beautiful we've thought about it for years since we did the episode and yeah it's rightfully

2001
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:48,400
it's so worth it like just going out there's there's a lot of cool stuff to see in malta

wheelchair is out of control mac and me style pre mac and me and hobo knows what to do he has

2025
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:07,680
to stop this and then cut to what it can only be that the makers of littlest hobo just threw the

2026
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:13,840
dog at the kid in the wheelchair really the kid the dogs just midair and just wow it's really

2031
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:42,720
a stunt uh but if that wasn't enough for you that this crazy thing happens that like the kid has

2043
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:54,400
because we'll we're watching these episodes and there'll be some guest you know actor for

2044
02:01:54,400 --> 02:02:00,000
for whatever oh this guy i know he's from seinfeld or something we start looking up their credits

2045
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:05,440
and like everyone that was on melrose place you know was probably like had a guest spot on like

2046
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:12,960
90210 but then they were also they were always on star trek like next gen or voyager and they

2047
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:18,160
were always like a character on seinfeld and it was like there's oh really so so there must have

2048
02:02:18,160 --> 02:02:24,000
been some casting crew or like a company that was just using the same bunch of people right

2049
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:30,640
wow um but um but two of the guys two of the people from melrose place jack wagner

2053
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:59,600
of a series of like ghost dog movies i think and uh but i just anyways a long story short i just

2054
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:06,240
bought this dvd last night on ebay uh dog gone yeah wow but it's like that's there's almost nothing

2055
02:03:06,240 --> 02:03:11,120
for it because like dog gone's been a few other movies like over the years daphne's aniga that's

2056
02:03:11,120 --> 02:03:18,080
yeah that's it yeah yeah so jack wagner did the song all i need do we know all i need just a little

2060
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:47,520

2061
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:55,200
just learned some new tricks oh that's so they didn't really go very far no i guess it writes

2062
02:03:55,200 --> 02:04:02,080
itself you know what's the so just quick google a dog phrase take the first results put it on the

2063
