1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:09,680
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,940
Welcome to what I'm sure will be an extremely comfortable episode of Podcast the Ride, the

3
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:35,200
Second Gate as we discuss the miracle of birth, the miracle of life as shown to us through

4
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,220
recently, constantly on the podcast, Martin Short.

5
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,100
I'm Scott Gardner, joined for this

6
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,880
day of miracles by Jason Sheridan.

7
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,760
Never been more comfortable in my life.

8
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,940
And Mike Carlson.

9
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,560
I'm here, I watched the thing we're talking about today through my hands, with my eyes

10
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,260
kind of peering out through my fingers.

11
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,600
I just, I didn't know what was coming and I

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,100
didn't want to be traumatized by it.

13
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,200
But I think I'll be okay.

14
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,080
If I have to excuse myself

15
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,760
or if I faint, I apologize.

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:15,640
You are describing my exact state of mind about this film, this Epcot Center film that

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:22,940
I had at the time and I thought I wouldn't have now and yet in a way, I guess I don't

18
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:22,940
know.

19
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,860
This is weird.

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,560
Here's a question.

21
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,120
Did everybody see this movie at the time?

22
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:31,440
Did

23
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:37,440
anyone watch this in person in the place that it was in the Wonders of Life Pavilion?

24
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,900
I cannot remember.

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,520
I feel like if I would have, I would have had a lot more questions.

26
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,140
And I would have gone into seventh grade health class a lot more prepared.

27
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,060
I don't remember.

28
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,480
What was the refresh?

29
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,840
What's the, how long was it there again?

30
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,300
I have it written down somewhere.

31
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,800
Now I don't know where it, I don't know when it left honestly.

32
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,220
I have it.

33
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,140
Was there an opening?

34
00:01:59,500 --> 00:01:59,660
Yeah, Jason.

35
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,580
Okay.

36
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:09,140
October 1989, it opens and it closes with the rest of the Pavilion January 1st, 2007.

37
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:10,380
Wow.

38
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,060
What a run.

39
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,680
What a great run for it.

40
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,300
I, it's weird.

41
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,600
I don't have a memory of seeing this, but it is possible that I did because it's very Epcot Center.

42
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:28,540
And as we said before about Epcot, a lot of experiences of Epcot blend together, especially when you're remembering something from 25 years ago.

43
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,380
But this one, I think this stands out.

44
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,340
This is an impossible one to blend.

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,780
It's very unique.

46
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,300
I for sure.

47
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:46,780
Yeah, I, you know, we were talking about the making of me an original movie for the wonders of life Pavilion starring Martin Short.

48
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,820
And, you know, I don't, I don't think of this.

49
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:59,240
I think of this moment a lot, but there's there's a funny or die video made by past guest Nick Weigert called Gungan Style.

50
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:07,120
And it features past guests of the show, Ryan Perez, and in it he has a wonderful delivery of the line.

51
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,200
So why are you doing this?

52
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,820
And that is how I thought about like reading about this ride.

53
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,340
I was like, why did they do this?

54
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:28,460
Yeah, yeah, because if you don't know it, if you never got to experience it, it is a it is a film about

55
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:34,040
the miracle of life, about birth, about the reproductive process.

56
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,320
Basically, you know, long story short, this is a Disney sex ed film.

57
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,260
This is a sex ed film that you could watch on vacation exclusively in Epcot Center.

58
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:53,400
This is crazy because I don't think like the Marvel characters are allowed to like kiss that much anymore.

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:07,560
Like I think that they're so afraid of certain things that might be like uncomfortable that like the company now is would never, ever, ever know something like this in one of their theme parks.

60
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:18,880
It's odd to do it back then, but I can at least see like their thought process of like it's this is going to be a very educational day at Disney World for youngsters.

61
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,820
So I guess we could also like we're doing body wars if we're explaining how, you know, fossil fuels work.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:35,340
I guess maybe we should explain to the kids with a friendly, friendly Clifford man how reproduction works.

63
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,640
I can see their logic, but it is very funny to think about it now, especially in the context of what they're comfortable with.

64
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:56,820
Yeah, I hadn't thought about this that how like the are their bread and butter in the recent past Marvel and Star Wars, whatever you think of these franchises, they are the unsexiest franchises you've ever like.

65
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,860
No one would ever describe anything in any of these movies as sexy.

66
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,260
Not that making a me is supposed to be sexy.

67
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:11,600
It's just in the in the, you know, the argument of them getting anywhere close to even the topic to even saying the word.

68
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:18,680
There's animated sperm, you know, there's animated sperm and animated sperm at Epcot Center is the headline.

69
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:28,920
If you didn't know about this cart cute cute, I will say definitively cute cartoon sperm at Epcot Center for years, years.

70
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:36,420
Definitely cute, but then they're like they talk like they're sort of like Brooklyn guys.

71
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,680
There's a race going.

72
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,180
We got to make a baby.

73
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,020
We got to we got to go get that egg.

74
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,060
I'm a cute sperm.

75
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,220
I don't you think that's cute?

76
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,780
Well, I don't think the voice is necessarily cute, but I think their design is visually design wise.

77
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,320
You take the personality out of it.

78
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,860
Just purely aesthetically, I do find the cartoons sperm cute.

79
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,280
That's very I'm shocked by that.

80
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,960
I thought you would be pure discomfort with every step of this.

81
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,180
So now to hear that you find the sperm cute.

82
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:14,120
Well, I'm a theme park journalist and I can separate myself sometimes from my own personal beliefs and feelings.

83
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,820
Obviously, I believe no child should ever learn any of this stuff.

84
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,640
I think that this should be blind until wedding night.

85
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:31,340
And then you sort of had a pamphlet from a priest and you quickly do what it says in the pamphlet and you hope that that's the one time you get pregnant and then you never talk about it again.

86
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,340
Never have to remotely revisit.

87
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,960
Hopefully you have hopefully you have triplets also with that one intercourse.

88
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,600
Take care of it all at once.

89
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,060
Yeah.

90
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,320
Yeah.

91
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:48,760
Children really exist as scars as proof that you had to do the dirty, awful deed.

92
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,080
Yeah.

93
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,200
Yeah.

94
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,360
But you got through it.

95
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,520
Hey, that actually to that end, this was part of what inspired doing this topic.

96
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:03,180
I I feel bad roping him into this after the creepy discussion so far.

97
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,640
But I have been a dad for a year now.

98
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:13,760
I am a year out from having experienced the the miracle of birth and I thought this could be I thought this would be fun to talk about.

99
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:21,760
And what I didn't realize is how much would plunge me back into like if I ever saw this at the time and I'm not really sure.

100
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:27,720
But it just it did plunge me back into just feeling like, well, you'll never you'll never do any of this.

101
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:40,080
If this is your comfort level with learning basic, un-graphic information about where babies come from, then you know, you don't have to worry about ever going there.

102
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,980
The lights you go to an interminably long dance and then the lights go down.

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,080
At some point, there's a wedding and you get a phone call.

104
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,960
You know, there's a brief water skiing interlude.

105
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,320
There's a water skiing interlude.

106
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:00,280
There's a second dance, a honeymoon dance and different kind of dance.

107
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,540
It sounds like a lot of planning and a lot of work.

108
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:07,900
I.

109
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,580
Yeah, this this is it's it's extremely strange.

110
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,060
And like I said, I thought I'd be comfortable watching it now.

111
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,400
I was like so shocked by that.

112
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:24,260
And and I watched it with with Aaron, who I did the baby with.

113
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,060
And she was mortified.

114
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,100
She was mortified through this entire thing.

115
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:38,460
Like, yeah, you would think two people who have who have made who have made a me there's a me out there made by us.

116
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,340
You'd think we'd be comfortable with this film.

117
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,720
But, oh, my, it's like it's utterly creepy to both of us and everyone.

118
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,720
It's very chase and like unnervingly.

119
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,440
It's perverse.

120
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,820
But it's also very ambly.

121
00:08:53,840 --> 00:09:03,920
It's very like ET soaring music while they're talking about some of this stuff, which is I find an odd juxtaposition as well.

122
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,900
I mean, I get that like making a child like, you know, that's such an emotional experience.

123
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:15,360
But like before that, like the nuts and bolts of it, like it's supposed to be like, wow, the sperm and the egg.

124
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,700
Wow.

125
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,020
Yeah.

126
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,040
I guess it's a miracle.

127
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:24,880
I guess they're also like tiptoeing from what I read.

128
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,740
They were concerned about like, OK, first off, we don't want to get tied into the abortion debate.

129
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,120
And it's like, oh, OK.

130
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,460
And I feel like they go out of their way to have more.

131
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:42,300
They don't they don't like say like here Martin Short says like, this is me at three months and now me at six months.

132
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,900
But he doesn't go like this is a person like, you know, this is a thing they do.

133
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:56,540
You know, it's very obvious, very hetero hetero normative in the like there's two types of people, lady kind and mankind.

134
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,600
Yes, I did note that.

135
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:07,140
And and that, you know, I they science knew there was more kinds back then.

136
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,260
You know, society took a long time to catch up.

137
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:19,240
And so I, you know, but you can feel them like sometimes you can feel Disney try not to be political.

138
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:27,700
Like the pictures in the Carthage Circle bar and restaurant where Walt is like they have Photoshopped a cigarette out.

139
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,180
It's like, OK, this just looks like you.

140
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,040
You've created an unreality in your attempts not to offend.

141
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,640
Yeah, don't put yourself in this situation.

142
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,940
Don't go anywhere near the arena if you don't want to deal with the subtlety.

143
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,220
I think you like why no one made them do this.

144
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,960
As far as I know, did MetLife, the sponsor of the Pavilion, I think, require.

145
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,620
Look, we've been really meaning to get some sex ed info out there.

146
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,600
So that's our one stipulation.

147
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,100
Yeah.

148
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,640
Parents were like coming to Main Street going like this place has everything at the help desk or whatever.

149
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:11,840
This place has everything except I would really like it if like somebody could teach my kid how to make a baby here.

150
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:16,460
That would be the one thing I would have as far as a suggestion is concerned at Walt Disney World.

151
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:17,680
Yeah.

152
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,680
Well, just like it's a one stop shop.

153
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,760
You know, Dad can golf and Mom can shop and the kids can enjoy meeting cartoon characters and going on rides.

154
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,420
We're taking care of so much.

155
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,800
So can you help me avoid the talk while we're here for six days?

156
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,180
Can Ed Grimley describe sperm to my young child?

157
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,560
Please.

158
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:44,920
Can it be a man known for his main lot in life is playing creepy characters?

159
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,780
Can it be the king of the creeps?

160
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,760
Yes.

161
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,140
All his famous characters are the creepiest characters and on Nerva young child.

162
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,960
Can he please explain about where they came from?

163
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:13,880
I like this might be one where it might behoove us to go sort of in order because I think a lot of people have not seen this or have only the fuzziest memory of seeing it.

164
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:21,900
If they did, the YouTube copies are pretty roundly terrible, despite ones that say remastered.

165
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,880
That is still filmed from the back of the weird small theater that they have this thing in.

166
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,180
They're functional.

167
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:38,420
But remember, filming, filming project projected film with like interlaced, you know, VHS is not going to look great.

168
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:42,300
You know, it's all very stroby and potentially seizure causing.

169
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:53,460
So if you have made a me, if you're expecting, I think maybe don't watch the YouTube version of this because you it might be unhealthy for your for your child.

170
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,260
For your me.

171
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,640
For your me.

172
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,200
You've recently made a me.

173
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,740
You recently made a me.

174
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,620
Yeah, it's somewhat.

175
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,460
Sometimes it's interesting.

176
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:15,100
I'm always so curious, like how is there a perfect pristine copy of Captain EO on YouTube from like the original reel or something?

177
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,520
And then there's certain things that are like this.

178
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:18,940
Like, I don't know.

179
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:24,220
How do people get copies of certain like pavilion movies and then others are not.

180
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,420
I'm always so confused by how that happens or why.

181
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:34,560
I mean, everything's like did any did did someone is it just like, well, someone liked this one.

182
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,120
So they saved it and no one cared enough to save the making of it.

183
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,380
It's a good possibility.

184
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,320
That's the case.

185
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,700
Not a single person was interested in archiving this bizarre movie.

186
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,620
Very possible.

187
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,660
Let me set the stage a little bit here.

188
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,780
So, yeah, we're in the wonders of life pavilion.

189
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,560
We've talked.

190
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,400
This was a later addition to Epcot 89.

191
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:03,080
We have talked about Cranium Command where you're in the brain.

192
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,320
We will at some point talk about body wars where you're in the bloodstream.

193
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,820
So it's generally about your body and life and health.

194
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,600
So, you know, we got to go see.

195
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,280
Got to see the nut.

196
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:26,500
You know, I feel like that that literally feels like a pitch in a conference room.

197
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,960
It's like, Mark, take it.

198
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,560
Take a 10.

199
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,620
Get some air.

200
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,180
I mean, man.

201
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Well, obviously, that what if they wanted to address this area,

202
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:42,540
it should have been a ride where you go into the night and where we all get.

203
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,580
Yeah.

204
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,080
Yeah.

205
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,440
Where you get ejaculated.

206
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,720
Like, clearly, that's a launch coast.

207
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,760
That's a lot of first launch coaster before Disney started doing it.

208
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,180
Sixty miles an hour launch.

209
00:14:55,020 --> 00:15:00,220
And then you'd get to really like understand it like you wouldn't have to have someone explain it to you.

210
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,140
You just know, oh, I get it now.

211
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,300
Yeah.

212
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:03,860
Yeah.

213
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,260
Yeah.

214
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:11,500
There's only one place you saw some vague like tower like at an incline.

215
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,740
You would understand.

216
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,360
Oh, OK.

217
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,240
So that's what you're.

218
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:14,540
All right.

219
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,680
I understand sex now.

220
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,400
It really it's you know, it should be a really a lot like,

221
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,760
maybe like Superman, the ride at Six Flags, a shoot off and up.

222
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,960
Maybe I guess you come back down, though, that doesn't make any sense.

223
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:33,880
Although I don't want to actually get into the physics of that and what that would actually represent.

224
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,860
I think it would have to be like the Space Mountain in Paris where there's a launch up

225
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:45,100
and then there's a whole like world that you get like you would have to you'd end up with like blinding white light.

226
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,040
And that represents like that's the moment of conception.

227
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,940
Can I I think that's absolutely correct.

228
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,360
But I do think that you would have wanted still like the start of rock and roller coasters launch.

229
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:00,660
You would have to have a Steven Tyler scream to start it off.

230
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,440
I think that would also be really good.

231
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,540
It's just like I thought you were just going to say muffled like,

232
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:12,000
you know, mixed tape playing in the background muffled, jaded playing in the distance.

233
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,120
Or you could have like a radio announcer like, check out Steven Seiler's new hat.

234
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,000
And then you ejaculate.

235
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,660
Yesterday, by the way, yesterday was Aerosmith Day in Boston in case when recording this on the 14th,

236
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,840
but the 13th in April is Aerosmith Day.

237
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,220
It was declared by a mayor or something.

238
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,440
I just want to let everyone know that.

239
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,820
Obviously, you don't need to go through basics on this podcast.

240
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,620
You could have said the sky is blue.

241
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,180
That's not news to anyone.

242
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,940
That's true.

243
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,040
I apologize.

244
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,800
I want to pander or I want to maybe we we all celebrated.

245
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,600
We all put on scarves for Aerosmith Day.

246
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,200
Yeah, I know.

247
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,120
I know you guys did.

248
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,020
So happy Aerosmith Day is all I wanted to say.

249
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:06,040
We put we put pics in the yard for the baby to find to go on a on a peri pic hunt.

250
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,660
Joey Kramer.

251
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,160
First of the words.

252
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:22,220
OK, so anyway, in setting the scene, basically what I'm trying to say is like I loved Wonders of Life so much.

253
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,800
We talked about Kramer Command, love Kramer Command.

254
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,680
I loved all these.

255
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,580
I love that.

256
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:29,400
That's the most like, you know, 80s mallish pavilion.

257
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:35,520
And not only that, I wanted to do everything that there was to do at Disney World the first time I went.

258
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,860
And I had the Burn Bombs guide.

259
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,980
I don't know if we've talked about Burn Bombs guides that travel.

260
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,240
But I read this thing on the on the flight over.

261
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,520
I read it front to back.

262
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,220
I knew everything there was to do at Disney World before we got there.

263
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,340
And I just remember reading about this one like, huh?

264
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,580
Well, we'll see when we get there.

265
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,800
It sounds very bad to me, but I do want to do everything there is to do.

266
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:11,440
And then I got to the sign that is outside the the attraction, which I think bears reading.

267
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,500
Dear guest, the making of me explores the sensitive subjects of human reproduction and birth.

268
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:23,120
This film contains spectacular images of fetal development as well as live footage of the birth process.

269
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,380
We ask that you use discretion when deciding whether you or your family should view the making of me.

270
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,360
Thank you.

271
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,180
Out.

272
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:30,660
Out.

273
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,260
I was out turned around.

274
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,580
No, thanks.

275
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,140
This this you're going to I don't think I know the word fetal at this point.

276
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,540
And hold on.

277
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:44,300
I'm going to learn something about sex and see what babies are like inside that with my mom.

278
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,840
I'm going me and my mom are going to walk in and watch this together.

279
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,480
I don't think so.

280
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,260
No, thanks.

281
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,140
One more body wars for me, please.

282
00:18:53,400 --> 00:19:01,340
Did you like a cartoon like pull out a picket sign immediately and start walking up and down outside to picket it?

283
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,640
No more filth.

284
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:08,320
Yeah, because I would imagine like Madonna or any of the other controversial people.

285
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,420
Oh, yeah.

286
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,880
You were like probably fired up about it.

287
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:18,540
God, right around the same time that they're willing to do business with that cone broad.

288
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,560
Or lit.

289
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:25,880
And then they're willing to promote the idea of people having sex.

290
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,960
I mean, they were really.

291
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,840
Yeah, they were.

292
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,260
They were mired at the time.

293
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,800
I do wonder, did like Limbaugh or like Morton Downey Jr.

294
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,380
like pick up on this one, like because that's the thing I was reading about.

295
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:49,660
Fox News does now they just like hone in on some, you know, you know, seminar at a community college or like a weird like local government like, yeah,

296
00:19:50,880 --> 00:20:00,520
a thing or they just like the world is ending if a library does, you know, drag queen story hour and they just blow it out of proportion.

297
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,780
Like this is the end of society.

298
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,860
Everything is collapsing.

299
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,120
Like I did anyone I didn't really find any like controversial stuff.

300
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,760
I think there was one newspaper article.

301
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,540
It's like, well, this is certainly interesting.

302
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,340
Yeah, I don't think this was so popular.

303
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,880
I don't think this was popular enough.

304
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,280
Yeah.

305
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,120
Warrant controversy at the time.

306
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,880
That's a guess.

307
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,640
But yeah, there was no Richter scale whatsoever.

308
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:28,500
Like nothing.

309
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,160
The needle did not move.

310
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:30,900
Right.

311
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,320
Yeah.

312
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,740
So that was the oh, what do we got here?

313
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,160
Oh, there's the the outside.

314
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:35,520
Yeah.

315
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,000
Oh, yeah.

316
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,680
This scared me.

317
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,000
These puzzle pieces.

318
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,020
Yeah.

319
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,760
The puzzle pieces are certainly a choice.

320
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:49,020
I have to say I do like that it is a building within a building that's appealing to me.

321
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,920
I don't quite know why.

322
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,640
I just kind of like that.

323
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,500
And I like the color scheme.

324
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,300
You too.

325
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,640
That's why this broke my heart to not go in and building in a building.

326
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,680
I like what you're saying.

327
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,960
But then like just just made it like, all right.

328
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,780
Well, it's colorful, but it's still like a shack where I'm going to watch a sex movie with my mom.

329
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,840
No, thanks.

330
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:15,120
I think I was mostly interested in getting a turn at the stationary bike

331
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,840
with a screen that made it look like you were peddling through Disney.

332
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,200
Is that is that right?

333
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,500
Yeah.

334
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,420
Am I imagining that?

335
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,240
OK, that is real.

336
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,240
Love that thing.

337
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,740
Yes.

338
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,100
Yeah, that's like why was that so exciting?

339
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,040
Conan's desk bit.

340
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,500
Yeah.

341
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,720
Which, yeah, I think the faster you peddled, the faster the footage went to.

342
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,120
Yeah, it just seemed fun.

343
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,300
Can I can I real quick get in a do you have memories of

344
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:47,460
because I have one very specific one, a memory of watching something that was really uncomfortable

345
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,180
because you were watching it with your parents?

346
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,320
My mind, maybe I said this already in the other episode.

347
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,740
It was Ace Ventura, Ace Ventura.

348
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,500
There's a very comic sex scene in that movie and we saw it in the theater.

349
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,760
And I just remember feeling like I wanted to die.

350
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,320
It felt like it lasted for like 15 minutes.

351
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,320
And I remember my mom like looking at my dad because he like had decided

352
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,720
that we were going to see Ace Ventura because he wanted to see it.

353
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,300
And I just remember like, oh, my, how am I ever going to get out of this movie?

354
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,260
Like, how am I ever going to get out of this situation?

355
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,820
You you did this.

356
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,100
You did this to our family.

357
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,480
Yeah.

358
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,040
Yeah, that is right.

359
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,460
That's my recollection of it.

360
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,280
Maybe they don't think it's like that, but we'll see.

361
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,580
I'll hear about it.

362
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:35,820
I have one which is that we we did watch Seinfeld a lot and I watched it as a kid

363
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:41,060
despite there being sexual scenarios and they would just always be ready to to pounce or to change the channel

364
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:47,280
if they thought that anything was getting dicey or to just avoid me asking questions about like,

365
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,640
what's a diaphragm or whatever that might come up?

366
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,400
What is mommy?

367
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,560
What is Spongworthy?

368
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:57,040
I boy, I think they they completely just whiffed it on that.

369
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,680
They just like talked about other things and spun their way out of the room to avoid it.

370
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,580
But I don't know.

371
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,900
Is this even in the same episode?

372
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,340
I don't know.

373
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,960
There's just a there's a thing where a condom is being fumbled with.

374
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,180
And it's just a close up of hands in a condo.

375
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:20,220
But I just I just remember like both parents like leaping across the room to cover my eyes for what never.

376
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,200
To be fair, they didn't know what was coming.

377
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,220
But also it's it's like NBC.

378
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,160
Like, I don't think they're just going to like.

379
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:27,540
All right.

380
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,780
Now we tilt down and see George's George's erect penis.

381
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,360
But I just remember like and I didn't understand like what what's and then when I caught glimpses of it,

382
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,520
I'm like, that's like a little balloon pack.

383
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,080
What's the problem?

384
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,240
I can't I see that.

385
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,580
Yeah, that's that seems right.

386
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:53,680
I don't know that my parents ever like did a superhero action hero dive across the move to change channel.

387
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,320
Excuse me, Jason, what do you got?

388
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:02,240
Anything I I've got to that they're both kind of like have asterisks.

389
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,580
But I remember watching with all of my family.

390
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,200
We ran it.

391
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:12,680
The Shining, just because I think we could all we weren't big on horror.

392
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,440
You know, we liked everyone in the family could agree on.

393
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,140
Are you afraid of the dark rolling right into Alfred Hitchcock Presents?

394
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,460
And at a certain age, I started becoming interested in movies.

395
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,340
I was like, can we rent like The Shining, Stanley Kubrick movie?

396
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,780
And I don't know that my brother would have watched it,

397
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:40,520
but I think we're all definitely sitting around and, you know, there's certainly nudity in the one, if not two sequences in that.

398
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:45,800
I think the abject horror is kind of overshadows it.

399
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,360
So I don't I don't think we jumped as much.

400
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,360
I don't know.

401
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:59,480
Another memory I have is being at like some sort of summer camp or like maybe it's on a cruise ship,

402
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:06,160
some sort of like kids like teens group like preteens and teens like hang out in its movie time.

403
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,480
And the movie they chose to show was The Rock.

404
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:19,720
And that has a very funny, like a very strange sex scene like a like a sex scene where they're like having a conversation and like played for laughs.

405
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:27,600
And that was just very weird to watch with other like 12, 13, 14 year olds and a couple of adults in the back of the room.

406
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,660
Yeah, I get that.

407
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,220
I don't remember this Rock.

408
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:39,020
And then my real quick, my sorry, my remember though, my mom loved that old 60 1968 Romeo and Juliet movie.

409
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,800
And you see Romeo's butt in that.

410
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,820
And she showed us that.

411
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,940
But she liked it, I guess.

412
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,860
So it was fine.

413
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,660
A scandal, scandalous at the time, I believe.

414
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,440
I think so.

415
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,160
Yeah.

416
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:48,960
Yikes.

417
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:49,400
Wow.

418
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,560
So I don't know if my mom liked the scene.

419
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,600
She was fine with it, I guess.

420
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,100
She didn't like my coarseness of Ace Ventura, I guess.

421
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:05,100
My mom took the the MPAA ratings very seriously as if they had been like around for a while.

422
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,960
Like if not himself had assigned the rating.

423
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,980
Oh, yeah, I was that way too.

424
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,120
My friend Luke could watch R rated movies.

425
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,120
And I think the first R rated movie I saw was South Park in the theater with my dad.

426
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,640
Yeah.

427
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,800
And the movie theaters near me were pretty strict about checking IDs.

428
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,580
But then I realized like a blockbuster video will rent you anything.

429
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:26,940
Sure.

430
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:37,220
I.

431
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:36,300
And you know, especially if you're a young, young, nerdy little little preteen who is very interested in hacking his way through the A.

432
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:36,500
F.

433
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,220
100 list.

434
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,580
That was a big deal when that first came out.

435
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:45,400
And yeah, they're not checking if you're here bringing an R rated.

436
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,880
They're just scanning the box.

437
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,500
Do back in three days.

438
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,020
Roman Holiday, please.

439
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,620
I suppose there's not that much R rated.

440
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,640
There's a few later movies, you know.

441
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,960
OK, so so the film.

442
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,560
All right.

443
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:04,960
We.

444
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,620
And again, I don't I really don't remember if I if I saw it at the time.

445
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,220
So so watch it recently.

446
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,960
It begins with Martin Short in like a black void initially.

447
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,940
And he says, how do you know it happens to everybody?

448
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,280
Just all of a sudden one day you wonder where you came from.

449
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,980
And we get to hear his story.

450
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,460
It becomes not a black void.

451
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,800
He's in the hallway of a delivery ward.

452
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:35,240
And he goes and he points to his dad in the room where there's a bunch of babies all at once.

453
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,040
I don't know what that's called or what it is because I had a baby in Covid era.

454
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,440
So this was not familiar to me whatsoever.

455
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,480
There was no lots of baby's room.

456
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,340
So so so now we've established is going to be like a this is like a time hopping thing.

457
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,320
He's going back to see the early days of his parents.

458
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,240
Yeah.

459
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,680
And he plays his own father.

460
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,020
Yes, which is we got to high school.

461
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,240
Realize he's playing his own father.

462
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,880
There's a pretty awkward cut in there because I think we go from dad is baby.

463
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,920
And he says that.

464
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,280
But you know, but before my story can begin, he's still got to meet mom.

465
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,520
Let's check in on her goes to see mom at like age five, six.

466
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,320
I'm not sure.

467
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,920
She's like playing with perfume that she shouldn't be.

468
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,220
And her mom stops her.

469
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,780
So she's just a little girl and she's going to be punished.

470
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,580
We don't want to see that.

471
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,360
So let's get out of here.

472
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,340
Let's go check on dad cuts to dad in high school played by a grown man.

473
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,360
And I don't know what they were intending.

474
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,460
I think there's a jump in time.

475
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,400
But the way the jump happens, it makes you go.

476
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,980
Wait, so the mom's six and he's like 17.

477
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,180
What's the it's a reverse Padme Anakin situation.

478
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,500
Maybe they could first meet when they were wildly different age.

479
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,000
I mean, they're always going to be at same age, but it was an appropriate age, I guess.

480
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,880
Maybe.

481
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,760
But I think that I think there's a time jump.

482
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,320
That's how I interpreted it.

483
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,440
But I know what you're saying.

484
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,520
It is confusing.

485
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:09,820
Yeah.

486
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,700
There's also a moment I don't want to skip over this.

487
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,740
It's very quick.

488
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,300
You have to pause it to try and catch it.

489
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,800
But the mom, before she plays with the makeup and stuff as like a child,

490
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,360
she's walking down a hallway with a baby carriage.

491
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:28,300
And the quick shot of the doll in the baby carriage is one of them.

492
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,700
It's it's upsetting.

493
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,400
Like, like, what the fuck, man?

494
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,460
What is this?

495
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,180
I don't care for this.

496
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,880
And I had to keep rewinding it to go like, is that like,

497
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,780
did they superimpose Martin Short's fate?

498
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,600
Like, what were they trying to account?

499
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,880
And I think it's just a very strange doll.

500
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:44,840
Mm hmm.

501
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,360
But that's a like you just described the perfect part for Martin Short to play.

502
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,580
Well, now maybe that was wishful thinking on my part.

503
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,740
There's still time.

504
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,680
Yeah.

505
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,260
Come on, Marty, play a doll.

506
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,220
It's on the subject of Martin Short.

507
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:07,280
I forgot to say, too, I said this an episode forever ago, that Martin Short is in four Disney theme park films,

508
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,960
not even attraction, not even like yours.

509
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,500
There's a pre movie before a ride.

510
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,620
It's all films.

511
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,140
There's this there's the monster sound show from when Disney MGM opened.

512
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,080
There's something that's exclusive to Disney's work.

513
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:32,460
The worst park Disney's Hollywood Studios is that what Disney Studios Paris in Europe called Ciné Magique and Oh Canada,

514
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,920
the Circle Vision movie.

515
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:39,740
So he's been in two Epcot movies, four theme park things overall.

516
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,680
It's a it's a rough filmography.

517
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:49,940
He's like number one, I think, Paz, besides like the voice of Mickey Mouse and increasingly Chris Pratt.

518
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:55,980
But he's been in so many things and it's all a pretty like like is anyone super fond of any of what I just listed?

519
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,100
I'm trying to think it's like the most popular one.

520
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,880
Oh Canada, I guess.

521
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,320
Just maybe like Canada.

522
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,680
I've never seen it.

523
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,500
I like it.

524
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,580
Yeah, I like that one.

525
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,100
What was the other there?

526
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,200
There's the Paris one.

527
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,100
This was the fourth monster sound show with Chevy Chase.

528
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,000
That was that where it was a thing where you made the sound effects, I believe.

529
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:16,900
Oh, yeah.

530
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,420
OK.

531
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:17,760
Yeah.

532
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:25,440
I don't I don't remember that super well, but I I mean, I loved all the binaural audio stuff and the little booths.

533
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:30,400
And so I think that probably would be what I would choose to prefer.

534
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:44,740
I know there is some good quality copies of some other videos went up, Superstar Television and the Mel Brooks, the Mickey's Big Break, not the Mickey's Big Break.

535
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,840
We talked about that.

536
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,740
There's another Mickey's Big Break.

537
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,720
Jim and Lett had been talking about it recently.

538
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:52,780
Oh, yeah.

539
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,960
Where did that play?

540
00:31:54,660 --> 00:32:02,940
Well, the Mickey's Big Break that we were talking about was from the like the late 90s or 2000, the one where with Go Soak Your Head, Fresh Boy.

541
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:10,200
But Mickey's Big Break with Mel Brooks and like a bunch of other stars, Carol Kane, I think shows up in it.

542
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:16,980
That I believe they said was in MGM Studios as like a bridge attraction, like something is closed.

543
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,580
We need to fill some time.

544
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:23,280
And they just shot this thing and put it up real quick.

545
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,040
Yeah.

546
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,400
Faintest memory of that.

547
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,280
Not totally sure.

548
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,220
Yeah.

549
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:32,140
Anyways, odd filmography, this being perhaps the oddest entry.

550
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,560
So he's in a high school classroom as a chalkboard.

551
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:41,020
And I think it says on the chalkboard next week, the reproductive process.

552
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:53,000
So that gives that gives Martin, our Martin, not dad Martin, the the in to turn to us and use the chalkboard to demonstrate some stuff.

553
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,960
We have the I'll just say the line verbatim.

554
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,960
Oh, yeah.

555
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,160
About growing up.

556
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:07,360
Very important for people who want to have babies because most of the baby making equipment doesn't begin to work until you mature.

557
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,460
This is this is a line you could see on your vacation.

558
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,400
The baby making equipment doesn't work.

559
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:16,960
Baby making equipment.

560
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,260
Like work.

561
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,540
I mean, it does some stuff.

562
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,520
I think it's the other stuff that comes later, I guess.

563
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,980
It's part of it works and then it could work earlier for some people.

564
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:35,680
And then I yeah, the tap of the prescription, the tap water.

565
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,040
Maybe it doesn't work all the way.

566
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,560
If you know what I'm saying, they can't intellectually.

567
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:42,240
Yeah.

568
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:47,520
But I'm comfortable with every word said everything remotely close to this.

569
00:33:48,860 --> 00:34:03,200
So I imagine this was all, yeah, like, you know, going over with a fine tooth comb at the time to be like, we have to explain that this the penis doesn't work yet in the way we want.

570
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,420
But we have to say it in a neutral way.

571
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,020
Yeah, we know 80s and 90s pop culture.

572
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,220
The motto may as well just be sex sells the most.

573
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:16,680
But suburban madness tells you that don't it just it's all it's awful.

574
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,680
No, no, no, no.

575
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,160
Yeah.

576
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,360
How do you square that circle?

577
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,920
And yeah, yeah, this movie does not not have the answer, I wouldn't say.

578
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:31,380
But before we can talk about baby making or body parts or any of that, we have to talk about people.

579
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,320
This is when there's the very stuck in the past.

580
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,100
There's two types of people.

581
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:36,900
That's it.

582
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,620
And that's it.

583
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,760
No more questions.

584
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,880
We only got 15 minutes.

585
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,720
That's a perfect amount of time to cover everything.

586
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,720
All the issues that this opens up.

587
00:34:48,920 --> 00:35:05,680
So he goes in his little sex ed lesson and then we see a diagram and what we see on the chalkboard, I would have to think is the only iteration in a Disney park of an intentional depiction of a penis.

588
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,980
Maybe in any theme park.

589
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:17,000
I hope I hope that there's not a lot of like maybe on if you're going for like an Italian statue sort of vibe that would still possibly be allowed.

590
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:24,860
Is there like a French or Italian theme park called like Penisland or Dickland or something like there is like a gross out park.

591
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:25,540
Yeah.

592
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:25,940
Yeah.

593
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,660
I'm not sure what it is.

594
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,880
It's got to be something like that.

595
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,120
Yes.

596
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,080
And as far as a mainstream American park.

597
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,500
Yeah.

598
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,420
All the penises are subtle if they exist.

599
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,080
They are subtle.

600
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:46,080
They were put there by horny imagineers who were doing it for a gag between them and their other imagineer buddies.

601
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,080
Typical Hollywood sickos.

602
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:48,960
Yeah.

603
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:56,400
We've seen the boxes of Disney animated releases and the priest with the boner and little mermaid.

604
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,100
Those animators, those pervert animators.

605
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,640
You will see arguments about that kind of thing like today.

606
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:10,820
Like in the in the panic of like Q world, they'll say these Hollywood sickos and you know, the priest gets a boner and little mermaid.

607
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,620
Did you know that?

608
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,920
Like, yeah, you mean from over 30 years ago?

609
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,280
Is that what you're talking about?

610
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,780
Yeah, it's probably a knee anyway.

611
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,400
But this there's no mistaking because it's a diagram.

612
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,680
Let's look at it together.

613
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,480
There's the penis.

614
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,540
As well as, you know, the tubes, the lady, the fallopian tubes.

615
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,000
Yeah.

616
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,560
Calpers gland over on the right and sure.

617
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:49,120
I feel like any any time like a health book needs to portray like a reproductive system, but it doesn't want to make it like sexual.

618
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,140
There are me like, OK, lead with the fallopian tubes.

619
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,480
You know, put a drawing of that in there.

620
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,240
Not sexy probably.

621
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:05,000
I don't think that's there's like a specific appeal in the fallopian tubes like your intestines or something.

622
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:18,400
I just just got so many handouts at like public school education, public school health class of like like just sheer boiled down to like these are different kinds of anatomy.

623
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,720
There are blanks next to him.

624
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,220
You know, when there's a blank on a worksheet, you got to fill it in, fill it in.

625
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:31,060
And I don't I don't know what that purpose was serving.

626
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:35,780
Looking back, what did barely comes up?

627
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,180
Look, we had a baby.

628
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:42,380
We had and I still don't like remember what all the various parts are that come into play.

629
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:49,440
It's like, you know, it's like when you go to a you go to another country and you learn enough language to get by and then you forget it as soon as the vacations over.

630
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,680
I've already jumbled as to what all these body parts are.

631
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:53,700
I yeah.

632
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,780
And the medical field does not seemingly prioritize a lot of people's health.

633
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,580
And it wasn't until I was much older.

634
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,360
I learned about like, yeah, there's a lot of ailments specific to stuff.

635
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,800
And it's like, why didn't this come up in health class?

636
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:15,560
You know, what I want to learn about ailments when you were well, you know, you just look I just feel foolish when I'm older.

637
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:26,280
It's like, well, they they never I don't yeah, like stuff never came up, I think, until people like had to actually deal with it either.

638
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,860
You know, they had it or a family member had it.

639
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,740
I don't know.

640
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,100
I had public education.

641
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,120
You know, yeah, it's a real roll of the dice.

642
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:39,200
I had a great school, but there was definitely some questionable choices.

643
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,300
Hmm.

644
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,000
Right.

645
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:48,020
Well, look, if you want me to, I'll explain to you what the Vaz deference does and what the cowper's gland does off air, though.

646
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,400
I don't want to.

647
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,920
I don't know what the cowper's gland is.

648
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:59,900
I wrote I looked up what the cowper's gland does for a bit that I had Jason disgustingly do about seven years ago on stage.

649
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,640
And I have forgotten.

650
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,220
I will be OK.

651
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:03,900
Yeah.

652
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,740
But we have them to all three of us have cowper's.

653
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,900
I hope so.

654
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,500
I mean, I haven't I haven't had one removed.

655
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,040
I didn't like my cow.

656
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:14,600
Yeah.

657
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,980
Gland didn't like burst.

658
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:24,860
You know, if you had an aftermarket model, if you had gotten something replaced or swapped out synthetic cowper's gland.

659
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:26,780
Yeah.

660
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,700
Has science perfected this?

661
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,260
Maybe.

662
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:37,080
I mean, those like, you know, your any of your characters on fiction have a synthetic this like Winter Soldier have a synthetic cowper's gland.

663
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,160
Do we know they haven't gotten it?

664
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,660
They see they're not going to get into that.

665
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,580
Maybe in the 80s.

666
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:41,720
Yeah.

667
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,120
Maybe in the 80s they would have been certainly not now.

668
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:44,780
Yeah.

669
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:45,900
Yeah.

670
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:58,560
Despite this might be a zone where I know we're getting off of the movie a fair amount, but I was like, I can't resist asking if any of us have specific memories about.

671
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,460
How we did learn where babies come from.

672
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,740
Yes, I have absolutely know exactly how it went down.

673
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:06,740
Mm hmm.

674
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:17,640
And my memory of it is I might be combining two different explanation dumps by my mother in one conversation.

675
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,780
So I have a memory of asking two specific questions.

676
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,060
I don't know if I've said this in the show before.

677
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:27,760
Two questions in one two things that were bothering me that I didn't understand both at the same time.

678
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,620
I remember my mom sitting on the bed and explaining this stuff to me.

679
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:37,880
And the two questions were how am I you say like I'm related by blood to dad.

680
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:43,460
If I just came out of you, how do I actually have a relation to that?

681
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,820
That doesn't make sense to me.

682
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:49,100
How how would I be actually blood related to him if I just came out of you?

683
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:55,000
That doesn't make that question to Santa Claus doesn't actually.

684
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,580
Does not go bunch out at one ring toys for everyone.

685
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,000
Right.

686
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,440
That seems wrong.

687
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:05,300
Like my memory is both of those getting knocked out in one conversation.

688
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:11,180
I think they are probably around the same time in third grade that I come upon both of these.

689
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,940
I don't know if that's that's earlier than I got to any of this.

690
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,280
That's to either one.

691
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,540
I think it's their great could be third or fourth.

692
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,420
I think third or fourth for sure.

693
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:26,260
And yeah, my mom was like, I'm saying we're Santa Claus because I think I've said this on the show before.

694
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:31,040
My mom had to start retconning stuff after I was asking questions like I go, Mom, wait a minute.

695
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:36,200
If people don't have money, if they're poor like Santa doesn't does he bring them things?

696
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,280
Why wouldn't he just bring them things and then they wouldn't be poor anymore?

697
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,460
My mom's like, oh, we we have to pay Santa.

698
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,120
What?

699
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,840
I was like, oh, OK.

700
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:53,060
Like that lasted maybe another six months of my logic where I go, oh, OK, that seems odd.

701
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:58,400
It kind of takes the magic away of Santa leaves a bill after it's a service.

702
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,860
It's like Amazon Prime.

703
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:00,700
Yeah, yeah.

704
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:05,680
But I think that lasted that kept the fantasy alive for at least another month, few months.

705
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,940
But then that's a crazy one.

706
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,000
Then I could answer.

707
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:09,640
Good question.

708
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,240
Good answer.

709
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,420
You know, he was thinkers in the Carlson House.

710
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,340
Yeah, pretty good.

711
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:16,000
Pretty good lie to keep that ruse, the fun ruse going.

712
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:28,160
And then the other one was I just because my mom would say your blood, there's blood relation and then you can be related through like marriage and like you could have a step brother and you don't necessarily you're not related by blood.

713
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,140
So when she when introduced that concept, I started thinking.

714
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:41,420
And then my memory is she said, well, when you have a baby, you have the man puts his penis in the woman's vagina.

715
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,640
And she didn't explain sperm.

716
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,000
She didn't explain anything past that.

717
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,800
She just said that happens.

718
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,220
And then a baby, that's how a baby's created.

719
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,560
And I went, oh, OK, got it.

720
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,580
Oh, went for it with the with the words didn't even dance around.

721
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,160
I believe she said the words.

722
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:00,800
But yeah, she didn't say.

723
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:10,700
And then like some New York voicing like New York speaking sperm shoot and then like an egg that's all dolled up.

724
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,580
Lots of competing Brooklynites.

725
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:13,560
Yeah.

726
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,360
I didn't do a race in uterus city.

727
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,200
Yeah, you have sperm.

728
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:23,040
They're very overeager and they're very aroused and they all work at the docks.

729
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,900
They're all longshoremen sperm.

730
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,010
They're yeah, longshoremen and stevedores.

731
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,160
And yeah, I think the wow, wow, that's crazy.

732
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,140
That's a real like end of innocence all at once.

733
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:36,620
Yes.

734
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,380
Yeah.

735
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,600
You were said, were you asking where did I?

736
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:48,740
Yeah, I think I was slowly piecing stuff together throughout middle school.

737
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,860
And then I had OK.

738
00:43:51,040 --> 00:44:01,380
So so my school had seventh grade health class, eighth grade health class, nothing in ninth grade, tenth grade health class and seventh grade.

739
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:10,580
Looking back, it's a lot of the food pyramid and a lot of calculating cholesterol and blood pressure, which I don't know.

740
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,780
I would just get good at doing the worksheets.

741
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,340
I wouldn't retain the knowledge.

742
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:23,980
I still I know my blood pressure is usually fine if not low, but I anyway, unless it's laundry week.

743
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,460
Well, you know, I hate it.

744
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,700
I hate I hate cleaning.

745
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,260
I do.

746
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,740
So eighth grade health class, they're like, OK, sex, penis, vagina.

747
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,960
It was coed for one thing.

748
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:40,740
Like it was boys and girls in one class in fifth grade.

749
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:49,180
I believe the the girls were taken out of the class and had a presentation about like your body is changing.

750
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:54,100
And then they came back and we were all like reading magazines and playing board games.

751
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,340
It's like, what was that all about?

752
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,740
There was like, don't worry about it.

753
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:10,620
And then in tenth grade, that's the that was a class where the like kind of intense gym teacher is like, you have to use a condom, but didn't like like and with with

754
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:15,960
you have to use a condom and here are all the diseases you're going to be tested on that you could get.

755
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:23,800
But didn't say here are condoms or here you can buy them anywhere at any age with just money.

756
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,760
Like, I don't know.

757
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,180
Like they were weird about it.

758
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,420
They were they were prioritizing strange things.

759
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,420
So I need to know a condom dealer.

760
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:46,760
I kind of now finding out the logistical factors, the horse racing channel and cable would switch from horse racing to much more entertaining footage at about 11 o'clock midnight.

761
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,300
Most evenings.

762
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,480
So you are scrambled.

763
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,620
You're watching scrambled porno.

764
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,400
And that's how you figure out worse channel.

765
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,220
The whole channel once once trotting.

766
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,400
Once the trotting races ended, were they humans or horses?

767
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:00,420
Huh?

768
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,560
No, they were humans.

769
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,660
OK, huh?

770
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,740
So so you're saying that's you learn through scrambled porn how babies are made?

771
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,240
Well, no, I knew the logistics.

772
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,840
But like, what were you when you learn the stuff?

773
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,200
I think like 1314.

774
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:20,180
OK, wow.

775
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,020
The fun stuff.

776
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:28,580
You mean like when I would watch like a scrambled porn channel and it was like a woman in underwear, like posing on a couch for 45 minutes.

777
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,640
This is my recollection of what I was scrambled on our TV.

778
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,660
Now, it's well, look at this.

779
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:39,700
It depended on if you got the Playboy channel, which was softcore or the spice channel, which is disgusting.

780
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,960
It's just very it was like comically graphic.

781
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,760
Well, we're trotting after dark.

782
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:58,080
The night is to add that sometimes it would just be horse racing all night or it was Gilbert Godfrey's up all night when he would show a movie that was like beach party.

783
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,740
Aliens or something.

784
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:04,260
And it was like just an excuse for everyone to be like somewhat naked.

785
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:08,240
But as far as USA would let something out that air.

786
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,620
Right, right.

787
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:15,640
I so my my story with it was, I believe, fifth grade.

788
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:27,260
I like one of the strongest memories that I still retain was I was like beginning to put some pieces together and then some kid, some like jerky kid came up to me.

789
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,560
It was like, hey, check this out.

790
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:41,200
And he had a twig and he had a nut, not a nut like a peanut or the nut that Jason was referring to earlier, but like a, you know, like a nut and bolt nut.

791
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,260
And the nut has a hole in it.

792
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:47,220
And he took the twig and went back and forth.

793
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:47,940
Wow.

794
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,420
And then he ran away.

795
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,620
And I don't know why this was done.

796
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:56,120
But I like was just that was probably at lunch.

797
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,600
And then for all my classes, the rest of the day, I was like, wait, hmm.

798
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,920
There had to be you don't just do that.

799
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,420
That's got to mean something.

800
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:08,020
And by the end of the day, I sort of had maybe pieced it all together.

801
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:17,660
So when I got home, I said to my mom, hey, is sex when the guy puts his thing into the girl's thing?

802
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:18,660
Wow.

803
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,160
And then and she was not prepared for this.

804
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,280
She was frozen in her tracks.

805
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,960
And then it was like, give me give me a little time.

806
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,560
And then the day passed.

807
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:31,760
I did my homework.

808
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:32,620
Dinner passed.

809
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,360
And then Scott were ready.

810
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,260
And both of my parents were in what I were.

811
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,940
They were on what I call the serious couch.

812
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,420
It was the couch where we prayed, where we did the rosary.

813
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:43,860
Wow.

814
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,840
Where I where we went when I was in trouble.

815
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,860
And now for for this discussion.

816
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:54,320
And there was a book that they had had ready in case this were to come up.

817
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,300
And I don't remember much about that presentation.

818
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:02,060
It confirms what I thought about things, about things and things.

819
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:10,900
And mainly, I just remember the veneer of it being so creepy that I was like, well, I won't be going anywhere near this anytime soon.

820
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:11,560
Goodbye.

821
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,420
It was just that.

822
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:13,720
I don't know.

823
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,860
It all the serious couch.

824
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,680
It just like it mucked up my brain for a while.

825
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,480
But I was the twig guy really, really did it for me.

826
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,540
Thanks for spelling it out.

827
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,760
A very helpful diagram like in the CEPCOD movie.

828
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:32,800
Was your explanation clinical or was it more like what I got where it was like, these are the broad strokes of it?

829
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:39,960
But I think that I have blacked it out 100 percent.

830
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,100
There's no way to know.

831
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:54,960
You know, when you're getting the sex presentation from super Catholic parents, you you get red in the face as I'm getting again, even describing it.

832
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,740
And there's a lot of warnings about Opus Dei in there.

833
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:58,980
Strange.

834
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,400
I feel like my mom got away because I had asked about it early.

835
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,920
She got away with not having to be very detailed about it.

836
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:13,740
So I could know the gist, but I wasn't old enough to know, like, experience any feelings that were complicated.

837
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:29,220
So, like, I had the basic knowledge and then I could slowly understand it just on my own versus like asking when I was in seventh or eighth grade when, like, all of a sudden hormones are firing and I have to, like, navigate my own feelings in relation to it.

838
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,520
It's got to get more specific because you're like you're getting getting closer to something.

839
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,780
Yeah, a little a little kid, you would just have to explain the very basics of it.

840
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:44,860
But if somebody was like, yeah, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth grade, I feel like then you start to have to go.

841
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,760
And now you might feel certain ways.

842
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,120
And here's what you do with that.

843
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:51,680
And here's that being said, I never got any of that from either parent.

844
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:55,100
Some of that would have been nice if I if I think about it.

845
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,740
But I think most of our parents probably don't want to do it because it's uncomfortable.

846
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,600
And I get that.

847
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:05,300
But yeah, well, I want to steal from how your mom did this whole like giving you clues.

848
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:10,900
And then letting you go off and solve the mystery because I'm going to have to do this within the decade.

849
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:16,480
I need a plan at some point when the when the boy comes to me asking questions.

850
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,720
You've got a movie here, though, on YouTube.

851
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,020
You got a movie.

852
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:21,760
Yeah.

853
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,580
That I think might be perfect.

854
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:24,860
Oh, boy.

855
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,280
It is an option.

856
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,480
It is an option.

857
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:34,720
I think after my wife's reaction to it, I think there's no way that the making of me will be involved in the talk.

858
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,280
All right.

859
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:45,860
Well, when when making of me on Disney plus the new six part season one premieres in a few and a few years, maybe that'll be like perfectly timed and ready.

860
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:48,400
A new generation of making of me.

861
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:53,800
Maybe making of me is tied into the Ronald Moore see somehow.

862
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,580
Martin Short's character is a member of C.

863
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,320
That's my dad.

864
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,660
Barnabas T.

865
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:01,700
Bullion.

866
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:02,920
Yeah, that's yes.

867
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,240
The prospector.

868
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:08,340
Yeah.

869
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:09,620
Well, Disney updated.

870
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:10,340
Give me something.

871
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,340
Give me a movie.

872
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:16,280
You know, I'll play for a lifetime pass if you give me something to replace the talk.

873
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,060
I remembered one of the ways I pieced it together.

874
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:20,680
I think.

875
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:21,340
Oh, yeah.

876
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:26,240
I was very when I had to do papers in school.

877
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,000
I was a real I was a real encyclopedia kid.

878
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
We didn't have them at home, but I knew like I had to do a paper.

879
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:36,640
This is easy.

880
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,300
I'll just start with the encyclopedia.

881
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,100
And if not enough there, then I'll go to books.

882
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:52,600
But then sometimes you grab the, you know, the S encyclopedia and you just see like what's under here under sex or what's under here under penis or vagina.

883
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:56,520
And, you know, and that shit like that happens.

884
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:01,500
You just become a podcaster, you know, eventually you were really getting away with something there.

885
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:05,200
I mean, we all look at Brown on cycle.

886
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:16,880
I think we all looked up words in a dictionary, you know, see what's in their dictionaries were good to again all of this very cold and methodical.

887
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,660
Yeah, yeah, sure.

888
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:26,160
This was just I just I felt like we couldn't resist the, you know, the listeners have come to know us pretty well.

889
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:33,860
And now they know how the good boys or maybe why the good boys didn't graduate into good men.

890
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,880
Why there's stuntedness.

891
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,300
Oh, and down to the river to pray.

892
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:45,840
Yikes.

893
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,500
OK, well, back, back to the film.

894
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:54,040
So now we got to get the we got to get the parents together.

895
00:53:54,300 --> 00:54:00,220
And that's when we cut to where they finally meet and merge as a couple.

896
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:04,460
And it cuts to a fifties dance in full effect.

897
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:10,800
We're outside the gymnasium and there's people in big poofy dresses and there's a fifties car.

898
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:22,420
And we get into a scene where the fifties people are at the dance with different people and their future son needs to get them together.

899
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:31,840
And their future son is a floppy haired Canadian TV star who's worried that he won't exist unless he pushes his parents together at the fifties dance.

900
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:36,840
This is all I can't put my finger on it, but it's like this was trying to evoke something familiar.

901
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,080
I agree.

902
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,820
I couldn't I didn't know I have any.

903
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:44,540
Yeah, I didn't have any guess what I was imagining it was like seeming like.

904
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,000
But yeah, I hear you.

905
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:46,320
Yeah.

906
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:46,780
Very bad.

907
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,140
Hey, shout out 80s late 80s.

908
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,180
Martin Short had a heck of a head of hair on him.

909
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:52,760
That's true.

910
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:53,720
Yeah, yeah.

911
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:54,860
Pretty styling.

912
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:55,620
Absolutely.

913
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:05,620
Yeah, I did find a quote confirming that that Disney wanted this to think this thing to feel like a cross between Back to the Future and Nova.

914
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,340
Strange, strange things to cross.

915
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,080
Well, while you'd want to.

916
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:19,700
And in fact, the the fetus footage that comes not long after this spoiler is from Nova.

917
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,300
It's from the series Nova.

918
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:26,920
Disney did not commission specific other Disney branded fetus footage.

919
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:29,580
They just, yeah, reuse.

920
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,220
That is a little disappointing that they reuse the fetus footage.

921
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,040
Yeah, knowing it's a rerun.

922
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:35,480
Yeah, it is a bit of a let down.

923
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:43,120
So another thing with Disney trying to like skirt issues is that they're like, wait a minute.

924
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:48,760
So the whole thing this is about like these people are going to have a baby and we want to have this this dance scene.

925
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:54,620
But now that's high school and these we don't want to get into how are these people when they conceived and what have you.

926
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:58,480
So that is why this is not a high school dance.

927
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,580
This is a college dance.

928
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,020
You know, a college dance.

929
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,780
Those things that happen.

930
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:12,180
I rebuke my college, my sophomore college dance that I remember so well.

931
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:19,220
Yeah, I I'm sure they existed, but I didn't go to a college dance.

932
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,480
Nor do I recall that even being an option for me.

933
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:30,840
Perhaps in the fraternity sorority world, which if you can imagine that I, the good boy, was not mixed up in the fraternity world.

934
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,540
I was not involved in a fraternity either, believe it or not.

935
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:36,520
Shocker of shockers.

936
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:51,140
No, Ithaca had outlawed fraternities after someone died in the 80s and Cornell was rife with fraternities despite the fact that someone dies once a year.

937
00:56:53,520 --> 00:57:00,700
And in fact, the one or two frat parties I went to over at Cornell, sure enough, did feel like hell on earth.

938
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:01,780
Yeah.

939
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,140
Not my scene.

940
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:04,460
Yeah.

941
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:08,000
So we got to get the we got to get the couple together.

942
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,480
We got to get mom and dad together.

943
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:15,460
They they're dancing with with partners who they don't really seem to care for.

944
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:32,280
But then they notice the other from across the room and then and then slowly push their dates to the center of the room and are dancing close enough to see the other in this very creepy tableau of the like unwanted other partner.

945
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:37,340
Just being ballast getting in the way of the eventual birth of Merton Shore.

946
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:38,700
It's a very strange sequence.

947
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:39,480
Yes.

948
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:49,700
So before your mommy and daddy make you there will be a thing called dance cuckolding that goes on where you you dance with the one you came with.

949
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,440
But you are furious that you have to do that.

950
00:57:54,840 --> 00:58:01,820
But you try to do it while locking eyes with somebody else who is also there with someone else.

951
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,700
That is the decent thing to do.

952
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,040
It's what they do.

953
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,320
And you smash cut to it at a top hat wedding.

954
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,840
I like that choice.

955
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,440
The top hat wedding.

956
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,260
I think, you know, Martin's character from Father of the Bride.

957
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:25,620
I was thinking about Frank throughout because Frank's involved in the in the delivery later on and been Father of the Bride.

958
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:25,940
Right.

959
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:26,240
Yes.

960
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:26,460
Right.

961
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,240
And Frank to come in if we're going to have Martin's shirt playing multiple characters.

962
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,820
When is the first Father of the Bride?

963
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,620
Is it around this time?

964
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:35,220
Around here.

965
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:43,460
I mean, that makes sense that he's in the family like the Disney family when he's doing all these different Disney things.

966
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:50,720
Is he in Atlantis maybe or one of those one of those late era the ones that killed the animated movie?

967
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,240
Father of the Bride is 91.

968
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,160
So this is before it.

969
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:55,940
Oh, yeah.

970
00:58:55,940 --> 00:59:00,020
So Frank was just, you know, a gleam in his eye at that point.

971
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:02,460
I have this idea.

972
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,540
I don't know where to put it.

973
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,120
Just waiting for the right film to come along.

974
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,780
I mean, he's Jack Frost in Santa Claus 3.

975
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:09,680
Mm hmm.

976
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,420
Of course.

977
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,580
You know, he is in a lot of different Disney stuff.

978
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:14,780
Yeah.

979
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:21,140
Do you think that when he's making the making of me, is he like probably Clifford is in the can?

980
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:25,180
Is he like super cocky about it?

981
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:27,820
Is he talking about it every time they cut on making of me?

982
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,980
Is he like, yeah, so just wait on that release date.

983
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,660
Orion should be getting back to us any day now.

984
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:37,220
And I think it's look, it's my peewee.

985
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:37,760
What can I say?

986
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:38,480
It's my peewee.

987
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,800
I can't wait to be able to see it.

988
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,000
It's a good question.

989
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:47,060
There was a quote, I feel like, and maybe I'm going to get it totally wrong after he was on Malaney, the one season Malaney sitcom.

990
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:51,900
And like Malaney was like, yeah, I talked to Martin Schur and he was like, look, kid, you do some of these.

991
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:52,880
Sometimes people like it.

992
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,160
Sometimes they don't.

993
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:59,840
I feel like maybe he's got his just like a working man philosophy when it comes to people liking things.

994
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,120
I don't know if he had it back then.

995
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,500
Maybe Clifford broke him.

996
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:03,260
I'm not sure.

997
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:04,940
Brought him down a peg.

998
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:05,380
Yeah.

999
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:05,820
Yeah.

1000
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,460
I also don't.

1001
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:08,260
I want to make it clear.

1002
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:09,460
I love Martin Short.

1003
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:10,040
I'm not.

1004
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:10,800
I'm not goofing.

1005
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,480
Oh, yeah.

1006
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,620
But he's played some unnerving characters of all time.

1007
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,480
And I just remembered another one.

1008
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:21,400
The clip when he's in Mars Attacks and he's the horny presidential aide.

1009
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,160
And he gets I completely forgot about this scene.

1010
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:24,920
And I remember this.

1011
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:29,100
I go, oh, I saw this with my mom and it made me uncomfortable in the theater in 1996.

1012
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,760
Oh, I remember this.

1013
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,020
The other was like a couple of weeks ago.

1014
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:36,800
And I was like, oh, yeah, because he's hitting on the Lisa.

1015
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:41,760
I think Lisa Marie's actress's name who plays the very tall like Martian.

1016
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,140
Tim Burton's wife or girlfriend at the time at the time.

1017
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:45,580
Maybe.

1018
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:45,940
Yeah.

1019
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:47,380
Possible.

1020
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:49,960
And then, yeah, he takes her in like the secret.

1021
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,580
This is obviously very Clinton.

1022
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,240
Bill Clinton influenced like a secret sex room in the White House.

1023
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,960
And then he gets murdered by this Martian.

1024
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:05,720
Yeah, I remember I was having flashbacks to like, oh, I was sitting with my mother.

1025
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:12,140
One of the first PG 13 movies I was allowed to see in theaters and 96.

1026
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,220
I would have been 11.

1027
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:19,420
So that was probably an argument, like at least a minor fight of like, just let me see.

1028
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:20,700
Like, Dad's coming.

1029
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,700
You know, it's fine.

1030
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,040
Like it's a commercial.

1031
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:24,820
It's silly.

1032
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:27,340
Like, you know, it's kitschy.

1033
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:28,000
It's self-aware.

1034
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:29,080
We really funny.

1035
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:33,460
And my mom was like, all right, now that you've seen Mars attacks, we want to talk to you about how it really goes down.

1036
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:43,580
Now that you've seen Martin Short and the Martian, now we want to explain to you what he was feeling and what he was, you know, what you might eventually uncomfortable.

1037
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:47,260
Did you did she have to have a talk with you about Jack Frost?

1038
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:59,500
Like, so does just so when Jack Frost tries to if there's no Santa Claus, then when Jack Frost tries to freeze Santa Claus, he can't deliver toys anymore or or something or whatever.

1039
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:02,600
That's what I assume the plot of Santa Claus three is.

1040
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:10,540
Yeah, I think I think almost every Martin Short movie is a learning a chance for learning about sex in some way.

1041
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,540
You can apply it.

1042
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:18,940
Learning about something learning, you know, like how our audience had to learn that they are all Clifford's.

1043
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:19,220
Right.

1044
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,900
And they love it.

1045
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,720
The audience loves it across the board.

1046
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,220
They we've gotten a lot of great feedback.

1047
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,320
They are.

1048
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:27,800
I wouldn't be.

1049
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,300
We're the biggest Cliffords.

1050
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:30,400
Let's let's be true.

1051
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,380
We're the biggest.

1052
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,480
Well, that was the swing that Mike took.

1053
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:35,000
You said we're Cliffords.

1054
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:40,020
And then suddenly you made the leap to bring in thousands of other people in on.

1055
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:47,020
I saw the opportunity because for so long people haven't I don't think we've not decided on like a catchy little name.

1056
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:52,060
And I saw a really good marketing opportunity, I think, because I'm just that's how my brain works.

1057
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,140
I'm honestly think of a marketing opportunities.

1058
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,780
So it's got people talking.

1059
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:58,960
The socials are a buzz.

1060
01:02:59,120 --> 01:02:59,840
They love it.

1061
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,060
Yeah, they love it.

1062
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:02,220
I assume all good.

1063
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,800
It's not 50 50 for sure.

1064
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,960
It's certainly not 50 50 love and hate.

1065
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,160
Certainly not.

1066
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,740
OK, so let's see.

1067
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:12,180
So all right.

1068
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:13,840
So we get the we get the couple together.

1069
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:15,820
They get they get married.

1070
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:16,640
They have the top hat wedding.

1071
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:23,180
Then we got a little montage of what they're doing instead of having the baby rather water ski than have me.

1072
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,320
Yeah, they say.

1073
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,300
And, you know, so they have to go so the roads.

1074
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:31,940
This is a montage that for Aaron and I would be approximately 14 years long.

1075
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:32,740
Sorry.

1076
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,760
My apologies to the child.

1077
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:36,940
You got to do what you got to do.

1078
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:40,160
Go to theme parks a lot and then have a baby.

1079
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:44,280
So then they get together.

1080
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:48,160
Now we're in the bedroom, but we don't get to see any of that.

1081
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:57,180
We tilt up to the magical Amblin indoor sky where OK, so Mernchardt is being conceived.

1082
01:03:57,180 --> 01:04:01,120
But now adult Martin Short is up on top of a roof.

1083
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,040
He's giving them their privacy.

1084
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:06,180
So instead, he's just hovering above them.

1085
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,120
But he can hear.

1086
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:14,160
Yeah, unless they are very unless they're very quiet, unless they're doing it very gingerly.

1087
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:15,920
And maybe that is maybe that's the case.

1088
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,700
They just don't make any noise during it.

1089
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:19,200
But still, you're so close.

1090
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:25,740
If there was a window even cracked open, he's he's listening to some unpleasant noises at the very least.

1091
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:27,960
Well, it's a character played by Martin Short.

1092
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:32,240
So you know that the sex is like pretty, you know, loud and insane.

1093
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,200
I would have to think.

1094
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:33,740
Oh, yeah.

1095
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:35,560
Oh, boy.

1096
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,640
Oh, there's some mugging happening during the sex.

1097
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:40,320
Yeah, for sure.

1098
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:44,640
It's kind of high kicks and like crossing the line very quickly.

1099
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:46,480
A live performer for God's sake.

1100
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:51,700
I just watched a clip of him do a Frank Sinatra song with a Paul Schaefer orchestra from a couple of years ago.

1101
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:55,140
You know, this is like kind of an old time showbiz guy, too.

1102
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,160
So, yeah.

1103
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,900
So imagine him in the bedroom.

1104
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,320
He's got panache.

1105
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:01,140
Yeah, of course.

1106
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:03,520
This is interesting.

1107
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:06,120
It's really like he's he's seeing it all at once.

1108
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:09,100
You know, he exists while he's being conceived.

1109
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:15,980
It's like what's Jason, our favorite writer, one of our favorite writers, Grant Morrison.

1110
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:16,980
I talk about a lot.

1111
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:25,060
He talks about the hyper entity, which is if you could stand out of space and time and look at it all at once, you could see everything where everything came from.

1112
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:29,220
It was just this one long like this giant snake monster, this big rat king.

1113
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,420
Oh, yeah.

1114
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,260
Like a big, long comic strip.

1115
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:32,800
Yeah.

1116
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,040
Yeah.

1117
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,260
And this is sort of what Martin Short is doing right now.

1118
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:36,760
He's he's existing all at once.

1119
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:39,200
He's seeing the past, present and future.

1120
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:41,780
That's pretty trippy.

1121
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:45,860
I mean, why are we focused on actually birth is kind of boring and it happens all the time.

1122
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:50,600
I want to know how he got to this juncture where he has godlike powers.

1123
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:53,020
Very good time magically.

1124
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:53,560
Yeah.

1125
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:58,200
Well, look, Lauren pulls some strings and magic happens, you know,

1126
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:01,520
Lauren, some ritual, some fraternity ritual.

1127
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:05,660
Lauren was there and he he like made a deal with some sort of a demon.

1128
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,380
So Martin Short could travel through time and see everything.

1129
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,420
If you're in the SNL elite.

1130
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:12,020
Yeah.

1131
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:20,400
Lauren gives let you in on the secret of how you live for 5000 years, but only the you got to like more than four seasons.

1132
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,880
You got to have a couple of hit characters.

1133
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:22,900
Five Timers Club.

1134
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:24,840
They make it in there for sure.

1135
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:25,740
They get to be immortal.

1136
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:26,340
Yeah.

1137
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:30,640
You get to glimpse upon an elder god, an ancient one.

1138
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:31,500
Cursed.

1139
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:34,360
But you can't look too long or you will be driven insane.

1140
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:34,780
Right.

1141
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:35,140
Right.

1142
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:35,600
Danny.

1143
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:36,680
Danny's in the group.

1144
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:37,360
Billy.

1145
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:41,360
I guess as a Roth Cthulhu.

1146
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,340
They have to fake kill some of them sometimes like Buck Henry.

1147
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:46,480
But that was a false death.

1148
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,780
He that's just to throw people off the trail.

1149
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:49,560
But yeah, he's off.

1150
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,160
He's in a he's in a castle somewhere.

1151
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:52,140
Yeah.

1152
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:52,620
Yeah.

1153
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:52,900
Oh, yeah.

1154
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,640
You got that power.

1155
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:55,060
Yeah.

1156
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:55,300
Yeah.

1157
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,460
So we'll be we'll be in it.

1158
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:56,520
Yeah.

1159
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:00,040
He's still going to look like he still look very youthful even at 500.

1160
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:00,640
Yeah.

1161
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:05,260
He then says I'm going to recite some dialogue here again.

1162
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:08,680
Remember the sperm we said my dad had?

1163
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:10,040
I don't know.

1164
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:13,480
No, I don't.

1165
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:19,200
So it's something I can't imagine a lot of people say in casual conversation.

1166
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,180
Then let's read this all.

1167
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:31,000
But the truth is when two people are in love, one of the loveliest things they can do is be as close together as possible.

1168
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:32,140
They might kiss.

1169
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:33,260
They might hug.

1170
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:41,540
Another way that mature adults express their love for each other is to get so close that the man's sperm actually enters the woman's body.

1171
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:53,460
Yes, I also took note of this phrasing because, again, very careful to say so much and not anything at all at the same time.

1172
01:07:54,140 --> 01:08:00,060
It's yeah, it's like really trying to make sure that like if you're little, it goes right over your head.

1173
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:02,020
And it's it's that thing.

1174
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:04,140
If it's me, third grade, that's going over my head.

1175
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:08,100
But you guys, when you learned you might have maybe figured that out a little more.

1176
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,500
You could piece it together.

1177
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:13,880
You had the memory of like, I know where it comes from, so I know where it has to go.

1178
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,460
So that's not to jump ahead.

1179
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:20,320
But if you haven't seen this film, they do.

1180
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:25,880
There is not then a scene around the corner where they show a penis thrusting into a vagina.

1181
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:29,500
It doesn't become scrambled trot channel after dark.

1182
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,860
Not two horses going at it.

1183
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:39,480
No, there's no horse racing into like a sequence of scrambled of like a guy like high fiving like, yes, dude, no, guess what?

1184
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,140
It's not the Simpsons fuzzy bunny joke.

1185
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:44,580
Oh, yes.

1186
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:45,020
Yeah, yeah.

1187
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,500
One of the best children.

1188
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:47,400
Yeah, yeah.

1189
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:48,640
She's faking it.

1190
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:50,660
So they don't really.

1191
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,440
Yeah, they don't get into then then what happens.

1192
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:58,300
But I think something like I think there is something about the ambleniness and the creepiness of all that.

1193
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:02,440
Like it was around this point I turned to Erin while watching with her and she was a gas.

1194
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:04,240
She was pale white.

1195
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,380
Someone who is not uncomfortable.

1196
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:10,780
I look like I've had sex with her as we have baby again.

1197
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,220
There's not a person who is too.

1198
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:14,260
I've found to be uncomfortable with these areas.

1199
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:18,220
I don't think I've ever seen her so offended by something as this.

1200
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:25,680
She was just so creeped out by the general veneer of this film by the by the dancing, the loveliest things they can do.

1201
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:30,680
I think the lack of suggestive language around this point, she called it filth.

1202
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:32,380
She said this is filth.

1203
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:35,760
This should have never been anywhere in an amusement park.

1204
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:41,620
I don't remember the bit, but there's a pat and I was a bit about how like cleaning up filth makes it way creepier.

1205
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:44,800
And I don't remember the details of it, but he likes it.

1206
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:50,980
He takes like dirty material and then he like puts in like network censored words for things.

1207
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:52,320
Oh, yeah.

1208
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:55,460
It's so much stranger and more bizarre and creepy.

1209
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:56,320
Yes.

1210
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:57,020
Yeah.

1211
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:15,840
Similar, I feel like to this where it lets me know that if I had said, you know, a little while ago, you know, Aaron, when two people are in love, one of the loveliest things they can do is be as close together as possible.

1212
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:21,100
If I had said that verbatim as a pickup line, that is what happened.

1213
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:22,020
There'd be no baby.

1214
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:23,460
Do you want to do?

1215
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:24,960
Do you want to do a lovely thing?

1216
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,280
The making of a divorce.

1217
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:31,400
Oh, man, baby.

1218
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,060
I want to get as close to you as possible.

1219
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:35,840
We might kiss.

1220
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:36,820
We might hug.

1221
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,200
I second hug second in the list.

1222
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,180
I know we might even hug.

1223
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:47,100
I learned everything I know about sex from this one video Epcot Center.

1224
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,640
I got to get close to you.

1225
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:50,440
Very close.

1226
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,440
Super close.

1227
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:58,880
I saw that when I was a kid, but now I'm a mature adult and I want to express lovely love.

1228
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,520
You know, I was saying my dad had all that sperm.

1229
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,320
That's sperm.

1230
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,220
My dad had.

1231
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:07,480
I got it.

1232
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:12,060
He still has some, but he doesn't need it as much as when he needed it to make me.

1233
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:15,080
And now I've got the sperm and it's lovely.

1234
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,140
I just got the captain now.

1235
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,500
I just got to get very close to you.

1236
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:21,640
How close?

1237
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,060
Well, that's close as we can do.

1238
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,940
And I still because all my info is from this.

1239
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:27,740
I still don't know.

1240
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:28,900
All right, let's do it.

1241
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:29,840
Let's get close.

1242
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:30,960
Here we are.

1243
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:31,600
We've kissed.

1244
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:32,500
We've hugged.

1245
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:38,800
I assume that some sperm is now in you and I'll see you at the delivery room.

1246
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:40,420
Wraps that thing up.

1247
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,720
The delivery of you remember the sperm?

1248
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,400
My dad had it.

1249
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,480
It said so offhandedly.

1250
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:55,580
It sounds like I think like if you're like padding your pot, like do you have a lighter?

1251
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,560
Do you have a light or like, hey, do you have a quarter for the meter?

1252
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:02,260
I thought it's not one of the ones that takes credit cards.

1253
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,580
Yeah, it's very casual.

1254
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:06,680
It's a very casual.

1255
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:09,020
Yeah.

1256
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:11,180
It's odd.

1257
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:11,920
I don't.

1258
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,860
I don't even want to throw it out to somebody on the street.

1259
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:19,600
If you're, you know, like socializing is going to be weird once we're out of quarantine and we're going to need icebreakers.

1260
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:23,240
We can't just talk about did we get Pfizer or Moderna over and over again?

1261
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:24,760
We need new stuff to talk about.

1262
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:30,180
So, hey, remember before all that were two years ago, I was talking about that sperm.

1263
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,020
My dad had.

1264
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,140
A good book story quarantine.

1265
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,180
Do you ever remember that sperm?

1266
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,160
My dad had.

1267
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:44,600
That's a week.

1268
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:51,340
We could all in a way like I don't know, like there could be a photos of us that say underneath the sperm.

1269
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:55,980
My dad had like we we are the products of the sperm.

1270
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:57,340
I want an egg as to get.

1271
01:12:57,340 --> 01:13:01,460
So you have to include that, you know, we all equal the sperm.

1272
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,640
Our dad had and the egg.

1273
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:04,860
Our mom had.

1274
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:07,460
It's really lovely when you think about it.

1275
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:08,020
Oh, yeah.

1276
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:09,840
When you say it like that, it's lovely.

1277
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:11,820
I think this is one of the loveliest episodes.

1278
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:13,160
It's one of the loveliest.

1279
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,940
It's one of the nice music under this too.

1280
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,560
Where it just be so nice.

1281
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:20,720
Such a nice thing to think of.

1282
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:21,580
Well, it's a shame.

1283
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,080
It's just so crass.

1284
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:32,200
And like again, like learning the true name of God, like you start to unravel a little hearing it because it is the sort of phrase that it's like that is such an odd phrasing.

1285
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,340
We'd love to put it on a T public shirt.

1286
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:37,060
You know, we haven't had a new shirt in a while.

1287
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:37,640
That'd be good.

1288
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:38,640
But just far.

1289
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:39,920
No, no.

1290
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:42,080
You know, I'm going to say no.

1291
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:44,000
I'm going to veto that on air.

1292
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:44,740
It's a retro.

1293
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,440
I've got mania out there.

1294
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:47,880
People love every little bit.

1295
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:49,040
They want a shirt with smart one.

1296
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:50,240
They want a shirt with figment.

1297
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:56,500
I'm sure that says remember the sperm my dad had a little cartoon Martin Short on a roof.

1298
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:05,200
If they could, you know, cut at the gardens, the galaxy cosmic rewind is going to have nods to old Epcot.

1299
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,240
Then maybe there's a place for it.

1300
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:09,340
There is.

1301
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,880
I will say this now that I'm thinking about it.

1302
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,680
There is a sperm joke in the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie.

1303
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,260
Well, a black light joke.

1304
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:17,200
I mean, it's a black light joke.

1305
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,160
I've seen it about 50 movies, but there is there.

1306
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:23,140
So it is appropriate for the level.

1307
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:29,180
So maybe we could get a little nod to making a me, you know, as it maybe it launches.

1308
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,520
Maybe it's a little bit of a launch.

1309
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:31,720
I think it launches backwards.

1310
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,480
In fact, that's what I heard is a rumor.

1311
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:36,980
Time to launch you like the sperm my dad had.

1312
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:41,040
I was telling you about that sperm my dad had.

1313
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,820
Here's a cosmic rewind for you.

1314
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,020
The sperm my dad had.

1315
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:52,840
Look, kid, tantric stuff takes a lot of practice and you can do it, but it's not a joke.

1316
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:58,780
Oh, man, you got get it in there.

1317
01:14:58,880 --> 01:14:59,680
People are dying.

1318
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:03,740
There's oh, people are clamoring for the sperm.

1319
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,740
The sperm Martin for its dad had.

1320
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:06,540
That's right.

1321
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,040
Imagine it hasn't opened yet.

1322
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:11,200
Let's get it in.

1323
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:15,740
So then I was going to say we moved into like into the cartoon.

1324
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:16,860
But first, there's a lie.

1325
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:23,220
And the lie is all of us came to be because their parents made love, allowing the sperm and the egg to meet.

1326
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:23,940
Lie.

1327
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,220
That's not true.

1328
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:26,100
There's fertilization.

1329
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:31,160
There's lots of there's people who then the parent is out of the picture.

1330
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,160
There's so is it.

1331
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:33,480
There's so much going on.

1332
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:36,640
What do you mean all of us came to be?

1333
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,980
That one.

1334
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,920
You can't let that slide.

1335
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:47,040
So with the lie is a transition, we go into the wacky sperm cartoon when it began.

1336
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:49,540
Erin had the question, is this John Kay?

1337
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:55,560
And thank God it's not John Kay, because, boy, we delve into even a deeper, darker territory.

1338
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:03,580
The cartoon I looked up, it was it was done by the animation director was Bill Croyer, who's the director of Fern Gully,

1339
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:10,460
The Last Rainforest, and also the animated intro sequences of both Christmas Vacation and True Beverly Hills.

1340
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:11,120
Oh, wow.

1341
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,040
Now, like you said, you called the sperm cute.

1342
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:14,380
I did.

1343
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,100
I do think the sperm sequence is cool.

1344
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:17,560
It totally has that vibe.

1345
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:23,400
Like the thing that doesn't happen anymore when the live action movie had the animated intro, I tended to like those a lot.

1346
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:26,320
And I there's like a real spirited vibe to those.

1347
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,840
And I feel that in in this a little bit.

1348
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:32,200
Is this the best part of the whole thing?

1349
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,280
Hmm.

1350
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:38,560
I'd say so, because we're not having to watch the parents bring their bodies close.

1351
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:39,080
Yeah.

1352
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:41,760
There's no no magical, lovely skies.

1353
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:42,220
Yeah.

1354
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:44,280
It's nice to see a cartoon after all this.

1355
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:45,880
I think maybe it is.

1356
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:46,060
Yeah.

1357
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:47,200
Maybe that's the best part.

1358
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:53,800
But pretty insane that this is a Disney attraction that has a sign that says uterus city limits.

1359
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:00,380
How in the world would they ever allow this now?

1360
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:02,580
I bet this really is so funny.

1361
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:09,960
Because I even at the time, it would seem like it seemed we really seem insane to put this in that somebody go, what is Jason said?

1362
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:10,800
Like, what are we doing?

1363
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:11,520
Why are we?

1364
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:12,080
Yeah.

1365
01:17:12,220 --> 01:17:12,540
Why?

1366
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:12,880
Yeah.

1367
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:13,560
Why would you?

1368
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:14,680
Why would you do this?

1369
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:19,520
But I guess I guess they really wanted to stick with the mission of like educating the youth.

1370
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:20,940
Yeah.

1371
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:27,980
And what it is is that a ball your sperm gear up for a race to be the to be the uterus city champions.

1372
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,040
You get they also they all get going.

1373
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:34,840
And the winner gets to make a baby.

1374
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,480
What happens to the losers?

1375
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:39,180
And then like a like a kaput.

1376
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:40,120
Yeah.

1377
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:41,020
Gesture.

1378
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,060
So now everybody knows.

1379
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:46,340
Well, this is it is like, you know, you do kind of like the sperm.

1380
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:46,980
They're they're fun.

1381
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:47,660
They're hopping around.

1382
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:48,720
Mike even called them cute.

1383
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:53,140
So to think that these are probably the quickest dead Disney characters in history.

1384
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:01,440
the precursor to minions.

1385
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,940
He's making me sperm, I think.

1386
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:04,620
Yeah.

1387
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,440
Now, Universal will not be doing a making of minions movie.

1388
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:12,820
But thanks to the wonders of the Internet, you can find all about.

1389
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:17,500
I would like to know.

1390
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:24,760
I think the minions as your guides through the reproductive reproductive process would be a great way to learn.

1391
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:28,160
It'd be very I just figured I'd teach the teach the kid.

1392
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:28,540
Great.

1393
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:35,360
But OK, so the race is on and then it pans over to the to to Miss Egg.

1394
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:37,160
Hello, Miss Egg.

1395
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,260
She is sexy.

1396
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:39,440
She's sassy.

1397
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,160
She's got a ponytail.

1398
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:45,880
She looks at her watch like what's the trouble, boys?

1399
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,620
Why aren't you here yet?

1400
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:50,700
Very again, really odd.

1401
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:52,920
This Lady Egg character.

1402
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:58,400
And then when they all get close, when they finally like it, like a lot of them are dropping off along the way,

1403
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:00,800
they're they're expending their energy too early.

1404
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:01,780
And this is a marathon.

1405
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:04,640
You have to like be in it for the long haul.

1406
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,820
So like we're losing them.

1407
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,100
And then you got to they got to get up over a hill.

1408
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:12,280
And she finally sees some sperm cresting the hill.

1409
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:16,620
So she puts on an apron with a target on it.

1410
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,460
What did you miss that part?

1411
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:21,540
I am in the moment.

1412
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:22,480
I'm forgetting it.

1413
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:33,280
Why does this all this whole sequence is like, OK, when the sperm meet the egg, it's like a USO skit that they would see on like on the deck of an aircraft carrier.

1414
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:36,880
That's the sketch that Al Franken did when he was in the US.

1415
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:39,120
Oh, geez, geez.

1416
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:40,680
Oh, man.

1417
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:41,460
All right.

1418
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:41,760
Sorry.

1419
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:43,000
Maybe he wrote this.

1420
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:44,520
We don't really know who wrote it.

1421
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:45,780
We don't know him.

1422
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:51,420
The well, that we die actually do know who wrote it, but we'll talk about that later.

1423
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:52,080
Oh, great.

1424
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:52,640
OK.

1425
01:19:53,720 --> 01:20:00,760
Oh, I forgot that the first step of the race is having to pick a tube and their labels left fallopian tube, right fallopian tube.

1426
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:05,660
A lot of them a lot of them lose just by plowing right into the middle, not making a decision quickly enough.

1427
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,220
But she's put on her target.

1428
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:11,560
She is ready to get plowed into by a sperm.

1429
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:13,980
It's really crazy.

1430
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:16,220
It would be like showing a porno in there.

1431
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,620
You'd be like, this is fucked up.

1432
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:18,840
But OK, I OK.

1433
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:22,180
Well, it's a clinical understanding of how this happened.

1434
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,000
Yes.

1435
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,580
As long as there's not too much goofy setup, as long as it's straight out, just straight.

1436
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:34,680
You just want to read like there's something to you about the unadorned nature of a pornography film that would be more acceptable to you.

1437
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,500
Well, it depends.

1438
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:42,540
It would have to be like a soft lens and maybe it's one of the ones where people are married and there's no shenanigans.

1439
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:43,460
You know what I'm saying?

1440
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:48,080
You hate those porno shenanigans.

1441
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:49,680
Yeah, there's just a lot of shenanigans.

1442
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,040
You try to find one where they're playing a married couple.

1443
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:53,360
The nice thing.

1444
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,940
I want all the porns that I watch.

1445
01:20:57,380 --> 01:21:03,460
There is a screenshot of the marriage license at the beginning so that I know.

1446
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:04,280
Me too.

1447
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:13,560
The sperm knows that he's the way like he looks back.

1448
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:14,460
There's no competition.

1449
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,080
He kind of hops over.

1450
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:22,400
He doesn't even bother with the cutting the ribbon, the ribbon that's there before target apron egg girl.

1451
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,820
He just hops over it and he knows this is his time.

1452
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:26,640
He's going to do it.

1453
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:35,300
He sprays his breath with little breath spray and he just collides in and they both explode into smoke.

1454
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:41,900
And that is how that's how a me is made involves breath spray, a target apron.

1455
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:43,000
Here's a list.

1456
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:44,680
Here's a list of supplies.

1457
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:46,860
If you want to make a me, I'm trying to think.

1458
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,500
I mean, I, you know, plus it up again.

1459
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:49,460
We shouldn't be plus thing.

1460
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:50,700
This probably is not going to come back.

1461
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:51,500
We should probably burn it down.

1462
01:21:51,580 --> 01:22:01,600
But if I have to plus it up, maybe it's like a sugar rush from Wreck-It Ralph and all the sperm are driving little cars maybe toward the egg.

1463
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:05,980
And the egg is the victory like the victory line or whatever you call a finish line.

1464
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,320
Yeah, I like I like that.

1465
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:14,620
And look, all the there's all these Pixar movies, all the P doctors are all about like different metaphysical.

1466
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:17,760
Here's the representations of things in your body.

1467
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,680
Why not do let's bring the let's bring the sperm.

1468
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:21,360
The full sperm's back.

1469
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,900
Let's do the full sperm's movie.

1470
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:23,860
I think that's right.

1471
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:25,560
I think that then they own it.

1472
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:26,660
You know, it's not a stretch.

1473
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:27,380
They love I.

1474
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:27,640
P.

1475
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:28,880
They love reusing I.

1476
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:29,040
P.

1477
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:29,620
these days.

1478
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:40,000
So I think I would like a movie that's all about like because a lot of the Pixar characters are dealing with like, you know, but I want to be more than I know I have this purpose that I'm stuck to.

1479
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:42,520
But I want to transcend that and see what else is out there.

1480
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:51,960
So you like really get to know the plight of sperm and you follow him to the day and then there's the race and there's five million other ones and he dies.

1481
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:53,980
Yeah, and that's the end of the movie.

1482
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:58,980
Yeah, it goes 60 miles an hour and head first into a goddamn diaphragm or something.

1483
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:01,800
Just like a leader of the pack.

1484
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:09,740
Oh, where oh where can my baby be?

1485
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:13,320
The Lord took away from me.

1486
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:16,160
Oh, no.

1487
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:19,540
Head first into a condom.

1488
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:21,460
Tied on impact.

1489
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:24,400
So that's that.

1490
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:29,240
And then we get our our majestic fetus footage courtesy of Nova.

1491
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:46,240
The the you see them go to a movie theater where everyone is laughing nonstop, not waiting for jokes to laugh at, but just laughing and laughing straight through while everyone in the theater is smoking a cigar.

1492
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:48,240
This is a very bizarre theater.

1493
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:56,520
Yes, they're extremely distressing in Koba times to watch this like so much smoke flying around the room.

1494
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:58,720
The baby's coughing Martin Shurtz.

1495
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:00,020
Like, get me out of there, Mom.

1496
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:03,420
And they do the day the dad wants to stay.

1497
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:09,140
He wants to keep watching this nonstop polarity and choking on 100 other people's smoke.

1498
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:11,440
But he agrees to leave for the sake of the baby.

1499
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:22,620
I don't know what I feel like when Martin Shurtz would have been gestating, doctors still would have been recommending like four out of five doctors would have still been recommending Chesterfield's for your T zone.

1500
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:25,060
Like cigarettes is good.

1501
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:31,700
I don't know that that feels like a very 1988 89 thing of like secondhand smoke.

1502
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:32,520
Not great.

1503
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:35,880
You know, that's slightly new.

1504
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:37,300
It's revisionist.

1505
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:38,180
Yeah, yeah.

1506
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:41,800
Yeah, they're like, you know, your baby's hair is going to be longer and thicker.

1507
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:46,380
The more smoke it gets straight into the womb.

1508
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,500
So they so they leave.

1509
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:53,160
And then pretty soon, I think we're at we're at delivery.

1510
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:55,420
The baby is delivered.

1511
01:24:55,900 --> 01:25:00,120
I mean, this is like I could certainly could not have handled this at nine years old.

1512
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:05,920
I'm seeing the like because it's a pretty realistic depiction of the baby coming.

1513
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:11,760
This is not the sitcom version where I have like perfect year and a half year old is handed to the mother.

1514
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:18,100
You know, it's a it's a it's a graphic sticky display.

1515
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:19,520
It's like a gross baby.

1516
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:19,940
Right.

1517
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,040
Am I like that's like an extra.

1518
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:24,960
It does seem like like a baby xenomorph or something.

1519
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:30,820
Just the way, especially because of the like bootleg nation, the bootleg nature of the video as well.

1520
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:32,680
I can't quite see what it looks like.

1521
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:35,260
So it does look like it's like a baby alien or something.

1522
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:39,540
Maybe on a fully restored print.

1523
01:25:39,620 --> 01:25:44,440
Maybe it doesn't look that crazy, but it's like this baby is pale blue.

1524
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:45,400
It was very.

1525
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

1526
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:48,800
It's like a little avatar baby or something.

1527
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:49,840
A little not be God.

1528
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:51,140
Yeesh.

1529
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,940
And you know, this also like Aaron is watching this aghast.

1530
01:25:55,960 --> 01:26:00,040
She's just like, Jesus, they showed this and I'm like, you know, we did this.

1531
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:01,620
This was we had to do this.

1532
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:07,920
And we both agreed watching this in this movie was more unpleasant than doing it in real life.

1533
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:09,800
The baby looked grosser.

1534
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:12,360
There's also something about when it's yours.

1535
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,580
You're like, you know, they warn you that the baby is going to be gross when they come out.

1536
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:18,680
Not in our case, because our baby is so great.

1537
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,160
It was adorable to us.

1538
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:23,220
You see photos later like Jesus.

1539
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:24,680
Oh, my God.

1540
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:33,200
Well, imagining the walkie talkie chatter on like the on the set of just like, Hi, Glen wants more goo for the baby.

1541
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:35,760
OK, flying in the goo, flying in the placenta goo.

1542
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:38,320
Flying in.

1543
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,340
How do they do it?

1544
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:46,260
Sound like is this is this a baby that is has things has goo applied?

1545
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,440
How do they do newborns?

1546
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:56,880
Is it a good up for month old or is it a an animatronic or just like a still baby model?

1547
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,840
They shake a lot to convince you that it's alive.

1548
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,240
This one looked pretty real and I think has a credit on IMDb.

1549
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:05,140
Oh, yes.

1550
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:05,780
Maybe.

1551
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:17,440
But the actress, though, like when then it then she's a little bit grown and visits Martin Short in the hospital, bringing the loop to a close.

1552
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:25,200
Or did that baby have like a two month period where it worked a lot like it had like 30 credits for two months?

1553
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:33,220
Well, actually, can I ask, are we getting to the end with the the is the next thing the girl in the hospital?

1554
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:34,620
I think so.

1555
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:34,980
Yeah.

1556
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:37,220
Can you explain to me?

1557
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,120
This is where I lost the thread.

1558
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:40,780
Like I lost the timeline.

1559
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:50,860
Is this the mother child mother traveling forward in time to see her future child Martin Short as a baby?

1560
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:52,460
Is that what's happening?

1561
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:53,380
Yeah.

1562
01:27:53,420 --> 01:28:01,300
So the movie began with Martin Short seeing his father as a baby, which is the beginning of his story.

1563
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:05,860
So now we've looped around and it's the beginning of the girl's story.

1564
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:10,020
She says, here's my dad as a baby.

1565
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:13,900
It's it's all set one generation back.

1566
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:18,520
Well, but she's starting a new making of me that we don't get to see all of.

1567
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:19,140
Thank God.

1568
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:24,020
So that's Martin Short's movie daughter seeing.

1569
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:26,780
But so we haven't met that daughter before.

1570
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:28,460
Oh, wait, that's right.

1571
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:29,220
Yeah.

1572
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,260
See, this is where it starts to get confusing.

1573
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:34,040
And it's not Martin Short's actual daughter.

1574
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:35,020
I looked that up.

1575
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:39,200
No, no, it's yeah.

1576
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:41,600
No, we're just jumping ahead to.

1577
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:44,280
But it is the same order of events, right?

1578
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:47,580
It's just it's a kid now instead of a grown Martin Short.

1579
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,160
Right.

1580
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,360
Yeah.

1581
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:53,160
But she's seeing her own father as a baby.

1582
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:58,020
If we're really following the pattern, though, she should be an adult woman saying.

1583
01:28:59,040 --> 01:28:59,540
Correct.

1584
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:00,100
That.

1585
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:00,540
Yeah.

1586
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:01,520
Yeah.

1587
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:01,760
Yeah.

1588
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:02,840
OK, that's what I think.

1589
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:03,940
That's the confusion, right?

1590
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:07,180
If it was a little confusing to go from a baby to a kid.

1591
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:12,700
And then that's not the because the baby is Martin Short and the kid.

1592
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,900
And it would have been so much more clear if Martin Short had just played the seven year old girl, too.

1593
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:18,860
Obviously.

1594
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:22,240
Oh, well, that yes, that is what we all want.

1595
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:25,520
Child Martin Short should be a child doll.

1596
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:27,340
A fetus.

1597
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:27,780
It should have been.

1598
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:28,420
Why did they do?

1599
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:29,840
Why did they use this Nova footage?

1600
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,340
Why wasn't it Martin Short?

1601
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:32,800
Oh, like wrinkled up.

1602
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,200
We know he's a contortionist.

1603
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:36,740
He would have eaten up playing a fetus.

1604
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:43,300
Yeah, it would have been a lot like Ace Ventura, too, with the rhino or something like he's just like gooey and like trying to climb out of something.

1605
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:46,920
Yeah, Martin Short is the baby covered in goo like the rhino.

1606
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:47,540
Yeah.

1607
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:48,500
Yeah.

1608
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,220
Every and he should have been the mom, too.

1609
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:52,260
He should have been clearly should have been everybody.

1610
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:55,940
He should have definitely done an Eddie Murphy, a nutty professor in this.

1611
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:56,640
Yeah.

1612
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,420
And there's still time you could still.

1613
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:00,800
He's not doing play.

1614
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:01,400
JPEC.

1615
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:01,860
JPEC.

1616
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:04,060
We're redoing Epcot Center now.

1617
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:05,520
We're redoing Epcot.

1618
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:11,740
And, you know, there's an opportunity here somewhere to get this back into the park.

1619
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,920
You know, I just heard that Club Cool is returning.

1620
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:16,240
It was taken out.

1621
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:18,420
It was taken away, but they're going to put it somewhere else now.

1622
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:19,280
I don't remember.

1623
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:21,560
I don't quite remember what Club Cool was.

1624
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,140
I don't know.

1625
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:27,140
I guess this is not of important.

1626
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:28,580
It absolutely is an important.

1627
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:29,520
It is important.

1628
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,400
Oh, man.

1629
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:31,380
This is not fake.

1630
01:30:31,420 --> 01:30:32,900
I swear to you, this is not fake.

1631
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:34,460
Then what's Club Cool?

1632
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:34,900
Convince me.

1633
01:30:34,940 --> 01:30:38,880
Club Cool, it's one of the few free things at Disney World.

1634
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,800
You could sample sodas from all around the world.

1635
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:42,460
I know it's that.

1636
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,820
I know about that.

1637
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:47,060
With Beverly, that horrible drink, Beverly.

1638
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:50,900
Ligenberry soda, right?

1639
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:51,780
Yeah.

1640
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:52,440
Lincolnberry.

1641
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:52,940
Ligenberry.

1642
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,400
Thank you for the right pronunciation.

1643
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:58,760
I knew there was a thing where you could sample foreign sodas.

1644
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:00,760
I didn't know it was called Club Cool.

1645
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:06,200
And I have just condemned myself to an endless episode of Club Cool.

1646
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:07,740
I know how this podcast works.

1647
01:31:07,740 --> 01:31:11,820
People are going to be fucking psyched for Club Cool episode.

1648
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:13,080
Trust me.

1649
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:16,060
I like people being happy.

1650
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:23,120
This is not like us doing a Patreon about the Aerosmith Pink video or something.

1651
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:25,540
This is what people are excited about, I think, Club Cool.

1652
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:28,260
Fine.

1653
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:29,440
Club Cool is coming.

1654
01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:31,200
Okay.

1655
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:33,720
But so, yeah, we're at the end of the film.

1656
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:35,680
We've closed the loop.

1657
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:39,360
Jason, you were saying that the makers of this film.

1658
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:40,480
Yeah.

1659
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:41,300
Okay.

1660
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:47,440
So writing and directing credit goes to a guy named Glenn Gordon Carone.

1661
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:52,240
He was a producer for Moonlighting and Medium.

1662
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:54,760
Created these series.

1663
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:55,600
That's crazy.

1664
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,540
I didn't know he was the same creator of both of those shows.

1665
01:31:58,980 --> 01:31:59,200
Bull.

1666
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:01,220
He's a producer on Bull.

1667
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:02,760
Currently on the air.

1668
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:05,000
He directed numerous episodes of Bull.

1669
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:06,680
He directed the pilot for Medium.

1670
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:07,860
And I may have said this before.

1671
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:13,380
If you direct the pilot of a TV show, you get money every time they keep making the TV show.

1672
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:13,680
Right.

1673
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:17,700
One of those coveted jobs in Hollywood.

1674
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:22,040
And he has a written by credit for an episode of Taxi.

1675
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:22,820
Geez.

1676
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:23,400
Nice.

1677
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:23,920
Career.

1678
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:24,360
Yeah.

1679
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:25,040
Wow.

1680
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:26,240
Cool career.

1681
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:32,460
And don't forget, he rakes it in from having directed the film Wilder Napalm.

1682
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:39,680
You know, Wilder Napalm with Dennis Quaid, Deborah Winger and written by Vince Gilligan.

1683
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:47,620
You know, Breaking Bad Mania caused such a reverse swell backwards into Wilder Napalm.

1684
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:48,720
Of course.

1685
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:49,580
Yeah.

1686
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:52,320
We're still in the crater of it.

1687
01:32:53,280 --> 01:33:06,480
He also, I think, though, maybe sucks because he, this director, because he fired Eliza Dushku in a sexual harassment kerfuffle with the star of Bull, Michael Weatherly.

1688
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:07,260
Oh, no.

1689
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:08,520
Do you remember anything from this story?

1690
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:09,280
Yeah.

1691
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:11,280
I didn't know that was that show.

1692
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:12,480
I think that's this.

1693
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:15,180
Yeah, it's Bull and it's this guy maybe.

1694
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:18,580
And I like he was on tape saying bad stuff about her.

1695
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:22,580
This guy didn't harass, but he took the harassers side.

1696
01:33:22,740 --> 01:33:26,520
And I believe Eliza Dushku sued and got a lot of money.

1697
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:30,300
I think I might be getting some facts wrong about that.

1698
01:33:31,980 --> 01:33:34,020
So, look, I don't know.

1699
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:35,440
These are some good shows and everything.

1700
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:37,700
That's going to taint my feeling about this movie forever.

1701
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:46,100
This magical film that perfectly summarizes the loveliness of body closeness.

1702
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:46,540
Yeah.

1703
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:55,340
I'm going to remove my half awake description of quite a career and replace it.

1704
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:56,720
That's still true.

1705
01:33:56,860 --> 01:33:57,300
We just did.

1706
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:58,040
That's true.

1707
01:33:58,160 --> 01:33:58,840
Unfortunate.

1708
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:00,500
An unfortunate arc.

1709
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:13,660
I don't like I feel like maybe you guys don't share my I don't want to sound like I'm like this is like some sort of moral panic thing for me.

1710
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:23,260
I just know, boy, watching my wife get a gasp at this film, I don't think I've ever heard her call anything filth the whole time I've been with her.

1711
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:27,080
She was very, very upset about this.

1712
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:27,560
I don't know.

1713
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:31,220
There's a but maybe that's not where you guys are landing on the.

1714
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:32,620
I mean, it's just odd.

1715
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:41,520
It's odd that there was an attraction where, like, if you were dealing with sterility or endometriosis or any number of other issues, you're like, oh, great.

1716
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:42,540
I went to Disney World.

1717
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:48,360
I saw this little movie and yeah, it made it was I got depressed immediately.

1718
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:52,600
Yeah, I'm not like horrified by it being there.

1719
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:57,900
It is just confusing, obviously, like watching it in, you know, whatever year this is, 2021.

1720
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:04,620
It's like, oh, I think we're like we're ready to have a more nuanced conversation or a more elaborate conversation about all these topics.

1721
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:10,820
But it's just like, how are you going to do that at a theme park?

1722
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:13,580
And yeah, that's what I understand.

1723
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:15,540
Just don't get anywhere near it.

1724
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:20,640
You don't really have the time for it there because there are a lot of things.

1725
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,660
There are a lot of things I would tell a hypothetical son or daughter about all this stuff.

1726
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:31,100
And it's like you can't cram it into a nice a nice people eater attraction, you know, for 15 minutes.

1727
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:38,280
You with your considerations to hitting all the quadrants that a theme park attraction has to hit like it's too.

1728
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:42,660
It's too ambitious is my feeling, especially in this day and age.

1729
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:46,180
Yes, I like it for the ambition in a way.

1730
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:49,160
I like that they, you know, you talk about Epcot being weird.

1731
01:35:49,180 --> 01:35:50,380
This is really weird.

1732
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,100
It's weird that they did so weird.

1733
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:52,540
Yes.

1734
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:53,720
Yeah.

1735
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:54,960
Is it good?

1736
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:55,880
I don't know.

1737
01:35:56,060 --> 01:36:00,620
I also don't feel like the audience was thrilled in the copy that I watched.

1738
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:04,780
Martin Shirt was explaining things at the chalkboard and then just midway through a sentence.

1739
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:09,420
He just heard this really like interrupts the whole thing.

1740
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:12,140
So they were they were enthralled.

1741
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:17,420
I feel like if dads went on University of Energy and then straight over to this thing, it was double nap time.

1742
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:17,940
It was.

1743
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:18,680
Yeah, that was it.

1744
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,600
Just sleep right through it.

1745
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:26,960
Can I I have something I found the touring plans, the old touring plans page.

1746
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:27,720
Oh, yes.

1747
01:36:27,820 --> 01:36:27,980
Great.

1748
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:28,740
With this.

1749
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:40,160
And they show both sides of the argument, you know, because they are the touring plans, you know, reviews and rundowns of rides, you know.

1750
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:45,960
They they have a father of two from Connecticut weighed in with this opinion.

1751
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:50,220
The making of me is very well done, but I find it an odd juxtaposition.

1752
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:55,540
How many people decide a vacation at Disney World is the time to explain this stuff?

1753
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,200
Show this in health class.

1754
01:36:57,820 --> 01:36:58,180
Yeah.

1755
01:36:58,180 --> 01:37:14,620
Now, that said, they add a gentleman from Cheshire, England, who believes correctly in our view that Americans are sexually repressed rights by the standards of sex education programs shown to English children of ages eight to nine.

1756
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:18,280
The making of me seemed almost Mary Poppins ish in tone.

1757
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:22,760
Certainly other Brits found your warnings over content quite puzzling.

1758
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:39,780
I got a you know, I I think I lean closer to that second opinion of like, yeah, this is this is probably just another way Americans are kind of insane, you know, compared to much of the rest of the world.

1759
01:37:39,780 --> 01:37:44,940
I think my my take is that he's I think he's right.

1760
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:54,140
But like like you should if you're going to let a movie do the work and explain some of this stuff to a kid, the movie should go further.

1761
01:37:54,280 --> 01:38:02,520
The movie should like, you know, show a little more of what it is and what like it should tackle stuff a little more.

1762
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:06,180
But that movie should not be shown in Epcot Center.

1763
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:06,900
Well, correct.

1764
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:12,340
So if I'm feeling like harumphy about it, it's not the like the film is very tame.

1765
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:13,180
Absolutely.

1766
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:16,920
But for the setting, it's just so bizarre.

1767
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:19,180
And it gets you into this area of lovely bodies.

1768
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:24,820
And when lovely bodies want to be be lovely on each other, they shoot their lovely sperm.

1769
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:31,440
I think that's where it's just to just either go one way or go the other way and and pick choose a choose a tube.

1770
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:37,340
It should be like a 10 hour seminar that you had to go to like the hotel, like a hotel ballroom somewhere.

1771
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:40,740
Like if you really want to do this with your kid, let's let's go do it.

1772
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:41,900
OK, it's 10 hours.

1773
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:43,820
There's many different movies.

1774
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:46,020
It start with this like cleaned up version.

1775
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:48,060
Then there's like hours on consent.

1776
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:51,620
There's hours on the fact that you can have sex and it's not for procreation.

1777
01:38:52,220 --> 01:38:53,980
There's a lot in there.

1778
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:57,380
There's a bit like let's do it as opposed to this.

1779
01:38:57,380 --> 01:39:05,000
Yes, Mary Poppins, like Puritan American version of like and then a little bit of whimsy will create your future child.

1780
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:06,780
Like we haven't gotten it.

1781
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:09,300
He calls himself a sprite.

1782
01:39:09,620 --> 01:39:10,040
Yes, yes.

1783
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:17,320
The man who plays Clifford when he is getting coughed on by a hundred people in a movie theater, he says,

1784
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:22,780
but cigars and drugs and alcohol are not good for this little sprite.

1785
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:25,100
Weird, weird.

1786
01:39:25,780 --> 01:39:27,700
This is why I understand audience.

1787
01:39:27,780 --> 01:39:29,560
Why you don't want to be called Clifford's.

1788
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:32,260
It's really a good man who calls himself a sprite.

1789
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:38,600
When you think about how backwards, you know, things have been when it comes to like teaching people about sex education.

1790
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:46,900
This is a beautiful illustration of of yes, what the American psyche was at the time and still to some degree is

1791
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:51,600
when it comes to like how comfortable you are explaining this to children.

1792
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:52,560
All right.

1793
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:52,900
Right.

1794
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:54,140
It's a day.

1795
01:39:54,220 --> 01:39:56,040
Look, this video damaged a lot of minds.

1796
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:57,180
It really.

1797
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:57,940
Oh, yeah.

1798
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,100
A lot of kids up.

1799
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:00,220
I'm sure of it.

1800
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:04,280
I maybe I saw it and I just blacked it out like you're talking about your sex talk.

1801
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:05,140
It's possible.

1802
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:06,000
I should have.

1803
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:10,820
You know, I really should have asked my mom is any memory of this because it was there long enough

1804
01:40:10,820 --> 01:40:16,700
that I would think that there was a good chance we did see it, but I have no memory of it.

1805
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:18,980
Is there any chance I saw it in like 2003?

1806
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:21,140
Did I just say like, it's a weird thing.

1807
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:21,520
I'm bored.

1808
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:22,120
I'll do it.

1809
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:24,580
I because it did feel a little familiar.

1810
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:26,840
But it's a good idea.

1811
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:33,920
It's familiar in that Epcot center of its time way to where you go, did I see this or did I see the Canada Pavilion?

1812
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:36,700
And I'm just remembering Martin Short from that.

1813
01:40:36,860 --> 01:40:37,160
Yeah.

1814
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:37,700
Yeah.

1815
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,880
But I mean, there were no sperm in the Canada movie.

1816
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:40,780
So.

1817
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:48,920
Yeah, well, bizarre, interesting to revisit.

1818
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:53,200
I guess you survived podcast the ride.

1819
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:57,220
And what can I say?

1820
01:40:57,580 --> 01:41:01,040
It's, you know, keep it lovely out there.

1821
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:17,440
Obviously, if you have a talk to give to somebody, you know, to a child, you know, be aware that that the discussion of man of dad's sperm could enter into it and make it easier.

1822
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:26,740
And just remember, you know, during this last year, these trying times, you know, people's memories might not be as as good as they they once were.

1823
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:32,560
So, you know, be patient with the people around you if they don't remember that, you know, that friggin sperm.

1824
01:41:32,660 --> 01:41:34,000
You remember I mentioned that sperm?

1825
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:36,280
You know, you got to smoke.

1826
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:37,080
Can I buy my smoke?

1827
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:40,320
If you have to remind people about your dad's sperm, that's OK.

1828
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:41,200
That's what Jason's saying.

1829
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:42,080
It's OK.

1830
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:42,460
Yeah.

1831
01:41:42,460 --> 01:41:43,620
Go at your own pace.

1832
01:41:43,740 --> 01:41:44,720
You know, it takes a little while.

1833
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:50,360
Just get nice and lovely and say, yes, I remember the sperm you said your dad had.

1834
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:50,860
Yes.

1835
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:53,660
But but stop before you start screaming.

1836
01:41:53,820 --> 01:41:56,460
I remember I remember everything.

1837
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:59,280
I can see everything all at once.

1838
01:42:02,740 --> 01:42:03,280
Yikes.

1839
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:04,220
Yikes is correct.

1840
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:06,380
Yeah, that's a yikes of an episode.

1841
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:11,600
But thanks for thanks for listening to it for potentially less yikesy episodes.

1842
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:13,300
We got three a month here.

1843
01:42:13,980 --> 01:42:18,720
So keep it.

1844
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:19,560
So long.

1845
01:42:20,220 --> 01:42:22,060
So long to all the wonderful me's out there.

1846
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:23,360
Goodbye, me's.

1847
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:24,540
I'm glad you got made.
