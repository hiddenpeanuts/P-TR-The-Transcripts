1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:13,640
Warning, the following podcast contains secret trombos, Ewok sadness, the big zerg, and many,

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,240
far too many Tom Cruise tangents.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:43,600
to talk Buzz Lightyear astro blasters on today's podcast, The Ride.

6
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,040
We're going to podcast The Ride, which today, just to be clear, isn't about Lightyear, the

7
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,040
movie.

8
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,600
This is the ride based on the movie about toys that the origin story about the human

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,400
Buzz Lightyear is based on.

10
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
I'm Scott Gardner.

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,400
Hi, Jason Sheridan.

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
Hi.

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah, I'm glad we settled that.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,200
Yeah, yeah.

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,280
That's just to be clear.

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,640
That's the only reason that was said.

17
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
Mike Carlson.

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
Hi.

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Yes.

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,000
And then we should also clarify, this is a podcast not about The Ride.

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:15,000
It is a podcast based on the concept of The Ride as a themed entity.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,600
Okay, so I don't want to make that because people might be confused about what this podcast

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,000
is even a few years in.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,400
And it's about the idea of The Ride being something that's bigger than just an actual

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,520
ride.

26
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,520
So that's clear.

27
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,520
I just want to make sure that's very clear.

28
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,520
Like, just to be clear.

29
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,000
We're also really going out on a limb because we're probably going to touch on one, two,

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,960
three, four, four different four different rides.

31
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,960
There's a lot of names, a lot of names to play.

32
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,720
It gets very complicated.

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,000
So let's make sure all of our names get out before we start to do that, including our

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,760
guest for today joining us for the first time in person.

35
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:59,880
Finally, not a Zoom, doing the real podcast The Ride experience here in a hot garage.

36
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,920
It's the only real way to do it.

37
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,680
From Get Played, it's Matt Apodaca.

38
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
What's going on?

39
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,600
I just want to clarify that I'm actually not the Matt Apodaca, but I'm based on Matt Apodaca.

40
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,400
So that's just like just so we all just are clearing the air there.

41
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Oh, jeez.

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,720
We're one level removed.

43
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,680
Yeah, I'm the guy that like, no, I'm not going to.

44
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,680
Would you say you're in all?

45
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,640
I was going to say, are you like an homage?

46
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,440
Yeah, maybe a Matt Apodaca pastiche.

47
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,440
OK, got it.

48
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
Got it.

49
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,440
It's not all of it, but it's like you sort of get it.

50
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
Yeah.

51
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,440
OK, then I guess that word.

52
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,440
Yeah.

53
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,600
If you hear like, dare to be stupid, you sort of like get Devo.

54
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,000
You're like, oh, I sort of understand.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh, sure.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah, it's almost better.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,840
It's almost like combines a bunch of things into one potent.

58
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,840
Yeah.

59
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,800
Matt, in this case, Matt Apodaca ish piece.

60
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
Well, that's great.

61
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,600
It's good to have you, whatever you are here.

62
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,600
I'm excited to be here.

63
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
I love this show.

64
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,200
So it's it's it's an honor to be in the garage.

65
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Oh, fantastic.

66
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Yeah.

67
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,480
So it's so happy to have you and wanting to get folks who were so much fun over Zoom.

68
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
But we.

69
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,480
Yeah.

70
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,520
We haven't actually done one in person.

71
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
So this is wonderful.

72
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
We're to look in the in the eye.

73
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,440
Finally, all this this stuff is done.

74
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,480
It's all this crazy covid stuff.

75
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,120
It is over.

76
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,120
We are celebrating.

77
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,880
I was on a plane the other day and I freaking cheered.

78
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,880
I freaking laughed.

79
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,880
I was like, finally.

80
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,880
Oh, open the I opened the emergency door and threw my mask out the door.

81
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,880
You were on the flight.

82
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,880
I was on the flight.

83
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,880
Yeah.

84
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
Wow.

85
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,280
I hit pause on Ghostbusters Afterlife and they're like, I got a clap.

86
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,280
I got a clap.

87
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,280
I was ready to clap when the plane landed.

88
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,280
I got a clap now.

89
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,280
We ran after the movie.

90
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Yeah, yeah, of course.

91
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
Yeah.

92
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,280
Ever.

93
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,600
But because this did happen, my parents are telling me about it.

94
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,480
They were not on one of the planes where this happened, but they knew people who were.

95
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,480
Oh, wow.

96
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,480
Got the announcement.

97
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,320
Ladies and gentlemen, you can remove your masks right now.

98
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,560
There was like a minute of mid-flight where it happened.

99
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
Yeah.

100
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,560
Were there videos of it?

101
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,560
Yeah, yeah.

102
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
It was like on Twitter.

103
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,240
I can't think of a dorkier thing to do.

104
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,240
That's like way wackier than like wearing your mask.

105
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,240
Yay.

106
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,240
I don't have to anymore.

107
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,840
Well, making the biggest deal out of the removal, which is a very simple process.

108
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,840
It can happen in less than a second.

109
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,840
Oh, thank God.

110
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,840
Each strap whipping it like as if you're breaking through shackles.

111
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,840
Yeah, using like the jaws of life to take it off your face.

112
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,000
Metal chest, belt on your face or something when you literally everybody had it off to

113
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,200
snack on pretzels minutes earlier.

114
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
Yeah.

115
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,840
Or you're like Houdini with this like locked like vest.

116
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,000
It's like, oh, it's like it's that big of a deal.

117
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah.

118
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,760
It kind of revealed for me how few people actually have noise canceling headphones because

119
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,240
that was a game changer for me.

120
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
Really?

121
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,680
Like investing in decent noise canceling.

122
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,480
Like I feel like for me, that would have been like pulled that your ear, you know, you're

123
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,720
saying people up and like here I go, OK, and like just put it back to my book or something.

124
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,960
You're saying you ignore all the announcements now that you have the noise canceling headphones

125
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
on a plane.

126
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,960
I'm saying I don't like I don't catch some of them.

127
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,520
I have it up loud enough.

128
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,520
Yeah.

129
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,440
I remember the last plane I was on, I was watching Venom to let there be carnage and

130
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,200
I did miss some of it, but only because I had my my AirPods just blasting and everybody

131
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,480
near me heard that there'd be carnage as well.

132
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,720
They're not great, but thank you for saying the full title.

133
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:33,400
I got you know, I got to give credit where credit's due and, you know, give art the respect

134
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
it deserves.

135
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Yeah, you know.

136
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Yeah, of course.

137
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Yeah.

138
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Film and this carnage to be gotten.

139
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Yeah.

140
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
I mean, it's in the movie.

141
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,400
He says it.

142
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
He doesn't.

143
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
That phrase said in the movie.

144
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,080
He says it at the end of the first one and they were like, you know what?

145
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,080
That's the title of the movie.

146
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,080
Oh, yeah.

147
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,880
They're like, we have a title.

148
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
Yeah.

149
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,160
Like, OK, Andy Serkis, get to work, baby.

150
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,520
Man, I am so behind.

151
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,000
I haven't watched that and I have not watched Morbius, the living vampire yet.

152
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah.

153
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,560
There's no way that I'm going to see Morbius within the next two years, but maybe in three,

154
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,560
I'll give it a watch.

155
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,480
I'm going to out myself that I was how this is a little I pay attention and I've only

156
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,640
seen that word just while flipping past on the Internet or on Twitter or something.

157
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,320
And I just thanked friend of the show, Andrew Grissom, for saying the title out loud in

158
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,320
front of me because I said it was bound to happen that I would on the podcast would just

159
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,840
dive in and call it Moribus.

160
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,760
I was so close to that happening.

161
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,760
Now I've essentially let it happen now.

162
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:39,320
But I really did think that I so much I have not come across Morbius before.

163
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,320
Yeah.

164
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
Yeah.

165
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:49,320
He was like kind of a big character in the Spider-Man cartoon in the 90s, but not memorable

166
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,320
like weird as like me and Mike.

167
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
Like yeah, more.

168
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,320
Yeah.

169
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
More Michael Morbius.

170
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
Michael Morbius, the living vampire.

171
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
Dr. Mike Morbius.

172
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
Yeah.

173
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
He's playing Dr. Michael Morbius.

174
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,320
Felicia, Felicia.

175
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,320
He was just like very.

176
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
Yeah.

177
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,120
He would say Felicia, which is Felicia Hardy, the black cat who I am by Felicia.

178
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
No, not by Felicia.

179
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
No, by Felicia.

180
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,880
Although now you've probably created an internet sensation.

181
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,880
Oh man.

182
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
You just edited that.

183
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,880
Let me go.

184
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,720
I'm walking over to funny or die real quick.

185
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,720
Edit, edit, edit.

186
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
Post.

187
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,720
Money rolls in.

188
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,840
All of them so much money.

189
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,840
For me.

190
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,840
Cha-ching.

191
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,720
It's a hit on our web, on our page, on True Social.

192
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,320
It's a hit on the True Social page.

193
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,520
Yeah, they're partnered with True Social now primarily.

194
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,520
Congrats, guys.

195
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,080
So, yeah, so happy to have you and happy to talk about, I think this topic makes a lot

196
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,920
of sense that we landed on it as a gaming attraction.

197
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,920
Yes.

198
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,320
Just sort of where we were leaning with other stuff you were talking about.

199
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
Yeah, yeah.

200
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,320
You're very gaming-versed.

201
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,320
I love games.

202
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,720
Yes, yeah.

203
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,320
You also were talking about though like, you know, carnival games.

204
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Or the game, because there are carnival games in theme parks.

205
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,320
Yeah.

206
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,320
Do you ever stop and take advantage of that?

207
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Do you give those a whirl?

208
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,320
I feel like when I was a kid, that was definitely something that I was like more interested

209
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
in.

210
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,320
I was like, oh, well, like, because like, I feel like when I was a kid at Knott's Berry

211
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,320
Farm, for example, they had like, like they would have like Pokemon plushes.

212
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,320
Like they weren't like necessarily like in theme park exclusive.

213
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,320
They would just like get like Stewie or whoever.

214
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
Right.

215
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
Right.

216
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Any sort of thing they could get that people would then want to spend like five dollars

217
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,320
on three balls or something.

218
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
Like I would always try to do that.

219
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,320
And I would always try to like figure out like how to like, how to win.

220
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,320
Because those games are sort of like they're not impossible, but there's there is like

221
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
a trick to them for some of them.

222
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,320
But I always do pretty well with the one where you have to like blow up the clowns like balloon

223
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
head or whatever it is with water or something.

224
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,320
Yeah, the straight water gun basically.

225
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,320
And you it's a little tiny target and like a big rectangle.

226
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
And it's like sometimes it's like moving too.

227
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,320
So you have to like follow the moving thing.

228
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,320
But I would always do well with that because the other people playing that are usually

229
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,320
younger children.

230
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,320
So I'd be like, OK, well, I'm 10.

231
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
I got smoke in that.

232
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,320
Yeah.

233
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,320
And they're upset.

234
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,320
And I get to take home my Stewie.

235
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
Did you win a Stewie?

236
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,320
I don't know if I ever got a Stewie.

237
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:37,320
But like I think the last time the last time I did one, we got a an off color bullseye

238
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,320
from one of the ones that California Adventure.

239
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,320
And it was like for my birthday, my girlfriend like paid for like the round of games.

240
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,320
And I still was like I didn't even try to like let her win.

241
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
I was like, I'm going to win.

242
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
And I won.

243
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,320
But I let her pick the plush.

244
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,320
I don't know where it is now because like I guess I don't keep track.

245
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,320
That's the horse racing game where you throw the ball like the sir like there's like three

246
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,320
different targets and they're like the hard you get farther in the race if you throw it

247
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
in the more like far away, far away target.

248
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,320
And I feel like they had they had a different I wanted to play again because like if you

249
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,320
then you know, if you win more than once, you can like sort of get a bigger prize.

250
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
And they had like a Mickey with like a Hawaiian shirt.

251
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
And I was like, that's sort of more the vibe.

252
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,320
I was like, yeah, that's good.

253
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,320
California Adventure.

254
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,320
Yeah.

255
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,320
Well, yeah, this guy, you know, just by look of him, you know, he's got a little bit of

256
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,320
just by look of him, you know, he's got stories.

257
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
I wanted to see what he was all about.

258
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
But we didn't even play that much.

259
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,320
We didn't play more because more people then showed up and I was like, I don't like our

260
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
odds.

261
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
We got to get out of here.

262
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
Yeah, yeah.

263
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
That's I've talked to real.

264
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,320
I talked about accidentally winning a homer on the Santa Monica boardwalk.

265
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,320
I realized after I was done, it was the horse racing game.

266
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,320
I had beaten eight children.

267
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
Ten years ago.

268
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,320
So I was in my 20s.

269
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Yeah.

270
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,320
Is this the way maybe you both have stumbled on the hack here?

271
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,320
If you want to win one that it has to be competition, because if it's you versus somebody,

272
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,320
nobody, right, you end up empty handed.

273
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,320
But if it's you versus many children.

274
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Well, right.

275
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,320
That helps a lot.

276
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,320
The water gun game you're talking about and then the horse racing game both has to have

277
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
a winner also.

278
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,320
Some games where it's just you got to get three strikes or whatever.

279
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,320
And then that you can just fail at and win a target like a ping pong ball in like a weird

280
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
round dish.

281
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Yeah.

282
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
Yeah.

283
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
Like that's a sometimes like a frog based game.

284
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,320
Yeah.

285
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
Yeah.

286
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,320
You have to do something like that.

287
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,320
I'll still like there'll be a lot of winners, but maybe like you're not going to get a bigger

288
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
prize.

289
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
No, no, no, no.

290
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,320
I won against no one back.

291
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,320
I won.

292
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,320
I think I talked about it on my trip report episode, but like we were at Animal Kingdom.

293
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,320
It was pouring rain all day and there's a carnival games by the rubble of the primeval

294
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,320
world.

295
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,320
And Jane played cheap.

296
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
She paid for a round.

297
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
It was a wiffle ball.

298
00:11:53,320 --> 00:12:00,320
You were given like X number of wiffle balls and you had to get it in like a wooden like

299
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
surface that was filled with holes.

300
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
Yeah.

301
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,320
And it, you know, so eventually it goes in a hole, but it had to be a colored hole to

302
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
win a prize.

303
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,320
And she, she didn't get it in or bounced out.

304
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,320
And I was like, all right, I'll give it a shot.

305
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,320
And I just went like wild card with it.

306
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
Like I got, I just didn't aim.

307
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,320
I just threw it high and it came right down and went right in the medium prize hole.

308
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
That right.

309
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
And it was, yeah.

310
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
Pretty good.

311
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,320
He just held for applause.

312
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,320
For the listener at home.

313
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Like they're going to be applauding.

314
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,320
They lifted you up on everybody's shoulders and they locked you down main street and like

315
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
this man's a god.

316
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
They put him in the tree, the tree of life.

317
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,320
Waves to everyone.

318
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
Yeah.

319
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,320
The, I think I've said this before too, Mike, I would love these carnival games too, because

320
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,320
there would be a local carnival and there would be a guy who most years who would like

321
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,320
loudly tell you how the price system worked.

322
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,320
And he would be like, we're playing for another big and we are playing for another big and

323
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
you go to big and for a jumbo.

324
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,320
And like, we love this guy and we would play this game.

325
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
And I don't think we ever even want to big in.

326
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
I think we got a small, the smallest version.

327
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
We did not get a big.

328
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
Small and big.

329
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,320
We did not get a big and small ones, but I don't think we spent enough money.

330
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
Yeah.

331
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,320
If somebody's shouting that they're about to do one with a big in, you're immediately

332
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
more interested than you were a second ago.

333
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,320
But when you didn't hear anything, he was like, wait a second, a big in a big in sounds

334
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
fun.

335
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
It's such an ear worm.

336
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
It's not a word you're used to hearing.

337
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Yeah.

338
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
Maybe only hear it there.

339
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
A big in two big ins for a jumbo.

340
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,320
I do think like carnival barking is like an unsung art.

341
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,320
Like I always am like so impressed with everybody.

342
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,320
Just like working their ass off at a carnival there because that's, you know, it's hard.

343
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,320
It seems hard to me.

344
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,320
Yeah.

345
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,320
You do for hours.

346
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
Yeah.

347
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
Yelling for hours.

348
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
And you got to pack it up and move on to the next city.

349
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
That's crazy.

350
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,320
Yeah.

351
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
It is.

352
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,320
It's an interesting, interesting life, I would assume.

353
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,320
Yeah.

354
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,320
I wonder how many people are still like on the road 300 days a year with a carnival.

355
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
A decent amount, I bet.

356
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
I would assume so.

357
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,320
I watched that movie, the Nightmare Alley, and I kind of wanted it.

358
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:20,320
I wasn't, I didn't love it because it wasn't as interesting as I wanted it to be, which was then just seeing more carnival stuff.

359
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
It was not enough carnival.

360
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,320
You want a documentary.

361
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
Yeah.

362
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
Yeah.

363
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,320
I guess I wanted to see like POV footage of carnival.

364
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
Somebody experiencing a carnival.

365
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Unedited raw footage.

366
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
Security cam.

367
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
You should, there's an old movie called Gun Crazy.

368
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Okay.

369
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,320
And it's about two people doing trick shots at carnivals.

370
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Like they're like marksmen.

371
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,320
Yeah.

372
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,320
And then they start robbing banks.

373
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,320
But like that sounds awesome.

374
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:55,320
The way they seduce each other is by like they put apples on each other's head in front of an audience and then they shoot a gun at it.

375
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
Oh my God.

376
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,320
And that is like, oh, everyone's just cool with this.

377
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,320
That, I mean, that's like, I love heist movies too.

378
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,320
So that's like a combination of things that I'm in.

379
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,320
What's it called?

380
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Gun Crazy.

381
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
Gun Crazy.

382
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,320
Also known as Deadly is the Female.

383
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Wow.

384
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
Crazy tight 1950.

385
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
It's a Trumbo.

386
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
It's a, it was blacklisted.

387
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,320
Wow.

388
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,320
But it was, yeah, it's a Trumbo.

389
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
It's a secret Trumbo.

390
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,320
Secret Trumbo.

391
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,320
That's a biggin.

392
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,320
Yeah.

393
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
It's like a B movie.

394
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,320
And then, but it is like, this is better than you think it would be.

395
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,320
Like it's like in the national film registry.

396
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,320
Oh, okay.

397
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
So I forget where it was on HBO Max.

398
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,320
I don't know if it's still up there, but yeah.

399
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,320
So, so Matt, you were like, you were very, I would say like, because I feel like the same way.

400
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,320
I was very game obsessed when I was young too.

401
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,320
Because I liked video games a lot.

402
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,320
But then, yeah, going to a place where there was the winning aspect.

403
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
That was like really exciting.

404
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,320
But also like some of these places, like, like Disneyland had an arcade for a while.

405
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:05,320
And like even in the, what it's called now, the, that thing in Tomorrowland,

406
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:12,320
it's now like an Avengers, like, or sort of like a Marvel, like presentation place or something where they had Osimo.

407
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
Oh, I'll know all that.

408
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
Yeah.

409
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,320
The launch, the launch.

410
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
What is that?

411
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,320
Star Wars.

412
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,320
Star Wars.

413
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,320
Yeah.

414
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,320
In there they had like, they had like, I feel like I played Guitar Hero in there one time.

415
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
Like they like had it like set up.

416
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,320
Probably.

417
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,320
And was like, I think it might've been like even like, or it might've been Lego Rock Band.

418
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,320
Oh, wow.

419
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:37,320
And so I was playing with other kids, like probably to like Taylor Swift or something.

420
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
Yeah.

421
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
What's different about the Lego?

422
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:45,320
It's more like, I think it's a little more like these are like radio Disney, like type hits or something.

423
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
Sure.

424
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
Less likely to be raunchy.

425
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
Yeah.

426
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
Yeah.

427
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,320
Exactly.

428
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
No Buck Cherry or anything like that on there.

429
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
Damn it.

430
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
Filthy Buck Cherry.

431
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
A lot of Microsoft sponsorship there.

432
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
Yeah.

433
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,320
You got a lot of Xbox stuff.

434
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
So I think it was like on an Xbox.

435
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
Yeah.

436
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,320
And I was like, I don't have this.

437
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:09,320
Windows, whatever the current Windows at the time was where it's like, look you can run a whole house with Windows ME.

438
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,320
I feel like I remember like Windows 7 being like a big deal.

439
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
Yes.

440
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,320
Like just in my lifetime, I remember hearing everybody being like, wow, Windows 7.

441
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,320
Wow.

442
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,320
We should do an episode on the Windows house.

443
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,320
I remember that being like kind of interesting because I remember a friend of mine, you know what?

444
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,320
I don't know if you've had Ify Wadiway on the show before.

445
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,320
We have.

446
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,320
Okay.

447
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,320
I've been to Disneyland with him quite a bit because he's one of my oldest friends.

448
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,320
I've known him for like 16 years.

449
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,320
Former employee as well.

450
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,320
Yeah.

451
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,320
Well, yeah, we were former coworkers.

452
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,320
We worked at the improv together.

453
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:49,320
And he also, he's just, he's, I mean, all going on and on about how much I love him.

454
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:57,320
But we went to Disneyland a lot and we went into the, that display room and we got everybody around us because you can like change the music stuff.

455
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,320
We put the cha cha slide on.

456
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
We got everybody in there to do the cha cha slide.

457
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,320
Wow.

458
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,320
You turned it into a actual interaction.

459
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
Wait a minute.

460
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:13,320
This is going to be fun because I mean, there's a certain type of person that I feel like they're probably all at Disneyland.

461
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,320
If you hear a cha cha slide, you're going to participate.

462
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,320
Yeah.

463
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
Yeah.

464
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,320
Yeah. I do it there.

465
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,320
Yes.

466
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,320
This is sorry.

467
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,320
This is still the this is Lego Rock Band or is this is the Windows?

468
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,320
This was in the Windows house because you can like change this.

469
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,320
I think there was like the music.

470
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,320
There was a thing in the room.

471
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,320
You're like, oh look, you can put on whatever songs you want on this thing.

472
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,320
And one of them, one of the preloaded ones was the cha cha slide.

473
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,320
They tried to do a call back to the house of the future or the house of tomorrow.

474
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,320
The one that, you know, was the sixties attraction.

475
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,320
Yeah.

476
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,320
That like they had to get so many wrecking balls to destroy.

477
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,320
Yeah.

478
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,320
Yeah.

479
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,320
Solidly made.

480
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,320
Right.

481
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,320
Right.

482
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:59,320
And then at the end of the interventions out here, they recreated like the inside of a house that you could like, look, you can run this with Windows 7.

483
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
Yeah.

484
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,320
This is pre like Nest or like smart home stuff is just catching on.

485
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:11,320
All the product that I remember the screens and stuff you were supposed to like the touch screens like it was like you had hit it.

486
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
Yeah.

487
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
Yeah.

488
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,320
Really.

489
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,320
Yeah.

490
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,320
Like it was just the really.

491
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
I love our smart homes.

492
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
Perfect.

493
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,320
So yeah, we love our smart homes.

494
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,320
Sometimes I'm like, well, I barely touched this thing.

495
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,320
Yeah.

496
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,320
I already just did it.

497
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
I knew where you were heading.

498
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,320
Yeah.

499
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
I was thinking.

500
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,320
I love my fridge where I can see what's inside the fridge.

501
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,320
That's great.

502
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,320
Yeah.

503
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
I love that.

504
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,320
In my house.

505
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,320
All the effort you save.

506
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,320
Yeah.

507
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,320
Because those things can stick.

508
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
Yeah.

509
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,320
Oh yeah.

510
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,320
Force sometimes.

511
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,320
Sometimes I'm just so, so weak.

512
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
Can't even open my fridge.

513
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
I just like to know that there's food in there if I need it.

514
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,320
Lack of food.

515
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,320
Yeah.

516
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,320
Because you're weak because all you've done is look inside and not eat anything.

517
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,320
Of course.

518
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:57,120
Well, let's take a few steps over in the embattled land of Tomorrowland.

519
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,040
You know, it's a spotty realm in almost every park.

520
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:08,080
Perhaps save for this attraction, one of the only things that has worked in Tomorrowland

521
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,800
and that packs them in the Buzz Lightyear attraction.

522
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,600
I guess, I don't know, is now the time to discuss the names.

523
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Sure.

524
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
I got it in front of me.

525
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
There's so many.

526
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Yes, Jason, please.

527
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
I don't know if you know this.

528
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,760
It has a different name in almost every, it's in, it has been in six different Disney parks

529
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,880
with slightly different maddeningly similar names.

530
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,880
That's, yeah.

531
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,880
Which we of course have to go through.

532
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,880
That's very good and not confusing.

533
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
Do you want to?

534
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
Yeah.

535
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,760
At one period of time, there was a very small window where It and Dumbo were the only things

536
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,120
six castle parks throughout the world.

537
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Wow.

538
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,080
And then Hong Kong closed theirs to build the Ant-Man and the Wasp ride.

539
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,080
Nano battle.

540
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,080
Yes.

541
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,080
Nano battle.

542
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,080
Exclamation point.

543
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:59,040
So in Walt Disney World in Florida, it's Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger Spin.

544
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
In Tokyo Disney.

545
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,400
Hang on though, because there's an important thing.

546
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Is it a possessive?

547
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,400
It is.

548
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
It's a posthorpy.

549
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
This one is possessive.

550
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,280
This is the only possessive.

551
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,280
Sometimes Buzz Clank.

552
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
Okay.

553
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
Yeah.

554
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
Only in this case does he claim ownership.

555
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
It is his.

556
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,440
Otherwise, his name is just kind of butted up next to the name.

557
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
Yeah.

558
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,240
It is Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters at Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland in Anaheim, and Hong

559
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,440
Kong Disneyland.

560
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,600
That's also the order that those opened.

561
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:33,640
And then it's Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast in Disneyland Paris and Buzz Lightyear Planet

562
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,120
Rescue at the Shanghai Park, which is noticeably different.

563
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,640
Like a massive upgrade.

564
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,640
Wow.

565
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,640
Oh, that's good.

566
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,640
Okay.

567
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,640
Okay.

568
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,640
Gotcha.

569
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,640
What do we call this episode?

570
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,640
That's a good point.

571
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,640
Yeah.

572
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,640
I was going to sort this out now, I guess.

573
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,960
I think it's Astro Blasters.

574
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Which one do we like the best?

575
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,640
Oh, does everyone have a favorite?

576
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:00,080
I was going to say Planet Rescue seems to be like the only one that like rings true to

577
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,640
me for some reason, even though that's like not what it's called.

578
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:10,040
It's sort of like, because I don't know, based on what you do in the ride and the experience,

579
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,840
I guess you also blast Astro.

580
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,240
So it's hard to say what is actually happening.

581
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,240
You blast Astro.

582
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,240
Yeah.

583
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,840
In your mind, you mean by because you're blasting and there's space stuff around that qualifies

584
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,840
as blasting Astro?

585
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,840
Yeah.

586
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,840
Yeah.

587
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,840
You're like an astronaut.

588
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,840
So you're blasting.

589
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,840
It's like, oh, well.

590
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,040
Here to blast some Astro.

591
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,200
I'm here to blast some Astro.

592
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
I mean, hopefully he says that in the new movie.

593
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
He does.

594
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,480
Or at least he does.

595
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,400
We could be maddening and like combine a few in a wrong way.

596
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
That's funny.

597
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,920
And make people mad as soon as they open it up.

598
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,040
Laser, Laser Ranger Blaster.

599
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
Ranger Blaster?

600
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,040
Space Astro.

601
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,040
Jumble them all.

602
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,160
I think Astro Blaster, because like.

603
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,200
That one has three of them.

604
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Yeah.

605
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
Three of them.

606
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
Yeah.

607
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
Majority wins.

608
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,200
For me.

609
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,000
There's three of them and four seem like the same.

610
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,440
They have the guns you can take out.

611
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,640
It looks a little better than the Florida one.

612
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,640
Okay.

613
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,880
Which kind of made, I didn't dawn on me like the order these opened in where I was like,

614
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,160
oh, they kind of did on the cheap in Florida.

615
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,840
They went all a little more all out in Tokyo and then they just kept cloning the Tokyo

616
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,840
one until Shanghai where they were kind of building everything from scratch.

617
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
And they went a little harder.

618
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,840
A little fancier.

619
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,840
Yeah.

620
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,440
Matt, I assume you're primarily familiar with the Disneyland one.

621
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:41,360
Yeah, I've been to the Florida park, but not for now probably like 20 years.

622
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,360
I went when I was young.

623
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,360
Sure.

624
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
I assure you it is exactly the same.

625
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,360
I'm sure.

626
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,360
I'm sure.

627
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
I see there's even been any paint put on it.

628
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,360
I want to go back.

629
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,360
I got to see this Avatar area.

630
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,360
Oh yeah.

631
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,360
I'd love to see that.

632
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,360
Oh yeah.

633
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
Yeah.

634
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,480
That's like, that to me is almost worth like booking a vacation around.

635
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,800
I really want to go see it.

636
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
I would, yes.

637
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,760
I would disagree.

638
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,760
Yeah.

639
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,760
It's something.

640
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,040
Because we watched the, my girlfriend and I watched the, those Imagineer documentaries

641
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,520
too on Disney Plus, which are great.

642
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,160
And I had no interest in any other Disney parks like around the world.

643
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,440
And I was like, I want to go to all of them.

644
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,200
They all seem like they have their own cool, I mean they made their own great propaganda.

645
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Like, you know.

646
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,200
Yeah, sure.

647
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
I was like, this looks awesome.

648
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
I love this.

649
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,200
I film them very well.

650
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,200
Thanks for showing me Disney.

651
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,400
You're watching big ads, but they're very well done ads.

652
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
Yeah.

653
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,760
But yeah, I used to have an annual pass to Disneyland and California Adventure.

654
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,800
And I would frequent the Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters quite a bit.

655
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,240
Because it's like a, I don't know.

656
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,240
It's fun.

657
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,640
I think it's fun and good.

658
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:54,080
And I feel like nowadays you can get in there under 10 minutes.

659
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,720
It's pretty, it's a pretty low, low census in that line.

660
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,520
Not a lot of people go in there, but you can, you know, when there's a long line for something

661
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,720
else you're like, wait a minute, we can just go do Astro Blasters real quick.

662
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,760
And then, you know, what's 45 minutes in 10 minutes, you know, it's the same thing.

663
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
Yeah, yeah, sure.

664
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,120
It's a good like wind down the day ride.

665
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,440
Especially, you're probably not looking at much of a line.

666
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,440
No.

667
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,440
Often the last thing I do.

668
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,080
I feel like they're blasting the AC in there too.

669
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,920
So like on a hot day you can get in there and, you know, get some, get cool before you get

670
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,640
back out in the heat.

671
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,440
And also the line moves because it's the omnimover system.

672
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,840
So the thing's constantly moving.

673
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,240
So the line generally, even if it's a little longer than 10, you're, you just need movement.

674
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,920
You need movement really, which is bigger sometimes than the actual length you're waiting.

675
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,920
Yeah.

676
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,240
There's a slight outdoor line if it's really crowded.

677
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,880
You usually get through it pretty quickly.

678
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,800
So yeah, if you need to cool down, you can get inside pretty fast.

679
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,040
If I see that outdoor, I'm like, yeah, I'm doing it.

680
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
It gives you a good.

681
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Yeah, yeah.

682
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
If it's outside, I'm like, okay, there's something.

683
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,040
Yeah.

684
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,280
A lot of people are getting involved today.

685
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:09,000
It gets a little like, I don't easily get claustrophobic, but like between the outdoor

686
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,560
line for that and then the outdoor line for the Astro orbit, like with these very narrow

687
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,600
path like, yeah, I haven't figured out this crowd flow.

688
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Yeah.

689
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,960
Since the late nineties, this weird choke, one of the few choke points.

690
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,960
Yeah, yeah.

691
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,480
It's very jammed over there.

692
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
Yeah.

693
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,480
When it gets jammed in that area, I almost like don't know what to do.

694
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,620
Like because there's like, there's not a great flow of traffic in that, in that particular

695
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,960
section that you're talking about.

696
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,960
And there's people coming in both directions.

697
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,000
And I often feel like I'm standing completely still behind someone sometimes.

698
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,080
And I'm just like, well, I'm supposed to be moving.

699
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,080
I want to be walking.

700
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,080
I missed it.

701
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,200
And then the group is all the way over there and I'm stuck behind someone who forgot how

702
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,160
to like participate in walking traffic.

703
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
Yeah.

704
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,160
It's got overwhelmed.

705
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,720
So then it's best to go the other, like if you see the Omnibus pulling up on Main Street.

706
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
I'm going around the Matta Bar.

707
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
Yeah.

708
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,200
Like run for the train or run for the Matta Bar.

709
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,680
Like just get out of that area.

710
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,960
I don't recognize offhand what the Omnibus is.

711
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,440
Is that the double Decker bus?

712
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,440
Yeah.

713
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,440
You ever done the Omnibus?

714
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,440
Oh yeah.

715
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,600
Oh, I think I have.

716
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,600
Both levels.

717
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,600
Wow.

718
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,600
Both levels.

719
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,440
Oh, I like to be high up.

720
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,440
Oh yeah.

721
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,440
Height miser.

722
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,440
Height miser.

723
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,440
Yeah.

724
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,920
Does that cover the Omnibus?

725
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,320
Did we just do the Omnibus episode or is there more?

726
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
Oh no, there's a lot more Omnibus stuff.

727
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,320
All right.

728
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,320
Okay.

729
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
Just checking.

730
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,320
Seeing if I can get out of it.

731
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,240
You got to get on this bus.

732
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,000
Separate episodes for bottom level.

733
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,480
Look, I've already compromised today.

734
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,400
There's like multiple different Buzz Lightyear names and it should be like four or five episodes.

735
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,000
I wondered if that would get, yes.

736
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,760
Technically, look, Space Raider Spin is a whole other.

737
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,800
It's very like, this is a ride deployed to do a lot of rescuing, just as Buzz Lightyear

738
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,640
is rescuing planets.

739
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,640
It's always filling spaces where things have kind of come unraveled.

740
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:13,040
Disney World, it was filling the space left by this progression of weird airplane advertising

741
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,040
rides.

742
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,680
I don't know if you ever got to go on any of those for any reason.

743
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:22,640
Just like there was this spot that was just rides that were blatant ads for first Eastern

744
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,120
Airlines and then Delta.

745
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,280
Eastern which is gone, right?

746
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,880
There's no like for a long time.

747
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,320
Yeah, no Eastern, but was the official airline of Disney World.

748
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,360
Now is the official airline of hell.

749
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,360
Yes.

750
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,400
Weird Delta ride, which is I kind of liked the Delta one.

751
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,920
We're going to get into some of the other ones.

752
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,560
Dreams, that's Dream Flight, which we all got to go on.

753
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:50,080
If you had wings, that's my mother loved if you had wings.

754
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,600
So like that was like a beloved ride by people.

755
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
I never got to go on it.

756
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,280
But my mom loves soaring.

757
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,560
Like she can get choked up talking about soaring.

758
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,680
Yeah, she asked me to my mom to do things.

759
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,240
It's the greatest, like one of the best things she's ever seen.

760
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,760
There are so many moms that have this story.

761
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,040
Yeah, and that is true.

762
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,040
Like I like soaring.

763
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,040
I like it too.

764
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,520
She's like she goes nuts for it.

765
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,240
Yes, moms go nuts for soaring.

766
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,240
This is a fact.

767
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,240
So Josh Groban of rides.

768
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
Point.

769
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:22,640
Well, you know, we missed the you know, there's a New York freestanding soaring.

770
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,640
There's like a one off.

771
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,640
Oh, right.

772
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,640
Yes.

773
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,640
Times Square.

774
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,640
They're everywhere.

775
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,640
We should have done that.

776
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,640
Toronto, I think.

777
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,640
Yeah, Vegas.

778
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,640
I did Vancouver.

779
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,680
And there's two different movies in the Vegas one.

780
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,040
I forget what it is.

781
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,760
I think it's like soaring over Red Rocks and Las Vegas.

782
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,920
And I don't know what the other one that plays is.

783
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,920
There's one that I didn't mention it when we talked about Heritage USA.

784
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,280
We're talking about religious parks.

785
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:54,160
There's one a guy who tried to buy that place and revamp it and failed.

786
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,120
He later in San Diego, there is something called Wings Over Israel.

787
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,120
Wow.

788
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:04,080
What is built that is a there is a religious soaring.

789
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,080
Wow.

790
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,560
Except they don't do the part where you lift up.

791
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,560
You are just in shaky chairs.

792
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:14,600
It is a big dome and you take wings over Israel.

793
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,640
I don't know what you see exactly.

794
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,960
Pigeon Forge has one in Tennessee.

795
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,960
Wings Over Pigeon Forge.

796
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
Yeah.

797
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,960
Would you know what it is?

798
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,960
Become a pigeon.

799
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
Yeah.

800
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
I mean, that's cool.

801
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,000
I would like to see what a pigeon gets up to, what they eat.

802
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,240
Poop on a statue.

803
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,240
Yeah.

804
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,240
Oh, yeah.

805
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,240
If you could.

806
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,240
Yeah.

807
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,400
If there's like vibrating haptics on your chair that were like make you feel the feeling

808
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
of a big relief.

809
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
I'm doing it.

810
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
Thank you.

811
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,400
That's a million dollar idea.

812
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
It's mine.

813
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
It's mine.

814
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
OK.

815
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
All right.

816
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,400
OK.

817
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,760
Then in Disneyland, what this it took over a space, there was a bunch of things.

818
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,360
It was Circle Vision movies.

819
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:00,520
But the last thing that it was before was it was all the line for the rocket rods.

820
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,520
This weird.

821
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,520
Did you do that?

822
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
I don't remember.

823
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,520
I really don't remember that.

824
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:08,560
I know that because I mean, I'm from here, so I've been like going to Disneyland like

825
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,120
my whole life.

826
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,880
But like, I don't remember.

827
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,400
I feel like I don't remember the park.

828
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:21,480
I feel I remember when Astro Blaster is like was new and it was like exciting.

829
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,520
But I don't remember anything before that.

830
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,240
Maybe when I was there before, it was like still like under construction or part of the

831
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,240
line or something.

832
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,240
Oh, maybe.

833
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,240
But I don't.

834
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,240
Yeah, I don't remember.

835
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,400
I don't even remember the rocket rides.

836
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
I remember.

837
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
Oh, no.

838
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
Maybe this is that Knott's Berry Farm.

839
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,760
They had these like rides that like they had to shut down because people kept falling out

840
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,760
of it.

841
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,480
And they were like these like singular cages or something that went high up or something.

842
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,080
Is that like a was that a parachute?

843
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,080
I think it was like a parachute.

844
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,080
Yeah.

845
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,080
Yeah.

846
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
That's not there anymore.

847
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,080
No, no.

848
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,080
I think.

849
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,240
One too many people fell out.

850
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,240
I think reason.

851
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,240
Yeah.

852
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,240
Yeah.

853
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,240
They're like that.

854
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,240
We got us.

855
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,240
We got to knock it off.

856
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,680
But I also feel like I mean, where are we all at with Buzz Lightyear as a character?

857
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,680
I feel like I love Buzz.

858
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,680
Oh, I loved him.

859
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,680
I love him.

860
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,680
I still like him.

861
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,680
Yeah.

862
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,680
Yes.

863
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,680
Yeah.

864
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,840
There's been I guess he's a little out of this, but my son was so it was just there

865
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,640
was multiple Toy Story's a day for a little while.

866
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,640
Sure.

867
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,640
So I got familiar.

868
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,640
I got re-familiarized with them to the point where like I knew it as well as the animators.

869
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
Yeah.

870
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,800
Probably did.

871
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,720
There is a stretch in time, but they never really like occasionally.

872
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,120
It was just like we've done enough one.

873
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,560
Let's do three today.

874
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,560
Sure.

875
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,560
That's all.

876
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,200
But there's enough of the and the shorts are fun.

877
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,880
So it was kind of a pleasure to be to just have constant Toy Story's around.

878
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,880
And Buzz is great.

879
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:49,480
And the kind of the world that the ride is pulled from because it really is kind of the

880
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:56,320
implied Buzz Lightyear universe that's in the cold open of two where you're fully in

881
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,480
his world and you meet Zerg.

882
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,120
And it's just it's a really neat that fake out I think works really well.

883
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,840
You're really wondering what the movie is up to and wait, are we going to stay in Buzz

884
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,840
Lightyear world?

885
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,360
I remember being like disappointed a little bit like when I was a kid and that came out

886
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,360
as a wait a second.

887
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,360
I want to see this movie like that's cool.

888
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,360
Yeah.

889
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,360
Yeah.

890
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
It's pretty neat, I'd say.

891
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,560
But is any of the theming in Astro Blaster is based on the cartoon?

892
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,560
So we were.

893
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,560
Yes.

894
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
So yeah.

895
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
Yeah.

896
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:34,120
So the queue has art in the style of the short lived one season cartoon Buzz Lightyear of

897
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,120
Star Command.

898
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,120
Yeah.

899
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,120
And the direct to video Buzz Lightyear of Star Command.

900
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,120
Oh, there's a movie.

901
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
Yeah.

902
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
We my creative subtitle.

903
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,120
I've never heard.

904
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,120
We loved it.

905
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,120
We liked it too.

906
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,120
Yeah.

907
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,880
I really liked it.

908
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,080
And because I think Patrick Warburton is is Buzz in the cartoon, I think.

909
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,080
That's a good.

910
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,080
That's a pretty good.

911
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,080
And switch out.

912
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,080
I don't know.

913
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,080
I think I was just like a young Seinfeld fan.

914
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,080
I was like, oh, this guy's funny.

915
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,080
Yeah.

916
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,080
Oh, for sure.

917
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,160
I would have been like wrapping up middle school or starting high school.

918
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,160
Yeah.

919
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:11,160
But still at the age where it's like if there's nothing good on cable, what is in syndication

920
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,160
on broadcast?

921
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,160
Yeah.

922
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,200
And then they would come on UPN during their very, very odd kids block.

923
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
Yeah.

924
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,200
We're always changing.

925
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:28,960
And it was always stuff where it's like Bats Master, the fifth most popular Saban read

926
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,000
show, stuff like that.

927
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,560
And that's where Buzz Lightyear ended up oddly enough, because at that point, I think Disney

928
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:42,840
had bought ABC and the Disney Channel was chugging along.

929
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:48,640
I just remember being very interested in the extended universe of Buzz Lightyear, because

930
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,640
you don't get that in the movie.

931
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:55,040
So to know that he has this other life as this space hero.

932
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,360
I was like, oh, that's kind of funny.

933
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,160
Now I guess it doesn't exist because this movie is coming out.

934
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,160
Yeah.

935
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,160
Doesn't it?

936
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,160
Yeah.

937
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,160
This wipes out that show, essentially.

938
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,160
We're saying that is not the Buzz.

939
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:12,760
Unless that was a show that was based on the toy, that was based on the movie that Andy

940
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,680
saw.

941
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,680
We're back in this territory.

942
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,680
Oh, man.

943
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,680
I don't know why I forgot this.

944
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,400
I saw yet another clarification of what the Buzz Lightyear movie coming out is.

945
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,400
I think I saw this too.

946
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,400
And it's like, they're like, it's basically like a movie that Andy would see.

947
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,600
This is his Star Wars is what I saw.

948
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,160
I think what the clarification was.

949
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,160
The bar, hi.

950
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,160
Yeah.

951
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,160
The clarification, I think, was like, okay, Andy would have watched that cartoon we were

952
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,520
just talking about as well.

953
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:45,080
But this would have been like the big budget version that Andy would watch.

954
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,440
Lightyear, the movie coming out.

955
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,000
So these are both not true.

956
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,120
Like these are fictional stories, even though that's kind of contradicts what the Chris Evans

957
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,440
initial tweet was.

958
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,440
Yes.

959
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,720
But I think the director, yeah, the director was maybe the director, somebody worked on

960
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:04,600
the movie was trying to clarify that this is like Andy would have seen Lightyear and

961
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,600
it's just like the.

962
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
Yeah.

963
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,200
It's the big budget version.

964
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,320
There's multiple versions like there are with IP in our world.

965
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,320
Yes.

966
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,320
Yeah.

967
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,320
So that's what it's like.

968
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,560
Well, like Ninja Turtles, there's a big Ninja Turtles movie, but then various TV.

969
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,560
Yeah.

970
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,920
The toy maybe doesn't look like the one in the movie.

971
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,920
Right.

972
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,920
Yeah.

973
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,960
Where it's, it's actually the confusion is kind of doing a good job recreating how like

974
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,500
or Batman even more so than like cartoon that doesn't look like the movie.

975
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,040
And that the toy is different than that.

976
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,200
There are three actors playing Batman currently like.

977
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,680
Tough to keep.

978
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,440
It really keeps you on your toes as a kid to learn all of this.

979
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,440
Yeah.

980
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,440
So no, no wonder you tuned out Morbius.

981
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,440
There's no real.

982
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,440
I'm not going to learn.

983
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,440
I don't have time for this.

984
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,440
I was busy with Batman.

985
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,520
Batman to wrap my head around.

986
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,480
I'm now regretting that I didn't look into Buzz Lightyear of Star Command earlier because

987
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,760
all these I'm catching names that are wonderful.

988
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,200
Brent Star kisser.

989
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,200
Yeah.

990
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,200
It's a reporter.

991
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,200
That's pretty good.

992
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,800
Wait, there's another guy.

993
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,680
There's an evil Buzz who is also war Burton.

994
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,120
There's Petra Hammerhold voiced by Nikki Cox.

995
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,560
Plasma Boy voiced by Michael Showalter.

996
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,560
Wow.

997
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,040
Director of Tammy Faye movie.

998
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,040
Michael Showalter.

999
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,040
Is this on Disney Plus?

1000
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
It's not.

1001
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,040
I just looked it up.

1002
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,040
Wow.

1003
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,840
I think it'd be under like in the way that they put up some of the older Star Wars cartoons

1004
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,280
and stuff as they're like.

1005
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,280
Yeah.

1006
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,560
It's like Star Wars stories.

1007
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,560
Yeah.

1008
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,440
No, it doesn't count.

1009
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,440
Lightyear stories.

1010
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,440
Yeah.

1011
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,440
Oh, I see.

1012
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,120
That's their way of saying it's a little make them up stone.

1013
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,120
Don't worry.

1014
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,440
Don't concern your little head with these.

1015
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,440
They did.

1016
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,720
They did like I think last year put up the Getty Tartakovsky like shorts that are really

1017
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,720
cool.

1018
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
Yeah.

1019
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,720
Yeah.

1020
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,720
Those are awesome.

1021
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,720
And then they also put up the limited animation droids cartoons and the horrifying Ewoks movies.

1022
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,200
Oh, those are the Ewoks movies on Disney Plus.

1023
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,240
I was talking to the other night.

1024
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,120
I feel like I was talking about that where like in the one movie she she has an indicator

1025
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:11,720
like wrist cuff thing and she watches the like each of her family is a light.

1026
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,280
Each member of her family, she watches them die one by one.

1027
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
Oh my God.

1028
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,280
And this is a kiss movie.

1029
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,280
Very upsetting.

1030
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,280
What a cold way to watch.

1031
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,120
She watches the lights just go out.

1032
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:28,120
And the previous movie was all about reuniting the family and the star.

1033
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,120
Oh, no.

1034
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,120
I swear.

1035
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:36,120
If I'm misremembering this, something happened to me where I like hit my head watching this

1036
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,120
movie.

1037
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:42,840
But I swear like this is glued in my mind in the way that like I graduated elementary

1038
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:48,180
school, got taken out to lunch, and then we saw the live action Casper movie and something

1039
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:53,360
just froze in my mind of just hearing Devin Sawa go, can I keep you?

1040
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:57,600
Like it's just an early like, oh, he's going to become a comedian.

1041
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,480
He's hung up on something weird.

1042
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,480
Oh, should have caught that.

1043
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,640
Can I keep you?

1044
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,640
Can I keep you?

1045
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:08,040
It seems from my conversation seems like women of a certain age, their coming of age was

1046
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,920
that moment for like there's dozens of people.

1047
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,920
I feel like this is true.

1048
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,920
Every year.

1049
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,040
Almost everyone I know attuned.

1050
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,920
Yeah, he's like horny for Devin Sawa.

1051
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,920
Horny is the word.

1052
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,920
Yes.

1053
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,480
It was like Casper or Devin?

1054
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,200
I think Casper.

1055
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,560
I mean, Casper is funny.

1056
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,600
And Fatso and Stretch and all the other guys.

1057
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
Yeah, sure.

1058
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,480
That's how you know.

1059
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,000
Yes. The girls whose sexual awakening.

1060
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Yeah.

1061
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Yeah.

1062
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Stinky or whatever.

1063
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,800
I mean, Christina Ricci is who I'm speaking of.

1064
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,800
Oh, yeah.

1065
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,560
I found the exact quote real quick about Lightyear.

1066
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,560
Oh, yeah.

1067
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,560
From the writer director.

1068
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,560
Yeah.

1069
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,960
Lightyear, it's the movie that Andy saw that changed his life.

1070
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,160
Andy's Star Wars.

1071
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,880
So that's officially what it is.

1072
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,880
Yeah.

1073
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,880
Is that because he is.

1074
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,880
What do you mean?

1075
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,880
You heard it.

1076
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,880
I used to direct or said it.

1077
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,280
Because, yeah, he played with the toy a lot, but then he ends up giving the toy away.

1078
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,400
What's really the permanent trajectory of Andy's life?

1079
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,400
Yeah.

1080
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,920
If he likes this movie, if it changed his life, why did he give the toy?

1081
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,800
Do we give Buzz away right away?

1082
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,200
Woody's the only one that had a chance at college.

1083
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,200
Yeah.

1084
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,200
Yeah.

1085
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,200
Well, what is he going to college to do?

1086
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,200
Do we ever find that out?

1087
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,320
I don't think we know Andy's profession.

1088
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,320
No.

1089
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,320
Okay.

1090
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,000
Presumably going to be working the rodeo.

1091
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,640
Yeah.

1092
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,120
If he's thinking about keeping Woody, yeah.

1093
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,120
He's going to rodeo school.

1094
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,120
He's doing lasso tricks.

1095
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,120
He's learning.

1096
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,120
He's learning for years.

1097
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,120
He's very involved.

1098
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,120
So we don't know.

1099
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:39,440
And then we don't see Andy in the four because it's Bonnie.

1100
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,200
So we don't know how it changed his life yet.

1101
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:47,720
We know that he's not in animation or a podcaster because he gave the toys away.

1102
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,720
Yeah.

1103
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,720
Yeah.

1104
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,720
Yeah.

1105
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,720
Yeah.

1106
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,880
The worst ending of a movie I've ever seen is when he gives those toys away.

1107
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,880
Yeah.

1108
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,880
He became cool.

1109
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,880
It's Mike's nightmare.

1110
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,600
We don't know what's Bonnie's handy.

1111
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,240
We don't know if he gets into bowling shirts and rockabilly.

1112
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,240
We don't know.

1113
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,440
Frantically searching eBay and behind the scenes.

1114
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,200
There should be him in his mid thirties rebuying all the toys off of eBay.

1115
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,480
That should be a Toy Story movie.

1116
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,200
But then they don't all know each other.

1117
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,200
So when they all meet, they're strangers now who talk like the ones that we knew.

1118
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,200
That's the reboot.

1119
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
That's like, yeah.

1120
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
What a good idea, by the way.

1121
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,200
Yeah.

1122
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
Okay.

1123
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,200
Okay.

1124
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,200
That's ours.

1125
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,200
That's ours.

1126
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,200
Yeah.

1127
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,200
Well, yeah.

1128
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,200
Okay.

1129
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,200
Why doesn't he play with us?

1130
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,200
Why does he just put us in an Ikea Billy bookshelf and look at us sometimes?

1131
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,200
The D-Tolf is the real...

1132
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,200
Oh, excuse me?

1133
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,520
The D-Tolf is the ultimate toy displayers shelf.

1134
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,520
That's the D-Tolf.

1135
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,520
D-Tolf.

1136
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,520
D-Tolf.

1137
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,520
D-Tolf.

1138
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,520
D-E-T-O-L-F.

1139
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,840
That's an Ikea, though?

1140
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,840
That's an Ikea, yeah.

1141
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,280
And that's the optimum display cabinet for...

1142
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,000
I'm a Calax man myself.

1143
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Yeah.

1144
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,840
That guy was like the scariest man to me when I was like a little kid.

1145
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,320
I was like, this is horrific, what he's doing to these toys.

1146
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,880
I don't think he should be allowed.

1147
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,280
Sid or the Toy Man?

1148
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,920
Oh, I mean, I was less afraid of Sid, but I was more afraid of the Toy Man.

1149
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,920
Oh, okay.

1150
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,760
There was something electrifying about his behavior to me.

1151
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,400
He was like, he was a craven.

1152
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,120
I just didn't care for his personality.

1153
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,120
Thank you.

1154
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,480
His design is like, you know, many of like...

1155
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,800
He looks like dozens of the people who ultimately were me-tude when that movement was in full

1156
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,800
swing.

1157
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.

1158
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,800
I mean, he does look like one of those.

1159
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,800
That's what I was responding to as an eight-year-old.

1160
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,760
Would Al have been me-tude had he...

1161
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,960
We don't see what he does, but I'm sure...

1162
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,280
He's definitely like an MRA-like type guy.

1163
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,280
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1164
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,280
That's true.

1165
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,280
Oh, yeah.

1166
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,280
Yeah.

1167
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,280
It'd be funny though...

1168
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,280
He backs the blue.

1169
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,560
I know the director has clarified, it's like, this is a big budget movie in this world.

1170
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,920
It'd be funny if it was like a big budget flop.

1171
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,840
If it was like, oh yeah, if Andy saw the Tom Cruise-y mommy.

1172
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,040
You mean in continuity a flop.

1173
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,040
Oh.

1174
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,640
Oh, Andy saw Gods of Egypt and it just changed his life.

1175
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,640
Yeah, yeah.

1176
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,640
You know?

1177
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,640
Or it's like Flash Gordon or something.

1178
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,440
Or it's sort of like a cult sort of hit.

1179
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,440
Yeah.

1180
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,320
Andy was mesmerized by Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.

1181
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,480
So it changed his life by like ruining his social life for many years because he couldn't

1182
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,160
go talk at school about the thing he loves because no one else likes it.

1183
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,760
Listen to me, it's two movies.

1184
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,480
It's Death Proof and Planet Terror, okay?

1185
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,680
And there's fake trailers in between.

1186
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,920
You can watch them separately.

1187
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:35,880
My mom told this story growing up that the weekend that E.T. came out, she saw Tron and

1188
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,080
she was the only one of her friends that saw Tron and everybody else saw E.T. and she was

1189
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,840
absolutely like eviscerated at school.

1190
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,840
Like what's Tron?

1191
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,840
Oh.

1192
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:52,040
And then there's no further detail you could produce that doesn't sound like the dorkiest

1193
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,040
thing you've ever.

1194
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,040
Nothing you could say about Tron helps.

1195
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,640
Well there's a guy named Ram you see.

1196
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,640
Boo.

1197
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,640
Go play with someone else.

1198
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,160
So they're like computer graphics.

1199
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,160
Yeah and they look good.

1200
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,160
No.

1201
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,160
They look.

1202
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,240
They look.

1203
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,240
They're literally in the movie, yeah.

1204
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,240
There's bikes that make hard right angles.

1205
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,240
That would be impossible in our world.

1206
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,240
It'd have to be a little curve at least.

1207
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,240
You don't know who David Warner is?

1208
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,240
What?

1209
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:28,240
You can repeat this in like X number of years where it's like Daft Punk to the soundtrack.

1210
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,240
Sounds cool.

1211
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,240
That was cool though.

1212
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,240
Yeah.

1213
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,240
Yeah.

1214
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,240
That was, they were pretty cool.

1215
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,240
It took the world a little long time to catch up with your mom.

1216
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,320
No I don't.

1217
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,320
I feel like when I saw, was it Legacy?

1218
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,320
Tron Legacy.

1219
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,320
Tron Legacy.

1220
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,880
People in my theater were like cheering before the movie started.

1221
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,200
They were all very excited about Tron Legacy and then they all sort of walked out sort

1222
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,200
of like, oh alright.

1223
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,200
Then you have to be up at an hour in.

1224
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,200
Well I got a nap in.

1225
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,200
I mean very cool vibes between that music.

1226
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,200
Great vibes.

1227
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,200
The visual, I feel like the visuals still look great.

1228
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,200
Yeah.

1229
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,360
I still give it up for that more than I don't.

1230
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,360
It's just.

1231
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,480
I like that one.

1232
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,480
Both movies, like once it really kicks in you're like, okay.

1233
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,480
Last half hour.

1234
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,480
This is interesting.

1235
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,480
Yeah.

1236
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,160
I'm a, I would go as far as to say staunch defender of Tron Legacy.

1237
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,160
I really like it.

1238
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,160
Yeah.

1239
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,160
Yeah.

1240
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,040
Do we have, is there any movement on the rumored Leto Tron movie?

1241
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,040
Oh man, I hope not.

1242
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,040
Are we going to see Moribus?

1243
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,040
Is Moribus going in?

1244
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,040
Is Moribus?

1245
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,040
Yeah, Moribus is in that one.

1246
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,040
Moribus.

1247
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,720
Mitchell Moribus.

1248
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:37,040
I feel like I've been hearing about the Jared Leto Tron since I moved to Los Angeles.

1249
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,040
It's always been with you and it always will.

1250
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,040
Yeah.

1251
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,040
I.

1252
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,520
The idea of it will always be, the movie itself won't get made.

1253
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,520
It's real to me.

1254
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,520
That's right.

1255
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,920
The, to get back to the ride a little bit.

1256
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:53,920
Yes.

1257
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:59,040
I mean we can, we can break off details of it, but is there like, is there a part of

1258
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,880
the experience you enjoy the most?

1259
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,920
Do you feel like, well here's the question is how do you, how do you approach it?

1260
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:10,880
Do you care about getting a high score or are you just hanging for fun?

1261
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,080
Well, I guess I care about getting a higher score than whoever I'm sitting with.

1262
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:21,680
Like, so I want to do better than, you know, my brother or whoever I'm there with.

1263
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:27,000
I like, I don't know, there's, cause I know that there are like, there are hidden targets

1264
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
too that are.

1265
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Oh yeah.

1266
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,680
That if you can get them, you get like more points for getting these, like these special

1267
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,680
targets.

1268
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:39,840
But I feel like a vast majority of my profile pictures on like MySpace were the picture

1269
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,920
from that you get at the end of the ride.

1270
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,640
Cause like they take your picture in there that you can email it to yourself.

1271
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,640
Had to do the email.

1272
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,360
I have countless, God knows if I comb through my Gmail.

1273
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,360
Yeah, absolutely.

1274
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,360
Countless email pictures.

1275
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:56,000
The only one I could find was with you.

1276
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,960
It was, I think you forwarded it to me.

1277
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,960
Yeah.

1278
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,440
You kicked my ass too.

1279
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,440
You were like double me.

1280
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:06,880
I mean, I don't think either of them were, I think we're both still under a hundred K,

1281
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,400
but you were like handily ahead.

1282
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:14,640
Yeah, I don't, I'm not good at, I'm not pretty, like when we did the Toy Story Midway Media,

1283
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,160
like Griffin smoked my ass immediately.

1284
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:22,400
I think I like to chase the trick shot, like the far away targets.

1285
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,400
Yeah.

1286
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:29,320
I just learned about the sequence targets where it's like shoot the box, shoot the

1287
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:35,600
target on the lid when it opens up, that activates a monster who has the triangle target that

1288
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,000
has the highest scoring ones.

1289
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Right, right.

1290
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,800
If you just do a quick search in your email, Galactic Greetings.

1291
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,800
Yes.

1292
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,280
That'll be where, what the email says when they've been sent.

1293
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:51,000
And I have one, I have like a 2009 through a couple of years ago.

1294
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
You got a lot of them?

1295
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,360
I have a good amount, I think.

1296
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,200
I have not done it recently.

1297
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,080
Is the email feature turned on?

1298
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,080
I don't know.

1299
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,080
I don't know the answer.

1300
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,480
I have not done it since COVID.

1301
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,920
I feel like I, I think I stopped doing it because something about the way that look,

1302
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,800
the tech is, it went in in Disneyland in 2004 and I think you kind of feel the 2004 of it.

1303
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:19,760
And I just, if, if that it's a slow keyboard and if it ever gets stuck, I'm like, I just

1304
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,440
want to stop and not finish my, not put in my entire email.

1305
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,440
Yeah.

1306
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,360
For some reason I lose pair if I feel like that keyboard is not keeping up.

1307
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,320
So I think I just stopped wanting to make that stop.

1308
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,560
And it often, as I said, it's often the last thing I'm doing for the day.

1309
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,080
So I just like choose to go home instead.

1310
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,120
Oh, I've got to pick, I've got you and I for some reason have that photo you were just

1311
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,120
talking about Scott.

1312
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,680
I have you and Jason in my email.

1313
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,680
Wow.

1314
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:54,040
I searched it and I'm sort of the date on this photo is kind of harrowing.

1315
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,040
It's March 8th, 2020.

1316
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,840
Oh my God.

1317
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,840
Whoa.

1318
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,840
Whoa.

1319
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,440
So you're looking at your, so you're looking at a different man.

1320
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,440
Yeah.

1321
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,800
This is a person who's person anymore.

1322
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:11,080
They're, they're sort of like, I remember this day because we went and we were well

1323
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,080
aware of, of COVID of course.

1324
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,760
And we were all sort of like, we probably shouldn't be here.

1325
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,840
This is crazy. Right.

1326
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:18,840
And then we were there all day.

1327
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:19,840
Yeah.

1328
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:24,840
And my girlfriend did get sick that day, but it wasn't a COVID related thing.

1329
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,840
Okay.

1330
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,840
Okay.

1331
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,840
That's right there.

1332
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:32,400
I realize now that you forwarded me this picture of you and Scott, and if you look, I have

1333
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:44,920
a draft that I never sent and all that's written in the draft is why.

1334
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,120
That absolutely could have been just on autopilot.

1335
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,120
Yeah.

1336
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:54,120
If we were doing it late at night and I, I'm like forward and I'm thinking about show stuff

1337
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:58,200
and I just auto did it to you or I ought to just did it to both.

1338
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,200
Who knows?

1339
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,200
When did we start this podcast?

1340
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,200
Wasn't it later that year?

1341
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,200
No, it was before that.

1342
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,200
I think it was 2016.

1343
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,200
No, it was 2017.

1344
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,860
So that was July 2017.

1345
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,720
This is before the podcast then.

1346
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,440
Wait, what year did you say?

1347
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,720
Maybe the picture was a proof of concept.

1348
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,920
You're like, Hey, look at this.

1349
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,920
Oh yeah.

1350
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,040
I thought this was 2018.

1351
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,880
I have one from two.

1352
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,480
I have one from February 8th, 2017.

1353
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,480
Okay.

1354
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,480
That's the, that's us.

1355
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,480
Really?

1356
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,480
You and J. Yes.

1357
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,640
That's you and Jason.

1358
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,360
So it does predate the podcast.

1359
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,360
Before the podcast.

1360
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,360
Wow.

1361
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,720
You, uh, Scott, Jason has 84,900 and you have 30,200.

1362
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,720
I hate to out you guys.

1363
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,320
Oh, he's more than dirt.

1364
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,320
Yeah.

1365
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,200
Um, I'm looking through my scores too and my best score is 450,000.

1366
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,200
Geez.

1367
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,200
Oh yikes.

1368
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,040
And that's from 2019.

1369
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:46,320
So I got back and get, I started in 2009 and 250,000.

1370
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,240
You were, you were sending me, you were sending the email.

1371
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:52,080
Why did you send this pit of the score for me to laugh?

1372
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,660
If so, thank you.

1373
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:58,040
This is an arrested development style call forward or like a lake house situation where

1374
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,040
I sent it.

1375
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,520
I didn't know why.

1376
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,320
And maybe the reason was for this day, right?

1377
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,320
Future.

1378
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,320
I did.

1379
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:13,640
My score on this photo is, uh, 230,800.

1380
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,640
Not a bad score.

1381
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:19,360
I think you're maybe, well, maybe you're both good at it with that score, Mike.

1382
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,360
That's very solid.

1383
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,680
That's much then that's higher.

1384
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,480
We must've gotten, that's 2019.

1385
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,920
We must've gotten stuck right in front of the secret target.

1386
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,920
That's nice.

1387
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:31,000
Cause it seems like two 50 is my normal ish zone.

1388
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Yeah.

1389
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,240
Um, I also, there have been times where I'm in an odd number of.

1390
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:40,320
People in my group and I'll opt to sit in it by myself so I can dual wheel.

1391
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,320
Yeah.

1392
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,840
Oh, that's, that's fun.

1393
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,280
That is I've tried that, but that I'm not good at that.

1394
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,560
It's not, I don't get one score is going to be a lot better than the other one.

1395
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,000
But it's, it's still pretty fun.

1396
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,160
Like a John wick scenario.

1397
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:57,880
I'm thinking I'm back in there and Zerg is fucking scared.

1398
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:02,400
I've never seen unprecedented.

1399
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:09,160
I'm sort of like kind of, I wish there was more Zerg.

1400
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,160
I like Zerg.

1401
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,160
I like Zerg a lot.

1402
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,160
Is Zerg in light year?

1403
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,160
Yeah, he is.

1404
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,160
Yeah.

1405
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,760
I've seen there's the, you could, he's in the trailer now.

1406
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,360
They've, they've revealed Zerg.

1407
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,360
That's right.

1408
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,760
But it's sort of, I think the approach is kind of anime is what they're thinking.

1409
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:28,560
I think it's kind of a robot suit is the idea, which I guess is consistent with, you know,

1410
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,080
he's sort of a Vader.

1411
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,560
He's like a kid's Vader.

1412
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,560
Yeah.

1413
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:36,640
We don't really know what's inside that or if he is fully a robot.

1414
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,640
Right.

1415
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:41,800
Maybe he is because he's deploying robots in the raw.

1416
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:46,400
Like that's kind of a lot of who you're facing off against, at least for the first part of

1417
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,400
it.

1418
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:52,160
Like it's big boxy robots, almost like rock them, sock them style robots in the first

1419
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,640
couple of rooms.

1420
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:59,640
But then you get to planet Z where there's now aliens in play.

1421
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:00,640
Yeah.

1422
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:05,800
I'm really guessing here because in thinking, in prepping this episode, I was like, I have

1423
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:10,240
no landmarks in my head or moments from this ride.

1424
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,400
What the ride is to me is there's a Z, there's a Z, there's another Z.

1425
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,520
I really do not stop and take it in.

1426
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,520
Yeah.

1427
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:21,960
Sticks out to me watching the ride footage is how many of the robots have little plaques

1428
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,440
that say Zerg rules.

1429
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,440
It's a pretty funny detail.

1430
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,200
Yeah, that's good.

1431
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,560
I hope they're in the movie.

1432
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:33,960
This is, and maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, but this is a ride that I almost appreciate

1433
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,320
that it doesn't look great.

1434
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,000
It's not, especially now and it doesn't hold up so much.

1435
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I've always liked it.

1436
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,200
And especially when it came out first, I thought it was because it was the first thing that

1437
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,200
was a big video game.

1438
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,360
So I was ecstatic about that aspect.

1439
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:51,960
But unlike Men in Black, which has crazy, it's in the Orlando ride, Men in Black at

1440
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,760
Universal, has like very elaborate animatronics and it's still a shooting game.

1441
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,760
Big sets too.

1442
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,760
Big sets of stuff.

1443
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,480
That sounds awesome.

1444
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,440
But you're still like, you have that panic of trying to get a high score so you're not

1445
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,800
taking stuff in as much.

1446
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,480
So I do like, because I agree with you, Scott, where I'm like, I remember like a couple things,

1447
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,160
but I've been on this ride so many times and I don't really have a good like geography

1448
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:17,320
for where things are because I'm in a panic to get a high score.

1449
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,800
But it's good that the ride, so what I'm saying is it's good the ride kind of looks like shit

1450
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,160
in places.

1451
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,160
That's what I'm saying.

1452
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,680
Well, the storyline of the ride, it kind of like that Toy Story 2 opening.

1453
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,040
It kind of splits the difference between the reality of the world and the reality of

1454
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,920
a bunch of toys with AA batteries.

1455
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1456
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,840
The squeak, the little green men.

1457
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,840
There's cool, cool stuff.

1458
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,400
When I say shit, I'm exaggerating.

1459
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,400
Yeah.

1460
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,400
But it is.

1461
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,400
Yeah, yeah.

1462
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,720
No, it's neat and fun in there, but it is very, it's like a, it's a high end laser tag.

1463
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,720
Yeah.

1464
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,720
That's good.

1465
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:54,320
That's the most, that's the most amount of theming I want for a ride that I'm like panicking

1466
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,600
trying to get scores and not taking the theming.

1467
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,120
I hear that word a lot of times now.

1468
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,160
Does that describe your frame of mind?

1469
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,400
You do, it is a panic for you.

1470
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,520
Maybe it's a panic, but it is definitely like very focused.

1471
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,880
I'm very focused about getting a good score.

1472
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,400
I don't like to mess with the, cause there's like a directional like toggle on the ride

1473
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,600
too that you can sort of swerve in either direction.

1474
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,440
I like to, I like to be in control of that.

1475
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,440
Yes, me too.

1476
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,440
If it's going to move at all.

1477
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,440
Yes.

1478
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,120
Cause I don't necessarily trust who I'm with all the time to know where to go, where to

1479
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,120
point it.

1480
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:31,280
There's kind of a lesser necessity for the later versions of the ride where you can take

1481
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,640
the gun out of the holster and there's the cable.

1482
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,520
The Florida one, the guns are mounted like a carnival game kind of thing.

1483
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,520
Still?

1484
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,520
Yeah.

1485
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,520
God.

1486
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,920
And so it's kind of more necessary.

1487
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:49,520
Also the Florida one, very much more clearly painted flats like the Tokyo and the Anaheim

1488
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,240
ones, a little more depth to them, a little more movement.

1489
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:57,240
They have some more like robot three dimensional things that are like look cool and are not

1490
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,240
just like cheap.

1491
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,520
When you get to the big Zerg, the big Zerg is good.

1492
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,760
I really like the big Zerg.

1493
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,760
Yeah.

1494
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:05,760
Yeah.

1495
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:06,760
And that's pretty dimensional.

1496
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,760
You get a lot of Zergs.

1497
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,600
You get this Zerg early on, there's a Zerg flying by in the background.

1498
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:16,640
So if your desire is to see him, which I do like him.

1499
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:24,160
Last time I was there, I bought a Zerg for my kid who like one of the first things he

1500
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:28,080
ever said was just a, was he's like a grrr.

1501
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,800
He points at it, he knows exactly what it is.

1502
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,800
He's obsessed with it.

1503
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,960
I was thinking about bringing it in to see if we could do anything with it or just to

1504
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,480
inspire us, but I don't want to take it away from him.

1505
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,120
He'd be upset if Zerg was gone.

1506
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:41,240
You did what with it?

1507
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,560
That is for me, that is not content, dad.

1508
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,560
It's not content.

1509
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,560
He learned the word content.

1510
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,560
He learned the word content.

1511
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,480
I'm a broadcasters home.

1512
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:55,800
One Zerg piece of trivia involving the ride is that I didn't realize that the ride in

1513
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,640
Florida was there before the movie.

1514
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:05,320
So this, so actually in 1998, Space Rangers Spin was the first place you could ever see

1515
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,600
Zerg who was only spoken of in Toy Story.

1516
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:09,600
Wow.

1517
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,560
Sort of like Boba Fett in the holiday special.

1518
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,120
Is that really the first Boba Fett appearance?

1519
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,120
Whoa.

1520
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,680
In an animated cartoon.

1521
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,680
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1522
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:21,680
Right.

1523
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,400
Another great thing about the holidays, but my favorite, my Star Wars.

1524
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,440
Mike, I have similar memories to you.

1525
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,440
This opened up.

1526
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,160
It's kind of like a video game.

1527
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:36,720
And like 1998, it was like, oh, this is so cool.

1528
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:42,720
And then a year later, Men in Black opens up and I don't think I wrote it for a couple

1529
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:48,240
years and it was instantly like, I was like, oh, getting to hold the gun is much more

1530
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,880
preferable than like hunching over this mounted cannon thing.

1531
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,000
And then when I came out here for the first time, I was like, oh, the Buzz Lightyear has

1532
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,480
the gun, like the guns with the cable.

1533
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:03,440
It's so much easier and the noises are more like appealing, like more pleasant.

1534
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,040
That no, I'm trying to look over the noises.

1535
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,600
Are they still unpleasant in the Florida?

1536
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,600
They're not unpleasant.

1537
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,800
I just think they're a nice kind of like little bouncy.

1538
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,280
Florida Buzz Lightyear almost every time I've gone.

1539
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,720
And I'm sure I've ever done it.

1540
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:16,920
I wonder if I've done it.

1541
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,400
That backs up a lot worse, I feel like.

1542
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,240
Yeah, I have obviously done it when I was younger, but that's OK.

1543
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,400
Next time. That's an ugly exterior.

1544
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,680
I do not like that exterior.

1545
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,520
That is just like a weird, gackey frame.

1546
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,360
It just looks like, you know, like paste on art for a kid's room.

1547
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:34,920
Yeah, I don't really like that.

1548
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:40,120
Yeah, yeah. That's but I think it could all I think there is a way to aesthetically

1549
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,440
I don't know, improve plus up this.

1550
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:49,120
I like the I believe the Shanghai one has screens.

1551
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:52,840
And it's weird to say screens is the remedy, but I feel like there's something

1552
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:58,200
there's like something in digitizing or the way they've updated the Fantasyland rides.

1553
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:02,960
There's a way to get some, you know, just more subtlety and texture and depth.

1554
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,360
That might be I don't I don't love Toy Story mania.

1555
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,080
I feel like you got it. You got to do too much.

1556
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:15,560
Like, I feel like shooting a gun is easier than like pulling this like rope, like ball thing.

1557
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,400
Well, it certainly hurts less. Yeah, yeah.

1558
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,080
Absolutely less pain. Yeah.

1559
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:23,520
You buzz. Maybe the true admission is I'm too out of shape to do Toy Story mania.

1560
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,680
It's all wrist shape, though.

1561
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:30,720
It's really like carpal tunnel causing because we've talked about it before.

1562
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,960
And I really like me and we mean it.

1563
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,240
But I think everybody has a similar experience.

1564
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:39,840
By the by the end of that last bonus round, you are like, all right, let's go.

1565
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,520
Like they can take one screen out and I'd be like, that was fine.

1566
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,040
Like it would be. Yeah. Yeah.

1567
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,280
Oh, you want one less round? Yeah. One less round.

1568
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,520
Get me out of there.

1569
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,120
But like because I also didn't just feel like screen like

1570
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,200
I went to Universal in Halloween this past Halloween.

1571
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,640
And I was there early so I could do some of the rides I didn't see in a long time.

1572
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,360
And I hadn't done the Harry Potter stuff.

1573
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,720
And I was like, I'm going to throw up.

1574
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,880
I was like, this feels so bad to me.

1575
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,760
Those are. Yeah, that one's that one's rough for sure.

1576
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,920
And then the the the last one that I did was the Transformers one.

1577
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,120
And I was like, I can't do any more of these today.

1578
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,000
This is like rattling my brain. I can't do it.

1579
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,920
Yeah, I'm totally with you.

1580
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,960
I think I've just started to like screens that amend

1581
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:27,560
others because sort of rise of the resistance is that you'd have to say.

1582
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:31,880
And I like that screen elements, but it's never fully.

1583
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,600
I guess at the end when you go into that pod, but, you know,

1584
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,080
little screens all around or even the Jurassic World

1585
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,920
like the screen section of that ride, I think is fantastic.

1586
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:47,840
I wonder if we'll get a light year update for it.

1587
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,520
There are rumors of Griffin.

1588
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,680
Yeah, there are rumors.

1589
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,880
Are there legitimate rumors?

1590
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:55,240
Yeah, I don't know if they're so strong, but I've seen it speculated here and there.

1591
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:59,080
Because I wonder, I mean, it feels like they're really pushing this movie

1592
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:02,120
by saying that it's going to like that changed Andy's life.

1593
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:05,960
That's a big that's a, you know, we don't know what else has changed his life.

1594
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:06,960
Yeah.

1595
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,680
So I wonder if they're they're expecting this movie to do well.

1596
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,080
Because I also think this is going to be the first the first Pixar movie

1597
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,600
in like two or three years that's like released in theaters.

1598
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,200
That's right. Yeah.

1599
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,880
Yeah. That's interesting.

1600
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,880
Mm hmm. Yeah.

1601
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:23,080
They they gave the animators of color a chance.

1602
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,680
Yeah. They dumped all their movies on the streaming service.

1603
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,680
Absolutely. Yeah.

1604
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,600
But light year and light year, the character who's been in nine movies already.

1605
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,160
Yeah. Yeah. He's going theatrical.

1606
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:37,560
Looks like truly like what you picture when you picture like a white guy.

1607
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,960
He's now he's now more of a generic white dude.

1608
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,480
Yeah. He has less specific than ever before.

1609
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,880
I I have a couple of weird things with this.

1610
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:53,320
Like the one is that like the face in this upcoming move,

1611
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:57,600
like the face of the toy makes sense because toys are often caricatures of humans.

1612
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:01,800
But then the face looks pretty similar in the light year one

1613
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,600
where it's supposed to be more realistic.

1614
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:07,560
But other complaint is that I I just over the weekend, I was like, man,

1615
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,520
it's a lot of people still talking about light year.

1616
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,280
That must be out next week. Right.

1617
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,600
And the answer was no.

1618
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,280
Six weeks like five, six more weeks.

1619
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:20,520
There's more talk about light year than there was for this new Fantastic Beasts

1620
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,840
movie that was shocked came out last week.

1621
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,400
Like, yeah. Wow.

1622
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,920
It did. Yeah.

1623
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,560
Geez. Got shrounced by the bad guy.

1624
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:29,800
Yeah. Yeah.

1625
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:34,280
Well, there were some issues in terms of getting the cast to promote the film.

1626
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,000
Oh, OK. Oh, yeah.

1627
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,640
We weren't as aware. I know.

1628
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,920
I remember that. Yeah.

1629
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,760
So available to. Yeah.

1630
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,360
OK. Got it. Now they could have gotten mad out there.

1631
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,800
Everybody loves mad.

1632
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,720
No one, you know, mad.

1633
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,880
Yeah. The fate of the franchise rests with you.

1634
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,880
Guy who's known for being like a very personable, like cool guy.

1635
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,200
Oh, that's good.

1636
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,680
Guy who's like, yeah, going to do a Broadway thing after they're due to,

1637
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,360
like, one million dollar movie.

1638
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,920
Yeah. Yeah.

1639
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,840
A guy who, like, doesn't look scary.

1640
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,720
Well, we'll see.

1641
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,880
We got more weeks to ponder this.

1642
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,680
Yeah. See if we get more.

1643
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:18,120
I think after Dr. Strange. Right. Right.

1644
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:22,120
There's more promotion or more interviews about Lightyear.

1645
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:26,720
I think the way it goes now is that like because it still feels like they're not

1646
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,240
confident because they're not doing Jungle Cruise 2 yet.

1647
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,960
No. So it feels like that, like an overlay gets greenlit

1648
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,600
as soon as like Jungle Cruise 2 or as soon as Lightyear 2.

1649
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,360
Yeah. Gets greenlit.

1650
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:40,520
I don't know. That could be wrong.

1651
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,560
But like it feels like they need like an extra bit of confidence.

1652
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:46,680
Yeah, they need to know that it's going to be sticking around.

1653
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,960
For a 10th Buzz Lightyear. Yeah. Yeah.

1654
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:53,760
Exactly. So then promotional tool tool for a future movie.

1655
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,480
It's not just enough to have it in the park.

1656
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:59,000
It'll be built into Chris Evans' contract that he's going to have to record

1657
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,400
Vio for the ride.

1658
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,000
And that's that's already in there.

1659
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,680
Yeah. I think they can lock that down now.

1660
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,320
They're not losing these actors.

1661
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:12,280
Well, the big rumor right now, Matt, the the Tarzan tree house is closed.

1662
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:16,120
I was going to ask. Yeah. And they're they've announced

1663
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,160
they're going to re theme it.

1664
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:22,880
And they're I haven't seen in Canto yet, but there is a tree house in that movie.

1665
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:26,480
Yes. I have not heard like the tree house is vital to the plot of the movie.

1666
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,040
But there is a tree house. Yes.

1667
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:31,280
And that is an existing tree house.

1668
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:35,600
Does it seem like the best place to have like a hit movies ride?

1669
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,920
Like this very narrow 1950s pathway?

1670
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:42,040
Yeah, that's not like ADA, like accessible in any sort of way.

1671
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,600
No. OK. But what?

1672
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,800
Hear me out here in Canto. Fine.

1673
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:50,680
But what if Lightyear had a tree house and we could go in and visit that?

1674
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:53,320
That'd be good. Yeah. I'd be interested.

1675
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:58,560
Like the light buzz Lightyear saw a movie about a guy who had a tree house

1676
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:02,720
that inspired him to explore the universe to want to go get up high.

1677
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,280
That's what I want. I love being up in my tall tree.

1678
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,680
But what if I could go even higher than this?

1679
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:11,000
Well, where's higher than a tall tree buzz?

1680
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,360
What are you talking about, doofus?

1681
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:19,040
Maybe up there, maybe somewhere like infinity or even beyond.

1682
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:23,040
I don't know where the where the catchphrase came from.

1683
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,600
Well, you got to know where the catchphrase is.

1684
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,240
We have to learn.

1685
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,120
Oh, I think that's all coming.

1686
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:32,800
He either says the catchphrase or says half the catchphrase gets it wrong.

1687
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,360
And then there's like a they fly now kind of bit about.

1688
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,600
Yeah, sure.

1689
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,680
Somebody's going to say that happened.

1690
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,600
You know, they got to have a moment like that in there.

1691
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,360
I want to try that one again.

1692
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:43,920
I think you need a punch up pass.

1693
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,520
Who says that?

1694
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:48,960
I hope so.

1695
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,360
I just saw a tweet going around that I was so fascinated by,

1696
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,600
which is that we're coming up on the 10th anniversary

1697
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:00,840
of the release of the first Avengers movie and early press screenings

1698
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:05,360
did not have the swarm scene in it because it had not been filmed.

1699
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,720
Like it was a few weeks before release.

1700
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,440
No, I believe it. I believe it was filmed at the premiere.

1701
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:15,320
At the premiere, I believe after the junket, like they got them all together

1702
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,880
for the junket and then put them in.

1703
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,400
It's either the junket or the premiere.

1704
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,440
But it like it might have been the premiere because that was the only time

1705
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,040
they were all together again.

1706
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,120
And they quickly. Yeah. Oh, crazy.

1707
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,320
And Evans has a beard in that scene.

1708
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,200
And he's that's why he's like he has his hand over his face. Yeah.

1709
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:30,760
Because he was shooting a different movie.

1710
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,240
So it's their solution.

1711
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,120
They should have done something cool like like Mission Impossible

1712
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:38,960
Fallout where he reloads his fist and his beard gets a little thicker.

1713
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:40,480
In the movie.

1714
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,680
Does that happen when he when he does the when he does that?

1715
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:47,720
I just saw this clip going around when he does the punch, watch his beard.

1716
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,720
And a little thicker. It does.

1717
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:52,000
I don't know. I think it's a you see this.

1718
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,960
I've seen it. It's like it's it.

1719
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,080
I don't know how or why it's yeah.

1720
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,800
It's certainly not because he did it, but like because.

1721
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,120
But it's like some sort of editing, like mistake that like they might

1722
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,880
maybe use two shots or something.

1723
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:08,320
But it's a cool idea to pump your own beard up.

1724
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,040
Yeah. Like what is it?

1725
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:11,200
And then the implication of what does that do?

1726
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,200
Like you certainly have a little more testosterone.

1727
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,160
You're probably a little stronger. Sure.

1728
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,440
Yeah. I mean, it is.

1729
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:20,600
It's interesting in the in the story of like, oh, this is when you see this.

1730
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,160
It is. I gets a little more evil.

1731
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,800
His beard gets thicker and his fist punches.

1732
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,400
Icon as you keep doing it, describing the story.

1733
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,880
I can picture it exactly.

1734
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,400
In the trailer. And it's a great moment.

1735
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,960
It's really cool because you just sort of know right away.

1736
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,440
This guy's like really strong.

1737
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,080
Like you like you only do that.

1738
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,320
You're not going to do that if you're like me.

1739
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,960
It's not going to communicate this thing.

1740
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,600
But if you're Henry Cavill and you're like jacked as shit, you're like,

1741
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,720
I better stay away from this guy.

1742
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:44,640
Yeah. Yeah.

1743
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,040
Just looks like a failed dance move otherwise.

1744
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:50,120
You're a normal person getting the water off your hands because there's no paper

1745
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,160
towel. Yeah.

1746
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,160
The Dyson didn't recognize. Yeah.

1747
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:56,920
Yeah. My arms are so thin that Dyson couldn't recognize them.

1748
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,280
It is a franchise.

1749
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,240
It's a franchise of cool movements.

1750
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,560
I mean, the first one where he like drops into the room.

1751
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:04,760
Yeah. Steady.

1752
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:08,880
The second one, people might not think this cool, but where he gets the message

1753
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,840
through his Oakley sunglasses and throws them at the camera.

1754
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:12,920
And they explode.

1755
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,880
All that like pointy running he does.

1756
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:15,960
Oh, all the pointy running.

1757
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:16,920
Oh, yeah.

1758
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,400
Yeah. The craziest running

1759
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:22,200
that when he breaks his leg.

1760
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:23,360
Oh, yeah.

1761
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:24,760
It's in there and they use it.

1762
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:25,320
I love them.

1763
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,000
They're simply the greatest films ever made.

1764
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,400
I don't disagree.

1765
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,160
He's an absolute freak.

1766
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,000
He's like the greatest movie star of all time.

1767
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,480
The greatest movie star.

1768
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,200
I saw that anecdote that

1769
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:40,080
what's is it Jake Johnson from New Girl and the new.

1770
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,160
When he did the mummy with him.

1771
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:44,240
Where he did the mummy and they jump off a collapsing three story building.

1772
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:46,320
And Jake Johnson lands on his back.

1773
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:47,480
He goes, oh, I'm hurt.

1774
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,600
And Tom Cruise goes, are you injured or you hurt?

1775
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,320
And he says, what's the difference?

1776
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:54,400
He's like, well, injured means like something's broken.

1777
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,240
Can you go again?

1778
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,160
He's like, yeah, I can.

1779
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,040
I can get up and go again.

1780
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,400
He's like, OK, then you're hurt.

1781
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,480
Oh, my God.

1782
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:02,080
Of course, you're hurt.

1783
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,840
You fell off a three story building.

1784
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,640
What a normal man.

1785
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,480
Yeah.

1786
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:13,040
Look, I look, I'm going to cut it off here because I have three Tom Cruise stories

1787
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,560
that I've seen on talk shows that I want to talk about.

1788
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,080
But we're no that's not what this is about.

1789
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:20,280
I just want to cut it off here because there's no theme park presence.

1790
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,880
You have nowhere to put that's absolutely shocking to me.

1791
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,680
Well, they've they've they bungled the mummy, didn't they?

1792
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,400
We could have got a new mummy overlay.

1793
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:28,720
Yes, I know.

1794
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:32,280
Yeah. And Mission Impossible, because Tom is just talking about him again.

1795
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:35,280
Mission, he just he just apparently squashed the idea of doing

1796
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:39,040
Mission Impossible streaming show, which could I say make it special.

1797
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,040
Yeah, yeah.

1798
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:40,960
We don't need that on.

1799
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,880
But come on, Tom, where's the Mission Impossible ride?

1800
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,560
Where is it?

1801
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,520
Yeah. Make it the best ride of all time.

1802
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,360
Put it at Six Flags or something.

1803
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,000
Yes. Oh, yeah.

1804
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,160
It's just a Riddler repainted.

1805
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,160
It's a possible ride.

1806
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:57,720
Go. Well, how do you but how do you get a ride to Tom Cruise?

1807
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:01,760
Standards like how do you does it have to like push us to the brink?

1808
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,520
Yeah, we have to not injured.

1809
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,880
It has to be built into the ride that like you might die for real.

1810
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,280
Well, you sign you are doing this.

1811
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,440
Yeah, you sign.

1812
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:13,960
It's not some like bland legal entity that you're signing for.

1813
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,880
It's like a paper that he wrote.

1814
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:18,560
Yeah. Or you watch a video where he's addressing you.

1815
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,000
And he's like staring your eyes and like, I feel like

1816
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,480
if Tom Cruise is in his room right now and he stared in our eyes

1817
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,480
and told us to do something, we'd all do it no matter what.

1818
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,960
100 percent. Because he has he has that power.

1819
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:29,800
100 percent.

1820
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,240
He would because he makes he's like one of those like politician guys

1821
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:35,360
who like you looking at you and you're like, this guy is in love with me

1822
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:39,160
and I will do whatever he says.

1823
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,360
He activates your injury in mode.

1824
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,040
Yeah. All I would want to do is make him laugh.

1825
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,880
And I know I couldn't know.

1826
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:46,520
You know, I couldn't.

1827
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:48,080
But also, I don't know what he thinks is funny.

1828
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,200
Like there's no way he thinks anything normal is funny.

1829
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,520
Well, he jumped. I bet.

1830
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,960
Like there's a clip where he like jumps over Keegan Michael Key.

1831
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,000
They were. That's a deep.

1832
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:56,960
Oh, that was a deep.

1833
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,360
Yeah. You got fooled, my friend.

1834
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:00,240
Fooled. I thought it was real.

1835
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,280
But that does seem like something he would think is funny.

1836
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,080
Like doing a job.

1837
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:06,160
If he saw that, he'd probably be like, yeah, you'd love it.

1838
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,560
He'd like talking about Tom Cruise.

1839
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,840
Yeah, it's not the back to the podcast.

1840
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,320
Yeah. Well, let's talk about that.

1841
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,040
Why don't we talk about the star of this ride?

1842
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,200
Not Tim Allen, but Pat Fraley.

1843
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,440
Yeah, it was fake Buzz Light.

1844
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,120
We've talked about fake Woody Jim Hanks.

1845
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:27,080
We haven't given due to fake Buzz Lightyear, Pat Fraley.

1846
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,280
Pat Fraley is a Ninja Turtles voice.

1847
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:31,640
Oh, yes. He is.

1848
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:34,280
Crane Crane on the original Ninja Turtles.

1849
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,800
So major credit from that and like eight billion other shows.

1850
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,760
But usually if you see my crank real quick, of course,

1851
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,560
to enter

1852
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,960
the end, you're one is.

1853
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,320
That's all I got. Tom Cruise.

1854
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,280
I want you to know I don't laugh very often.

1855
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,920
But what I'm about to produce

1856
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:54,680
a ha ha ha.

1857
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:55,840
And that's as much as he goes.

1858
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,080
But you did make him laugh. I love shredder.

1859
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,960
I absolutely loved your crank.

1860
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,360
Do you understand?

1861
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,040
Oh, it's all I could dream of.

1862
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:07,040
Vienna.

1863
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,160
We have a safe cracker roll.

1864
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,840
It's only one scene.

1865
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,360
But if you can do your crank voice.

1866
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:15,800
That's how he cast his movies.

1867
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,880
He sees somebody do one thing that he likes and is like, all right, you're in.

1868
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:20,840
That's it. You're done.

1869
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,720
It's work. There's a lot of henchmen.

1870
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,160
Like there's a lot of guys. Yeah.

1871
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:26,680
You know. And then he OK, I'm going to tell the story.

1872
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,200
He was on the talk show.

1873
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,880
He's on Graham Norton with Rebecca Ferguson.

1874
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:32,320
And she said the first time that she did a stunt where they went down

1875
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:35,040
a building or whatever, it was like a scary thing because it was so high up.

1876
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,960
And then they landed and he looked at her and he went, welcome to mission.

1877
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,200
Oh, my God.

1878
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:44,000
He was on the show, too, and he claims he didn't do that.

1879
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,880
But she goes, yes, you did say that to me after the stunt was over.

1880
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,520
He probably was so mad.

1881
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:49,600
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1882
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,600
Do you think you could tell if we put a mission style clock on it?

1883
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,560
Could you tell both stories?

1884
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:56,800
The other two stories?

1885
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,120
How much time does he have? How much time does the fuse take?

1886
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:01,320
No, I don't. I don't want to.

1887
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,000
That's too much pressure.

1888
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,720
That's more pressure than I was.

1889
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,640
Anecdote, I have the clearest in my mind.

1890
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,920
So if you get up the gumption to do another one, so funny.

1891
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:10,760
Let me think.

1892
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,640
The I was going to say that I like the

1893
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:19,560
I think one of my favorite gift shops in the park is the one that's outside of the bus.

1894
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,200
Uh huh. It's like a sort of it's called.

1895
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,560
I don't remember either, but I feel like it's like a good I like the theming in there

1896
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,560
because it's it's consistent with the ride.

1897
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:32,920
So it is very like it's very buzz like it's like very like green and purple

1898
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,160
and blue in there. And I don't know.

1899
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,080
I like it in there. Kid friendly.

1900
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,160
Yeah. Pixar stuff.

1901
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,680
Yeah. Mm hmm.

1902
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:41,800
Like sometimes. Yeah.

1903
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:42,880
I know there are cars.

1904
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,440
You can buy cars merch there a lot, too. Yeah.

1905
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,280
So there's a lot of pin racks.

1906
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,000
I feel like I used to be so interested in the pins.

1907
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I and now I'm just like, I mean,

1908
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:57,400
they're the same that like they're like Funko Pops now, too, right?

1909
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,400
Or they're sort of similar in that way

1910
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,120
in popularity, I think.

1911
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:05,800
But I don't know if pins, I guess, reached further than this.

1912
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:08,280
I've been so seldom on the show.

1913
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:10,200
We're not the pin guys.

1914
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:14,360
No. By you being ever a pin guy, that makes you the you're the biggest pin guy in the room.

1915
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:16,800
I think I mean, I say that and I probably had it.

1916
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:20,480
I probably had 10 pins like that's like as many as I had.

1917
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,160
I had a pin face. I had a pin face.

1918
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:23,360
You have a few dozen pins.

1919
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,920
And now they like threw houses.

1920
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,280
Have you you in the pin wars?

1921
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,040
Yeah, it was in the pin wars.

1922
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:31,440
I feel like now when I see them, it's not as big of a deal like at

1923
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,360
at the parks.

1924
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,640
I feel like now it's sort of like these people are off to the side,

1925
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,480
whereas it was more of an like not an advertised thing,

1926
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:42,400
but it was more an out and proud sort of thing in the park.

1927
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,120
And now I feel like I see people with their like little felt

1928
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:49,520
background or something with the pins in it, the book sometimes.

1929
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,920
Yeah. And like a flashlight.

1930
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,960
Like they're doing it under cover of darkness now.

1931
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,040
Yeah. What's the thing? Yeah.

1932
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:57,360
I've seen these like little shit where it almost feels like a street performer.

1933
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,360
Yeah. Where it feels like is this this can't be or they're like on

1934
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,160
canal street or something in New York.

1935
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:04,760
Like it's like a very like we're like, hey, we got pins.

1936
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,240
We got pins over here. You want the pins? Yeah.

1937
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,280
They encouraged pain trade.

1938
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:11,120
I mean, they've always got a pin trading. Yeah.

1939
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,960
The little felt boards that the cast members have at some spot,

1940
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:16,360
like that's the official like park one.

1941
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:19,520
But then what's happened, this happened with lightsabers recently.

1942
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:23,880
There was a big there's lightsaber meet meet up sometimes at Galaxy's Edge,

1943
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:28,080
where it's like people organize them this themselves.

1944
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:31,200
So like pin traders, I feel like just an earlier version of that.

1945
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,160
Yeah. Are they? Yeah. Sorry.

1946
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:37,000
Oh, I was going to say they just set up at that tomorrow land terrace.

1947
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,880
And then they got the books and the binders and stuff.

1948
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,880
I think this is what you're saying, man. And I agree.

1949
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:45,080
Sometimes it feels like you turn a corner and it's almost as if you caught

1950
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,760
like two people kissing or something. Yeah.

1951
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,640
You're like, oh, I don't need to see this. Yeah.

1952
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,560
No, I didn't. I didn't. I'm not.

1953
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,480
I'm not involved in your trading.

1954
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,840
Go ahead, please. Please don't mind me.

1955
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:59,080
I will say my favorite pin and Emperor Kuzco pin. Very nice. Oh, cool.

1956
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,720
And you have it. I still have it.

1957
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,320
And it's pre transformation.

1958
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,520
So it's him as the guy.

1959
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:07,560
And I always I always really love that that movie.

1960
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:10,880
I remember this and I guess I don't.

1961
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:13,320
I'm remembering that we've talked the one time we talked about pins

1962
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:16,200
is that Jason said you could buy the pins this and I'm selling you out.

1963
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,800
I was going to this is a whole thing.

1964
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:20,040
Jason talked about how you could buy the pins on Amazon.

1965
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:22,960
And apparently those are knockoff pins. Oh, no.

1966
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:28,320
Yeah, I saw multiple blogs recommend this as like, hey, families,

1967
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:31,880
if you want to go and do pin trading with the members, you can just buy bulk

1968
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:35,120
things of pins and then you trade them.

1969
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:40,400
And and there's as many like family blogs or message words

1970
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,440
as it's all doing this.

1971
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:44,880
There's the counterpoint where people are like, you're putting false

1972
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,120
pins in the ecosystem. Yes.

1973
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,280
Yeah. Circulating scrapper pin.

1974
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,520
And so Jason is a purveyor of false pins.

1975
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,400
I didn't like to trade trading even as a kid, like even at the height

1976
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:58,320
of Marvel trading, like I felt so anxious trading.

1977
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,440
Yeah. And this is mine.

1978
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,880
Especially with a stranger.

1979
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,920
Yeah. Yeah. I got to talk to you. Yeah.

1980
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,320
Yeah. And like, I don't really know.

1981
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:07,680
Yeah. As a child, you don't know the I mean, you kind of know the value.

1982
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,240
But yeah. Yeah.

1983
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:11,000
So I I don't know.

1984
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,760
So I would buy them once or twice.

1985
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,120
I trade it with cast members.

1986
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:18,560
But like now it's fun, like fully crying.

1987
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,680
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1988
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:23,920
But now he does all the fake ones.

1989
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:25,520
So he's he's doing it constantly.

1990
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,400
Yeah. These are scrappers.

1991
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,720
Get it. You're banned for life.

1992
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:32,720
Bite him to see if they're so thin.

1993
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,600
I don't know if they are supposed to break or not.

1994
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,720
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1995
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:36,800
Honestly, if you bite them.

1996
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:40,880
But I think right around the same time as Fast Pit, like the official dizzy

1997
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:45,320
pin trading marketing and logos came right around.

1998
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,760
My memory is like the very late 90s.

1999
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,760
Like it was a millennial thing.

2000
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:54,240
You got like they had like the lanyard that you can put pins on and stuff.

2001
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:57,440
And then you can be like, oh, like, yeah, cool.

2002
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,640
Too slick now.

2003
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,600
That is what it's like.

2004
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,520
Too slick now. Too expensive.

2005
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,040
Yeah. I say. Yeah.

2006
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:09,720
Hmm. Can we talk about the like the game itself, the Buzz Lightyear game?

2007
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:12,400
Yes. The stuff I didn't even know until looking for this.

2008
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,960
Yeah. I didn't know much in the way of secrets like just really how you do it.

2009
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:18,960
Right. Right. I was going to say, like, just the just the basics of like,

2010
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,760
what do the different shape targets mean as far as points?

2011
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,480
Like, I didn't even really know this.

2012
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:29,800
I knew instinctually I knew what was right and I knew it was lit up.

2013
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:33,920
It was more. But just to see it like circle is 100 square is a thousand.

2014
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,960
Diamond is five thousand. Triangle is ten thousand.

2015
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:40,240
And then if they're lit up, they're worth ten times that amount.

2016
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:43,080
Yeah. You can go. You can get home.

2017
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,480
There's more. And obviously there are more circles because they don't want you to

2018
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:49,520
be getting, you know, a million points in the first one minute.

2019
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,680
The first minute of the ride. We're not made of points.

2020
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,040
We can't just give them away.

2021
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,640
Could you imagine what would happen if we just gave away all the points

2022
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,000
at the start of the ride?

2023
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,640
He landed bankrupt.

2024
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,880
You'd have to add another nine.

2025
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,720
We have to slightly expand the LCD.

2026
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:07,240
I wonder what the highest documented score is.

2027
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,840
And that's maybe only interesting to the four of us.

2028
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,320
But that's OK.

2029
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:12,520
I'm sure there's people.

2030
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:16,360
I'm sure we're really proud of it who lorded over people that they got it.

2031
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:20,520
I think that so it maxes out when it's all nines on your board.

2032
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,600
So that's like it's nine hundred ninety nine thousand.

2033
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:23,800
And I know. Yeah.

2034
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:28,160
But I think if you go do that email, you can see the full score,

2035
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:29,360
which is higher.

2036
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:33,480
So you can see a score that is up in the millions range.

2037
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:37,680
I'm not sure what I think maybe a nine million is possible.

2038
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,160
I don't really know offhand.

2039
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:43,880
Yeah, I don't know how far you can go in the like off the books score.

2040
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,200
Honestly, I didn't really know like the glowing

2041
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,280
meant more points.

2042
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,960
I knew the shapes meant different points.

2043
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,720
I kind of knew they were hidden.

2044
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,960
What like the chest plate of the Zerg?

2045
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:57,960
There's a hidden one. Yes.

2046
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:00,000
I didn't know that. Why does everyone know this?

2047
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,120
Do you have to have looked this up?

2048
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,760
I just want some videos today.

2049
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,240
That's how I. Yeah, I didn't know.

2050
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:08,000
It was like a thing that I had heard, like in the park, like a friend of mine.

2051
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:12,840
It was a big Disney parks like fan, and I think maybe she told me.

2052
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,040
But, you know, that's probably she looked it up.

2053
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:19,080
So it's between he's got big chest plates.

2054
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,200
And if you aim between, it's on marked.

2055
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:23,400
It doesn't have a big Z, but that's the that's the big.

2056
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,920
And I don't think it lights up either.

2057
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,120
So you would never know.

2058
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:31,400
No. And I think like one or two of the circles are secret, like 50,000 ones.

2059
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,400
Yeah. Really advertise that.

2060
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:37,280
There's other stuff that I knew like never stop firing.

2061
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:40,560
Like if you hit a target, you can just keep hitting the target. Yes.

2062
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:43,640
I only saw this one place

2063
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:49,200
mentioned the better luck next time score where every five shots,

2064
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:51,960
if you don't hit something, you get points.

2065
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,480
And the other thing I said, yeah, like sympathy points

2066
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,440
because you aren't getting anything. That's nice.

2067
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,800
And so that adds to the like never stop firing.

2068
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:02,800
And Matt, what you were saying about like riding alone. Yeah.

2069
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:05,000
I had never seen this advice like

2070
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:09,000
you can probably get more points if you sit on the left to most one

2071
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:12,480
and then take the other one and put it on the seat, because at a certain point,

2072
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,680
it's just going to start firing. Oh, wow.

2073
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:18,760
So for the to cut down on confusion of the little dots,

2074
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:21,720
which you can see sort of your target.

2075
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:25,960
A little bit like what it's lining up as if he has a scope or something.

2076
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:30,760
Now this I have a lot of I would say that I'm not great at this, some of which is

2077
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,760
I get OK. So it is the green.

2078
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:38,720
It's like it is the green like site at the top is what you're going off of.

2079
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,240
Right. Not the going off field, baby.

2080
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,040
Circle in the back.

2081
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:46,160
I just if I'm trying to visualize it, I'm screwing up.

2082
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,480
I never think too much.

2083
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:48,800
I think because you have to do much.

2084
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:51,720
Yeah, because you have to see like that little red thing that's going.

2085
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:55,880
Like, yeah. And you eventually just yeah, you're only I'm just doing it on instinct

2086
01:21:55,880 --> 01:22:00,320
where it's like I'm realizing because I can't even explain to you what I'm doing.

2087
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,520
Visual really, except for the red.

2088
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:06,920
They're obviously aiming at the thing, but like it takes me a couple.

2089
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:09,960
I feel like it maybe even takes me 30 seconds to lock back into it

2090
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:14,840
because it's not something that feels so direct as far as being able to like perfectly aim.

2091
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:19,280
I think as soon as the gun activates, start shooting the wall close to you.

2092
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:23,680
And then you can see how much it's wavering left or right or up or down.

2093
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,640
And then you can course correct.

2094
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,760
That's my trick. Uh huh.

2095
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,120
I'm just a few off.

2096
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:32,160
I'm just pure. I just I turn feral and I.

2097
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:35,560
Yeah, I sort of have like a Max Payne like bullet time sort of.

2098
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:39,040
Yeah, it slows down linear.

2099
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:41,400
You put sunglasses on.

2100
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:45,400
My favorite is the one that's not lit up in the dark hallway.

2101
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:48,000
That's a good one, because it makes me a favorite.

2102
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,600
Yeah, because if you don't know, yeah, that's it's all of a sudden illuminates

2103
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,640
the dark hallway if you start getting it.

2104
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:57,280
And especially if you I think I got stuck there once, which is that's a big thrill.

2105
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:59,440
Yeah, it's so direct and very close.

2106
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:01,400
Yeah, you're so close to it.

2107
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:02,160
There are a few, too.

2108
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:04,920
I feel like there's one on the ceiling in there also, I think.

2109
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:08,480
I mean, yeah, I'm trying to remember in that hallway.

2110
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:09,520
Yeah, I think so.

2111
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,600
There might be one on each side and then on the ceiling.

2112
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,520
Yeah, one for everybody.

2113
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:17,960
The best one I just learned about is when you get to the big Zerg at the end,

2114
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:23,880
swing the car to the opposite wall and you're really close to like a toy box thing.

2115
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:29,840
Shoot, get the toy box target that activates a triangle that is so close to you.

2116
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:30,840
And you would just.

2117
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,680
Oh, wow. I usually never see it if you were.

2118
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:35,120
Everyone is facing the giant animatronics.

2119
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:36,640
Yeah, but there's a secret.

2120
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:37,600
If you face the other.

2121
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,880
A last dash for like, yeah, whatever it is, like 10,000 points or something.

2122
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:44,960
Yes, it's it is.

2123
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,520
Yeah, it doesn't hurt, which is good.

2124
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,000
Because I don't leave it being hurt.

2125
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,440
Yeah, but but it does.

2126
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,400
It is like a totally different.

2127
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,360
Your brain is in a different spot.

2128
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,560
Yeah. Than a normal ride.

2129
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,440
And you're like, you're kind of in there for a while.

2130
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:01,040
I feel like, too, like I don't feel like it's a very short ride.

2131
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:02,440
It feels like it's a long.

2132
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,600
Do you have the time of it?

2133
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,520
Four to five minutes is what I. Wow.

2134
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,040
Yeah, kept coming across.

2135
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:11,360
But it feels like you're in there for 10 or something.

2136
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,280
Yeah. Timely time slows down.

2137
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,280
Yeah, it's bullet time.

2138
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:15,080
It's bullet time.

2139
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,800
So you don't even know what what the actual real time is.

2140
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,320
You're busy.

2141
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:22,720
Yeah, the Shanghai one, it seems like a lot of the complaints or criticisms

2142
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:27,240
we have, they solved in Shanghai, where it's like a mix of practical sets

2143
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:29,960
and screens enhancing it.

2144
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:32,440
A lot of screen enhancement stuff in Avatar.

2145
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:34,800
Yeah, OK. And that works really well.

2146
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,120
Yeah, I'm all in.

2147
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,200
Yeah. And I don't know what it is.

2148
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:40,240
I'm just I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready for more of it.

2149
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,040
I'm great.

2150
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,800
I'm going to be fine.

2151
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,160
It sounds good, but I kind of want it to look worse.

2152
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,440
Just like make it look worse because I don't need it.

2153
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:48,880
I mean, I'm just wanting to win.

2154
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,000
I was going to say, I like it.

2155
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,560
I like it to be flatter.

2156
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:53,360
Yes. Yeah. Wow.

2157
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,040
This is the. So what does that mean?

2158
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,320
Do you take things out?

2159
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:57,520
Yes. Less stuff.

2160
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,040
Take the Zerg out at the end.

2161
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,480
Take make just put up a painted flat.

2162
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:03,200
Yeah. Cardboard.

2163
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:03,840
How do you feel?

2164
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:07,160
Because, like, again, the Shanghai, the targets are screens.

2165
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:10,080
So I don't think you have to hit a precise infrared dot.

2166
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:13,400
And so it's a wide screen and it makes the screen.

2167
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,520
No, too easy. That's too easy.

2168
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,200
Yeah. I like having to hit that perfect target.

2169
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,280
Beginner mode. Yeah.

2170
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,400
That's like the cardinal game we were talking about earlier.

2171
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:23,240
Yeah. That main circle.

2172
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:26,680
The this I was just thinking the Snow White ride has

2173
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,600
some screen enhancements now.

2174
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,160
I guess that way I wouldn't be so mad at that.

2175
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,240
They did a nice job with that. Right.

2176
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:34,520
Subtle. Yeah. Yeah.

2177
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:35,880
I really like it. Yeah.

2178
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:40,480
So, yeah, I just think, you know, even more basic,

2179
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,880
the children should draw the characters and they should use those flats

2180
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,920
for the ride, because again, I do not care when I'm competing.

2181
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,280
Yeah. It's I don't know.

2182
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,160
There is something the competition element of it,

2183
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,960
because you can't compete on any other rides.

2184
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:55,000
Like, not really. Right.

2185
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,760
Yeah. Midway mania. And is there another one at Disney?

2186
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,720
The cars ride like is sort of a race, but you're not really.

2187
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:03,040
Yeah. You're not doing anything.

2188
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,320
Whipslingers. And I think you're.

2189
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,280
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I haven't done that yet.

2190
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:10,640
I've been back once during the pandemic, but I haven't.

2191
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:12,720
I haven't gotten the California adventure yet.

2192
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:15,040
Well, if you want exhaustion. Yeah.

2193
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,440
Like if you thought Toy Story Mania was exhausted.

2194
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,960
I got to go out there and do flips pretty pretty much.

2195
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,560
It's quite feels close to that.

2196
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:24,200
It is because you're just like both red and the arms.

2197
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:25,680
I will hurt your full arm.

2198
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,560
I'm actually. Yeah.

2199
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:30,720
I haven't felt the rush to go to the Avengers campus yet.

2200
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,880
I was more excited to go to the the campus.

2201
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:35,080
You should edge. Yeah. Yeah.

2202
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:37,680
The ride itself is fine. Yeah. The campus is good.

2203
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,640
I think we like it. I heard the food is good.

2204
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:41,200
Food and drink is good. Yeah.

2205
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,240
They're really filling it out.

2206
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,960
Kind of the promises they made with Galaxy's Edge of like,

2207
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:48,200
and they'll be characters and updated stuff.

2208
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:52,320
Yeah. Haven't so much paid off as much as they have at Avengers campus.

2209
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:53,640
They've done a much better job.

2210
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:55,960
I well, isn't it just so weird, though, because like

2211
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,320
you can do that at the

2212
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:04,480
at the Avengers campus because it's not themed to a certain location in time.

2213
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,360
Right. Yeah. It's like, yes.

2214
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:11,320
Whereas like the Galaxy's Edge is what it would Jakku

2215
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:13,800
after this movie or whatever.

2216
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:15,280
Yeah. It's in between two movies.

2217
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,480
Yeah. It's like there's a one to one day.

2218
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:20,160
Yeah. Stuck on this one day in between eight and nine.

2219
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,640
Yeah. Forever.

2220
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:25,280
But they establish all the Marvel campuses that are going up

2221
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:26,680
at a bunch of the parks.

2222
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:28,600
That is not the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

2223
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,600
It's a Marvel theme park universe.

2224
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:33,240
And that's why everyone is still alive.

2225
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:35,160
Yes. Oh, I see.

2226
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:38,440
I see. And they have done some made up crap like that.

2227
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,920
I think they could still do it if they want.

2228
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:44,240
I want to do is change the story like the they could keep it

2229
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:46,600
Jakku or whatever and just have it be like.

2230
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,280
It's it's it's like a force.

2231
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:52,880
The force. Yeah, it's the force.

2232
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,400
There is crystal. There's magic.

2233
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,560
There's time.

2234
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:58,200
Somehow Palpatine is returned.

2235
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:00,880
Some of those have to have time.

2236
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:02,880
Just say the dead speak as you walk in.

2237
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,640
Yeah, that's OK.

2238
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:07,280
All the old care, every one of these.

2239
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,200
There's a rumor. Oh, I don't even spoiler alert.

2240
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:13,440
Maybe I'm so sorry, but I'm so excited by the runtime.

2241
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:17,000
So yeah, give me 30 seconds ahead if you don't want to know this

2242
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,960
about maybe the Obi Wan show.

2243
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:23,040
People are acting like maybe Dexter Jets to is coming back

2244
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,560
in Disney pluses Obi Wan.

2245
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:25,480
That's what that was.

2246
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:29,120
And I'm so excited about the idea.

2247
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,720
I'd be interested in seeing him again.

2248
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:33,120
I've been playing Lego Star Wars

2249
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:35,680
and he has a fun little sequence in the game.

2250
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:37,560
He's great. Yeah. OK.

2251
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:39,920
Well, would you like to see him cooking up?

2252
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,280
Oh, what kind of stains do you want on his apron?

2253
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:46,200
Well, I want him to yell at someone for like smoking a death stick in the diner.

2254
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,560
Yeah. And I want him to.

2255
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:52,320
I'm trying to think what's the iguana that Obi Wan rides in?

2256
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,240
Is it is it Attack of the Clones?

2257
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:56,640
I think so. Yeah.

2258
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:58,520
Yeah, I think it is. Yeah.

2259
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:02,240
So like whatever that is, I want him to eat a cook that things eggs.

2260
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:04,400
Yeah. Giant eggs in the.

2261
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:07,400
Yeah, it is an attack of the clones in the end sequence right before

2262
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:10,720
Django Fett is murdered by Mace Windu.

2263
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:13,160
Right. A bogus. Yeah.

2264
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,880
OK, so bogus eggs is what I want.

2265
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,320
Very fun memory of that movie of like one of my

2266
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:21,440
dorkiest fucking thing.

2267
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,920
One of my friends had just gotten their license.

2268
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:27,000
And it was a Friday afternoon and they're like, hey,

2269
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,520
we should go see that new Star Wars.

2270
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:33,360
And it's like, yeah, there's a three o'clock showing at the mall,

2271
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,640
like next to the mall. It's like, let's go.

2272
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:38,960
And we all just got in the car and drove over, bought tickets.

2273
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,760
Yeah. Went inside and sat down.

2274
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:42,920
It used to be that easy.

2275
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,680
And wait, the story is you went to see a movie.

2276
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:49,640
But it was the first feeling of like, wow, someone has her drivers.

2277
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:50,800
We can just go do that.

2278
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:51,680
This is a thing we can.

2279
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:53,840
This is open to anybody.

2280
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,240
No drop offs.

2281
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:57,640
OK, OK. And then three days later, my family was.

2282
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:59,880
And I saw it again. Yeah.

2283
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:01,400
And I was like, I don't want to spoil it.

2284
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:04,240
But at the very end, something cool happened.

2285
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:06,320
Yeah. The I.

2286
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:09,840
This is before the financial crash and before the Trump administration.

2287
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:11,840
So this was all that to it.

2288
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,600
And this is Jason's peak. Oh, yeah.

2289
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:16,040
This is. Yeah. Never got any better than that.

2290
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:18,880
I mean, I well, no, it was exciting.

2291
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,680
Shrek came out right after.

2292
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:22,280
Oh, man. Rouge came out.

2293
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:24,040
Yeah. Wait, is that right?

2294
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:25,960
Wait a minute. Am I getting the time?

2295
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:28,200
I was in 2002, right?

2296
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:29,920
Oh, OK. Well, maybe. Yeah.

2297
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:31,200
No, that makes more sense.

2298
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:32,960
OK, so that was the previous summer.

2299
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,600
There was all that was before 9-11.

2300
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:35,520
It was even better.

2301
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,720
Is it that was the greatest summer?

2302
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:40,720
That was the last summer.

2303
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:44,840
So when when they say that this like that, the light year movie is

2304
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:47,760
Andy Star Wars, they could be talking about anything like

2305
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:50,720
it doesn't necessarily have to be like Star Wars.

2306
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,400
Yeah. His life went a bad way.

2307
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:56,680
Yeah. It's like he saw evolution and he's like, that is funny.

2308
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:59,160
That head and shoulders bit.

2309
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:00,800
That's funny.

2310
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:07,520
Let's see, what have we not gotten to that we enjoy?

2311
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:11,200
We've not feeling good at this.

2312
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,440
I like some of these tips next time.

2313
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:15,040
I will. Good tips.

2314
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,760
The claw gag at the end of Astro Blasters,

2315
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:22,200
where they've got Zerg in the box, the box, and they're like dangling it.

2316
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:23,800
That's right. Little green men.

2317
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:24,680
That's pretty good.

2318
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:26,360
You know what I think we haven't really talked about?

2319
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:27,920
It doesn't get enough credit.

2320
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:31,080
Is the Buzz animatronic in the cube?

2321
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:32,080
Yeah, yes. Yes.

2322
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:36,360
It's like a low key really good addition to a cube of any cube.

2323
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:39,040
But like it's sort of you don't think about about it when you're thinking

2324
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:42,040
of like the famous classic good robots in the cubes.

2325
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:45,000
Well, it's been kind of exceeded a little bit and the technology has.

2326
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,040
But the first appearance of it was really how does this work?

2327
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,960
Where is that projector? Yeah.

2328
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:53,600
If well, assuming you figure out it's a projection.

2329
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:57,400
But really, the first time you see it, like, I don't know what I'm looking.

2330
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:59,360
I don't know how he's moving this much.

2331
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:00,960
And the head is following.

2332
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,840
I guess it's a little projector inside.

2333
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,640
And the only thing in the projection is just is the face.

2334
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:08,800
And I don't know.

2335
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:11,040
It's so it's so well that you can look up on YouTube.

2336
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:14,560
Just the raw video. Yeah, it looks worse now.

2337
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:18,320
I remember being like, why does this look so bad?

2338
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:21,600
I remember it being like, he's here.

2339
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,480
Like, but maybe that's like where they could put a new screen.

2340
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:28,360
Yeah. It's just like, yeah, update with the Chris, the Chris Evans.

2341
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:30,040
But oh, sure. Yes.

2342
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:32,240
He's like that new face in there. Yeah.

2343
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:35,840
Oh, there is a thing I was going to say about Pat Fraley, but fake Buzz Lightyear

2344
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:39,160
voice, which is he he had been doing.

2345
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:42,360
He now doesn't do anything new as Buzz.

2346
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:45,560
I'm not sure why they try to make it maybe somewhere in this confusion.

2347
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:51,000
If now it's Chris Evans or they try to make Tim and Tom do more.

2348
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:55,760
But at the height when he was doing a lot of Buzz Lightyear,

2349
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:58,640
at some point he was talking to Disney people and he said, you know, I've

2350
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,200
I've never met Tim. I've never met Tim Allen.

2351
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:03,400
I feel like I'd like to be funny.

2352
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:07,080
That guy and he and his well, and Disney said,

2353
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,760
we don't think that's a good idea.

2354
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,960
And he was like, why?

2355
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,240
What's what would be wrong with meeting Tim Allen?

2356
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:15,240
And they said, well, he's been around.

2357
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:18,840
He's been stomping around before asking why his brother

2358
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,480
isn't the voice of Buzz Lightyear.

2359
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:24,680
Like, because Tom Hanks, his brother is always Woody.

2360
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,760
So Tim is like, why don't I get that?

2361
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,840
Why doesn't my brother get that deal?

2362
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,320
But as far as I know, I think he's got a few brothers

2363
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,520
and I don't believe they are actors.

2364
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:37,320
So why is a brother automatically,

2365
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:41,720
regardless of with with zero interest in in acting? Potentially.

2366
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:45,400
Yeah, this is I have a story that I can't say it now,

2367
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:48,080
but I'll tell you a story after we stop.

2368
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:49,840
All right. Yeah. After dark.

2369
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,680
That's great. Yeah, I don't know.

2370
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:54,760
Look, if Tim wants to put his brother's auditions, I'd love to.

2371
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:57,480
We could all rally behind them if they can do the voice, too.

2372
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:00,120
At this point, I don't know.

2373
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:03,000
All I'm hearing here is that this is a man who loves his brother

2374
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,280
and wants him to have work.

2375
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:06,400
That's so nice. Yeah. You know. Yeah.

2376
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:09,640
But obviously, if you did Cranes voice, I think you should get any job.

2377
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:11,000
You're for. Yeah.

2378
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,040
Well, yeah, perhaps a little more qualified.

2379
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:17,800
They tried. They auditioned the brother, but he swore too much in the first five

2380
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:19,360
words. All right.

2381
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:20,560
Just you know, and just have fun with it.

2382
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:23,000
Make it your own fucking buzz light.

2383
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,040
I'm fucking listen up, mother.

2384
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:27,040
Listen up, little bitches.

2385
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,840
I'm going in there. I don't know if they'll like it, but they'll remember me.

2386
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:33,200
Kids got to learn swearing sometime.

2387
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:37,360
If a voice you need a brother, a brother.

2388
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:38,600
Damn it. I had a.

2389
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:41,000
Oh, I got to know if a voice you need.

2390
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,200
I like where that was going.

2391
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:44,600
Brothers brother of a brother.

2392
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:47,080
A brother is the choice.

2393
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:48,200
I had it. I lost.

2394
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:52,520
If a voice you need a brother, take heed.

2395
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:54,920
A brother. Yeah, that's as close as I can come.

2396
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:58,000
Anyway, there's brothers indeed.

2397
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:03,080
He's more loyal to his brother than he is to all his coke buddies.

2398
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:05,480
Yeah, maybe my brother.

2399
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:07,400
He meant, oh, wait, oh, that's right.

2400
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:08,440
Oh, yes. He's a rat.

2401
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:11,160
I forgot. I forgot that story.

2402
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:17,920
The voice of Zerg and Space Ranger spin in Florida is Frank Welker.

2403
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,640
Oh, yes. The greatest.

2404
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:23,880
Oh, and the voice in Astro Blasters is director Andrew Stamp.

2405
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:30,440
So the guy who yelled action on every day on John Carter.

2406
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:33,320
That's right. Was also that same voice.

2407
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:35,320
Which is on Disney Plus.

2408
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:37,720
Oh, I don't know. I think it is.

2409
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:39,720
But Buzz Lightyear Star Command. No, no.

2410
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:41,880
They should. They should.

2411
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:42,600
Just do it.

2412
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:48,680
I think it's been enough time we can reboot John Carter.

2413
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:49,400
I think it's time.

2414
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:51,400
They're going to keep trying everything.

2415
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:52,280
You would think. Yeah.

2416
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:55,480
Like soon. Taylor, another shot.

2417
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:56,360
It might be cheap.

2418
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:58,840
I mean, Netflix had a bunch of Roald Dahl stuff.

2419
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:01,240
They bought like a huge Roald Dahl licensing.

2420
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:02,120
And I. Oh, yeah.

2421
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:06,760
And their current troubles, I believe, has all been paused or canceled.

2422
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:09,000
Those bright two has been effectively canceled.

2423
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,280
Like everything is crazy.

2424
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:13,480
How are we even getting through this record knowing there's no break to.

2425
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:18,040
Star Wars changed my life.

2426
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:22,200
John Carter is on Disney Plus.

2427
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:22,840
Wow.

2428
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:23,240
Wow.

2429
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:25,400
And Gods of Egypt is on 2B

2430
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:33,080
because I got recommended it in my weekly 2B update email, one of my favorite marketing emails to get.

2431
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:34,920
Jason's picks of the week.

2432
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:38,200
Gods of Egypt and Gunn Guys.

2433
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:38,920
What was the movie?

2434
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:40,120
Oh, Gunn Crazy.

2435
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:40,920
Gunn Crazy.

2436
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:43,320
I actually have not seen all of Gods of Egypt.

2437
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:44,600
I did bookmark it to watch.

2438
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:46,840
Gunn Crazy is such a good name for a movie.

2439
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:49,800
Like that's I think that no, no, it's a perfect title.

2440
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:50,600
Yeah.

2441
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:51,320
That's your reboot.

2442
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:53,000
That's how Netflix turns it around.

2443
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:53,400
Yeah.

2444
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:53,720
Yeah.

2445
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:54,760
Gunn Crazy is back.

2446
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:55,800
I'm listening.

2447
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:59,000
It was in, I think restored like in the 2000.

2448
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,360
It was in one of those sets.

2449
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:02,520
Like the DVD sets were all the rage.

2450
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:02,840
Okay.

2451
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:05,240
It was like Warner Brothers crime, you know.

2452
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:05,880
What did they did?

2453
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:12,920
Like, I mean, is like the new release of it like lovingly like remastered like the Jaws Blu-ray?

2454
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:17,640
Like when I feel like when Jaws first came to Blu-ray, they were making such a big deal about it

2455
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:22,040
because like Steven Spielberg like got his hands in there and like remastered it.

2456
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:23,400
And it looked like a like,

2457
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:25,800
I mean, for my money, it looked like a brand new movie.

2458
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:29,640
I was like, this looks crazy that this like old movie looks this nice.

2459
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:29,960
Yeah.

2460
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:30,280
Yeah.

2461
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:32,520
Did they give the same treatment to Gunn Crazy?

2462
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:35,560
I mean, they have, it has gotten some restoration.

2463
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:37,160
So, but yeah, I love a poor cake.

2464
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:38,280
But then they get the Jaws treatment.

2465
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:39,080
Gunn Crazy.

2466
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:43,640
Gonna make everyone's eyes, we're gonna make them more bloodshot to make them look more Gunn Crazy.

2467
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:43,880
Yeah.

2468
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:45,560
Get some smoke coming out of their ears.

2469
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:46,440
Yeah.

2470
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:48,920
You gotta see it's just constant spirals.

2471
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:49,240
Yeah.

2472
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:50,040
We gotta make sure they really-

2473
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:52,680
The guy in the background going like this, cuckoo, cuckoo.

2474
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:53,320
Yeah.

2475
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:55,400
Are these guys Gunn Crazy or what?

2476
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:57,560
You never know with those Blu-ray.

2477
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:59,800
I mean, I think the Godfather ones are pretty well received,

2478
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:02,360
but I think there's some Kubrick Blu-rays where they're like,

2479
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:04,200
ooh, no, they made this worse.

2480
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:08,280
I just heard that on the Back to the Future 4K,

2481
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:13,880
you can see like bad makeup that you wouldn't have normally seen in a cut.

2482
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:14,520
Oh, yeah.

2483
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:15,080
It looks worse.

2484
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:15,640
Sure.

2485
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:16,120
Oh.

2486
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:19,160
There's a shot somewhere in one of them where a DeLorean flies away

2487
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:21,400
and you can see like a black box around it.

2488
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:25,720
Like, I don't know if they just weren't, the monitors were,

2489
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:27,880
or something was wrong with my monitor.

2490
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:28,440
I'm not sure.

2491
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:29,800
But watch out for that black box.

2492
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:33,000
Star Trek, yeah, when they up-res'd all those Star Trek shows,

2493
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,840
it's like all the alien makeup.

2494
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:35,000
Yeah.

2495
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:35,960
Maybe didn't hold up.

2496
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:37,640
This wasn't supposed to be nice.

2497
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:38,920
Yeah, this was on TV.

2498
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:41,400
Although the Star Trek motion picture, they just did the same thing

2499
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:43,800
where they have a new version that looks amazing.

2500
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:44,280
Wow.

2501
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:45,880
It's on HBO Max.

2502
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:49,240
And there's a lot of like, I get a lot of like Epcot vibes from this movie.

2503
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:52,200
Just a lot of like aesthetically pleasing.

2504
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:55,960
Yeah, like aesthetically like smooth surf space surfaces.

2505
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:58,680
And it's still a pretty boring movie.

2506
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:01,160
But that's why it's still like early Epcot.

2507
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:02,520
Yes, exactly.

2508
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:03,960
I have no memories of Epcot.

2509
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:06,200
And I know that I've been there, but I just have like,

2510
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:09,080
gun in my head, I couldn't tell you a single thing that I did when I was there.

2511
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:09,480
Wow.

2512
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:10,040
Wow.

2513
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:12,280
You didn't try sodas from around the world?

2514
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:17,160
That sounds like something I would have been interested in because I loved soda.

2515
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:20,360
But I couldn't tell you if I actually did it or not.

2516
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:24,120
Do you remember rows and rows of Genesis game demos?

2517
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:27,560
That feels like the eight, that's what you would have remembered.

2518
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:28,520
Maybe, but I can't.

2519
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:30,200
That's not ringing a bell either.

2520
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:33,560
I know I spent a whole day there too and I couldn't tell you a damn thing.

2521
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:34,680
Huh, what year?

2522
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:38,920
This was probably, let's see, 9-11 had happened.

2523
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:42,200
So it was certainly 2002.

2524
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:44,760
Oh, they might have packed up the video games.

2525
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:45,960
The video games might have been gone.

2526
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:46,760
Yeah, yeah.

2527
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:48,040
But the soda was there.

2528
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:48,760
Okay.

2529
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:52,040
Well, now I'm upset that I missed it.

2530
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:53,960
Maybe I missed out on the soda, but maybe I didn't.

2531
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:55,160
I don't know.

2532
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:55,560
I don't know.

2533
01:39:56,120 --> 01:40:01,000
Go see, go ride the mighty Akron in Pandora and go try their sodas.

2534
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Okay, so I haven't missed my shot completely with the sodas.

2535
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,520
No, you can still get the sodas.

2536
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:05,320
The sodas.

2537
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:07,240
Pandora is at Epcot?

2538
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:08,280
No, it's Animal Kingdom.

2539
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:13,400
You gotta buy a ticket for Pandora and you gotta buy a ticket for the sodas.

2540
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:14,040
Okay, okay.

2541
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:15,320
You know what?

2542
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:16,600
I mean, I'll do it is the thing.

2543
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,440
I am interested in seeing both.

2544
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:21,080
I can't think of anything else to recommend but the soda.

2545
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:22,680
Just do the sodas and then go.

2546
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:26,840
But I guess they aren't free at that point because you're paying that ticket price.

2547
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:28,680
But at a certain point, they're paying for themselves.

2548
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:34,120
If you can make it, if you refill 90 times or so, then you refund that ticket.

2549
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:39,080
I think about cutting the cost out from like traveling to a different country to get this soda.

2550
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:41,320
You know, then I'm saying you're making money.

2551
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:42,680
You're making money in a lot of ways.

2552
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:43,560
Those fucking rubes.

2553
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:44,360
Hopefully they hear this.

2554
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:44,680
Yeah.

2555
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:48,440
We should figure out, we should do an episode on like, here's how you can actually make money.

2556
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:56,280
That's a good, well, you should just go start scheming on that and bring us your findings.

2557
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:58,600
Yeah, I'll take a look at the stretchy.

2558
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:00,200
Get your chalkboard out and your headlines.

2559
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:03,240
The toppings bar have returned and your lunch is now free.

2560
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:07,160
That is a good, you really should.

2561
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:13,400
But for now, final thoughts on Astro Blasters or whatever we're calling it.

2562
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:17,560
Is there anything, talking about some secrets and stuff, is there any way you're going to approach

2563
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:19,880
this differently when you go back?

2564
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:23,960
Anything you're going to stop and appreciate more or try harder on?

2565
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:32,200
I'm definitely going to freaking like whip my little cart around to go right after Zerg

2566
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:33,240
to get that triangle.

2567
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:34,920
I'm not missing that ever again.

2568
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:36,360
You won't ever catch me missing that.

2569
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,080
But as far, I mean, I don't know.

2570
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:41,960
I just like to get in there.

2571
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:46,040
It's like a sort of nostalgic ride because I mean, I remember when it was new.

2572
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:50,840
And it's old now, I guess, right?

2573
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:51,560
When did it open?

2574
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:53,400
It opened in 2005.

2575
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:56,040
So for the 50th for the Disneyland.

2576
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:56,520
Okay.

2577
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:58,200
Yeah, Disney World was earlier.

2578
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:00,840
Yeah, Disney World was 1998.

2579
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:02,920
Tokyo was 2004.

2580
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:05,000
So I think they just cloned the Tokyo.

2581
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,440
They probably were working on those both at the same time.

2582
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:09,640
I'd hate to see it go.

2583
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:13,960
I don't want it to ever leave Tomorrowland.

2584
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:16,280
Maybe we've talked about this before.

2585
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:18,120
I don't know if we talked about this last time.

2586
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:23,320
We talked about Knott's Berry Farm, but I feel like Tomorrowland as a land is struggling.

2587
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:27,080
Well, look, it's usually what we're talking about.

2588
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:27,560
Yeah.

2589
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:30,680
If you woke us up in the middle of the night, it's what we'd start talking about.

2590
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:35,320
Because I mean, this is not a new observation, of course, but the promise of Tomorrowland

2591
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:36,920
is that it's showing you tomorrow.

2592
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:41,800
But now everything in there is kind of old and we've sort of passed some of that.

2593
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:43,640
So I don't know what to do.

2594
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:47,480
I don't know what to do with the land, but whatever you do, leave Buzz where he is.

2595
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:49,800
Maybe update it with the new hunky Buzz.

2596
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:57,000
They're kind of stuck because the land itself, we've been saying for over a decade now,

2597
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,680
the land itself needs some work.

2598
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:05,400
But very popular rides in Space Mountain, Star Tours, Buzz Lightyear, very popular rides.

2599
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:11,080
And I just don't know if there's like, I mean, this is me not being plugged into modern art

2600
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:13,800
or design in any sort of way.

2601
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:21,240
But I don't know if there's a futurism movement like there was when they came up with Tomorrowland.

2602
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:26,040
I don't know if people are right now looking at what 22 is looking like or something.

2603
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:26,680
You know?

2604
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:27,480
Yeah.

2605
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:28,120
That's some of the...

2606
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:33,160
Yeah, because there was so much futurism in the 50s and every time they did a new pass.

2607
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:34,680
I'm thinking go back.

2608
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:40,760
Go retrofuturism with it or something and make it like 1950, like what the Jetsons looked like

2609
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:43,640
or something and make it old looking but new.

2610
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:44,040
Yeah.

2611
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:47,720
When they found solutions, the solutions have been akin to that.

2612
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:48,120
Yeah.

2613
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:51,000
And then the Tron ride, do you know about the Tron ride?

2614
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,040
Yes, I want to get on that.

2615
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:52,600
It's coming to Disney World.

2616
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:53,480
Where's that one?

2617
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:54,920
Well, it'll be in Disney World soon.

2618
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:55,240
Okay.

2619
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:56,760
So another reason to head down.

2620
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:57,560
That seems like...

2621
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:03,320
I'll honestly plan a trip around that because when I saw that ride in the Imagineering thing,

2622
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:05,320
I was like, that looks great.

2623
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:07,960
And that feels like future.

2624
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:14,120
That actually, it's 80s infused but not fully retrofutur.

2625
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:15,560
Who's got Ratatouille the ride?

2626
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:16,200
Evcon.

2627
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:17,000
Evcon.

2628
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:17,720
Is it now too?

2629
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:18,280
Okay, okay.

2630
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:19,720
Man, I'm going to Florida, baby.

2631
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:20,200
You gotta...

2632
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:22,440
Yeah, let's open up.

2633
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:23,320
It's quite a queue.

2634
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:24,760
I gotta get this Ratatouille ride.

2635
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:27,480
Yeah, there's a Guardians coaster opening up, got no...

2636
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:31,880
Oh, but Hong Kong gets the Ant-Man and the Wasp?

2637
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:33,160
Hong Kong is what has...

2638
01:44:33,160 --> 01:44:33,720
Yeah, they took...

2639
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:35,720
They're the only place that's taken Buzz out.

2640
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:37,800
It looks kind of like...

2641
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:39,560
Fine.

2642
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:39,800
Right?

2643
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:40,120
Yeah.

2644
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:41,960
It's kind of a lateral move.

2645
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:42,760
Yeah, pretty much.

2646
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:43,080
Yeah.

2647
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:43,320
Sure.

2648
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:46,120
You have to keep her as the Wasp then they can't...

2649
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:48,520
Oh, with Angelina Lilly.

2650
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:48,760
Yeah.

2651
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:49,320
Yeah.

2652
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:56,200
I have heard as they expand it more and more in the Asia parks and the movies got more and

2653
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:57,240
more popular there.

2654
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:07,560
Some stuff that they have chosen, it's like Iron Man, Darth Vader is very popular.

2655
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:12,040
Iron Man, Ant-Man, Wasp, they all have helmets on so anyone could be behind it.

2656
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:12,360
Oh, yeah.

2657
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:13,080
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2658
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:16,120
So that's good then?

2659
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:19,800
Well, that's I think why they settled on those characters.

2660
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:20,680
That makes sense.

2661
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:24,600
For those parks, I'm sure a lot of sound-alikes.

2662
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:25,000
I don't know.

2663
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:25,800
Is it Downy?

2664
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:27,320
Is it Downy in the Iron Man thing?

2665
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:28,760
No, that has never been Downy.

2666
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:30,520
He's the only one who escaped the contracts.

2667
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:31,240
Yeah, exactly.

2668
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:31,880
Paul Rudd...

2669
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:32,920
And the franchise in general.

2670
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:34,040
Yeah, for now.

2671
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:37,000
Paul Rudd is in the ride though.

2672
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,240
Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly, they did all the voices for him.

2673
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:40,920
I believe that because they were there I think.

2674
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:42,920
They made him go.

2675
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:43,960
Yeah, they were at the opening.

2676
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:45,320
She can't go back.

2677
01:45:46,360 --> 01:45:47,320
She got to get that shot.

2678
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:47,960
She got to get that...

2679
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:48,440
Yeah.

2680
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:49,960
She couldn't come back either, is the thing.

2681
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:50,440
She's kind of a...

2682
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:52,760
She's like a terminal situation.

2683
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:53,240
Yeah, yeah.

2684
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:54,520
She's a real Victor Navorski.

2685
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:55,080
In between.

2686
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:59,080
She's just there in the terminal clapping because she heard.

2687
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:02,200
If she could go on the plate, she wouldn't have to wear the mask.

2688
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:07,400
Well, excellent.

2689
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:09,160
Matt, thank you for joining us.

2690
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:09,560
We're going to...

2691
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:13,560
I'll give you the high score of Galactic Hero.

2692
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:14,360
Thank God.

2693
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:18,200
You ranked Galactic Hero and you survived Podcast The Ride.

2694
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:19,320
Thank you, thank you.

2695
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:21,480
Thanks so much for being here, IRL.

2696
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:23,080
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2697
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:24,440
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2698
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:26,440
Yeah, check out Get Played.

2699
01:46:27,560 --> 01:46:29,880
Show that I'm on with Nick Weiger and Heather Ann Campbell,

2700
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:31,000
where we talk about video games.

2701
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:33,800
Is this coming out in May?

2702
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:35,960
No, I think it's out this week.

2703
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:36,440
Okay.

2704
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:37,080
I believe so.

2705
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:42,440
Then for all of May, just coming up, we're calling it PokéMay,

2706
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:44,360
and it's going to be Pokémon stuff all month long.

2707
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:44,920
Oh, jeez.

2708
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:45,720
Look forward to that.

2709
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:46,360
Oh, great.

2710
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:47,240
Oh, that's a great month.

2711
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:50,680
Wait, you know what we didn't talk about is there was a video game you could play,

2712
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:54,040
and still can if you download an EXE file.

2713
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:00,680
On, because the old pictures you used to get said Disneyland.com slash Buzz.

2714
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:01,240
Yes.

2715
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:04,280
So if you go to the archives, Disneyland.

2716
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:08,600
You won't do it now, but if you go to Webarchive.org,

2717
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:14,200
download the old, you can play a weird janky Buzz Lightyear, Aster Blaster game.

2718
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:18,280
I'm remembering trying to do that and just being like, come on.

2719
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:21,320
I'm alive, would I have a life to live?

2720
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:24,280
They said there was a very limited window of time where they're like,

2721
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:27,720
and it's going to affect the ride in the park.

2722
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:29,160
And it's like, how long did that land?

2723
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:29,400
Yeah.

2724
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:30,280
If ever.

2725
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:31,080
And like in how?

2726
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:36,200
How would anyone know if you were on one side of the other?

2727
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:37,080
Someone at home.

2728
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:40,760
The thing moved slightly.

2729
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:43,400
That comet rotated five degrees to the left.

2730
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:44,440
We've been compromised.

2731
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:48,280
Two other oddball video game things.

2732
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:51,480
The game shows up in Kingdom Hearts 3.

2733
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:54,360
The Buzz Lightyear ride shows up in Kingdom Hearts 3.

2734
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:58,840
And then in Disney Quest, if you recall, there was a bumper car

2735
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:02,680
cannon kind of attraction that was also called Buzz Lightyear Aster Blasters.

2736
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:04,600
But even slightly different.

2737
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:05,320
It was singular.

2738
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:10,280
Buzz Lightyear's Aster Blaster.

2739
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,640
Possessive and singular.

2740
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:14,280
What?

2741
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:15,080
Why?

2742
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:17,640
If you're in a tank, it's Aster Blaster.

2743
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:19,640
But there's multiple people, right?

2744
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:20,120
Yes.

2745
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:21,640
Why aren't they all Aster Blasters?

2746
01:48:21,640 --> 01:48:21,960
No.

2747
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:23,480
This one's referring to the gun.

2748
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:24,680
The gun is the blaster.

2749
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:26,040
And that's the reason for the title.

2750
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:31,560
Maybe entertainment was better when everything did not have a Bible.

2751
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:35,480
Like everything did not have a series Bible or a canon Bible.

2752
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:37,800
Hey, look, I love the sloppiness.

2753
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:41,000
That's what gave us the Star Wars Holiday Special.

2754
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:43,400
More sloppiness, I say.

2755
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:46,840

2762
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:03,400
That'd be a hell of an incentive.

2763
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:06,440
When we do it, it'll be you'll influence the show if you play.

You won't know how, but you will.

2765
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:09,880
Butterfly effect.

2766
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:11,800
We all cough.

2767
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:12,920
You made us cough.

2768
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:15,240
And we will pilfer your NFT wallet.

2769
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:17,560
Just go on like that.
