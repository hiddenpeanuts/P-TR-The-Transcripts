1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Club Three.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:29,840
Welcome to Podcast The Ride Club Three, the world's first youngest,

3
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,120
is the enemy of progress and innovation.

4
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,260
So let's, we're here to keep it pumped up.

5
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,800
We're here to keep you inter-gaged today.

6
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,340
Yeah, you're gonna be so inter-gaged by this episode.

7
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,280
Mike Carlson is ready to inter-gage you.

8
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,740
Yeah, the only thing we need to get the audience hyped up about us is a high energy video from

9
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:26,400
someone like a Jim Davis who can really just fire people's loins up.

10
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,400
They fire people to get excited about something.

11
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,960
The magnetism of that man.

12
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,580
Which I think, I don't know, yeah, we'll get there, but I don't know that I ever really

13
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,320
heard an interview with him before and I love it now.

14
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,040
I know what you mean, yeah, I could not, I know the visual of him.

15
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,840
I mean, I'm not surprised by the way he sounds compared to how he looks.

16
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,100
It seems right, but there is something about just hearing it for a while, especially discovering

17
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,380
it because of a man who seems to think he's like God.

18
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,380
Yes.

19
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,380
Yeah.

20
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:08,140
Yeah, who's working with, was working with Jim Davis very closely according to this video

21
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,660
by Jim Davis.

22
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,340
And imagine having to give that up.

23
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,260
I mean, that's the drama.

24
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,060
If you don't know exactly what we're talking about, somebody being stripped of their right

25
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,020
to spend time with Jim Davis, the creator of Garfield.

26
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,020
We'll get into it.

27
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:28,140
We started a business before we get there, Club 3 business.

28
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:34,220
Today's topic won by the biggest margin we've seen, probably propelled along by us cheating,

29
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,260
increasing the weight.

30
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,180
Pretty heavily endorsed, which is our want to do.

31
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,940
There's no rules here.

32
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,180
We can endorse things and that might backfire.

33
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:49,560
People actually might pick something that we don't want to do one day, including, which

34
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,560
sort of happened in the like in the lead up and we were like gathering the nominees,

35
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,800
the most support went to something that we did not put in the poll.

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:06,440
And that is the idea that Evan Susser would come on and tell the full story that we censored

37
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,540
about his experience at Sesame Place.

38
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:15,440
Something happened in a bathroom and we elected to instead play us the song moves like Bert.

39
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,920
I remember that.

40
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,280
Maroon 5 parody.

41
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,600
I just wanted to address that really quick and just say we talked about it, right?

42
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,760
We did not bring it up to Evan Susser, who's a busy man.

43
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,040
And I just want to say before we bring this to put before we even put this on his desk,

44
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,860
I think we need more of a plan here because we talked about it.

45
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,040
We all know the story.

46
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,960
Everyone in this room knows the story.

47
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,800
And what we can tell you, the audience who doesn't know it, it's not going to make you

48
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
happy.

49
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,440
No, it's unpleasant.

50
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,800
And I, but I'm also worried I miss remembering some stuff because you said we remember Jason

51
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,440
does not remember the story.

52
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,080
I may be making it worse in my head.

53
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,120
So you might be because I don't think it's as bad as you do.

54
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,120
Maybe I miss under next story.

55
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
Interpreting something.

56
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
Okay.

57
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,040
I'm going to tell you both the story and I'm going to play moves like Bert over it.

58
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,680
No, no, I'll do it.

59
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,680
I want to remind you.

60
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,120
I want to see if we're on the same page about it.

61
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
All right.

62
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
Okay.

63
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
Listeners, get ready for the song.

64
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
Okay.

65
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
Back.

66
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
I hope I have the file still.

67
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,720
So just do like a big throat clear and then go into it.

68
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,600
Just really set up.

69
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:39,080
So Evan was in the bathroom at Sesame Place and there was an employee in there from Sesame

70
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,240
Place and he.

71
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,320
And there was something.

72
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,880
Yeah.

73
00:04:48,880 --> 00:05:00,160
And the person was like plush because of.

74
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
Okay.

75
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,160
Yeah.

76
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,720
I remembered it exactly.

77
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,440
So does that change your.

78
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,160
I'm still a little queasy about it.

79
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
No, it's not a good story.

80
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,160
It's not a fun story.

81
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
I don't.

82
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,240
You're getting our live reaction to hearing it again.

83
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,040
And if you the listener want this, I'm just, I think what I'm saying is I think we need

84
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,000
pitches on what else.

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,840
Susser, a great guest, a guy we'd love to have around.

86
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,520
I think we need something more on the table for him to do if we are going to bring them

87
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
around.

88
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,440
I think he, I think he would not be against telling the full tale, but you know, but then

89
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,600
we don't want that to be a four minute episode.

90
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,360
It's a huge bummer.

91
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
And then it's over.

92
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,760
And then we have to wait for the next club three.

93
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,060
It'll be funny if everyone paid the extra tier for a four minute episode.

94
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,060
That would be funny.

95
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,060
Yeah.

96
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,760
I, yes, I agree.

97
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,760
I like that part.

98
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,760
If I wasn't so sure that this would be, yeah, I'm happy after they would turn the thing

99
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,760
off.

100
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,520
So look, it's not out of the running.

101
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,080
I'm just saying, I think we need more information, more pitches.

102
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,280
We're just sending that back to the drawing board, but feel free to come back with any

103
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,960
ideas you have.

104
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,160
Now what is moving on to the next round, the runner up is the idea that we would watch

105
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,280
the entire Bob Iger masterclass.

106
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,280
Which is a good.

107
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,200
Now that is, is that eight to 12 hours of content?

108
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Or maybe I'm not sure.

109
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,560
I don't know the standard of, of masterclass.

110
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,960
I'm just surprised that's the first masterclass that there anyone's proposing that we do and

111
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,800
not a Mr. Spacey.

112
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,560
Do we have copies of that?

113
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,800
So yeah, yeah, yeah.

114
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Somebody I feel like pirated it at the time.

115
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,000
It needed to make sure this wasn't scrubbed.

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,560
So Iger, that sounds like a black.

117
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,640
I, I, I, that sounds like funny to me.

118
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,200
I don't want to overly endorse it, but I just, I want to say I like the idea.

119
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,640
However, it may have to wait.

120
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:02,120
I haven't talked to you guys about this, but remember next month is October.

121
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,120
It is when we transform from podcast, the ride into haunt cast the fright.

122
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,920
And I thought maybe we should try to take this into club three, do the first themed

123
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:18,040
club three, uh, and just say that if you have suggestions for spooky stuff and maybe we

124
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,760
don't get enough of those and we do, uh, we do throw Iger masterclass in there or it's

125
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:28,080
a mix, but I feel like we could harvest enough, uh, scary ideas between, uh, weird, scary

126
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,960
rides or kind of like haunted house stuff that we might not know about or obscure haunted

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,440
haunts or even like, you know, a lot about our fears at this point.

128
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,640
If there's something we've discussed being afraid of that you want us to, uh, you know,

129
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,080
go to the brink about, uh, that seems like something fun, potentially, uh, many other

130
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,280
suggestions from you guys.

131
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,520
Oh, what, what might, uh, what, what haunt cast the fright on club three might end up

132
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,480
being, I know there's been, uh, some whimsical, is there a Paul Lind Halloween special?

133
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,680
Michael, I'm looking at you.

134
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,400
That's smart.

135
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:58,880
Of course.

136
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,600
What do you mean?

137
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,960
No, you know, you know,

138
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,640
I'm pretty sure.

139
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,120
I think.

140
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,280
Yeah.

141
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,480
We watched some of it.

142
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:10,040
But in terms of like Halloween being a time for whimsy and costumes, there's also, is

143
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,680
it Paul Lind at, uh, the spring walk, uh, walk away cheese spring?

144
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,160
I never got Paul Lind.

145
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,080
That's not not that's done.

146
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,960
Not okay.

147
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,520
Paul is not done.

148
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,200
Not so Lind is not done.

149
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,800
Not so I could not remember which actor of that time period.

150
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,040
It was furious right now.

151
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,360
This is like, look, I'm bugging my love.

152
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,440
I'm upset.

153
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,160
So those are more whimsical options.

154
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,840
Paul Lind also has, there's a track called like Paul in castle Dracula.

155
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,360
And he does like a narration of like the Dracula story.

156
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,360
Like our Renfield Renfield.

157
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,640
We might, let me say this.

158
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,240
Maybe I'm wrong, but, and maybe with our, with the club three audience, we might not

159
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,480
have to do this, but just in terms of the year that it is on this earth, what can brief

160
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,160
context for Paul Lind, please?

161
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,640
Yeah, sure.

162
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,240
Well, he, he was an actor.

163
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,280
He's in bye bye birdie.

164
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,360
He was uncle Arthur on bewitched.

165
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,880
He was on Hollywood squares.

166
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,640
He was off in the center square, I believe.

167
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,920
And he's just one of those very specific character actors that I'm obsessed with.

168
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,240
Like an Al Lewis or anyone.

169
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,720
Yeah.

170
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:14,960
Yeah.

171
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:20,800
Oddball personality, almost as known for just being himself as being on shows.

172
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,720
This will help kind of a male Joanne Worley.

173
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:24,960
Yeah.

174
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,200
Yeah.

175
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,040
You really clarified it for a lot of folks.

176
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,280
Great.

177
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,720
So yeah.

178
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,600
So he has a Halloween special and kiss is on it.

179
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,520
Betty white is on it.

180
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,680
The woman, I can't think of her name who plays the wicked witch of the West in.

181
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,160
Oh yeah.

182
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,440
Margaret O'Brien.

183
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:39,760
Yeah.

184
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,160
Yeah.

185
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,560
And there's a long eight minute sketch that the thing starts with that is just Paul

186
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,800
and not knowing what holiday it is.

187
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,640
So he's like, dresses the Easter bunny.

188
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,320
That's a hipity hop Margaret.

189
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,800
Eight minutes.

190
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,360
So long.

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,920
And I bruised, Philanche, I think worked on that.

192
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,440
I think that was in his first gigs.

193
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,080
Oh boy.

194
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,480
I believe.

195
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:58,960
Of course.

196
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,920
Makes sense to me.

197
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,360
Yeah.

198
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,240
So anyway, Paul.

199
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,400
Well, that's a strong idea.

200
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,840
Somebody throw it in there.

201
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,240
You got to say it for us to put it in.

202
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,920
But anything in the Halloween realm and maybe we'll put, so just put a pin in

203
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,960
Eiger masterclass, which I do like and I want to do.

204
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,200
Sure.

205
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,880
So that business out of the way.

206
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,760
Now we move on to today's business.

207
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,440
What a business.

208
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,520
That literal business.

209
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,640
For the umpteenth time, let me read the full description from Shane Cannon, who suggested

210
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,040
it.

211
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,560
Please discuss the failed Canadian Garfield restaurant, Garfield eats the failed Canadian

212
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:43,120
Scooby Doo frozen food brand Scooby Doo eats and the founder of both of them archetypal

213
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,880
guy and noted hyper narcissist, Nathan Masri.

214
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,080
And that's what we're prepared to do.

215
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,720
This thing in general, I didn't know any of these words.

216
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,160
I somehow missed it, Jason.

217
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,600
It seems like you sort of knew the vague shape of this from the internet world of the

218
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,240
last few years.

219
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,760
I knew it a little because, um, you know, Garfield, we all grew up with Garfield, I'm

220
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,960
assuming comic strip collections, like the cartoon and we all grew up tolerating

221
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,600
Garfield.

222
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,480
Yeah, we all grew up knowing that Garfield existed and that we were supposed to like

223
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,760
it because we were children.

224
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,760
Did you not like Garfield though?

225
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,880
Because I loved Garfield.

226
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,320
Yes, I liked Garfield.

227
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,360
I just want to make that clear about my stance on Garfield anyway.

228
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,720
Um, yeah.

229
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,880
And I, I Garfield kind of has taken on another life on the internet, been memeified.

230
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,800
There's the, that Garfield with our without Garfield strip.

231
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,120
There's that lasagna cat web series.

232
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,800
The greatest, really great.

233
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:49,440
And, um, yeah, so I had heard about this a few years ago.

234
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,440
I didn't realize it was as complicated as it was.

235
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,960
I think I heard some Canadian comedians talking about it and I saw either a vice article

236
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:05,200
or, uh, uh, the, the journalist, Sarah, uh, I think it's Hagee or Hagee.

237
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,320
Um, I, she had covered it in a, in a, I think food and wine.

238
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,280
I just reread that and then the eater talked to her and like, there's a lot of after

239
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,680
action reports out there on the internet where you can kind of get some angles on this.

240
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,080
Yeah.

241
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,920
People covered the spread.

242
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,600
People definitely, this was like documented from all angles for sure.

243
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,880
Um, while it was open and we are not the first, uh, entity to cover this.

244
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,120
As you said, many, uh, many blogs and articles, even other podcast.

245
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,840
I believe my brother, my brother and me did it.

246
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,360
Ben and I haven't listened to any of these.

247
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,400
So I don't, we, if we're repeating material, uh, apologies, but I think we all tried to

248
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:53,120
find some new things about this, try to shine some light under the rock and find some new

249
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,840
odd bugs crawling around in this absolutely insane story and world.

250
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,720
Yes.

251
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,200
Yeah.

252
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,520
And we, uh, maybe the first time we were given a dossier.

253
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,000
Oh yeah, that's right.

254
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,560
Yes.

255
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:13,840
This is, I, I, I just generally want to say the like campaign that Shane Cannon mounted,

256
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,360
I was so impressed by that he like kept at it and I saw numbers tick up real time in the polling,

257
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
from him endorsing it.

258
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,760
Uh, and then yeah, that's not the first iteration of this, but like audience research,

259
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,360
voluntary audience research.

260
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,000
We got a spreadsheet from Jeff Cole.

261
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,280
Thank you, Jeff, who seemed to completely have new things to bring to the table and

262
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,520
donated them graciously to us, which we will get to throughout the episode.

263
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:41,920
Yeah.

264
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,760
And to everyone politicking and like, you know, getting, really thinking a lot about club

265
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,720
feet, please do not stress your out on, stress yourselves out on these selections.

266
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,160
Do not beat yourself up for voting for one or the other.

267
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,240
We're all just having a nice time.

268
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,720
I don't know.

269
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,680
I might go the other way.

270
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,520
I think let's put some work into it.

271
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,640
Oh, you want some suffering?

272
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:02,800
Yeah.

273
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,120
Yeah.

274
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,280
Yes.

275
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,440
Okay.

276
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,480
Let's make the people we're paying us the most.

277
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Greater suffering, greater the peace, you know, it was a takeaway from Mission Possible

278
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,600
Fallout.

279
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
I think that was what you're supposed to take away.

280
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,120
Consider club three your buy in to a, to work that you're doing for free.

281
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,800
Scott is the lane of a club or of podcasts.

282
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,360
The ride lane being the bad guy from Mission Impossible.

283
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:25,920
Fallout.

284
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,400
Of course.

285
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:26,720
Yes.

286
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,760
Lane lane.

287
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,640
We know lane.

288
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,360
He'll be back.

289
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,040
So, uh, all right here.

290
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,600
I recently, I forget where, but I saw the storytelling advice to maybe that sometimes

291
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,360
it's good to start in the middle and work your way both ways.

292
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,320
And that's my idea of how to, to corral this.

293
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,520
So what I would, I'd like to do here is to, uh, before we get into the character, the guy,

294
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:57,040
maybe set the scene of what, uh, you might've encountered if you were one of the great people

295
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,680
of Toronto, Canada in 2019.

296
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:08,880
Um, so in 2019, uh, a restaurant pops up, uh, out of nowhere and it is a restaurant themed

297
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,400
after famous comic cat Garfield.

298
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,960
This is out of the gate unusual because this sort of thing does not happen.

299
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,760
A freestanding, we, you know, we know these pop-up kinds of things that say by the bell

300
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,840
place or the, the star Wars bar or whatever, but often there's a shelf life on that.

301
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:31,200
But this is an official Garfield restaurant, seemingly unless they just stole it all.

302
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,680
But then you look into it and they did not steal it.

303
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,320
This was, this is related to pause ink.

304
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,160
The company that regulates all of the Garfield licensing.

305
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,400
And I want to point out, I think, cause like Nick, what is Nickelodeon owns Garfield now?

306
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,040
Viacom.

307
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,680
Viacom.

308
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah.

309
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,800
Yeah. Right. Right.

310
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:53,760
So, but Jim Davis historically will let Garfield be, do anything like license Garfield for almost

311
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,640
anything like Garfield without Garfield, which was a strip that took John out of the Garfield,

312
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,040
like which Photoshop him out or no, excuse me.

313
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,840
The rock field.

314
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,400
Yeah. Yeah.

315
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,480
Yeah. It's like John, baby, losing his mind.

316
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,240
Yeah. It just, it's a sad man losing his mind and Jim Davis was like, sure, print it, make

317
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,560
whatever. I don't care. Like he doesn't, he doesn't seem like he's that precious about

318
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,040
Garfield and pausing is what I'm saying.

319
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,680
I think if he can figure out a way for money to go back to him, I read that with Garfield

320
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,200
minus Garfield that he, he allowed it to exist, but then also started making his own versions

321
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:35,280
of that to co-opt their Garfield deconstructionist idea. So that was his way of getting money to

322
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,440
come back. But yeah, we all know the, you know, the phones and I feel like he, he's almost

323
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,480
Garfield almost more famous from shirts and stuff.

324
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,200
Yeah. I just bought a shirt for $5 from Coles at his Garfield. It's a tie dye Garfield shirt.

325
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,360
You bought a tie dye Garfield shirt.

326
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,640
I went to go get my bivalent booster and I went, Coles was next door and I had an Amazon return.

327
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,720
I returned, I got a $5 off coupon for something in Coles and I go, well, let me take a look around

328
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,120
clearance. And I found a tie dye Garfield shirt.

329
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,200
Did you have to leave the county? Where is the closest Coles?

330
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,200
The closest Coles is on Laurel Canyon and it's like 20 minutes away. It's not too far.

331
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,840
Yeah, they're around. I know. And like what, you know, not too far from LA because every

332
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,560
whole world is just cold. This country is cold.

333
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,440
This country is cold. There's like 2000 locations.

334
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:27,120
But I had only seen it in the town past Pasadena where the Sonic is.

335
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,840
Oh, right. Right.

336
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,240
It's a Coles.

337
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,200
Monorovia maybe?

338
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,160
I think, yeah, somewhere around there.

339
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,440
That's Coles country out there.

340
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,320
It's Coles country. All right.

341
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,760
You don't have to drive. We have got a little bubble around us where there are no, less Coles

342
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,560
and less chilis, but then it's only a 15 minute drive.

343
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,400
I was at Coles once a week as a child.

344
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,520
Wow.

345
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,960
Yeah, we had a Coles right down, right, like three minutes from the house.

346
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,040
Ours was Mervyn's. Mervyn's got sort of subsumed.

347
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,600
Yeah.

348
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,640
Anyway, so this is, it's a weird thing because when does a restaurant just open about a character

349
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:07,840
and in 2019, why exactly, why Garfield, why now? What does a Garfield restaurant mean?

350
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,640
And I assume if you have not, like, oh, maybe we should go check it out. What

351
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,600
sorts of things do they have? Well, they have lasagna naturally. Now, this part of it makes

352
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,880
sense. This might be, this might be where the sense stops in this tale, but a Garfield

353
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,800
restaurant that serves lasagna. Sure. Got it. Can't only be lasagna though. What else? Well,

354
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:34,880
pizza goes with lasagna. Great. How does the pizza stand out? Well, the pizza

355
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,720
is in the shape of Garfield's head.

356
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,240
Kind of.

357
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,560
In theory. That's what they're depending on. The skill of the person rolling the dough or

358
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:51,760
what the oven does to it. Yeah. So, hey, that's interesting. Garfield, the iconic shape of

359
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,840
Garfield, I guess. Look, it's no Mickey Mouse. There's no features as prominent. And if anything,

360
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,880
it's probably like a circle and then you kind of cut into it and you get less pizza, probably.

361
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,960
Yeah. It's less of an oval.

362
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:05,920
Yeah.

363
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:12,240
It's an altered oval. You might be losing pizza, all told. There also seems to be,

364
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Garfield's Orange, we know this. So we're just going to do regular old red pizza sauce.

365
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:26,080
I don't think so. We're going orange. Now there's sauces that are orange out there. That's not so

366
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:35,600
crazy, but this place pioneered their own orange sauce that reviewers seem not particularly fond of.

367
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:43,520
Yeah. I mean, if I was going to try and make that myself, I think I know the basics of cooking.

368
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,680
I would get a bunch of orange heirloom tomatoes. Sure. You know? Okay. I don't know.

369
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:57,280
I don't know how sustainable that is for like a restaurant to do. Nothing. But well,

370
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,320
what it probably does is drive up the cost because they, and they also made all these

371
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:09,120
decisions, which are good about GMOs and farm fresh and all that. But then also they claim all

372
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,600
this, but then everybody hates the way the food tastes. And it ends up extremely expensive is what

373
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,600
I'm getting at. The prices seem outrageous at this place. Yeah. That food and wine article,

374
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,480
it's like, oh, and don't forget to use your 50% off coupon. And the 50% off coupon brought it down

375
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:34,480
from $50 to $25. And it's like this barely fed three people and none of us really enjoyed it.

376
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:41,520
For cardboardy pizza, for pizza that was not enjoyed. And by the way, not coupon,

377
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,240
goopon. But we'll get to that. Oh, all right.

378
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,480
Okay. So lasagna pizza with an orange, it makes sense. And then, you know,

379
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:59,520
Garficchino's, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop the car. Garficchino's. I like the word. I approve of word.

380
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,680
But why are the, why are the primaries of this place Italian food, hot Italian food

381
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,400
and, and then coffee on these things don't particularly go together. No. Especially what

382
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:23,200
they portray as a Garficchino is like massive. That's a venti drink of pure hot. And that has,

383
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:30,240
I think a strong dark chocolate component. So you're sucking down dark chocolate coffee

384
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:37,280
and a lot of it. And then switching over to lasagna. But you can get it orange flavored.

385
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,160
Oh, is that right? The coffee. Yes. Orange? Like the fruit? The orange? Yeah. I know for like

386
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:50,560
really nice coffee. If you like do a twist of lemon or orange, there's something where like the

387
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:58,960
acid, you can do this. I'm talking about a cup of espresso that someone is expertly prepared

388
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:05,360
with a fresh brine and stuff. I ain't talking about whatever pump they're pumping into just this coffee.

389
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:12,080
Yeah. Yeah. I think, I think subtlety is probably at the window. The beverages go further though.

390
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:19,040
Oh, well you do tell. Cause your options are Garficchino, smoothies, orange juice.

391
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:26,640
That is it. No, no, no, no. Oh, carrot juice. Oh really? Yeah. Yeah. Everything orange. Cause

392
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:34,960
stroke. Cause I, there was a YouTuber, a strange Aeon. They have a lot of videos and they tried the

393
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,120
carrot juice and they said there's a lot of like texture to it. It's not completely liquid. Oh no.

394
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,840
But a thing that's missing that I associate with like eating pizza, no soda. They do not sell soda

395
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:55,120
pump. Yeah, that's right. There's no soda. They, they similarly with sort of why not this and why

396
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:03,200
that they do have fries, but no ketchup. And the answer is just well, because chemicals. Right.

397
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,840
And then I saw a discussion of like, well, you, there are ketchups that exist that are lacking in

398
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:14,080
chemicals. And the guy doesn't want to hear it. We'll get to the guy. So, you know, yeah, no sodas

399
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,840
to wash down your pizza. You're grabbing go pizza with no ketchup for your fries, but it's keeping

400
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,640
you safe and it's pushing you towards healthier items. Like the smoothies, the aforementioned

401
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:31,360
smoothies, Jeff Cole listener. He, when he went, while this was open, he ordered a mango smoothie,

402
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,440
texted his friends. The best way I could describe this is like banana water.

403
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah. He was not having a good time. Is this smoothie experience?

404
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:47,040
So all strange what's going on. You, you maybe hear about this place word of mouth. There's this

405
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:52,960
weird Garfield restaurant in 2019. Why here's the food that they serve. I would like more

406
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,760
information. Maybe at that point you go to the website for Garfield eats and you are hit with a

407
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:06,160
barrage of jargon. Here is some of the jargon. I don't, I mean, again, take your pay because

408
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,320
there's mountains of jargon that were, I think they made more jargon than food, but here's one.

409
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:17,600
Here's a stretch that I found Garfield's dreams come true. Garfield eats is the world's first quick

410
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:25,200
enter gauging restaurant app, both engaging and entertaining. Let's break down enter gauging

411
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,560
for a second. Um, I mean, imagine something being both entertaining and engaging. Never been done.

412
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:37,760
Never. Yeah. Never. These do not go in the original. It's technically the same spirit as

413
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,960
imagineering, putting the words together. Sure. But those are kind of different worlds that they're

414
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:51,600
pulling from, not essentially overlapping ideas. I think when I crossed enter gauging, when I crossed

415
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:59,440
that Rubicon, I was like, I'm starting to get annoyed. I was like this, I discovered something

416
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,280
later on. I discovered a line of thinking about this guy that I hadn't considered and I was like,

417
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,240
okay, it makes sense again. Cause before that I was saying, I was thinking about all the people

418
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:16,000
making videos, writing articles covering this and I was like, is this bait? Is this bait? Does he know

419
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:25,920
what he's doing? And then I, I, people pointed out like, consider these people that do not have

420
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:31,760
self awareness. And I was like, okay, now I understand it again. Yeah. Now I understand.

421
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:37,200
This is very like the cult movie. There, there's some overlap with Tommy Wiseau in the room.

422
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,040
And that helps thinking along those lines. Because you had to ask that question about

423
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,320
there. You have to like, wait a minute, this is so like perfectly hilarious to a sitcom degree,

424
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,160
so consistently funny. Maybe we're all being played here and he does seem a little self-aware

425
00:25:52,160 --> 00:26:01,280
now and playing up the character of himself. Nathan, I don't know. You have to poke around

426
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:08,960
a little bit and discover like, you have to be so calculated and smart to be that off of humanity

427
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,240
at every turn. Yeah. There's another, I was watching a couple of YouTube videos and they

428
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,640
were asking that question. I think the one I was watching was like, is Izzy? Yeah. They had a

429
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,520
pretty good. Yeah. She was asking the question too. And I think she spoke with somebody who knows

430
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,200
he's spoken with this man and was like, is this a bit? And they're like, I don't think so. I'm

431
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,040
not sure. I don't think so though. It's at least the smell test you got to do. And I, and I don't

432
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:39,760
think so. Let me, before we give him the hero's welcome, just a couple more things. App users can

433
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:46,240
play, watch and order at the same time and collect pause a loyalty coin system to unlock

434
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:52,480
coupon offers, game levels, episodes, and more. So hang on, wait a bit. We have one thing also,

435
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,240
we've breezed past is the app nature of this. So it's the first, it's an app. It's not a restaurant.

436
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:03,600
No, no, it's a restaurant, but you need the app to do the restaurant. And the app is like a full

437
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,880
experience. You have to get immersed in and you want it. You're going to want to get on the app

438
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,560
and watch the videos, the video content. What's that? It's old Garfield and friends episodes,

439
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:22,320
cartoon from the late eighties, the kind of old cartoon. Right. That we w we all watched this,

440
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,720
I assume. Yeah. I kind of liked the friends. In fact, we've talked, we've talked about this

441
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,200
before. I didn't like the friends. I didn't like the barnyard section. You didn't like the egg with

442
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:39,280
legs. I like the egg with like now there's one episode where the egg is going to hatch and it

443
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:44,800
hatches and it's just another egg. I mean, that's good. I understand as a kid, I didn't like the

444
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,960
barnyard friends and I liked Garfield and I've said the reverse. I liked, didn't like the Heathcliff

445
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,600
parts as much as I like the Cadillac cats. Okay. Cause they both had like two different sets of

446
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:59,120
characters that you would get with orange cats did another, they were like, there's not enough

447
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,720
here. Yeah. You've got to flush this out with something else. Right. I've talked about how

448
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:08,080
Hector was one of my idols as a kid from the Cadillac cats. That's one of my, the coolest guy

449
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:14,800
I'd ever seen was Hector up until I was like 11. Not your hero past. Steven Tyler took over. Yeah.

450
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,760
After 11 it was Steven Tyler, but up until then it was Hector from the Cadillac cats. Steven Tyler

451
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,640
and Billy Joe Armstrong came into the picture. No, that was years later. Okay. That was like

452
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:32,000
three years ago. Three years ago. So goop bonds. And if you haven't figured out goop bonds, that's

453
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:40,720
Garfield coupons, I guess. Yeah. There's no, what is the a good? Yeah. Garpons, Garpons, Garpons is

454
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:48,880
better. Goopons is much better. Goop coupons. Yeah. Like coupons covered in, covered in goo or that you

455
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:55,680
get this does goop. Does Gwyneth Peltrow's goop have coupons? Cause that would be, is that too,

456
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:01,680
that seems like too fun for them. It's like, cause it's kind of a serious, but she's got the vagina

457
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:06,160
candle. It's not completely serious, but isn't, doesn't, I feel like the vagina candle takes

458
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:10,720
itself a little seriously. Really? I don't know. I feel like she's a bit self, not completely. She's

459
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,920
not aware of that much, but a little bit. Maybe I'm wrong. What is the, what are the club three

460
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,720
listeners think? Is the vagina candle serious or maybe they began, like some of these things that

461
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,520
became self aware. Now they have a little fun with sure. They should have goop bonds. I like the word.

462
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:34,720
I like the spirit of this. Um, anyway, so okay. An app is essential, bizarre. Then you, you get to the

463
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:42,640
restaurant and okay, here we are Garfield eats. Why is the name Garfield eats so much smaller

464
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:52,400
than the, than the giant phrase in comic font love me, feed me. Don't leave me. Comic sans. Yeah.

465
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:59,920
Yeah. Let's talk about that phrase because it's from one of the movies. This is the, yeah, it is.

466
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:05,840
And then it isn't in a way. Cause he changed it. Cause in the movie he says, love me, feed me, never

467
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:13,040
leave me. And I think he's being cute when he says it, but apparently he says, Jim Davis said,

468
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:19,360
don't ever use never in marketing because it's a negative, I guess because it's negative. And so

469
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:26,080
he changed it to love me, feed me, don't leave me, which sounds, I don't know, desperate, sad,

470
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:32,480
let love me feed me. Don't leave me. Like I don't, it's weird. It's edgier for some reason. Yeah.

471
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,920
It feels more, more vulnerable and more of a more pleading. More goofy, like love me, feed me,

472
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:43,600
never leave me, you know, like. And also what is this jumble where like anything from the movies

473
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,200
is important? Yeah. I don't think the movies feels like those, those existed to entertain

474
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:58,080
then three year olds who hopefully immediately abandoned liking this. And they, they aren't

475
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,400
important. You know, like famously Bill Murray just like shat his way through it. Although like

476
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,840
rewrote it as he went, I think he's, yeah, he had to save it just cause he's a human with feelings

477
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,640
and opinions disowned it. But then also like said, he like worked hard improvising stuff. So who knows

478
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:20,560
what the true truth is without the director around the fake story. Also he tells too about the cone

479
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:26,000
brothers though that he thought it was one of the filmmakers going cone brothers, but then, yeah,

480
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,560
which I think is fake story. Yeah, it could be. Yeah. Although he knows he might be ease out of

481
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:35,200
it in a way. I guess, but like you can't even get to him and then they got to him, but he didn't,

482
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,760
like no one told him. I don't know. Wasn't that thing about how you could, you, it was so hard

483
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,280
to get a hold of him. Wasn't that cooler when he made better movies? It was like, wow, what a

484
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:50,320
Desperado out there on there. Yeah. I'll call back if it's the greatest movie ever made cut to

485
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:58,640
bunch of shit. It's also like he has a, he has a lawyer, you know, like Leno has a lawyer too. All

486
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,320
these guys who like are big, like, oh, you know, I don't have an agent manager or whatever. It's

487
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:08,320
like, they got a lawyer. Like you have a most savvy thing. Yeah. Like what, what you still have a

488
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,400
representative. You just made it hard for people to get in touch with you, which fine, but like,

489
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:17,120
it's not as cool. I don't know. It's not as cool as I may have thought it was 10 years ago. Yeah.

490
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:24,640
I bought into the mythology a little more. Um, so anyway, uh, bizarre sign, like, so was the name

491
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,560
of the restaurant, love me, feed me debt. Why is this phrase so prominent? It's just something

492
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,520
from the movie, but then that it like viewed as the gospel is like John three 16, but then

493
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,560
changed what's happening. And this is where you start to wonder, like, this is a little rinky.

494
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:43,360
This is not some, like, this isn't like if some traveling Hello Kitty thing opens up and it has

495
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,520
the Sanrio veneer, especially when you get into the restaurant, it's weird and cheap and falling

496
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:52,080
apart. Maybe we can't delay it any longer because something you might encounter when you get into

497
00:32:52,080 --> 00:33:00,960
the restaurant is a man in a perfectly tailored bright orange suit. He himself is orange.

498
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:11,520
Otherwise, like, like facially, there's a weird tan or cream job going on. He, uh, he has a Garfield

499
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:18,880
pocket square. He's a fancy Garfield man who seems to be like trying to be a human Garfield.

500
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:25,760
He's probably in the restaurant, uh, talking a lot about himself, getting very defensive about the

501
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,840
iPads and the app that are undoubtedly not working because also there's no cashiers in this

502
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:38,560
right. It's cashless, no cashiers, much simpler. You get rid of cashiers and all you have is the

503
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:44,560
owner himself, uh, telling you there isn't a problem with the apps. Yeah. Yeah. Much easier

504
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:50,880
than handing cash over to a human being. And this kind of predates the rise of ghost kitchens.

505
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,680
Yeah. Someone calls it a ghost. One article called it a ghost restaurant, which I had not heard

506
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:03,680
before, but does kind of accurately describe it because it's like not, it isn't one of these

507
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:09,360
where there then there isn't, there's at least a lobby. Right. Kind of like most dominoes or pizza

508
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:14,560
hut nowadays where there's just a counter. And then every now and then you find one where there's

509
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:20,320
like a single table with three chairs and you're like, who the fuck is he? What brought you to this

510
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,960
point? It's probably like the people who work at the pet shop next door want to get out for their

511
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,480
lunch break. So they eat like a sloppy pasta bowl at the dominoes table. The only excuse, yes, if

512
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,640
you, if you've walked more than a block to sit at the in restaurant pizza under dominoes table,

513
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:41,680
we're going to get into the guy. I think here we got to get into the guy. Yep. And this is,

514
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:48,320
I think a good way to get into the guy. I found out that he is on the app slash website blister.

515
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,320
Oh yeah. You toss this phrase out before we started recording new jargon to me. What's blister

516
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:02,480
is just cameo. It's a cameo for like LinkedIn people or like motivational barely even explains

517
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:09,520
what it is. It just got it. It basically just says like, uh, uh, learn from the best in business.

518
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:16,560
And then Nathan is under there. Oh yeah. The best and like Tory spellings on here and Chuck Liddell

519
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:24,080
from M from MMA world. Uh, so yeah, to learn from the best in the world. And Nathan is the first one

520
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:32,400
that they're talking about. Yeah. It's a photo of him and Garfield. Um, and my first time hearing

521
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,040
him was his video where he's pitching himself for why you should listen to him. So I'm going to play

522
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:46,480
that. I'm Nathan Masri and I'm an inter-gaging motivational speaker and it's time to blow your

523
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:53,440
brains and wake the F up because my talent is to elevate human consciousness.

524
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:02,720
Life is a self discovery. Also, he's doing this in front of a thing of a poster of Garfield playing

525
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:09,760
poker with dogs. That's come up. That's come. A lot of this stuff keeps coming back up.

526
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,000
And this is, this is the video is where you might go, Oh, is he goofing around? I can't tell. Cause

527
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
he's kind of putting it on. He's got a little bit of a smile and there's something contrived

528
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
about the suit and that he's in a, he's in a Garfield orange. So well, this one, he's wearing

529
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,840
a blue shirt with an A like a, some sort of a ribbon, but it might be a Garfield ribbon. I'm

530
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:31,680
not sure. Okay. Okay. Uh, is a self suppression

531
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,560
boom.

532
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:45,040
Adapting to something or someone for too long results in a magnetic attachment yielding to a

533
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:52,000
sense of loss. If we lose it, we must learn. Also in the back, there is some sort of like fake lion

534
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,600
king music track playing. It's like circle of life, but like it's a royalty free

535
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:05,600
power of detachment instead. So you don't, I take that back. It's can you feel a love?

536
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,320
It just is. Yeah. That's it. Sorry, sorry. Yeah.

537
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:21,040
Because we are born alone. So what's the answer? What's the answer? So what's the answer attached

538
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:27,040
with a lot of question to his face care and he's swinging around a gummy worm. Now I just want to

539
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:34,880
let you know about that. Okay. Or this worm, but don't create a habit of closeness suffocating me.

540
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:44,080
You will realize some of your toxic emotions were a result of some bad habit. Take it from me,

541
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:51,280
break it before it breaks you. Then he takes a big bite of the gummy worm in a comedic way.

542
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:58,880
And that's the end of the video. It's real like Kendall Roy from succession energy,

543
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:07,040
overly confident, but also kind of sad and very confusing and a really shitty beard.

544
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:15,440
Yeah. It's an odd to look at. It's odd to look at. He's really, I know he's a living wax figure.

545
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:21,200
He's really the way he is chosen to style himself. I think there's a way for him to have a beard.

546
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:28,400
And to have a little bit extra tan or pigmentation that doesn't have to look like this. I kind of,

547
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,440
I don't love when things kind of lazily say, Oh, this is like Tim and Eric, this is straight out

548
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:40,640
of Tim and Eric, but I swear I've seen stuff where Tim especially has a, like a beard that feels

549
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:48,480
painted on and he's on naturally orange. I mean, like it is extremely Tim for sure. It is aging

550
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:55,040
rockstar. It's an aging rockstar look. Even though he's not that old. Oh, this is a question.

551
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,840
Probably younger than us. Could be. I don't, well, you know what he is. The timeline,

552
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:05,040
the age timeline gets confusing too. Jeff Cole alerted us to this. There's some sloppiness with

553
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:11,120
the age. What we do know about him is that he is the world's youngest Garfield licensee. Yes. And

554
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:16,320
what we know about that phrase is that it is important. We grasp it. We have full context

555
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:24,400
to know why that is a big deal to be. Well, Garfield licensees famously, very old presidents.

556
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:31,360
It's only, you gotta be north of 70, but he got to it. He went straight for it. And at age, uh,

557
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:41,200
28 or 36 or 43, I don't know who knows, but he is, he is that. And he reminds you of that in any time

558
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:50,720
there is someone in front of him or a camera or anything. Uh, I, so here's our guy and this is a

559
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:58,800
guy, this is a guy Supreme. This is the definition of a guy. Oh yeah. Um, he is, he's so strange and

560
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:06,240
that, I mean, where do you even begin? Love me, feed me, don't leave me. Jason, when you said that

561
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,880
that phrase has like a sadness to it and a desperation to it, I think that the phrase

562
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:19,760
defines him so much and he seems to like find all this meaning in it and in Garfield

563
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:27,520
in general that I don't quite understand. Yeah, I don't, I don't either. Um, because it seemed like

564
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:35,600
he had a nice home, like it seemed like he had a supportive family life growing up, which I know

565
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:42,400
about from, uh, seeing some excerpts from his book and just just telling it, it seems like they

566
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,760
moved countries a lot and there might've been some culture shock or whatever. I'm just saying,

567
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:54,160
I don't know what's behind it. I know that that, the way he was speaking in that blizzard video

568
00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:02,560
or whatever, um, is kind of a go to business motivation and self-help motivation. I don't

569
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,560
know why, I don't know how that caught on of like, you have to have this philosophy and business

570
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:14,080
and, uh, when the, the most practical advice could be like, I don't know, just start doing

571
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:19,280
some things, just do practical things and something will stick eventually. Isn't that what it all adds?

572
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,440
All these books essentially add up to what you just said, but no, you have to be like,

573
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:30,960
you have to find 700 ways to reframe that. Yeah, it's like, it's like when I was, you know,

574
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,120
for starting comedy classes and all's we ever do with sit at the bar and talk about comedy and

575
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,960
stuff, it's like, no, just go home, just start crapping stuff out and eventually it'll hopefully

576
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,200
smooth out and something good will appear. You know, I liked that all's we ever did.

577
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:51,440
That was a good look. See, I just like spend so much time like pulling my hair out, waiting for

578
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,400
realizations when I was young. And then as I got older, I was like, oh yeah, you just got to do a

579
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,800
bunch. You just need to clock a bunch of hours and like sand off the rough edges, you know,

580
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,760
you needed somebody who would teach you self-actualization, which is what he's

581
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:11,680
advertising here. And that's why, why it, you know, people, people gravitate towards that stuff

582
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,200
because they think it's the answer, you know, there is no, there is no answer. There's no magic.

583
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,360
There's no magic sentence. You know, I don't know. I think this guy's going to hit on one.

584
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:27,200
He keeps talking and talking and talking, which is what he does. What made him this way? What

585
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:33,360
turns somebody into that? What is this bizarre combination of all the jargon that you just played

586
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:38,720
him saying, but then also Garfield is a huge part of it. It's a little tough to figure out,

587
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:48,800
if we parse, if we start getting into where, where did he come from? So he, it does seem like around

588
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:58,560
1718, the motivational world kind of starts hitting him. Why at age 17, he read, not like

589
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:05,680
most 17 year olds, he, he, he says himself, I was not off watching the Jersey shores of the time,

590
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:12,480
the time wasting mindless fluff. I watched a TV show. You can actually learn or to learn a thing

591
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:19,200
or two from the apprentice. I had all of Donald Trump's books at 17 years old and I was mesmerized

592
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:26,560
by his branding techniques. Mostly that's because that's mostly what he is. I have Trump, I had

593
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,440
wrote Trump down in my notes because it's like, I don't think we give enough credit that Trump

594
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:39,040
energized guys like this, like, like energized that kind of bullshitting the way it's guys like

595
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:44,560
this started to sound more and more like Trump and just talking and talking until stuff just

596
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,800
starts happening around you. But then if you actually look at all of them, none of them work.

597
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,800
He was also inspired and this is from Jeff. He sent us stills from the, from his book.

598
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:06,480
This gives you a window into his world. The book is called era. We might be, here's how I read it

599
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:13,600
is Arab biologist. There's a weird, Oh, like I want to say Arab biologist, but I'm seeing a weird,

600
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:22,560
Oh, it's supposed to be a combination of Arab and scoliosis. I think, Oh, because he had scoliosis

601
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:28,720
and he spent a number of months in a, in a cast bedridden. Yes. This is crucial to his story.

602
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,680
You said happy upbringing, but there was this rough run around 18 seemingly were six months where he

603
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:39,440
was pretty immobile and it seemed like what carried him through was the writing of Donald Trump.

604
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:46,560
And then also who, who is, who among us has not been inspired by Oprah. Oprah really had

605
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:55,120
a grip on his mind. And here's a section from the book. Oh, do I have it or not?

606
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:04,080
He just, he, he wrote her a letter at age 18 and like, Oh, that sounds nice about how he was inspired.

607
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:12,400
Well, kind of, but also the letter is a creepy as hell. Let me find it. Sorry. Oh, here we go.

608
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:19,760
Okay. Dear Oprah, my name is Nathan and I am an 18 year old who loves hot Oprah.

609
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:27,600
All right. So far the book has been all about like, and I had scoliosis and I could not,

610
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:32,800
and I thought all was lost for me until I wrote this letter. I am, I love hot Oprah.

611
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,320
I know it's funny and weird for a teenage guy to be such a big fan of Oprah instead of Snoop Dogg,

612
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:43,440
but life has compelled me to turn toward you. And thank God it did because it would be a loss to

613
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,400
miss a person so full of wisdom. He doesn't like Jersey Shore. He likes Trump. He doesn't like

614
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:55,040
Snoopy. He likes a hot Oprah. Yeah. Very straight, which this, you know, if you don't look at how

615
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:00,560
he's actually behaving, you could maybe think something's okay or like this guy's got gumption,

616
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:06,320
but then that those cracks hot Oprah, weird, weird. Yeah, we are for sure. And look,

617
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:14,160
when you really analyze it, who is smarter, the situation or Trump, you know, like really one just

618
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,200
is like a suit on and he fooled more people that way. Well, and that's, that I think is what he,

619
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:26,560
what Nathan Mesry got from Trump and he is just like put on a suit and have like a color associated

620
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:32,240
with you. Put on a suit, never stop talking. Doesn't matter if you're saying much, just never stop

621
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:37,040
talking. That's how they get the jump on you. If you ever give anyone else a window to talk. Orange

622
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:43,840
man, never stop talking. He really is the new Trump in a way. Well, there's another way that he's a

623
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:50,480
lot like Trump because, uh, you know, he, this guy, a business dynamo, he got his, he got a running

624
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:57,920
start. Oh, hot Oprah helped him overcome his scoliosis. And before you know it, he, uh, had sold

625
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:06,480
his ad agency at age 24. Wow. Then he was, he joined as VP of marketing for Mr. Sub Jugo juice

626
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:12,560
and Van Hout Cafe, all Canadian brands at this point living in Toronto. Uh, those all are from

627
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:19,760
MTY group and they all together have $2 billion in sales. That's pretty crazy. I mean, how do you,

628
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:27,840
that young randomly somehow end up as the VP of marketing for MTY group? One of the biggest,

629
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:34,400
oh, it's his dad. It was his dad, dad, dad, dad. It was his dad. Uh, this is a, this may be a fail

630
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:44,400
son situation. If you can believe it, uh, dad is like major, major, uh, UAE money, real estate,

631
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:52,480
like the, the owning all of the owning TCB Y in Canada is but a drop in the bucket of what

632
00:47:52,480 --> 00:48:00,240
Mr. Masri is up to. Um, can I ask, sorry to interrupt you TCB Y any thoughts? Um, I,

633
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:06,240
I remember them around in the mall. Yeah. Ocean city. Yeah. I mean, I like, I liked it. Okay. I

634
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,560
don't think we're a big TCB Y family. All right. Nevermind. I prefer the brand, uh, penguin,

635
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:14,960
which is like sparingly around. There was this, this, I don't know if that's California. There's

636
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:19,200
a very, I really like this penguin brand frozen yogurt. I think there's one or two straight.

637
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:27,680
Interesting. I think TCB Y probably the fastest to end up, uh, at I-95 corridor, like rest stops.

638
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:32,720
Like you were going to find a Roy Rogers and you were going to find a TCB Y. That's the last one

639
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,520
I saw on this. Yeah. I think it was on the way to Disney world or something was the rest of TCB Y

640
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:44,400
we were both there at the same time. Wow. 15 and didn't know it. Um, so, all right. So it's a fail

641
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:51,520
son situation. He has enough money, he has enough startup and like a job from daddy, but, uh, what

642
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:58,320
do I do from here? Maybe it's not satisfying him. He has other ideas, crazier ideas. Uh, I think I

643
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:03,200
also, you can't find much about, about the family, but I think there's a brother who's a much more

644
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,960
traditional, just like, uh, you know, not making web videos and wearing strange costume. So I have

645
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,080
a whole theory about what's going on here family wise, but, uh, he's not satisfied being a Canadian

646
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:20,720
businessman. So he takes a turn and goes, uh, to the land of dreams, Hollywood slash Burbank,

647
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:27,760
where he starts pursuing acting and writing. And this is around 2014, 2015. So I'm like, uh,

648
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,800
Oh, I'm getting scared. When are we going to run into somebody I've met or something with him?

649
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:39,840
Oh God, possibly. Yes. So whatever I was most checked out at it, funny or die. Um, no, he,

650
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:45,440
look, he was very productive. He studied under a teacher who taught Ryan Gosling. So he got some

651
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,240
of the knowledge that was, that went into Mr. Gosling later or no earlier, much earlier.

652
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:56,560
Earlier. Um, then he started, uh, what you were saying, Jason, he started making his own stuff.

653
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:02,320
He didn't wait around for his own opportunity. He acted in stuff that he wrote. He started Masri

654
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:08,000
pictures and there is a trail of Masri pictures content that you can still watch on YouTube

655
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,720
to this day. Uh, he produced a short film. This is in 2015 called Ahmed and Howard. Um, this is,

656
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:20,640
here's the description from them. An Arab and a Jew torn apart by history and brought together as,

657
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:27,600
as a grocery store, probably at to solve the Middle East crisis with one hummus at a time.

658
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:35,360
He, uh, later on comes back around to that idea of the conflicts between the Arabs and the Jews,

659
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:42,560
in a less creative way. Scared, scared. Um, at the time it's just high jinks of like opposing

660
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:46,880
cultures. It's like a, it's a two-hander and these guys think they don't like each other,

661
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:53,120
but after a crazy night of mischief in the, in this one odd, not friendly to cameras store that

662
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:58,880
they were able to film at, uh, they ended up getting along. Uh, it's a two-hander. It's Nathan,

663
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,480
it's the great Nathan Masri, the great actor, Nathan Masri, who's strong enough to go up against

664
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:15,040
him in 2015. Uh, do you guys, I don't know, is it, uh, does the name Jake Novak mean anything to you

665
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:22,080
recent past? Have you ever heard the name Jake Novak? I feel like I have heard it, but maybe I'm,

666
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:28,080
maybe it's just this, uh, did you around June of this year, did anyone pass along? Did I perhaps

667
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:34,400
pass along to you a video from Tik Tok? Yes. A wrap. Yes, I know it. I know. I know. I know.

668
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:44,880
I know. Who wants to be the new SNL cast member. No, I know. No, I think, I think this is, this is

669
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:50,000
a new thing I think I'm bringing to the Nathan Masri story, uh, due to some tweets that he himself

670
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,600
posted a couple months ago when it was Jake Novak made it out there. I could not believe this.

671
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,560
Not some random guy that he made a movie with. It's this guy who got notorious this year and

672
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:05,840
listener, if you don't know what we're talking about, there was this Tik Tok because SNL is

673
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:12,320
losing a ton of cast members over the summer. Um, and this guy who had made up a lot of comedy

674
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:17,520
raps on Tik Tok was throwing his hat into the ring with a rap that is addressed to Lauren Michaels

675
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:24,800
personally. Smart. I think you got a good read on the guy. Uh, and the, the tone of this is like,

676
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:35,200
I want to be the next SNL cast member. It's this like very cloying sub Lin-Manuel. Oh my God. I

677
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:40,960
mean, like you guys saw it, right? I mean, it's the craziest thing ever. But did you,

678
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:47,040
did you know the theme park connection? I know that he was outed as a member of the dapper.

679
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:54,960
This is his day job. Uh, so you might see him at Disneyland as a dapper Dan. This thing is so

680
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,680
crazy, especially that he start when he frames himself, like what he could be on the show. He

681
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,840
like thinks he could be the next lonely Island. So he says like, uh, because when it comes to the

682
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:08,240
county ramps, I've kind of been killing it. And then this, and then like, oh, I'm kind of a, uh,

683
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:16,880
Lin-Manuel, uh, Lin-Manuel Miranda mixed with Sammy Berg, meaning he, he calls an Andy Samberg,

684
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:22,880
Sammy Berg, which might be the most annoying thing I've ever heard. And this is an episode all about

685
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:28,400
annoying stuff. So these guys somehow found each other, cannot believe it. And I just, I want to

686
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:34,960
say people I think have been bordering on harassing of, uh, of Jake Novak, even outing his work as,

687
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:40,160
as that Disneyland. And I don't approve of any of that. Nobody should be mean to that. Yeah.

688
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:46,880
Just do what we all did, which is all quietly pass the link to everyone we've ever met in comedy.

689
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:52,560
I don't go out of your way to be mean to the guy. They, they announced four new cast members and

690
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:58,480
they all seemed like, you know, people who had been working for a while, but I, someone did have

691
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:05,120
a big tick tock file account and I was like, Oh no, is it, is it, it can't be. And it wasn't,

692
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:10,320
it was, I think they were all mostly standups and someone who was on the league of their own show.

693
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:16,000
Someone else who was a writer on big mouth, you know. Well, they've missed their shot to have the

694
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:22,160
sketch, uh, two guys trying to get their jackets, uh, look up this video if you haven't seen it.

695
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:28,000
Anyway, blew my mind that Maz, Mazari and Novak, which, and which he, he recently was like,

696
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,600
congratulations to my old partner, Jake Novak, you're on CNN, you're killing it. And then you

697
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:39,520
click on the link and the link is him talking about how sad he is that his life has become,

698
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:45,120
that people are coming after him for this video, which is, which plays into the Mazari

699
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:52,400
lack of awareness because he would constantly retweet and post articles that he, that are mean

700
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,280
to the restaurant. But he doesn't, he has no meter for that. It's if I'm being talked about,

701
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:04,640
it's good. And I get that, but also when it's 95% bad press, I think that no president, no president,

702
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,480
bad president thing doesn't apply. Well, that's a Trump's, I mean, Trump would attack, but Trump

703
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:13,280
also likes that too. That's another Trumpy thing where it's like, he just wants people talking

704
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:18,400
about him. He was on all the talk shows and his role was buffoon. Everybody thought that Conan

705
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,200
and Letterman were like, look at this idiot, mock him. But he was getting out there and that's,

706
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:28,800
that's the move you have, I guess, if you're not naturally, yeah, I know he was in the comments a

707
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:33,200
lot when people would write one star reviews and either be going to like, these are fake, these are

708
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:38,240
bots. They're people who don't want us to succeed. And you know, when it's a small family owned

709
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,640
restaurant and you see the owners responding, like, I'm very sorry you didn't enjoy your meal,

710
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:50,000
please contact us. That I understand. But like owners of like a licensed restaurant getting into

711
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:56,160
fights online with like, this is absolutely not true. You are a liar. Like that is no,

712
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:01,440
that's a Trump thing. Well, yeah. And well, and when the restaurant is due, it is to give him

713
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:07,840
credit doing things that no restaurant has ever done, perhaps for good reason. And people to say,

714
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:13,120
hey, I have some notes about the new things that no restaurant has ever done. He's like, no, wrong.

715
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:21,040
There's no possible way any of this could have any errors. Yeah. Really strange. One more just bit of

716
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:27,280
like, because I think being a guy, you have to be surrounded by sub guys. And like your and your

717
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,440
reputation has to be built off of other guys. And that's what that's what Nathan has done.

718
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:38,800
Um, including in June, 2015, despite just being a back, a working actor in Los Angeles, it's kind of

719
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:45,120
strange that he was invited to be knighted by the Prince of Montenegro, Prince Stefan,

720
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:51,040
chernetic. And that is a younger, that's an honor to be the youngest knighted man in the world.

721
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:55,760
So he's the, in addition, before he's the world's youngest Garfield licensee, he's the youngest

722
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:02,960
knighted person. That's wild. Um, and it's only devalued a little bit, I guess, by the fact that

723
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:09,920
two years later, the Prince of Montenegro was arrested for not being the Prince of Montenegro.

724
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:16,480
He was an Italian fraudster who this is from Reddit user soggy sauce, an Italian fraudster

725
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,440
who had been masquerading as the Crown Prince of Montenegro and Macedonia, despite the fact that

726
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:26,640
those countries don't have anything to do with each other. Soggy sauce. Thank you. Thank you.

727
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:33,280
Soggy sauce. Italian fraudster was the phrase that I like. Yeah, that's most likely have encountered

728
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:40,080
at least one Italian fraudster and oh my gosh, Tomasso booty, the fashion cafe guy, both a guy

729
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:47,040
and an Italian fraudster, another Italian fraudster. Yeah. He was knighted by the Crown Prince of

730
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:54,000
fake country from Princess Princess Diaries, Genovia, Genovia. Wow. The Crown Prince of

731
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,920
Genovia. What this guy would do is just like hand out. Anybody he wanted to meet, he just like

732
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:07,520
convince people it was a castle, put a bunch of like nice flags all over his car and then like,

733
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:12,720
please come out. I'll give you a title, including Pamela Anderson. Pamela Anderson came out to

734
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:19,840
Montenegro and he like put a sword on her head and said, you are now Countess de Gilly. Whoa.

735
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:26,160
This is what I want to do with the PTR legends. This is exactly the scheme. Yeah. I mean, legitimate

736
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:32,320
idea. Yeah. Well, okay. We'll take some cause this guy didn't get arrested for a little while

737
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:36,960
as well. We won't. So if we just get some like nice pins made up, put them all over our car.

738
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:42,320
Mm hmm. That's the move. Just get 300 pins glued to all of our cars. And they'll think

739
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:47,600
of somebody who think it's good. That's a big honor. And just rent a house like in somewhere fancy.

740
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:54,000
That's what'll get Eisner father and son to come visit us and get their award. Now you might be

741
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,200
asking how are we going to pay for this nice house? And the answer is you don't. The Prince of Prince

742
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:04,720
Stefan Trenetic just like by being a prince. This is another thing. How do they do it? Trump just

743
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:09,280
gets stuff handed to him by pretending this guy's like, I'm the Prince by, oh, okay. Well,

744
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,760
the bill is substantial. Don't worry about it. He's the Prince. We do not charge the Prince for a

745
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:18,080
fancy Villa that he stays in for a month and gives out awards to pay all the interest in that.

746
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,880
Oh, and then also then when the daily beast got a hold of this guy to say, Hey, so what do you think

747
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:30,320
about getting arrested and not being a Prince? He's like, no, no, no, I am a Prince. This is real.

748
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:35,360
This is all bogus. And also I just want to say on the record how much I love Trump and Putin

749
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:42,800
of wonderful men. I love the work that they're doing. This is the playbook and it's successful.

750
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:48,080
Generally, it is always successful. It is not really caught up to Nathan Masri as far as I can

751
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:54,320
tell. No, he's just, he just keeps dropping names and he got a restaurant open. He found another

752
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:59,920
sub guy. There's not a lot of information about his other guy, Pascal Heider, who is an Austrian.

753
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:06,160
And he seemed to finance the whole thing for a while. He, he is, he got rich from ICOs,

754
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:14,000
which is a form of crypto fake thing. So, you know, he's playing crypto people. He's and then,

755
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,720
but then the key ingredient, you can't just be knighted and toss it around your ICO money.

756
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:28,480
You got to go to the guy. You got to get a hold of Jim Davis to achieve. Sir, I'm trying to have

757
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:34,720
forward momentum here, but you keep having, why Garfield? Why? Also along the way, when he's

758
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:40,000
inspired by hot Oprah, he also like Garfield spoke to him because he talks about how that phrase,

759
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
don't leave me. He says like, that's the human condition. Love me, feed me. Don't leave me.

760
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,960
Well, he said that when he would come home from school with a report card, if he had A's,

761
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:56,800
A minuses or A pluses, his mother would give him a Garfield book, you know? Okay. He's just weirdly

762
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:04,800
associating success. He's conflating success and Garfield. Yes. Yeah. In a way. And I mean,

763
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:11,360
I kind of get it. I would get like, you know, $10 if there are comic books, if I got a good report,

764
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,760
you know, I kind of get it. It feels like that could have happened to you,

765
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:19,520
might like your reward was a Garfield comic book, literally. Well, what I would get is I would get

766
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:23,840
you go to a book fair once in a while and I would get one of the collected additions.

767
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:31,520
And there was one specifically that was like silver, like reflective, shiny hologrammy.

768
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:35,920
And I was obsessed with it. It was like the best day of my life when I would get one of those things.

769
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,480
Initially, they would do the collected editions where Garfield looked weird because it was early

770
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:45,120
on. The design wasn't perfected. Oh yeah. He was much fatter. Yeah. And he was just odd. Yeah. He

771
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:49,680
looked odd. And then those books were like thicker oftentimes. And I'm like, yeah, yeah, but I don't

772
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,800
whatever. And then the newer ones, like the cutting edge ones when I was little,

773
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,960
I had like a shiny cover and I was like, yeah, he looks good. Garfield's looking good.

774
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:01,520
And this cover is awesome. Are you the first person ever to call Garfield cutting edge?

775
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:12,400
Yeah, I am. Yeah. Cutting edge, looking good. But yeah, I did love Garfield as a kid. I guess I

776
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:17,840
really couldn't, I'm trying to think of why I loved Garfield as a kid. That's the question.

777
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:23,040
There's so much why. And I guess it's like, if I really think about what I like about it is I

778
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:30,480
liked the drawings, I think. Sure. I think I liked the- Like the line weight. The lines were soft and

779
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:35,840
I liked the look of the character. There was something about it. Big eyes. But I love that,

780
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:41,920
the voice. Lorenzo Music is the guy. Oh my God, of course. And then his mouth doesn't move.

781
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:46,560
The volado of it is the voice. He's also, he's fake Bill Murray in Ghostbusters. Right,

782
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:51,600
the reverse. Real Ghostbusters. Yes, Lorenzo Music. And then Bill Murray did it. Yeah, yeah.

783
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:57,680
And he created, co-created Rhoda to Mary Tyler Moore's spinoff and he was Carlton the Doorman

784
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:02,240
on Rhoda. Wow. And he never was shown on camera, but he would always be, hey, it's Carlton your

785
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:06,880
Doorman. Oh, so that voice was famous for that. Exactly. Oh, okay, okay. And that's the thing I

786
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:13,120
knew at 10 or 11 and I was a little happy with myself for knowing it because my mother told me.

787
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:18,160
I feel like we were both the sorts of children at family parties. Relatives would be like,

788
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:23,760
I gotta get away from this kid. They're talking about Lorenzo Music and Lucille Ball. And I,

789
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,160
there was, I had a name tag at the container when I looked at the container store when I was like

790
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:34,000
21 and it said Carlson on it because there were so many mics. And an older lady was like, oh,

791
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,600
is that Carlson the Doorman? And they like, she chuckled to her friend, he's not going to know

792
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:45,840
that. And I go, oh, you mean Carlton the Doorman from Rhoda? And they were floored. And I felt so

793
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:51,920
good about myself. Your moment finally came. It literally was, it was a perfect moment to use it.

794
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:57,200
It's the only time it's ever happened other than this moment right now. So two times in 30 years

795
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:02,080
have I been able to use that knowledge. They were literally floored. They fell on the floor of the

796
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:06,080
container store. They bled out of their brain. That's right. You had to clean it up. I killed

797
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:11,600
two ladies with my knowledge of Lorenzo Music. You can confess that on a club three. That's

798
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:15,920
not going to bite you. This is too deep. Yeah, too deep. Cops don't want to pay the eight bucks.

799
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,280
You know what this might tie into? This might be the time for me to play this video in which

800
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:27,920
some of the why of Garfield is answered. And it's also what connects Nathan Masri to the creator,

801
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:36,720
Jim Davis. This is a video made by Jim Davis promoting Garfield Eats after the license has

802
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:41,600
been acquired. This is my favorite video I've ever seen. I'll skip through it a little bit.

803
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:49,200
And there might be a special guest in the video as well. Let's see. Hello, I'm Jim Davis and this is

804
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:56,480
my cat Garfield. Hi, I'm Garfield and this is my cartoonist, Jim Davis. And that pretty much sums

805
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:04,560
up my relationship with Garfield. A little history on how this orange furball became the most famous

806
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:11,360
cat in the world might be in order. You see, even as a child- Wait, I only wanted to play that. Now

807
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:18,640
what I want to play is him saying why Garfield became like a hero. This is straight from the

808
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:24,880
creator's mouth. Like why did Garfield become a pop culture phenomenon if he did? Just immediately.

809
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:30,560
And he was born during a time when the fitness craze was in full tilt. We were all made to feel

810
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:36,400
guilty about eating pasta, skipping exercise, taking a nap, and in general, anything that made

811
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:41,600
life a little bit sweeter. Well, Garfield came along and defended our right to eat lasagna,

812
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:51,760
skip the gym, and sleep until noon. In a sense, he was a rebel. I guess. I guess. Anyone a rebel? No,

813
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:57,440
as a kid, I could give a shit about him eating lasagna. I liked that he liked lasagna, but-

814
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:04,720
Skip the gym. It's this fitness craze. This is getting out of hand. Olivia Newton-John did a song

815
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:13,840
about it. Jane Fonda in a robe. Too much. That's too many things. We need a fatso to eat fatty food

816
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:20,160
and save us from this blight. Wow, that's an interesting revisionist history, I think. Unless

817
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:25,440
that's something I'm just totally oblivious to. I guess adults thinking that, but children certainly,

818
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:31,280
I don't think. I would think that- These crazes. I hate these crazes. Children are the primary

819
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:36,960
audience of Garfield, at least initially. I think so. I think. Yeah. I just don't, I think that rebel

820
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:44,800
thing- That's something fake. Yeah. Well, it might also be in there to try to like segue from one

821
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:50,320
topic to the other. Here, forgive me. Back to the, I might repeat a little, but here, he keeps going.

822
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:58,480
Skip the gym and sleep until noon. In a sense, he was a rebel, which brings us to Nathan Masry,

823
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:05,040
another rebel and co-founder of a new food experience that Garfield would love. Garfield

824
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:11,040
eats. It's an easy and entertaining way to get delicious food in a hurry and be entertained at

825
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:18,800
the same time. Nathan calls it an enter gauging app, entertaining and engaging. It's the world's

826
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:23,600
first enter gauging mobile app for the restaurant business. Now- Could you pause it real quick?

827
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:28,080
Because I love how he says restaurant. Restaurant. Restaurant. From the restaurant business.

828
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:35,600
From the restaurant business. From the restaurant business. It is so exactly the energy of

829
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:43,040
my other favorite piece of Garfield content, which is our great former vice president, Mike Pence,

830
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:51,040
taking up Congress's time to do this slow, dottering tribute to Garfield on his birthday

831
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:57,520
with this great, like he's saying the Garfield basics, like he hates Mondays and hates exercise

832
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:06,080
and loves to pig out a cat after my own heart. As you know, it doesn't cut C-SPAN or whatever

833
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:12,160
doesn't cut to the audience, but like everybody's going to be asleep or on their phone and fucking

834
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:18,000
Pence again. And it's so funny that like, and then 10 years later, people are trying to hang him.

835
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:25,920
If he just fucking like stayed sleepy, he could have gotten out of this whole mess. Yeah. He got

836
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:31,760
too- He wanted to be in Trump's graze. Everybody does as Nathan does. Yeah. Pulled into the crazies.

837
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:38,400
That's right. He wanted to be in Trump's good graces. I just want to go back in that video

838
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:44,480
when he says, hi, I'm Jim Davis, creator of Garfield. And then a little cartoon pops up, goes,

839
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:51,120
hi, I'm Garfield. It does. And that's my cartoonist, Jim Davis. Is that Jim Davis doing both the voices?

840
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:55,920
It does that way a little bit. It does not feel like an official. It's not more Lorenzo Pest way,

841
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:02,000
I believe. But yeah. Yeah. Jim Davis. Not Bill Murray. I don't know. He didn't answer the phone

842
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,400
for that one. I would, uh, it's, it sounds like you could, with the right deal, he'll like,

843
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:12,560
we've teamed up with Kohler Toilets and Garfield is now going to, you'll be able to shit in his mouth

844
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:18,880
with our new Garfield toilet, like whatever, just plant him in front of the camera. And if the check

845
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:25,680
cleared, he's ready to go. Yum. Yum. Feed me your shit. They make Garfield toilets. You still have

846
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:32,480
to flush them five, 10, sometimes 15 times. Go now you can wear Garfield bulletproof vest.

847
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,240
Garfield will protect you from gunshots.

848
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:44,000
Like he doesn't, it doesn't matter. You want to take the ultimate nap? Go with Garfield cyanide

849
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,440
pills. If you're in the middle, you're in the middle of a war and you've been captured. Garfield

850
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:54,320
just chomp right down on Garfield's numb, numb, numb lasagna, cyanide capsules on your flavor.

851
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:59,280
You'll take your ultimate nap. Take you to where you don't want to, if you're off getting tortured

852
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:04,720
by an enemy country, that's like a whole life of Mondays. Quaaludes are back after by popular

853
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:11,120
demand, but now they're called Garflutes. You will be thinking you're sleeping in a little purple box

854
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:17,200
with a blue blanket and you're hunched up. Try to point me at the camera and I'll endorse it.

855
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:25,520
It doesn't matter. It's such a great energy. It's so funny. It's so in line with 70 something.

856
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:31,120
Yeah, now we know that's him. So why did he say yes to this? Besides just like sure, whatever.

857
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,400
It still feels too shady to say yes to. He seems to attribute it mainly to like,

858
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:43,520
well, no one has ever come to me with such a crazy idea. Okay, I get I that's it. So for it.

859
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:48,800
So now this guy gets to do whatever he wants with your license in Dubai and Kenny, can you,

860
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:56,640
you are fine with just like, you know, 500 pieces of social media where your character is just next

861
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:03,040
to this bizarre orange suited man. Like they're best friends now. Like you're okay with that.

862
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:08,640
That is on brand to you that a strange somebody we've never seen. I'd like to announce a team up

863
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:18,080
Garfield and Alex Jones are now together doing a podcast. There is info wars X Garfield. Garfield

864
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:26,160
loves nootropics. They help his brain. Ben Shapiro and Garfield now have teamed up for an exciting

865
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:36,400
new cartoon for whatever the hell that shitty daily color films. Oh yeah. Garfield and Gina

866
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:45,120
Carano are teaming up at last to take on Hunter Biden and this time shipping him to Abu Dhabi.

867
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:52,160
Actually, he's already in Abu Dhabi. Hunter Biden is already in Abu Dhabi and Garfield has to

868
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:57,280
get them back and then ship them again. Did you know Hunter Biden did crack and then kicked a

869
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:05,440
bunch of orange cats? It's true. Garfield will tell you the tale. The first Garfield eats was in Abu

870
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:12,640
Dhabi or Dubai. Excuse me. Dubai. It was kind of, but scooters is that I was going to say,

871
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:17,840
because I can't, I've now, I at least skimmed past every piece of Instagram content from

872
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:24,480
both Nathan and Garfield eats. And what I did not ever see was a restaurant that says Garfield

873
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:29,760
eats in Dubai. So was it, or was it all, it was a purely, was that a totally ghost kitchen?

874
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:36,560
I'm not really sure. They said there was exclusive Garfield scooters that would,

875
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:41,200
people would deliver the food to you. Which are terrified. They're seeing these yellow

876
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:47,280
scooters with these like yellow cubes. It looks like some secret military is like

877
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:51,360
coming to haul you away. Yeah. I mean, different websites had different locations. I mean,

878
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:56,560
there was definitely some where we're, we're coming to London, Ontario. We're coming to London,

879
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:02,720
England. We're coming here and, and clearly like, I'm sure. Yeah. The pandemics. What did them.

880
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:06,960
It's another one. Only the pandemic. Like all these other things. It's another one where he

881
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:12,080
like declared at a certain point that there will be 250 locations or something. This is the runner

882
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:18,000
up. Celebrary, nothing but that. This is, this entire thing is like a celebrity where

883
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:23,920
the celebrity is a guy you've never heard of. But like, and now certainly Garfield was powering it,

884
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:30,960
but also he, the whole point of this brand that he created is Garfield plus me, Nathan Masri.

885
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:36,720
Who are you? Shut up. Don't ask any questions about me. Who's your dad? Can't tell you who,

886
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:42,800
how old are you? Stop it. This is gotcha journalism. Like it's, I want to be famous,

887
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:47,520
but if you have any questions for about me, I cannot tell you. And I'm furious you add that's

888
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:53,440
very Tommy Wiseau actually. Right. Like vanity project for me. All right. Two simple questions

889
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:59,120
about you. Shut up. Get him out of the theater. Would you say he's Mercurial? He's definitely

890
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:06,560
Mercurial as somebody who's super around could be. He's somehow managed to be both. Yeah. So yeah,

891
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:11,040
in order for you to buy into this brand, you have to not only love Garfield and be inspired by

892
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:17,200
Garfield as if it is the teachings of Christ, but also love this orange suit man. And there's

893
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:22,560
interplay. It's all the Instagram content is the two of them. Garfield's thinking something snarky.

894
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:30,400
And then so is Nathan. Like here's Garfield next to Nathan and Garfield says, this is the man who

895
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:37,440
made a pizza out of my face. That's nice, but I'd prefer it in my mouth. What creepy weird. I don't

896
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:42,720
like this. He started owning the brand so much that there's footage of him like, uh, for sick

897
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:47,040
or autistic children or something. He's like autographing the kinds of books you would get

898
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:53,360
mine, uh, from 1987. He's autographing Jim Davis's Garfield books from 1987. He did not have anything

899
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:58,640
to do with those. He was a child or maybe not even born. I don't know. Uh, who wants an autographe

900
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:05,680
Garfield book from the guy who took the brand five years ago? So weird. Um, here's another weird

901
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:13,440
piece of content. Um, this was in the Dubai days. Okay. This is, uh, just kind of like hunky photo

902
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:21,200
of Nathan. He's got his high hair. He's got his weird beard and he's holding up a log and a wooden

903
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:28,640
log and he says, I work my back hard while Garfield eats. This log has 4% moisture imported from

904
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:34,080
Europe. Do you know what it will be used for? Hashtag entrepreneur, hashtag style, hashtag won't

905
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:40,160
work. Do you, does anyone know what the fuck does that mean? I don't know what that means. What's

906
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:48,160
his log for? No idea. His moist log, 4% moisture imported from Europe, just the moisture or was

907
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:53,280
the log imported with the level of moisture that you wanted? I guess the log has the moisture too.

908
01:15:53,280 --> 01:16:00,880
Is this, does this go along with the reusability? Like there were like the, the packaging for the

909
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:05,600
Garfield each place is like, you can use them for other things. I don't know if those are connected,

910
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:10,160
but let's talk about that. That's one of the weirdest things. Very strange. This is just like,

911
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:15,840
come into this restaurant with no seats and learn every premise for a restaurant you could possibly

912
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:24,480
handle at once. So this is it's because it's all reusable sustainability, but the box is wasteful.

913
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:29,200
I'm going to add this lasagna box. I'm going to end up throwing it away. Well, not so fast. Oh,

914
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:34,480
really? Is there another way? Yes. You can turn it into a tissue. You can turn this grease covered

915
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:41,520
pizza lasagna box into a tissue box. She's caked. So all I have to do is peel the cheese off. Yes.

916
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:46,720
That is basically merging with the cardboard already. Uh huh. Uh, may try to be okay with the

917
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:55,120
grease and then take my, all my loose tissues that I have because I am not willing to spend the money

918
01:16:55,120 --> 01:17:03,680
for tissue boxes. So I go to, I buy tissues off the street. Yeah. I go to a dealer who gives me

919
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:09,440
loose tissues, but I have nowhere to put them because I don't pay for a tissue box. What do I

920
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:15,200
do with all these bags? So you're the bag hutch, you know, thank God. Finally, there's a better way.

921
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:23,520
So the way a box to put my tissues in, uh, now these tissue boxes, one thing I hate about tissue

922
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:29,200
boxes is that they have that plastic part that kind of grabs the tissues and leaves the ones you

923
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:36,640
don't want in this box. Doesn't have that. Does it? Um, probably not. Oh, thank God. I hate the

924
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:42,000
plastic part of tissue boxes that I want them to just be loose so that maybe I pull one and pull

925
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:51,680
a hundred more out, um, of my grease cheesecake, tissues. The fuck is this playing? I don't, yeah,

926
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:57,600
I don't know. So weird. Uh, what else do you have to learn about the restaurant before you even

927
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:03,840
start? Well, there's the app. So you have to get an app and you have to watch Garf, you start watching

928
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:08,880
your Garfield content on the app. Here's another, this is going to blow some minds too.

929
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:16,080
This is from exclaimed.ca. He's talking about like the videos that are going to be on, uh,

930
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:19,600
you're going to know where I'm going with this because he's, this is an app that you watch while

931
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:25,680
you're waiting for your food and maybe you're watching eight minutes or so of content while

932
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:29,680
waiting. And he says, yeah, so you know, eight minutes, there'll be short form. And you know

933
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:34,400
what? We learned a lot from Quibi. I'm sure you're aware of Quibi. We think that again,

934
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:38,960
this is 2020. We think that short form is the future and that's what this is. Interviewer. So

935
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:44,480
you are a fan of Quibi. I do have Quibi, but I've unsubscribed. I did not continue my subscription

936
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:48,640
because it's only on mobile and my arm gets numb by holding the mobile. So as soon as they figure

937
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:52,400
out being on smart TV, which they should have done in the first place, then obviously I'll be

938
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:58,960
the first to sign up because I do love some of the content. So even he, we want to be like Quibi.

939
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:04,160
Really? No Quibi sucks. So no, but I do love the content. What's some of your favorite content?

940
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:07,840
Oh, there's one with JLo and another with Chris Hemsworth. I don't remember the names anyway.

941
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:12,000
What we want to be like Quibi, but I don't know what their shows are called. And I,

942
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:18,240
my arm gets numb when I try to hold my phone. Yeah. Now is the time to lie. Now is the time to just

943
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:24,160
go like, oh, it's great. I watch it every day and like memorize two shows, memorize like,

944
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:28,720
oh, I like the most dangerous game in 50 states of terror or whatever.

945
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:35,440
Now is the time to lie. I know he can't. What? Just don't like stop talking. Any interview you

946
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:39,840
see with this guy, you guys probably had it kind of researching the episode you're in for it because

947
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:47,680
like a one sentence question, 25 sentence answer, like stop. Why do you talk and talk and talk?

948
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:51,600
It's such a fun. I mean, I hate to keep bringing Trump back up, but it's such a

949
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:58,160
specific type of person whose family had a lot of money and they just turned into like a person

950
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:04,560
that has diarrhea is at the mouth and it gets them in every door. It just, it just, they waltz right

951
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:09,520
in people with money or I think people with money are stupider than people who don't have money.

952
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:13,120
Well, this is the big one. I've said this before on the show. This is the secret that middle America

953
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:18,320
doesn't didn't like as slowly figured out because of Trump. Yeah, they have that point.

954
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:22,080
People got it up in the point. Everybody goes, well, this person has money. Surely they did

955
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:27,920
something to earn it. There's no way a rich person could be foolish or stupid. Well, there's also the

956
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:33,200
aspirational side where it's like, well, I want to be rich and surely I will be like them and I'll

957
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:39,120
gotta be away for me to live the American dream. So how do I make the American dream habit by talking

958
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:47,440
and talking, talking, but yeah, no, it is a specific thing to these crazy rich people.

959
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:53,120
Yeah. Luckily it worked out a lot of people figured out that Trump is a con man and that

960
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:58,800
he just talked his way into the stuff and only some, a lot of people think that he is Christ,

961
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:05,520
our savior and will like take up arms for him. Yes, that's true. So, you know,

962
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:14,080
give and take you and some, you lose him. Okay. Okay. I have a little bit of the, of this Sarah

963
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:19,200
Hagee's article from food and wine, uh, or her order because, okay, well you said some of this

964
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:25,120
already, but they really got the runner, like she stuck with it and got what she was trying to get,

965
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:30,720
but they really gave her a hard time. Yeah. The interface wasn't working and he says it's early

966
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:35,600
stages. There's bugs. Don't worry about it. So he helped. He put in the order for them, the easy to

967
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:40,080
order mobile system. They were, you just need the owner to do it for you. They got a Garfield

968
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:45,120
shaped pizza. They got, okay. I was staring at this for so long before I got it. Did you

969
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:52,960
guys come across the phrase, the big Agna lasagna? Yes. Yes. I did. I haven't solved it yet. You

970
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:58,080
haven't solved it. Mike, do you have any idea? No, I don't know. Okay. Cause I look at it as big

971
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:05,280
Agna, but here's the clue. Agna is in lasagna. It's not Agna. It's Zanya. So why make it two words,

972
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:12,400
make it big Agna, which still is weird. Did you come across big cow lasagna? Yes. I feel like

973
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:18,960
that's more of a frozen good. Yo, that's the frozen cow. Yeah. That's when the, when the time

974
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:26,320
it got kicked out of the location, then he was dealing with big cow lasagna, which was held over

975
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:30,240
into the other brand. He started, this is where we're heading for four hours here. I have,

976
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:35,120
yeah, let's just take a break. You want to come back at seven tonight? We probably should cause

977
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:40,160
there's so many Instagram posts in general. I know. It's like, we could be the longest notes

978
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:45,200
I've ever had. We could do part two on just the Instagram. There's the landlord dispute.

979
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:52,080
Yes. Yeah. Well, well, yeah, go for it. Yeah. They got, he, the employees arrived one day,

980
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:59,280
you know, 2020 mid pandemic, uh, uh, first year of pandemic and found the doors locked, like the

981
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:05,040
locks have been changed. The landlord locked them out and that only lasted like four to six hours.

982
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:12,240
Because what happened was he got on the internet and started yelling. And I'm sure in reality, he

983
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:18,960
just did some phone calls and, uh, did a bank transfer and paid whatever he was owed or something.

984
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:25,360
But then at some point he said, the only weapon I have is the Garfield fans. When I speak, the whole

985
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:31,680
world listens. Now that's a threat and that's a Trump kind of threat. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Stand by.

986
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:35,440
What did he say? Like stand by and stand around. Yeah.

987
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:40,880
Keep standing. Yeah. Um, yeah. Well, then he started referring to the,

988
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:46,560
to the landlord and social media as land monster. Land monster is really something.

989
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:54,160
Um, I, yeah. When like probably just didn't pay and has the weight of Garfield. He's,

990
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:58,480
he thinks that people were yelling at him on the street. You are the Garfield king.

991
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:05,360
Why would that happen? That didn't happen. He also, cause there's all these grievances too. Um,

992
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:11,520
you know, I don't, if the guy encountered some like awful racial stuff, I can't argue with it.

993
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:17,280
Maybe that happened. But one that I don't understand is that he claims in an interview

994
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:22,800
that he would get harassed because, uh, okay. This people would say, come in and say things like

995
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:27,600
you have opened Garfield eats and not bugs bunny eats. And you were a disgrace to the

996
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:33,120
Garfield brand. You should have opened bugs bunny. It's been longer. Now you're reviving

997
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:38,880
a cartoon and bugs bunny deserves it more. We will threaten your store. We will threaten your life,

998
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:45,360
et cetera, et cetera. See, that's just a lie. See, he can lie. That is a lie. You are very

999
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:49,200
capable of lying. We know that no one cares about Garfield that much. He also,

1000
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:58,560
or bugs. I think it's been longer open bugs bunny eats these bugs bunny terrorists who won't let

1001
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:04,960
this nice man open his business. There's no, that is a complete like flight of fancy he had,

1002
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:08,160
you know, like sometimes when you're like upset or you're like working through something, you start

1003
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:12,960
to have like imaginary arguments with people. I do sometimes where you have like an imaginary argument

1004
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:18,160
like before you might be getting into something. He must be having these constantly and now he has

1005
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:22,960
them. They're so real to him. This is, well, this is also very Trumpy that like the thing,

1006
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:27,680
the line gets blurry of what happened and what you just imagined. I think genuinely they don't know.

1007
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:32,640
Yes. He like, uh, when he was saying, Trump was saying like, oh yeah. And I went to, uh,

1008
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:37,840
I was on Jimmy Kimmel and he came outside and greeted me at the limo and he never does it.

1009
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:45,360
He does not come out and he shook my hand and he had a white glove. That was not, that's not true.

1010
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:54,560
Yeah. He's made that up. Um, now also the, in the darker shade, I, I feel like, uh, I got,

1011
01:25:54,560 --> 01:26:00,400
I gotta talk about this cause I, I couldn't believe the pendulum swings on this one. Okay.

1012
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:07,440
Because he started selling Garfield face mass at some point, 2020 people selling face mass with

1013
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:13,200
logos or characters on them. Sure. He apparently did not have permission to do that. That did not

1014
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:18,800
fall under the license, but in when he asked for permission, he never heard back and he just did

1015
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:28,560
it anyway. Before that he was, uh, playing around with COVID skepticism. He had a lot of posts that

1016
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:35,440
it wasn't real, that it was actually sarin gas that people were being exposed to lines up with.

1017
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:42,400
This is very Q ish, right? And then it starts to take a turn. A storm is coming. Military troops

1018
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:49,280
are gearing up. COVID-19 quarantine is a cover up for something bigger. Another post stay at home

1019
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:56,160
order was to prepare for the hashtag storm I discussed in March, 2020. It is war between

1020
01:26:56,160 --> 01:27:02,800
Jews and Arabs. Oh no, no. Didn't you learn anything from your Jake Novak video? Meanwhile,

1021
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:08,000
cut to Jim Davis Garfield and I tell you to stay home. The storm is coming. Garfield is right.

1022
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:16,720
This is a heart that says all lives matter. And so he has since disowned this, but it seemed like

1023
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:22,240
he was really into it for a little while. He tried it on for a little while. Can I read now the

1024
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:29,440
Instagram post? Uh, it's a picture of, of Nathan and Steve Wozniak, uh, Apple co-founder. And I

1025
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:33,360
want to read the caption. Steve had mild symptoms and recently was on the news that he may have

1026
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:38,400
COVID-19. I hope I did not catch it. I'd rather hashtag stay home than be with Woz.

1027
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:45,200
What the fuck? I don't know. Is that because he has COVID or are you, you're selling, you took a

1028
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:50,000
picture with Woz, but you hate him? I don't know. And then it's just like he wrote about meeting him.

1029
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:56,480
So I don't know if he was with him. Uh, I don't know if he was. He does a lot of it. This is very

1030
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:02,000
guy is like, let me, you know, the, like we've all, we've had scenarios where maybe we met a famous

1031
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:07,440
person and then like that picture is for us and we don't need to like use this to start a business.

1032
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:13,760
That's just a nice thing that I have not like straight to social media because before Garfield

1033
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:19,120
eats, he had a gross West Hollywood picture with like a, uh, obviously a disgusting looking Jean

1034
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:23,920
Simmons and Lisa Vanderpump. And he's trying to frame that as if like, well, they're around me

1035
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:31,520
because I'm wheeling and dealing here in Hollywood. He also did a gross thing of one of the grossest

1036
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:39,840
things, which is to, uh, get a cameo and then crop out that cameo logo that explains why you have

1037
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:45,520
this celebrity content all of a sudden. Um, that didn't necessarily solve everything in this case

1038
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:52,400
because you can tell the person is reading painfully reading copy that she does not understand.

1039
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:58,720
Who am I talking about? Why actual Garfield family member from the films,

1040
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:06,880
Miss Jennifer love Hewitt. Oh boy. Oh my gosh. Hi, it's Jennifer love Hewitt.

1041
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:14,080
Congratulations on opening Garfield eats world restaurant for Garfield. I think that's amazing.

1042
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:19,520
That was really hard to say. Um, that's so super cool. I want to come check that out.

1043
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:25,440
I loved working on the Garfield movies. I was a big Garfield. And then she just talks about like

1044
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:29,920
this is the most obvious cameo in the world. She doesn't know. And why Garfield eats world?

1045
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:36,800
When was it ever that before? Weird. Don't look. And then, and then the caption is just like

1046
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:43,920
Jennifer love Hewitt, uh, won awards for ghost whisperer and for so you, you're, you think you

1047
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:50,560
can like a stolen Valor her like Canadian television awards from ghost whisperer because

1048
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:55,280
you have nothing to do with Jennifer love Hewitt. Stay away from love. We should. Yeah. Stay away

1049
01:29:55,280 --> 01:30:02,880
from general of Hewitt. Uh, I think that's in general, uh, I was going to say we should pay

1050
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:07,520
$75 to get him on blister or whatever the hell it's called, cause that's how much it costs.

1051
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:15,440
So he wouldn't give him money. I guess the ride, the audience will go flooding out the door.

1052
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:19,120
I don't know. I think they'll come flooding in the door. I was worried about this by the way,

1053
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:24,560
like, cause he's going to know about this. If he's willing to throw down $8, he might hear this.

1054
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:31,120
I feel like he like pokes around anything. The tweets will be, I was going to say like,

1055
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:37,040
yeah, it's not a Google search to find this patron here, but fucking like put asterisks in it. So

1056
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:41,840
we don't have to deal with this guy. It's like, it's a swear word. Oh, that's a good question.

1057
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:46,640
Yeah. Maybe we should. I mean, I don't think anything, everything. I don't know if we've

1058
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:52,240
speculated even at all here. I think we've just stated, but I don't know. I don't know. I just

1059
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:57,520
don't, he's going to bother us. We know, we know the time wherever, like he has nothing to do,

1060
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:01,440
but for her as people who are talking about his dumb thing. I'll say this. There's a couple of

1061
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:05,680
other people we've talked about that I was sure were going to contact us and we have not heard

1062
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:10,080
from them in the history of this podcast. Well, you thought your little classified

1063
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:19,040
Anderson was fool me. I mean, I also, uh, I, him and John Benkowski here really,

1064
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:26,800
I thought we could have a good time. Yeah. I'd love to have John Benkowski, Alki David or

1065
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:34,000
something. Let me, oh God, he's too busy being that level of terrifying about COVID is sarin gas,

1066
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:38,160
a hologram and presario Alki David. That's his, that's, that wouldn't even,

1067
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:43,440
he'd censor that on social media. That's too tame for what he posts. Oh yeah. He's horrible. Uh,

1068
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:46,960
okay. Anyway. All right. Grab it. I have a grab bag of other things about the restaurant when it

1069
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:51,920
was up and running. They did not stop at stop at coupons. They were also good meals. You would

1070
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:57,840
walk in and it'd be the most, the most confusing menu you've ever seen with just arrows pointing

1071
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:02,880
to stuff. Dan, you got to order it on the app and then like, and the social media is the similar

1072
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:11,760
style. Um, here's a gram that I have. Um, okay. Here's a piece of pizza and it's got broccoli and

1073
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:19,120
pepper on it. And as an arrow and it says a slice of Garfield's face now available. And then there's

1074
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:24,240
a circle next to that and it says 99 cent only. And if that looks familiar to you, it's because

1075
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:32,160
they stole the logo store and just colored it orange. That's a, that's not just a phrase.

1076
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:38,560
No, no, that's a logo. I like that brand. That's a nice store. Also, when you cut a slice of the

1077
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:44,240
Garfield pizza, it never looks appealing. It looks small and wimpy and shitty. Yeah. Yeah.

1078
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:52,320
People hated this pizza. The orange is horrible. Um, I, uh, cardboardy, uh, I saw some review

1079
01:32:53,200 --> 01:33:00,000
that said, Oh, what was this review? Oh, um, my brother-in-law ordered me the lasagna as a joke

1080
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,720
a few weeks back. He had to follow up for a week because it never got shipped and finally arrived

1081
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:11,680
in a wet bag and thought with a PC printed Garfield comic in it. After I took a few pictures

1082
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:16,160
for posterity, I told my brother-in-law, I couldn't eat it because thought when delivered and threw it

1083
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:20,880
out, he asked for a refund, but still had to pay the shipping and was told that a replacement lasagna

1084
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:25,520
would be at my door within the hour. That was three weeks ago and I'm still waiting.

1085
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:33,360
Well, I think the, the, the anecdote that I kept coming across was that, you know, he had giant

1086
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:38,880
stuffed Garfields and there were a few stories about it. One is that someone tried to buy it and

1087
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:45,440
they were told that is for serious collectors only, like they were being too, you know, funny

1088
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:51,200
about it. And then the other story I heard is that someone, someone like paid money for one.

1089
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:58,640
It's got a box shipped to their house and it was just a box of sand. It was a bag of sand in a box.

1090
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:01,120
It was not what they had ordered.

1091
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:08,560
Box of sand. How does that happen? That's not anything like Garfield stuff.

1092
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:13,280
Which is very close to like a meme story that went around the internet a while,

1093
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:19,920
a long time ago, where someone went to Walmart and it's unclear if this was a joke or they said this

1094
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:24,880
is what happened. It's that they bought a router and when they opened the box, when they got home

1095
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:31,440
for the router, it was just a bag of dirt that said puto on it. Like,

1096
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:39,840
I mean, that's, that's a fitting for this because this is so like, this took on a life of its own

1097
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:45,200
on the internet. This, this fell right in with all the Garfield meme stuff. I think that really

1098
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:50,640
helps speed it along. Garfield is enjoyed in this kind of ironic, what was this way that gets a

1099
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:54,400
little eerie. It's a little bit in that Shrek zone. It's a little annoying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But

1100
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:58,800
surely another character might not have gotten this. It's already so primed for internet and

1101
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:03,600
then it's a disaster and he's this was so he guy. It's just the whole recipe is there. I hate to

1102
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:10,400
interject. We're kind of a bonus round area here. Instagram, there's a poster. I don't know if you

1103
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:15,120
came across this. It says under construction, my unique Garfield collection suit by men, fashion

1104
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:21,120
designer and stylist in Dubai. And it's him drawing a picture of himself, I guess, in a suit,

1105
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:24,640
which I don't know that it looks anything specific. Like I don't know why you would have to

1106
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:31,120
draw it. It just looks like a, an okay drawing of a guy in a suit. Yeah, that's really bland.

1107
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:35,280
And then he said, invest in your personal branding to claim your identity in society.

1108
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:42,240
Someone will Google you, which is another threat. Yeah, I know. Uh, and this does not put his name

1109
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:47,040
in the description. How about that? That might, maybe he'll miss it because of that. Um, there's

1110
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:53,360
also, do I have it here? Uh, did you come across, uh, Nath field? No,

1111
01:35:55,680 --> 01:36:03,120
I hate him. He wrote the big reveal introducing Nate hashtag Nath field, which is a combination

1112
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:10,080
of him and a cat, a Garfield style cat, uh, far from being lazy. He possesses orangey superpowers.

1113
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:19,520
I don't know. He also has so many on Instagram posts of, of quotes that are attributed to him,

1114
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:25,840
to him. Yes. Inspirational quotes. It used to be Jim Davis, which is being inspired by Jim Davis.

1115
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:30,320
That's like only Mike Pence has ever done that. But then it switches over to, I never knew what

1116
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:39,920
love is until I met Garfield is I never knew what it is. I dream to be a trendsetter, not a trend

1117
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:47,840
follower. And then Masri, it sounded like he had a pretty loving mother. It sounded like he had a

1118
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:53,440
very loving family. And even though they went through hard times, but what, let me propose this

1119
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:58,080
and we don't know, this is all alleged in speculation. What if not? This was Aaron's

1120
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:02,240
theory. Actually, when I was telling her all this stuff about like, he says that Jim Davis is like

1121
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:08,160
a Godfather to me. Um, and that kind of clued me in and Aaron was saying like, what if this was,

1122
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:14,000
what if he was kind of like disowned? What if the more plain brother who we learned about who,

1123
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,000
who just like plugged into the business and didn't have all these kooky ideas, maybe this is like a

1124
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:24,160
soul situation, you know, Jimmy McGill, uh, he wore his weird suits and his personality had to come

1125
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:30,720
out and he couldn't just fit into the boring law firm. Maybe Nathan was like not the chosen brother

1126
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:35,200
and he's been looking for a father for me. He's in a little like at least business disowned by his

1127
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:41,200
father and he finally found the kind fatherly figure he's always needed in Jim Davis. I mean,

1128
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:46,240
Jim Davis does have like a kind grandfather energy around him in those, in those videos.

1129
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:51,040
I'll say that. Yeah, there's a picture of them. One of my posts that I highlighted is him and

1130
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:56,720
Jim Davis sitting at a table, Jim trying to work his phone. It looks like, and he writes dine and

1131
01:37:56,720 --> 01:38:02,960
wine with partner Jim Davis talking about, guess who? Yup. Garfield and our new app. Jim is young

1132
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:09,120
at heart with many stories to tell. No wonder he is the legendary hashtag comic strips writer of

1133
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:16,320
all time since 1978. So yeah, I mean, there's a, there is maybe a fatherly situation here.

1134
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:21,680
It's also like, this is the brag that you're doing is that you're, you hang out at least

1135
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:27,280
probably on two occasions, maybe with Jim Davis. This is what your breath, like there's other,

1136
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:33,520
there's like kind of wise people who'd like, you know, you could make somebody jealous of by like,

1137
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:37,440
wow, I got to go spend a bunch of time in our imagineering world. You know, it's neat when you

1138
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:44,320
see like, wow, I got to hang out with Bob Gurr or whatever. And it, but who's ever, you liked Garfield,

1139
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:47,600
you liked Garfield more than any of us. Did you ever, were you ever like, God, if I could only hang

1140
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:52,640
out with his creator, Jim Davis. Well, after I saw the video today, yes, actually, I thought,

1141
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:57,920
you know what, this would be great to talk about restaurants with Jim Davis, but no, as a kid,

1142
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:02,080
it was not the coming storm. You know, there's a storm coming, right? Michael, we have to be

1143
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:07,440
prepared. I mean, when you're a littlest, but I was like, even Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird as a kid,

1144
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:12,080
you're, you're like, I know those names, but I want to hang out with Michaelangelo. Yeah. Like

1145
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:16,800
as you get older, you're like, Oh, I'd like to, I'd like to talk to these guys. But yeah,

1146
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:23,600
I mean, I did follow some auctions for Garfield original comic strip art recently. And then I

1147
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:28,960
stopped following them once they crossed the $300 threshold. And I realized they had the data. I

1148
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:33,840
thought it was like, Oh, wow, this is $50. And then I, I had to look again and I was like, Oh,

1149
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:38,400
the auction's in three weeks. This just went up. No one is paid yet. That's why it's $50.

1150
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:42,400
I thought you were cashing in on Garfield. Why does no one know of it?

1151
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:48,480
I have to say, we, since we mentioned quotes, you know, there, there was an interesting,

1152
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:56,480
you know, quote from a professor, I think of this, this eater roundup about how everything went down

1153
01:39:56,480 --> 01:40:02,640
and, you know, he proposed the idea of a bad text. This is a bad text and gave the example of like

1154
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:09,760
Rebecca Black's Friday. It became like a game. The fans, people on the internet, they want to

1155
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:14,720
participate in the game and that's how it gets remixed or people make videos out of people.

1156
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:18,240
People want to have fun with this stuff on the internet. And usually you can't do that with a

1157
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:23,120
good text. It stands on its own, but like there's room in bad texts for people to get in and fuck

1158
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:30,800
around. Wow. Totally. Yeah. So I did like that idea. I thought there was some validity to that

1159
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:37,040
idea, but the quote that really got back, got me back on board was from Nathan himself. And it was

1160
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:45,200
about detractors of the restaurants. As for the negative opinions, restaurants, the restaurants,

1161
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:51,520
the restaurant, as for the negative opinions, those were from haters whose taste buds were

1162
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:58,720
psychologically tainted. Masry said, I've learned taste psychology as well. And you know, sometimes

1163
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:05,600
if you hate someone so much when you eat their food, you're gonna just say it's disgusting,

1164
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:11,680
even though it's amazing. And so it's just psychology that if, if I didn't tell you that

1165
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:17,280
was from Nathan, that sounds like Donald Trump. Oh yeah, completely. Oh, and there's, and there

1166
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:23,360
are a lot of people who, if he started a restaurant now, they would like the finest food they're weeping

1167
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:28,160
while they eat it. And it's like uncooked pork. I really, this is as quick as I know, but it's

1168
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:32,480
related to what we were just talking about. I think, and I haven't double checked it. I think

1169
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:37,440
on truth social Trump put like, and even Phantom of the Opera is closing under Joe Biden.

1170
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:46,720
Brandon did this. Yeah. I think that's what he, and the Phantom's not safe. Right. The

1171
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:54,640
chandelier is falling. Trump loves Andrew Lloyd Webber and is horrified that Phantom is closing

1172
01:41:54,640 --> 01:42:04,720
on Broadway. This salt of the earth guy, not a brissy, brissy New York socialite. Not a,

1173
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:09,920
not a Manhattan guy furious. He can never go to a Broadway show again. Cause he'll just get

1174
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:17,920
booed by the cast, the crew, the audience. There's no roller skating musicals under Brandon. I tried,

1175
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:23,440
I tried for four years and the swamp wouldn't let me bring back starlight Express. They tried. I,

1176
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:29,760
he tried to make new Cinderella, try to make it in England. What happens? It closes and the queen

1177
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:36,000
dies. And that's under Joe Biden. This guy that 10 years ago would rather have talked to you about

1178
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:42,640
the new actor playing Mr. Mistoffelees versus anything political. He's a disaster. No state

1179
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:47,680
presence. He doesn't know what is, he doesn't know what a Marcus he goes right past it folks.

1180
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:53,040
Uh, that's so Tugger used to be a curious guy. Not anymore.

1181
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:57,840
The ball under Biden. The ball is not so Jellicle.

1182
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:05,040
This is what he wanted to talk about. And now it's just psychology. It's just psychology.

1183
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:12,640
Fuck. Um, uh, sometimes on the social media, they change it to, I hate weekdays.

1184
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:19,840
No, you can change that quote from the movie. I don't care. No one knows that quote. We all know

1185
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:28,240
it's not weekdays. God, even Garfield has limits. He needs to get up sometimes and, and, and then

1186
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:34,720
to keep, but to keep it consistent with the Garfield philosophy, it was closed on Monday.

1187
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:37,600
This new business

1188
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:45,600
I like that though. I think it's funny as hell that a lot of places, a lot of small

1189
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:51,200
establishments are closed on Mondays. Not because not as a tribute to Garfield. Anyone. If you open,

1190
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:56,080
if you own a little store or something, say it's for Garfield. That's more fun. Your Christ figure.

1191
01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:01,680
Um, picture on Instagram of Garfield's hand shaking Nathan's hand.

1192
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:09,920
And it says now made good food gone affordable mission accomplished.

1193
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:16,400
Well, judging by most reviews, it was neither good nor affordable.

1194
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:23,840
No, it's so expensive. It's crazy. I feel like I've seen, uh, you know, farm to table places like,

1195
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:28,320
Oh, the foods under season, the selections. I don't know. It's kind of hint and miss. I've

1196
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:36,240
never seen anywhere labeled farm to plate and it's atrocious. You know, which one is he's

1197
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:42,080
farmed a table is the more traditional phrase, but he pushes F2P, which is far too late.

1198
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:48,320
Yeah. He can't just use the one that people use. He's got to invent that too. Um, well,

1199
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:56,000
it's, it's more affordable sometimes because, um, Garfield broken heart weekdays every Sunday.

1200
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:01,360
I can't even, this is so too irritating to read. There's so much busy text, but the main thing is

1201
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:08,400
he's telling you that it's 25% off on from Sunday to Wednesday. And he conveys this with a giant

1202
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:15,440
percentage sign and then attached to the giant percentage per the percent is the point of this

1203
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:25,360
post. And then attached to that as a tag that says 25% so per 25% percent. So you've got just

1204
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:31,200
a giant percentage sign. Like that's the point of the post percent. And then attached to that

1205
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:38,640
is a much smaller tag that says 25%, which is again attached to a percentage size. So 25%

1206
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:45,840
percent. This is not the only time he did this format of put like, let's just put a big percentage

1207
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:51,520
sign, but put the amount smaller, the social media, it's all so, and then what does Garfield

1208
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:55,600
have to do with it? And then often Garfield is saying stuff that's not in the voice. It's just

1209
01:45:55,600 --> 01:46:03,440
kind of flat. Do not wake me. It is a Monday. It's not like there's kind of a like foreign lost in

1210
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:11,680
translation nature to it. I, uh, it's all confounding. And then the, and then also on the topic of,

1211
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:17,680
I mean, I'm still obsessed with like, right. Here's a boy. Here's a bunch of like blank orange space

1212
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:25,920
by 90 pause to unlock this coupon. Got it. Okay. For a pumpkin Garfacino. So you bought,

1213
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:33,120
remember you buy pause, but you unlock goop. You cannot buy a coupon. A coupon is to help you buy

1214
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:40,640
for less. It's, I love it. It's so confusing. So much to learn. I, this is, uh, you know,

1215
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:45,280
okay. I don't know. Uh, tell me when you guys, I think I'm out of my grab bag, at least for right

1216
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:52,320
now. I am too, except for, uh, well, does anyone, because what we have, what we haven't talked about

1217
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:57,280
is like the biggest piece of video content that there is. Sure. Sure. Is there any more? Is there

1218
01:46:57,280 --> 01:47:03,840
anyone got anything left in their grab bag? Uh, I've got his post Garfield eats. We'll get to those.

1219
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:09,520
I just, I want to wrap the whole thing up with a little proposal that we've sort of talked about

1220
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:14,880
before, but this is, this has inspired me in a way. This is, I think I've thrown this out as a

1221
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:20,160
phony idea before on the show, but I think really I want to get it going now. And this has inspired

1222
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:25,920
me to do it and start investigating. So I want to throw that at the end. Um, okay. Well, um, I don't

1223
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:33,040
know if that idea is to start our own reality show because that is what Nathan Masri did. Uh, this is

1224
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:38,960
available in full on YouTube, his show, love me, feed me, don't leave me. If you can imagine the

1225
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:45,280
show. Um, this has a little fakey the way every reality show, Nathan Masri was the youngest,

1226
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:50,960
a bunch of the shit we've said, he sold his own ad agency at 24. Well, when did he start it? We

1227
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:57,760
went straight to selling it. And then, uh, a probable lie from earlier became a deeper lie

1228
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:05,120
now in transit because he says he even went to Hollywood and studied acting alongside Ryan

1229
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:11,120
Gosling. That was just his teacher. When did it become, wait, weren't you in Hollywood in 2015?

1230
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:18,320
Did Ryan Gosling go back for refreshers? Eddie not been in Oscar caliber films by that point. Um,

1231
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:23,680
so anyway, I don't mean this fucking show. I was interested in this for three minutes and then

1232
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:30,240
they just boy did it. It's just the fakest. It's like re it's, it's all that reality show,

1233
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:35,840
hijinq music like don't don't don't don't don't don't don't. There is a problem in the store.

1234
01:48:37,120 --> 01:48:45,280
And then while he navigates like fake problems, uh, like the, the tablets are off really,

1235
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:52,800
really. And he, what's the worst about this is that he's incredibly unlikeable in it in sort of a,

1236
01:48:53,360 --> 01:49:01,440
uh, Gervais Michael Scott kind of way, but he also knows it. Like he's, he's, you can tell he's

1237
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:07,040
trying to be the irritating boss and that makes it worse. If you just like actually were able to

1238
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:12,880
document this guy and see the horror show, but then he'd like him like playing this like

1239
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:18,480
cheeky character of a mean crazy boss. Like I'm playing about paying people minimum wage. It's

1240
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:24,000
like really, yeah, it's really hard to piece it out. It's like hard to figure out.

1241
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:29,280
I guess what put upon workers who do nothing but answer questions about store confusion.

1242
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:37,120
Now you get to be in a reality show too. Um, I, and this is in this, you get a really good

1243
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:43,040
look at the face. I think we've maybe underplayed the orange-ness. It's so weird. And the beard is

1244
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:49,120
so bizarre. It looks like if like a, if a woman is playing a male character in an SNL sketch

1245
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:54,720
and they have to like quick change, like peel a beard onto them. Um, but it doesn't, it doesn't

1246
01:49:54,720 --> 01:50:00,080
resemble the texture of a real beard or the color of one. It's that like game. It's I've seen this

1247
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:04,080
before about people. It's that remember that, like, that like thing where you have a magnet and it

1248
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:08,880
would, there was like a person. Thank you. Willy, Willy. It was the thing where you would like make

1249
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:14,640
hairstyles or a beard style for the head. And it looks kind of like that. And it looks like when,

1250
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:19,760
you know, someone in their sixties is up on the stage playing rock and roll and they got jet black

1251
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:25,680
hair and they got a jet black beard and everyone in the Ringo all start, yeah, Ringo included,

1252
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:30,000
Ringo included. You're like, that doesn't look quite, I don't think that's the natural stage

1253
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:35,520
make as long as it looks good from the back row. Fine. But then there's like windows where you

1254
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:41,520
could see what his real skin color looks like, which is a normal, not unappealing color. Like

1255
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:47,200
why would he choose the orange over just a red, but then he left some of it. God, it's strange.

1256
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:54,480
Powerful. Like Mr. Trump. He even took, is that why was he like, I have to be a weird orange man?

1257
01:50:54,480 --> 01:51:00,000
Probably it's orange is the thing, the color that ties this all together. Yeah. Yeah. But also

1258
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:06,480
stay home. We're all in this together. He, is there anything else about this? I mean,

1259
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:11,760
I mainly the show, the show gives you a good look at what it was like to be in the lobby where you

1260
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:18,800
can't eat. And my main takeaway is there's just a lot of loose wires. The TVs that are playing

1261
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:26,880
old Garfield and friends just have like unpleasant computer wires dangling around. It's just also

1262
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:32,080
true of the hologram theater. That was my memory of Alkydade. It's all so many loose wires.

1263
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:40,000
Just immediately does not inspire confidence in biz. Like if you got some Velcro ties or you got

1264
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:45,920
those plastic tubes to cover wires, like it's amazing the little tricks that you can do to fool

1265
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:51,040
people that like, Oh, this is nicer than things. It's like when you buy the paint, get a sample

1266
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:56,800
size and keep a brush like in a closet. And then if someone, you know, dings the wall,

1267
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:03,360
you have some to do touch-ups like, or your, your face or your, which was chosen from a Pantene

1268
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:15,840
gallery. Anyway, okay. What's left? The, we talked about the book a little Jeff Cole,

1269
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:23,840
he's dodgy about his age. His age changes all the time. I mean, I'm sort of heading

1270
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:27,840
for the end a little bit. Okay. Oh, here we go. All right. So let's, let's take you through the

1271
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:33,520
downfall. Jason, you covered the main thing, which is the COVID skepticism, which is very disturbing,

1272
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:39,040
but along the way, you know, we all know how many landmines there were in all of 2020, even before

1273
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:44,800
the pandemic. And he stepped right in one, one of the great pre COVID tragedies, which is the death

1274
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:52,880
of Kobe Bryant. You know, when you've opened a Garfield enter gauging quick mobile restaurant,

1275
01:52:52,880 --> 01:53:00,160
you have to address the death of the Los Angeles sports hero with a post that ties it together

1276
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:08,880
because in 2016 he won a kid's choice award. So thus he's holding an orange lamp. And the tone of

1277
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:14,720
this post is like, well, I have to look as an official licensee of at Nickelodeon, the staff

1278
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:19,360
and I at Garfield, the, it's are equally and deeply saddened by the death of Kobe Bryant. Like,

1279
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:25,920
so only because he won a Nickelodeon award and you're technically in the umbrella of Nickelodeon.

1280
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:34,320
And then it keeps going. Like the legend gone too soon. Hashtag dies. Hashtag children. Hashtag light.

1281
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:40,640
Fuck you don't do this. It's crazy. Why are you talking about Kobe's death? The hashtags,

1282
01:53:40,640 --> 01:53:47,840
every step of the way, the hashtags are wrong and unnerving. They never stop. What? Like who didn't

1283
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:55,280
figure out many years ago that hashtags do not get you anything. I think no one looks for hashtags.

1284
01:53:55,280 --> 01:54:02,000
The end of 2009, start of 2010, everyone was like, okay, now if you put a hashtag, that's a joke.

1285
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:08,240
Like that is, it's no longer useful. Although I've noticed this, it even fucks up your,

1286
01:54:08,240 --> 01:54:13,520
like your joke will have less reach because of the hash. The hashtags are like, what's the thing that

1287
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:20,480
the conservatives think happened to their tweets? It's kind of like the hashtags actually limit the

1288
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:26,240
reach of your thing. Right. I meant more in a figurative sense. Yes. Yeah. Yes. And as an actual

1289
01:54:26,240 --> 01:54:33,360
joke tenant, it can get really weird. And I don't know, trending topics are just insane. Now the

1290
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:38,160
stuff like Twitter thinks you want to say. Absolutely. Yeah. So don't, why is he still

1291
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:44,720
doing this in 2020? I don't know. So he, he thinks there's no pandemic. He's posting somewhere. I also

1292
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:51,680
like the really blunt stay inside because it is gas. So this is the first foot he's put forward

1293
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:57,120
in terms of the pandemic, which is sure to wreck his business, regardless of the business being

1294
01:54:57,120 --> 01:55:03,840
bizarre. So people, there's enough feedback like, Hey, that's weird. Don't do that. So now he has to

1295
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:11,360
kiss everyone's ass about and be kind with the pandemic and post things like Garfield in a

1296
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:17,280
superhero Cape. Gar cartoons are always immune. Tell us what cartoon you want to be today.

1297
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:22,800
And then Garfield says everyone wants to be me. And then in his caption, he says,

1298
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:27,120
tell us who you want to be, preferably a Nickelodeon cartoon or from Garfield and friends.

1299
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:34,000
I wouldn't be Tommy Pickles primarily because he is apparently immune from COVID-19.

1300
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:39,440
That that's what I, the cartoon character I want to be. Cause he's a baby. Why is he immune?

1301
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:42,560
He had said all cartoons are immune. Oh, all tart. Oh, good. Cause if you're both,

1302
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:47,440
yes, call cartoons are always immune. Hey, I, well, I guess it'd be anyone. Anyone.

1303
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:54,000
It'd be any. Oh yeah. No, don't say that. That's harassment to say bugs, but don't put that on

1304
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:59,520
Nathan. There's a guy outside with a broken pipe, swinging a chain around. He was a big bugs bunny

1305
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:05,920
fan. I saw your post. It should only, only answer should be bugs bunny. I will threaten your business.

1306
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:13,120
The warriors are coming after him. The baseball furies are mad. All dressed in

1307
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:20,400
robe, gray and white fur. Um, then he has to spin it around. He went from in a week,

1308
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:26,560
he went from hoax to I need to help the healthcare community and I need to do this with the Liz cares

1309
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:34,480
program. Now Liz, we all know this. Liz is a nurse who John Arbuckle wants to ask out. Of course.

1310
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:43,280
But he's, uh, scared to. So the Liz cares program, her shadow shows that she has a superhero. Uh,

1311
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:48,320
she is a course, not all superheroes wear capes, but they all do in their shadow. Right. Um,

1312
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:57,520
so Liz and any doctor could from now on get 50 to 75% discounts. Uh, all healthcare professionals

1313
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:02,560
get free Garficinos thanks to this pandemic. That's one of that's even better than everyone

1314
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:07,280
banging on the trash cans to say thank you doctors. Free Garficinos. I don't know if that,

1315
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:12,960
how long that program went. It says permanent, um, 50% off all food items and even special

1316
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:21,200
Garfield and Liz merchandise nurses, doctors. We know this has been difficult. So 50% off Liz,

1317
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:28,400
Liz tall doll, unique pairing. You don't often see Garfield and Liz. Liz is like the 15th most

1318
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:34,080
popular Garfield character. Yeah. I would love to see like a storyline with Liz and Arlene

1319
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:39,120
commiserate. Sure. Garfield's girlfriend Arlene. Oh yeah. Yeah. You didn't know that. I didn't know

1320
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:44,480
Arlene. I guess I don't know Garfield very well. Arlene's pink. Do you know when she got big

1321
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:48,720
eyelashes? Okay. She's kind of got a long neck. Do you think we're going to get a gripe about,

1322
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:53,280
just be sure everything you say about Garfield. Maybe. I mean, if you look up Arlene Garfield,

1323
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:59,840
will you recognize her? I'm wondering. Have I ever seen Arlene Garfield? I mean,

1324
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:05,200
I don't recognize her right now because there was never a food item named after Arlene. Oh yeah.

1325
01:58:05,200 --> 01:58:11,920
Pink eyelashes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Kind of creepy. Yeah. Well, I would say, all right from that,

1326
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:18,240
sorry, that color of pink and the long neck, the long neck. I know what you're going with.

1327
01:58:18,240 --> 01:58:25,280
Giant head. Yeah. I come, how could you not? Arlene is a little bit suggestive looking.

1328
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:29,840
Foul. She looks like a foul. Yeah. I designed Arlene. Oh, the plushes are, oh, I do not like

1329
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:37,200
the look of Arlene. I designed Arlene to be foul-like for a reason. Arlene, we're excited

1330
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:44,960
to welcome Arlene Brand Sex Toys into the Garfield family. I couldn't be more thrilled about it. Use

1331
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:53,280
it anywhere in your bedroom, at a restaurant. So, but this isn't enough. Clearly, because

1332
01:58:53,280 --> 01:59:00,400
immediately in the comments, somebody says, Liz can't defeat 5G sarin gas though. No. So too late.

1333
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:07,360
He put his pandemic feelings out there a little too early. Land Monster comes in and hurts the

1334
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:14,000
business. Eventually Viacom strips him of the license. We're cleaning house, like Star Wars,

1335
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:20,480
kicking stuff out of Cannon. Garfield eats no longer part of Cannon. And on right before Christmas,

1336
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:26,560
he was stripped of this in an already tough year. He is stripped of his Garfield title

1337
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:36,160
right before Christmas. Those bastards, he said. And that's tough. He did kind of a eulogy tour.

1338
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:42,480
He made some videos saying what's next for him, reaching out to the many fans, which he had to do.

1339
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:50,240
There were so many, tens of people, most of whom were looking at this ironically, waiting to know

1340
01:59:50,240 --> 01:59:53,520
what's Nathan's next move. I gotta say, the two part farewell video.

1341
01:59:55,440 --> 02:00:04,240
First off, I watched them both. The part one ends definitively. And then part two starts,

1342
02:00:04,240 --> 02:00:10,720
and he's talking about other stuff. It's weird. It's already. You'd think it would just continue,

1343
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:14,480
but it doesn't. He's on to the next thing. I'm sure there's a quote attributed to him about how

1344
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:20,640
you gotta move on quickly. No way. I'm gonna read you one as soon as we reveal the next business.

1345
02:00:22,240 --> 02:00:26,880
The thing in the video that stuck out to me is that he used the word destiny. And I was not the

1346
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:32,320
only one to clock that because other journalists who talked to him was like, he said destiny a lot.

1347
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:42,720
Yeah, weird. Garfield the cat is his destiny. Being a part of Paws Inc. is his destiny.

1348
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:49,280
He did a zoom saying goodbye to all the fat, like you could get on and talk to him and which people

1349
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:56,080
did. He said, boy, this is maybe where the Jim Davis thing gets the heaviest. He says,

1350
02:00:56,160 --> 02:01:03,040
Jim Davis told me take care of the cat and the cat will take care of you. And that is what happened.

1351
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:10,000
And look, it's all I have. I'm not married. I don't have a kid. This is what I have is Garfield eats

1352
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:17,920
and the cat and Viacom has taken that away. Oh my God, my God, how miserable you have the gym and

1353
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:24,400
Jim Davis is sage. I mean, that's, that's a nice moral, but it probably only applies to Garfield.

1354
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:37,600
So kind of a sad little Peter out of this business and Nathan Masri had no choice but to

1355
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:44,080
think about what had happened, collect his thoughts, maybe learn from the errors of his

1356
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:51,600
ways and next time try to start a more coherent business plan that is more guaranteed to have

1357
02:01:51,600 --> 02:02:00,160
success. That is not true. He started Scooby Doo eats. Next one. Next one up. The thing I just said

1358
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:06,560
to you, Mike, the, Oh God, where is, Oh yeah, here I am. And then just immediately Instagram posts,

1359
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:17,520
me and Scooby done with the cat. It's time for the dog. It's so funny. That was my Bible done.

1360
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:25,600
I'm about dog now. I have found a new God. Oh my gosh. It has got backwards. So funny.

1361
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:30,960
Just instantly. And look, I know it's just all the same shit, except he didn't even bother with the

1362
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:37,680
restaurant this time. Now it's frozen food, which Instagram posts allegedly affirm that they were on

1363
02:02:37,680 --> 02:02:43,680
the shelves at some places, but did he just sneak them onto shelves, take a picture and then smuggle

1364
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:50,000
them out? I don't know. Entirely possible. Oh, things on the table. Uh, no more orange suit. Hello,

1365
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:56,480
Brown Scoot suit, Scooby suit. He's wearing a scoot now. He didn't say scoot. He should as the

1366
02:02:56,480 --> 02:03:06,480
one phrase he missed. Um, he'd say things like, thanks for staying Brown. No, no, no. He posted

1367
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:11,440
it. This law. Did you guys watch this like endless video? I can't even make it through of the launch

1368
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:17,360
of Scooby Doo. I didn't watch that. I didn't. This was, I needed a lot of breaks. Yeah. From

1369
02:03:17,360 --> 02:03:22,560
this. Um, well we're going to come back to this in general as a topic. So we'll have another chance.

1370
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:28,480
I think, I mean, I do have a little more, which is that, um, remember that post that you showed

1371
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:34,560
Mike where it's his hand, the iconic hand of Nathan Mazury shaking hands with Garfield? Well,

1372
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:43,440
the hand business kept going. Here is one where, um, the, the caption is need a hot dog for your

1373
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:50,640
sandwich and his hand. I'm sorry. Okay. Let me go backwards. Scooby is holding up a hot dog, Frank,

1374
02:03:50,640 --> 02:03:56,720
and Nathan's hand is holding an empty hot dog bun. And if we were to take the caption literally,

1375
02:03:56,720 --> 02:04:03,920
he is saying that an empty hot dog bun qualifies as a sandwich. You're right. Yes. I disagree

1376
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:09,360
with this definition. Let's ask our expert Jason. Just a hot dog bun. Is it a sandwich?

1377
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:15,360
Well, just the bun. That's what's being illustrated here. Need a hot dog for your

1378
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:19,520
sandwich. And you're holding this and that is, that qualifies as a sandwich. You know, this is

1379
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:26,160
a long running internet argument is a hot dog, a sandwich, right? Um, I don't offhand, but I don't,

1380
02:04:26,160 --> 02:04:31,120
but that's a, and that's interesting. I would, I would say no, but maybe in the like the kind of

1381
02:04:31,120 --> 02:04:38,880
like early 1900s definition. So, but this is proposing that a hot dog is a sandwich before

1382
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:46,640
there's beef in it and no condiments. No, it's not. It's not. I don't know. Yeah. This is like,

1383
02:04:46,640 --> 02:04:53,360
I'll answer for Jason. No, it's not. This feels like the close encounters aliens are playing

1384
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:59,840
tunes at me. And I, I'm like, why, why are they showing music? And it's like, no, no, no,

1385
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:06,480
they're communicating. You don't understand play it, play this frequency. It's like, oh no,

1386
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:12,480
it's speech. It's their speech. You've talked about coupons and inter gauge for, uh, and, uh,

1387
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:19,040
and, and Tolios is Arab, Arab here making a mountain of mashed potatoes. Like Richard dry

1388
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:23,840
fits at this point. Now we're like, why are people yelling at me? Is a hot dog a sandwich

1389
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:29,440
without a hot dog in it? I don't, I know it's just a piece of bread. This is insane. What are you

1390
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:36,880
talking about? A sandwich. Um, and yet not the most insane piece of social media for Scooby

1391
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:42,000
Doo eats. I have to give that one to this. Oh, I have to brace myself before reading this one,

1392
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:51,840
purple background with flame at the bottom orange flame. And it says Netflix and dogs grass fed

1393
02:05:51,840 --> 02:06:00,720
hot dog is the date that won't hurt you. I, let's just all, so maybe we all need to lie on the

1394
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:07,680
ground. Just kind of process this. I'll take a nap, whatever it takes this whole endeavor. I,

1395
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:12,960
I wrote this down pretty early when I was coming through this. It feels like when you trans you

1396
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:18,480
use Google translate and you type a sentence into English and then you translate it into

1397
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:25,760
French or Spanish. And then you take that sentence and translate it back into English and everything's

1398
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:32,560
just a little wonky. Yeah. Cause it's just a pure literal. Yeah. And that that's what this all the

1399
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:37,440
whole endeavor feels like. Extreme. I mean that that's just, it is the Bay like the room. It's

1400
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:43,680
the basis of like, you know, I mean, these are all English speakers we're dealing with. However,

1401
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:49,360
like there's something in, I mean, there's something is not correct, but bad. Even if you would grant

1402
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:55,280
someone that, okay, maybe English is your second language. That doesn't feel like what this is.

1403
02:06:55,280 --> 02:07:01,360
No, because also something sinister entered in. This is one of the most sinister statements I've

1404
02:07:01,360 --> 02:07:07,680
ever seen. Grass fed hot dog is the date that won't hurt you. The date all other dates hurt you.

1405
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:16,640
Hot dog singular one word. Why is it grass fed a grant about the hot dog itself is grass fed

1406
02:07:18,160 --> 02:07:23,440
the hot dog ate grass. The three different animals that a hot dog is all three of them were grass

1407
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:31,120
fed. They all the pay the animals that formed the paste all were fed with grass. And the filler that

1408
02:07:31,120 --> 02:07:38,240
fills out this hot dog also grass is grass. It literally is grass. The more grass the guaranteed

1409
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:46,240
it is it won't hurt you. Netflix and dogs. Not a verb. It doesn't work even as a spin on Netflix

1410
02:07:46,240 --> 02:07:52,720
and chill. My body is liquefying. I know. His spine is wobbly. I'm about to keel over. I know. So we

1411
02:07:52,720 --> 02:07:59,760
need to let's we'll start heading for the door, but I feel like something big is missing. Oh, well,

1412
02:08:00,640 --> 02:08:05,760
you know, if you have a good idea, you might make a company, you might make a startup,

1413
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:13,280
but have you considered working with Nathan and making a try up a try up? Yeah, you see,

1414
02:08:13,280 --> 02:08:19,440
he started a new company that they don't build startups. They build enter gauging try ups,

1415
02:08:20,160 --> 02:08:27,120
not startups, not startups, try ups, a little robot in it. Try ups. What's that?

1416
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:35,600
I don't quite understand it. It's basically startups, but I think they cover some more of

1417
02:08:35,600 --> 02:08:41,200
the upfront costs or they're really speaking and I want to start babbling. Yeah, I've lost. He's

1418
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:45,760
robbed me of my ability to speak English, but I think the thing that stuck out to me in this image

1419
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:51,360
is, oh, he took enter gauging with him. Yeah. Yeah. Cause he says he doesn't know that the blizzard

1420
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:58,880
or whatever that he says in that video. Yeah. Oh, oh, well also because this has been the struggle

1421
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:04,000
with him is like, what do I do now? I told you he was so tearfully like I've been stripped of

1422
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:09,040
Garfield and it's my identity and Jim Davis is my godfather. So what can I take? And you're

1423
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:15,760
enter gauging is one of them, but he, nobody ever took the social media Garfield needs brand or

1424
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:21,840
whatever on Twitter or Instagram still going. And so what you end up with, and this continues to

1425
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:28,080
this day, a lot of confusing back and forth where the only account engaging with Garfield, enter

1426
02:09:28,080 --> 02:09:33,920
gauging with Garfield apps is Nathan Masri. So they, they like ping back and forth. Like when I'm

1427
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:39,520
doing any Craig Healy view, boo posting, I'm just switching between accounts. Spoiler. And so he's

1428
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:44,720
doing the same thing, but for real, uh, like he needs this to work. So, okay, now I sign in to get

1429
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:48,640
and, but what does he do with Garfield needs? Cause he's not selling food anymore. Well,

1430
02:09:48,640 --> 02:09:56,720
he creates weird scandals and this is one that, uh, Jeff Cole told us about, um, this is a situation

1431
02:09:56,720 --> 02:10:08,560
called staple gate. Yes. Yes. Staple gate, hashtag staple gate. Uh, basically he allegedly went to

1432
02:10:09,120 --> 02:10:16,480
A and W the fast food chain. Well, we'll circle back to that. Yeah. Yeah. Never. It's never just

1433
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:24,480
a thing. Um, he went to A and W and found a staple like in his bun or in the burger or something,

1434
02:10:24,480 --> 02:10:30,720
a loose staple, which he attributes to like, that must've been part of the packaging that, uh,

1435
02:10:30,720 --> 02:10:37,840
surrounding the food. So, and, and somebody wasn't careful and ended up in the food. And he is

1436
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:44,480
furious. He is like, it goes from, I found a staple to, uh, never would have happened with me.

1437
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:49,200
We had a rest also very Trumpy extremely never would have. You never would have found a staple

1438
02:10:49,200 --> 02:10:54,080
and then it gets really extreme. So what course of action should I take at A and W

1439
02:10:54,080 --> 02:11:03,360
Canada? You almost bled me to death. Hashtag blood. You tried to kill me, but I'm crawling back.

1440
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:09,440
Damn it. You're a stable. You can't defeat me. What were you going to say though? Well, wasn't

1441
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:16,480
there, uh, uh, an epilogue to that was it was actually Wendy's, but he, it was a Wendy's burger,

1442
02:11:16,480 --> 02:11:25,040
but he tagged A and W wrongly accused. That was incorrect. And then shortly there, after all this

1443
02:11:25,120 --> 02:11:33,440
happened, he tried to start a nonprofit or a business about food safety, like really quickly

1444
02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:39,760
after that. Yeah. The next day he's tying it into something called clean label product.org. That's

1445
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:46,000
about like, don't put dangerous stuff in food packaging. So yeah, oddly suspiciously it went

1446
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:53,120
from like this staple gave almost gave me blood to this is part of my brand. Now I'm an anti-staple

1447
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:57,920
swallower. I'm an anti-staple swallowing advocate. And that's what I do. It's kind of similar. Isn't

1448
02:11:57,920 --> 02:12:03,120
there a similar to a scene in the Jennifer Love Hewitt movie Heartbreakers where they put something

1449
02:12:03,120 --> 02:12:07,360
in the soup. They put something in as a scam. They pull, they pull, put something in the soup. I

1450
02:12:07,360 --> 02:12:13,280
believe I haven't seen them moving in a few years. Uh, so maybe when it was just when he was going

1451
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:18,240
through the filmography of miss love Hewitt, it's very strange, but that's just, look, it's not how

1452
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:23,600
it works. It's not like you can just go viral by like, I don't know, finding a shrimp in your

1453
02:12:23,600 --> 02:12:30,240
cinnamon toast crunch. It's not the record scratch. That's not how it works. There's nothing to be

1454
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:35,120
gained from something like that. So you said reminded me of a thing that really stuck out to

1455
02:12:35,120 --> 02:12:39,760
me in the farewell video. And I think it's that he held up a book at one point he went, we had an

1456
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:47,440
operations manual and that's just so the, the excitement of that is just so funny to me because

1457
02:12:47,440 --> 02:12:53,280
it's like, it feels like a, like a small business person being like, we gave customers receipts.

1458
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:59,760
Come on. Like, yeah, you, you should have an operations, but you're a business basic. Yes.

1459
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:04,960
Yeah. Well, that's where if we could tie it to the philosophy, love me, feed me, don't leave me.

1460
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:09,920
That is that like, as much as you want to say, well, this guy's like a self-made, he's just so

1461
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:16,880
sure of himself for a narcissist and he, uh, and the sheer bravado got him where he is

1462
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:22,240
that don't leave me thing is really like the, because that's the tone of the, of the book

1463
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:29,200
and hot Oprah. And I had the manual and Jim Davis and I love him and this is all I have.

1464
02:13:29,200 --> 02:13:34,400
There's also just this uncomfortable level of emotion that requires a lot of investment for

1465
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:41,120
like a funny Garfield restaurant that like, why do we know that? Why did it? Why did any listeners

1466
02:13:41,120 --> 02:13:45,680
know about this? Why did anyone on the, why have we talked about it for so long? None of this should

1467
02:13:45,680 --> 02:13:53,280
have hit us. A real business would not have the owner going like the manual. It's so unprofessional.

1468
02:13:57,920 --> 02:14:01,680
Yeah. Too much information for us to know about.

1469
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:07,360
He's overtaken the narrative. The narrative should be, isn't it fun to eat a Garfield pizza?

1470
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:10,640
Yes. That's what the narrative should be. Everything we've ever talked about on the

1471
02:14:10,640 --> 02:14:16,400
show has had somebody like having a meltdown, but we don't know it because they pulled themselves

1472
02:14:16,400 --> 02:14:23,520
together and like, no, I'm my public persona must be strong. It can't be crying. Oh, Jim Davis.

1473
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:29,440
I remember, and it might still be out here. I'm sure it's come up in conversation. The

1474
02:14:30,240 --> 02:14:37,920
licensed burger chain, she burger, she burger in Chicago. Well, no, it was, there was one in

1475
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:44,560
Ocean City, New Jersey. There was one in Delaware. Like, so, so they, they licensed this and it was

1476
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:52,400
just a pretty standard, like burgers and milkshakes kind of like lunch counter sort of thing. And if

1477
02:14:52,400 --> 02:15:02,400
you didn't remember the very old SNL character, she burger, she burger, Pepsi, like some might say

1478
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:08,640
did not necessarily translate past the original. Maybe that's right. And so all the parents,

1479
02:15:08,640 --> 02:15:12,720
like I remember my parent being like, oh, it was SNL. And the only reason you knew it was

1480
02:15:13,280 --> 02:15:19,840
an SNL sketch was there were some framed photos from SNL of those characters on the wall.

1481
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:26,000
And like, uh, the burgers were fine. You didn't need to know this. You didn't need, if you just

1482
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:30,800
went in and you weren't paying attention, didn't see those things. It didn't really matter. The

1483
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:36,880
thing that probably made it stick out more was like every table had a little, you know, a card

1484
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:42,560
holder that had trivial pursuit cards in it to like, you know, do trivial while you wait for your

1485
02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:51,040
food. So you're saying they have created a brand that is tied to a pop culture item, whatever,

1486
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:57,040
a piece of content. Uh, but it's not, you can ignore that and still enjoy the experience as

1487
02:15:57,040 --> 02:16:03,520
opposed to Garfield deeds where it is essential that you love Garfield, you love Garfield to the

1488
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:10,240
point of tears and you, what's this an orange suit guy? I love him too. Garfield's new friend,

1489
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:17,200
Nathan Masary got it. I love him. You know, way he created Garfield. Nathan did. It's funny. It's

1490
02:16:17,200 --> 02:16:23,760
like, I've never seen that before. Where if you will, will something that it actually becomes true

1491
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:28,400
and that Nathan actually created Garfield and now I know that and I love it. And that's actually

1492
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:35,120
more important than having Garfield eats carrot juice this morning. That's actually supersedes

1493
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:42,560
just enjoying the juice. Yeah. I don't think most people want a giant story to tumble out of the,

1494
02:16:42,560 --> 02:16:48,400
the business that they're going to. It's just too much. Like most people are in a haze. Give me the

1495
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:53,040
thing. And if maybe if you stick around, you become a fan. It's like, Oh, I've actually met the guy. I

1496
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:58,720
know the story of the place because it's nice. Not like, okay, before you eat here's 15 minutes

1497
02:16:58,720 --> 02:17:06,400
of backstory. It's all very upsetting and weird and shady. I just think, you know, one thing that

1498
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:12,560
kind of jumps out at me is now that we've been talking about it, this is that, you know, think

1499
02:17:12,560 --> 02:17:21,280
about Tillman for Tita. Oh, I'd love to think about him. Yeah. Another, a guy from a few years ago

1500
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:28,400
on the podcast wrote a book where he's aggressive about owning businesses and stuff. Does he not own

1501
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:35,520
Bubba Gump? He does. Which is tied to a pop culture property, but you can go and enjoy your $25

1502
02:17:36,480 --> 02:17:42,800
of seven pieces of coconut shrimp, if you're lucky. And you don't need to know about Jenny and

1503
02:17:42,800 --> 02:17:49,280
Lieutenant Dan. Yeah. But I, I think by the time Tillman for Tita got around to writing a business

1504
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:55,120
guy self-help book, he had a restaurant corporation that had rain first cafe and Bubba Gump and

1505
02:17:55,120 --> 02:18:00,560
chart house and the golden nugget. And he owned the Houston Rockets. And it, people might think,

1506
02:18:00,560 --> 02:18:06,080
you know what, I kind of want to hear how this guy did it. I kind of get that. This was more the

1507
02:18:06,080 --> 02:18:11,920
cart coming before the horse was born. Uh, you know, like we are getting the business, we got his

1508
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:19,840
book, we got his memoir, like if he had done a little business, but no one knew him. There's

1509
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:23,920
so much like that where people, what Pete there, what some people want is the guys. Some people

1510
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:29,600
want to be calling action, action, and then dressing like a director and stomping around

1511
02:18:29,600 --> 02:18:34,240
and pointing at people and they don't actually care about making the stuff. Yes. There's so many

1512
02:18:34,240 --> 02:18:40,240
people who want the air. God, even, I mean, Trump is the most like hollow guy, but he didn't write

1513
02:18:40,240 --> 02:18:47,040
the book until he had like done a bunch of his shady stuff. Yeah. Do not to defend tree, you know,

1514
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:53,440
f**k it. Let's defend him. Yeah. Great club three. Finally it comes out. This deep of burrowing.

1515
02:18:53,440 --> 02:18:58,400
It feels so good to be honest. No, but it's just a real time that I, you know what the book, uh,

1516
02:18:59,440 --> 02:19:05,440
biologists, that was before Garfield eats. Yeah. He was reprinted with him in the orange suit,

1517
02:19:05,440 --> 02:19:11,040
but then he didn't, that was before he'd done any, he maybe, he maybe hadn't even been knighted yet

1518
02:19:11,040 --> 02:19:17,440
by the arrested Prince. Yeah. There's a, this happens a lot everywhere. It happens on low levels.

1519
02:19:17,440 --> 02:19:22,000
It happens with people, you know, in Hollywood or all of a sudden they're like, by the way,

1520
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:28,640
now I'm teaching a class on directing. You're like, wait a minute. Yeah, I'm teaching a class.

1521
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:35,200
You're like, wait a minute. I've just, you've just declared something. Well, the declaring never stops

1522
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:41,280
with this guy because here's something. Oh my God. This was this month, earlier this month. I

1523
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:46,800
didn't even realize, uh, what's Nathan up to now? Why he's working on the reality show,

1524
02:19:46,800 --> 02:19:53,920
Mary Nathan Masri. Finally. Oh my gosh. He is calling for contestants, uh, from, oh,

1525
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:58,640
could you possibly guess the name of his company? It's not his name. What else would it be?

1526
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:09,040
Word. He says a lot. Oh, and, and, and, and, uh, the casting real implement the blind date is real.

1527
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:14,480
The marriage is real. The Mar or marriage gift is real. What the fuck does that mean? Stop making

1528
02:20:14,480 --> 02:20:20,560
up words. This is pilot episode. Get ready to date. Nathan Masri and hashtag Toronto. Why do

1529
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:26,800
you have a hashtag on a casting website? Casting notices are not evaluated by hashtags and

1530
02:20:26,800 --> 02:20:32,800
popularity. What a threat. Get ready to date. Nathan Masri in Toronto venue. TBD most likely

1531
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:38,320
paradise theater. Oh yeah. I bet you think you're having problems with that. Uh, uh, real dates,

1532
02:20:38,320 --> 02:20:45,120
real people prize for winner non-paid. You don't say I don't get paid to date Nathan Masri.

1533
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:55,840
Scooby doo eats impressario. No money. What? No way you ever dreamed of dating big cow lasagna

1534
02:20:56,480 --> 02:21:05,680
propagator. Oh my God. It's Jesus. Okay. To get, I am tapped out now, Mike, what was your,

1535
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:10,720
what is your proposal? So I've said this a couple of times, sort of joking on the show before

1536
02:21:10,720 --> 02:21:16,560
and cause cause this whole licensing Jim Davis association is fascinating to me. I assume he

1537
02:21:16,560 --> 02:21:21,760
has money from the family. That's probably how he got involved with Jim Davis. And I've said this

1538
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:26,720
before and I think I'm going to finally send some emails out because wouldn't it be great if we

1539
02:21:26,720 --> 02:21:34,160
could officially license one of the King feature syndicate cartoon strips to do something, a pop

1540
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:40,160
up, a walkthrough experience. And when I say one of these, I mean the cheapest one we can find.

1541
02:21:40,160 --> 02:21:46,640
So like Mallard Fillmore ride it out. Funky Winker bean. Uh, like, uh, like there's ones that we

1542
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:51,840
haven't like, wouldn't it be great if we could officially do podcasts, the ride X Winker bean

1543
02:21:51,840 --> 02:21:58,560
or something like just something in the realm of possibility. We could talk to the, if the creator

1544
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:04,960
is still alive, if we could do an official in the spirit of Garfield eats, I don't know exactly what

1545
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:08,560
it is because we'd have to figure out what's in the contract, what we would be allowed to restaurants.

1546
02:22:08,560 --> 02:22:15,200
Restaurant seems hard, much harder, but like a walkthrough experience, a maze, a horn,

1547
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:23,040
something in this room, a groove blender, a groove blender, if you will. Uh, uh, I think this is worth

1548
02:22:23,040 --> 02:22:29,040
exploring and I think this is the time to light the fire and I will start exploring the cheapest

1549
02:22:30,320 --> 02:22:37,040
licensing deal we can make with an existing property, comic strip preferably. We should see

1550
02:22:37,040 --> 02:22:42,560
if that licensing convention that had, remember the licensing convention in Vegas happened. We

1551
02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:47,040
didn't find out till after and then I think we reached out to them and they were not interested

1552
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:51,200
in our bullshit. Uh, well, I don't know. Do we reach out to them? I don't know. I think we're

1553
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:57,360
trying to, or you know what? We might've saw it happen in 2019 said, we'll do it in 2020 and that

1554
02:22:57,360 --> 02:23:02,880
was not an option. I don't remember that, but it may have happened. I remember reaching out to designer

1555
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:09,040
con and they said no. Okay. That's a different thing though. There's a licensing expo in Las Vegas

1556
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:12,160
where like all of a sudden, say, you know, the couple of last couple of years, you see a lot of

1557
02:23:12,160 --> 02:23:16,640
golden girls merchandise all of a sudden popping up. Well, I don't know that this is how it happened,

1558
02:23:16,640 --> 02:23:21,680
but a lot of times what happens is people go to this licensing expo and somebody has the rights

1559
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:26,400
to make golden girl stuff and they're pushing the idea that you should license this for your

1560
02:23:26,400 --> 02:23:32,080
t-shirt company, for your toy company. And that's how oftentimes things like that happen. I don't

1561
02:23:32,080 --> 02:23:37,840
think, I think that's not, that's too much too high profile. Oh, well, you want to get a funky

1562
02:23:37,840 --> 02:23:44,080
Winker bean or something that like crankshaft, no one's talking about it. We want to like,

1563
02:23:44,080 --> 02:23:50,560
we want the company or the lawyers to go, here you go for 500 bucks. Don't you want, you know,

1564
02:23:50,560 --> 02:23:55,120
not to say let's not get involved with King Features Syndicate. However, don't you want

1565
02:23:56,160 --> 02:24:04,000
as little corporate association as possible? That is correct. So, so I think it's worth exploring

1566
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:08,240
at King Features, but yes, that might be too much red tape. We may have to go to a different

1567
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:13,600
company that owns even worse comic strips. I think so. Like who owns Love Is or the Lock Horse.

1568
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:18,800
Sure. The Lock, yes, exactly. So, so we're going to go through all, I'm going to go through all the

1569
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:23,600
comic strips. Yes. And fit all the different companies. Yes, exactly. There's some downtime

1570
02:24:23,600 --> 02:24:28,000
when you're holding a baby and you're nursing a baby or the baby's gassy. So I will be going to

1571
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:33,520
see who owns all of these things and finding at least something we've heard of that's the

1572
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:40,800
cheapest thing we can get. And then we can do an official branded licensed event of some, maybe

1573
02:24:40,800 --> 02:24:45,360
this will take a year, take two years. Yeah. But I think it's worth investigating. It would be a lot

1574
02:24:45,360 --> 02:24:50,400
of fun. Is it like, yeah, is it like a, it's an experience that you walk through or like a, it's,

1575
02:24:50,400 --> 02:24:54,880
can we like collaborate with a food truck and turn the food truck branded for one night only?

1576
02:24:54,880 --> 02:24:58,480
I think that's very possible. I think it's very possible. I don't know that any food truck is

1577
02:24:58,480 --> 02:25:03,200
going to be wanting, want you thinking that their food causes zits, but you know,

1578
02:25:04,480 --> 02:25:09,600
the teens might like that. Yeah, sure. Um, it's also was brought on because somebody posted a

1579
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:16,000
picture of the cereal that I ate when I was younger called morning funnies. Oh yeah. I vaguely remember

1580
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:23,440
that. Do you remember morning? Oh, no, I don't. It had a lot of different, it had the Dennis the Menace,

1581
02:25:23,440 --> 02:25:30,160
high and lowest family circus, and something called Marvin, which looks to be a baby with a

1582
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:37,280
full head of red hair and tiger, which is a comic strip. I kind of remember. And then it's also

1583
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:44,400
adding that now Popeye, now they've added Popeye, Hagar, Hagar, the horrible and funky Winker bean.

1584
02:25:44,400 --> 02:25:49,200
Wow. So it was a comic strip cereal that was, I think our King feature syndicates.

1585
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:56,720
I don't know whether the EC Seeger branded characters are owned by King feature syndicate

1586
02:25:56,720 --> 02:26:01,760
or if the cartoons are owned by one, the comics are owned by another. I've fallen into another,

1587
02:26:03,600 --> 02:26:07,680
syndicate. We, I know we want to stay away from syndicates. I'm a little worried about a syndicate

1588
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:12,720
roughing me up. That's fine. I'm looking for the funniest names I can find. I feel like it's crew

1589
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:17,040
because you keep saying funky Winker bean. And I think it's gotta be in that if the name isn't funny,

1590
02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:21,360
that's true. Then I don't think it's going to work. And I just clicked on a word I'd never seen

1591
02:26:21,360 --> 02:26:28,800
before called kudzu. Kudzu seems to be about it. Well, all I can see is a truck in it, but I think

1592
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:33,600
there's characters. Anyone heard of kudzu? I think I have heard of kudzu. Oh, it could use a guy.

1593
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:39,360
Nevermind. Kudzu was a 16 year old resident of bypass North Carolina. But the real star is

1594
02:26:39,360 --> 02:26:45,360
Reverend will be done. Oh yeah. Yeah. I've seen some of the characters are nasal T Lard bottom

1595
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:53,040
item may wombat, uh, veranda, Tadsworth, and, uh, and what somebody's just called NASCAR dad. Um,

1596
02:26:54,000 --> 02:27:00,000
cuds, nothing much has happened with they CBS made a pilot of kudzu, but that was in 1983.

1597
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:04,480
So I don't think it's too in demand. The creator of the strip was killed in a car crash

1598
02:27:04,480 --> 02:27:12,160
about 15 years ago and it hasn't ran in a strip since then. So I think that kudzu is not particularly

1599
02:27:12,160 --> 02:27:18,080
in demand and at least might be a starting one for if we want to, um, I mean, what else are,

1600
02:27:18,080 --> 02:27:24,320
you know, like, uh, put out some nasal T Lard bottom socks. Yeah, sure. And then, uh, or underwear

1601
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:30,800
seat covers is our cute way of saying underpants. We just throw this stuff up on our T public site.

1602
02:27:32,480 --> 02:27:37,600
It's mainly the logo of our show, but we also sell merchandise of kudzu character nasal T

1603
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:43,040
Lard bottom. And then like, we'll have like a narrative podcast with Jason playing nasal T

1604
02:27:43,040 --> 02:27:50,720
Lard bottom or something rich in IP hungry times, craven times. So maybe we can just get a blanket

1605
02:27:50,720 --> 02:27:55,520
license for like kudzu or something. This is how we learned that kudzu is like incredibly popular

1606
02:27:55,520 --> 02:28:00,960
in Hungary or very possible. So that's something that we'll investigate here. Um, and we'll have,

1607
02:28:00,960 --> 02:28:05,680
hopefully just have a breakdown of how much it would cost to blanket license some of this stuff.

1608
02:28:06,480 --> 02:28:12,400
Um, I think maybe another key component to success in this area. Uh, you know, look,

1609
02:28:12,400 --> 02:28:17,280
I'm looking at a picture of the cast of kudzu and some of them are just wearing like a white shirt,

1610
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:24,000
uh, or blue and that's nothing wrong with that. However, what did Nathan do? He bought finely

1611
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:30,560
tailored suits to a distinct color. So I think we need to find like a particular shade that you

1612
02:28:30,640 --> 02:28:38,080
would not usually see a suit of and, uh, so that we are like embodying nasal T Lard bottom.

1613
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:44,800
Maybe with nasal, I don't know, maybe he's not a little bit if it's, if we have snot green suits.

1614
02:28:44,800 --> 02:28:48,720
Okay. All right. But it has to be all three of us. So it's going to be a bigger investment than

1615
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:53,120
Nathan had to make. Right. Right. We all have to get a suit, but you spend money to make money.

1616
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:57,120
Exactly. We're going to make so much money off of whatever this is. I think that's right. This is a

1617
02:28:57,120 --> 02:29:03,280
big money making endeavor and I'm very excited to start the journey. Yeah. All right. Well,

1618
02:29:04,240 --> 02:29:10,400
so to do list kudzu, uh, I'm sorry, nasal T Lard bottom green suits, assuming that he has, uh,

1619
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:17,360
boogers sometimes. Uh, but mainly you got to look up universal, see if universal press syndicate

1620
02:29:17,360 --> 02:29:22,480
seems like a bunch of heavy. Okay. Sure. Sure. They might play ball with us knowing that they're just

1621
02:29:22,480 --> 02:29:27,120
letting kudzu money language. Right. Yes. It's, you know, look, there's, there's a lot of toy

1622
02:29:27,120 --> 02:29:32,000
companies, small toy companies are licensing, uh, um, and Popeyes a pretty big brand, but they're

1623
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:35,840
still licensing pretty more, pretty obscure stuff, which can't be big money makers for these

1624
02:29:35,840 --> 02:29:40,320
corporations. Yeah. I don't think so. A small run of toys. I mean, they may make some money,

1625
02:29:40,320 --> 02:29:46,480
but that gives me hope that we can, we can do something here. Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Uh,

1626
02:29:46,560 --> 02:29:53,840
and, and who wouldn't to live the dream that Nathan Masri, his year at the top seems like

1627
02:29:53,840 --> 02:30:02,320
it was a great sane, normal, happy, and we want to do it. We want to do it too. Kudzu eats kudzu.

1628
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:12,000
Which is just finding someone we know who can kind of make food. I don't know. Just make tater tots.

1629
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:16,240
They could be, look, it's, it could be from the store. I don't care. Mary worth eats

1630
02:30:18,240 --> 02:30:24,800
just whatever, whatever it is. Doesn't even have to be a restaurant. Yeah. That's kudzu to Bose's,

1631
02:30:24,800 --> 02:30:31,840
uh, famous, uh, toaster waffles. No, we made those from scratch for straight from the farm.

1632
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:34,240
Don't look to your left. Don't look at those piles of yellow,

1633
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:38,800
I go boxes. Don't look to your left. No waste, no waste. That's, you know what? You go use them for,

1634
02:30:38,800 --> 02:30:43,200
put tissues in them. That's up to you. You do something with them. That waste is not ours.

1635
02:30:44,240 --> 02:30:46,800
And then when we can't get the rights, we'll just do it anyway.

1636
02:30:49,120 --> 02:30:56,160
That's really, that's what guys do. That's the guy spirit. Just do it. Um, well, I think we've

1637
02:30:56,160 --> 02:31:01,520
come to the end. Boy, oh boy. Uh, you survived podcast, the ride. Thank you so much for

1638
02:31:01,520 --> 02:31:05,360
subscribing to club three. And this is for everybody, but especially in this case to

1639
02:31:05,360 --> 02:31:11,040

1640
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:16,960

1641
02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:23,520

1642
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:29,680
plans from Bob Iger, but maybe not yet. Spooky topics, please list them below poll coming soon.

1643
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:31,600
Thanks for listening. Goodbye.
