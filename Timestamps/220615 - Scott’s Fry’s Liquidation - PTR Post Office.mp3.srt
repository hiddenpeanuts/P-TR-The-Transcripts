00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm Scott Gardner.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What's up, Jason Sheridan.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hi.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Mike Carlson is adjusting levels.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hello, I was adjusting levels.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But he's back up to the mic.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You made it just in time.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's like a rock, it's like a Springsteen where like, you know, the chorus is coming

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
in, you're kind of across this, like, little Stephen's across the stage, but he's got to

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
kind of make it back.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's exactly like that.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Exactly.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It was as exciting as that.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Uh-huh.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You made it.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Our E Street Band-esque chemistry is apparent here as we head into a PTR post office episode.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We're going to take some of your questions here.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And this is a good day, I feel, to be doing it because I have recently been reminded of

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
the value of communication with the listeners, of the good that can come when you're in contact

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
with the listeners.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Do you guys notice anything different about the garage we're recording right now?

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes, I notice about three differences, one of which I almost like walked right into as

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I was entering.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Well, that will not always be in your way, but I wanted to pull it out, make sure you

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
saw it.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Do you want to just, you know, I'll go through them individually, but can you just say what

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
generally are we seeing here?

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It appears that there are pieces of the closed fries in the garage now.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I think I see three, there could be more.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That is correct.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The fries electronics store.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes, yeah.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We now are, we're getting closer to my dream of recording in a defunct fries electronics.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Longtime listeners know the full fries electronics saga.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I've had a passion for this brand that's had a rough time from the high highs of allowing

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
me to be an astronaut in a video in their Anaheim store for two days.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Probably just one, probably didn't use it after I left.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
To the low lows of the store disappearing entirely.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's been a crazy ride for fries electronics.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm so fond of the brand still and all of the fun theming that they do.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And thanks to listener Emmy, who has one of the great Twitter handles I've ever come across,

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
which is radscorpion69.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Whenever one of these new things pops up, there's a land grab for getting the cool names.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And she just walked right in and got radscorpion69, I assume without even a bidding war.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So kudos on landing that.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
She let me know on Twitter that there was a liquidation sale going on at the Burbank Fries.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It led me to a very cryptic website where I had to email a cryptic email address.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This was not a real open to the public, big...

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
By the time I did it, a couple emails were exchanged and I got somebody's phone number.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And then I popped over there and it was...

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I mean, everything was still super...

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Actually, it was oddly populated because they were filming a movie.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't know where, but the parking lot was being used for movie parking.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So I got waved in by somebody who made a gesture like, oh, you're part of the thing.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And I was like, you mean the fries sale?

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Of course. Oh, there was hundreds of people here, understandably.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But it was at that moment just me.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So it was like me and the guy who was from whatever liquidation firm was selling all of these things.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I think there was one group wrapping up the sale in front of me.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And they were buying like a bunch of stanchions, like line separators.

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
For a different... like a business maybe.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes. Yeah, yeah. And that's completely what everything was at this.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It was like, if you need magnet boards or a bunch of old adding machines,

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
or you can run your business off of 35-year-old printers, then grab them here.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And clearly the desire was, please come and spend hundreds of dollars on business functional items.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So when I walk in and go, I really like the theming of the...

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I really like that it's kind of this... all that 50s sci-fi.

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's kind of like Tim Burton's Burbank that it's paying tribute to.

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And I really like... so do you have any of that?

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Like the trains and the guys like, no, no.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The company... the fries people took all that.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I think that might be true across the brand that they just... anything super cool.

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Because if you don't know or don't recall the Burbank fries, it might have been the best one.

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's way up there in terms of... you guys went at some point.

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
A giant spider taking it over. Was it a spider or an ant?

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh wait, it was an ant. I think you're right. Very good. Yeah.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And not only that, but then mannequins of soldiers who know that they might be dead in the next minute, throwing bombs at the... yeah.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Terrorists' faces. Terror-stricken soldiers.

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
UFO. Yeah, like UFO attack stuff. Yeah, pretty crazy.

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It was a violent... so you were depicting the absolute climax of a film that might end up kind of disturbing.

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You will get... yeah, if you were in the film, you would want to get yourself in a thick fridge and make sure that that A-bomb didn't go off before you got in the fridge.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah. The kind of thing that happened in those movies that they're paying tribute to.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Or you might end up having to swing through the vines with...

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Well, a little later you would. Later you would swing through vines with monkeys.

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
An army of realistic monkeys. Yeah.

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So anyways, I was hoping to score something in that neck of the woods, like an alien tentacle or they had model trains everywhere.

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's what I was hoping for. But I walked in there and it was pretty functional.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
However, I'm very happy with the functional items that I ended up with.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:40,000
If I could take you through them, up above the door now, there's a sign with Charlie Chip, my mascot friend, who came out to greet me like I was having a birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:49,000
We did the Anaheim event. They made some 17-year-old put on a smelly old costume before he lost his job forever the next day.

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But it worked out for me. Anyway, this sign says, Team Knowledge Pledge.

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I will apply the principles of Team Knowledge every day to make Fry's a better place for our customers to shop and our associates to work.

97
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's a lot of... The other item that I found is similar. It's like employee break room motivational.

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah. Like the black background, the picture, and then the white text. Usually the white text is pretty short. This is kind of long.

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yeah, yeah. The other one, and this is my favorite. They had a set of three of these, but I didn't want to buy all of them.

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So I separated them from their brothers. And I got the one that called to me the most.

101
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The one that I felt a sense of urgency about buying because it says sense of urgency.

102
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And it's a... Then the white... It's the black, as you said, and then the white border photo is a cheetah, I think.

103
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And Mike, can I make you read it because you're close or Jason? I got a lot of glare on it.

104
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah, I think I can do it. Fry's is dedicated to giving fast service, fast is uppercase, fast service to all of our customers.

105
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You must do your very best to have a sense of urgency to complete your job responsibly as quickly and as accurately as possible to provide the highest level of customer service possible.

106
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Great. Catchy. A reason for it to be as long as it was and not the abbreviated length that Jason referred to.

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Gotta get the word possible in there twice. As possible.

108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah, possible doesn't need to be... Yeah, my editor brain was like, no, I don't think that's...

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yeah, very close within the same sentence. But yeah, not a sense of urgency to edit the copywriting, but providing a sense of urgency to the...

110
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And so I'm kind of hoping also that maybe it's motivational for us in this space, that we will feel a sense of urgency to, I don't know, I guess, keep not talking about rides as long as we can.

111
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Whatever it is you guys feel a sense of urgency about, I hope that the cheetah is inspiring to you in some way.

112
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah, it is inspiring me. I just have a quick question. When you were bidding, were you bidding against like, you know, like David Copperfield and different like John Stamos?

113
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Were there big celebrities trying to get these items as well?

114
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
There was a notable lack of celebrities and other people.

115
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Was there a notable lack of bidding?

116
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah, there was no bidding. There was just prices set. All pretty reasonable.

117
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The like the one, this Charlie Chip sign, I went and found behind some other bullshit and he just kind of made up the price on the spot, which was 10 bucks.

118
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Price is right for me. You know, I got away pretty easy on all of this.

119
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The where I had trouble was, and this was a disappointment. This was a loss for me, is that the first thing that I went to, and then when the guy said, go take a look around, I went way past where all of the items were, into the very dark store.

120
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
First I went into the completely darkened screening room.

121
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh wow.

122
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Because if you remember all of these threads, I was very fond of the screening rooms where you could walk into a fries and watch like a soccer game or 30 minutes of Jurassic Park.

123
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And then probably you wouldn't see anybody else. Pretty creepy to be in one of those pitch black.

124
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Oh yeah.

125
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
A little unsettling. If somebody had been there with some sort of like hidden prank show.

126
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh yeah.

127
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
If it had been set up to scare me, it would have been a huge mess for me.

128
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Pitch black, but you did have to sign the waiver saying they can touch you.

129
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Like whatever scare actors are in there.

130
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Charlie Chip.

131
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah.

132
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Charlie Chip.

133
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Okay. If it's him, I'll just try to hug him.

134
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Charlie Chip puts a burlap sack over his head.

135
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Charlie Chip and the Minotaur.

136
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Stars plane.

137
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Oh yeah, the rarely used fries Minotaur.

138
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You hear the opening credits of Contact.

139
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah, no, I made it out of there before any of that could happen.

140
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But then I also made it to the corner because one of the big features of this fries that I liked a lot was something called the Atomic Cafe.

141
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It was a cafe where it was kind of like a mini version of the Disney MGM Studios,

142
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
sci-fi, dine-in theater where they played all the, where you would, the same deal, you would sit in a car.

143
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You would eat in the car, yeah.

144
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah, yeah, eat in the car and watch old B-movie trailers.

145
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Like completely that, but within a store and you could get sandwiches and stuff there.

146
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's still there.

147
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The Disney thing?

148
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The Disney one.

149
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yes.

150
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That would be an episode.

151
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
We should do that.

152
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yeah, yeah.

153
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The, yes, the Atomic Cafe, when we were doing that episode, I went and I didn't really find any of the sandwiches that appealing.

154
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So I just got an iced coffee and a slice of lemon cake.

155
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Oh boy.

156
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And it was delicious.

157
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yeah.

158
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You're eating it just in a store?

159
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yeah.

160
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
This is like.

161
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
This is the kind of odd experience that online shopping world does not give us.

162
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You went and sat in a car for a while under the view of a giant ant.

163
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I mean, you can still get like a Pizza Hut in a Target once in a while, like here and there.

164
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That's true.

165
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
There's Starbucks in Target.

166
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I mean, I know this is more special because it's more unique.

167
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah, you know, not a lot of theming going on.

168
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That's the issue.

169
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
When we used to go shop at Venture, one of my favorite retail stores as a child, Venture.

170
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Oh yeah, so we're called Venture.

171
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You know, it would smell like stale popcorn because they were pumping popcorn out and I would beg to get an Icy every week.

172
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And it would not happen every week, but once in a while.

173
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But I swear we ate we ate a grilled cheese or two at Venture.

174
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Sure.

175
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Did a lot of targets have Ices and that's kind of coming back to me.

176
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Yeah, Target.

177
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
There's still targets with some sort of slush drink.

178
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
A snack bar.

179
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah.

180
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Hot dogs, popcorn, Ices were kind of the go to.

181
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Kmart used to have a big snack bar.

182
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh, totally.

183
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah.

184
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yeah, for sure.

185
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yes.

186
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Target, I guess.

187
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I feel like maybe Starbucks is replacing a lot of like the.

188
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah.

189
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Which doesn't feel as special as the Target specific cafe.

190
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Right.

191
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Who's running it?

192
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Because I sense that the Atomic Cafe and fries was run by other people than the.

193
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Like it's a little mini business within the business.

194
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You know what?

195
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I got a counterfeit $10 bill at the Target snack bar once when I bought a hot dog.

196
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Whoa.

197
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Right.

198
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's just like.

199
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Hot dog exchange.

200
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What was that?

201
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Which Target?

202
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The Burbank one.

203
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Really?

204
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Which has redone their snack bar Starbucks set up so many times.

205
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's sore.

206
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I feel like a lot of the Targets in the San Fernando Valley are just constantly redoing

207
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
themselves.

208
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah.

209
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Which I like.

210
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I kind of appreciate.

211
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yeah, I appreciate it.

212
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Was the $10 billed it and have a picture of the mascot spot dog on it and you didn't notice?

213
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
No, it's just the sort of thing where it's like I gave a 20 and got whatever $17 back

214
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and changed.

215
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Put it in my wallet.

216
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Tried to pay with the $10 bill to someone else.

217
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Built it and then did the marker on it and they're like, Hey, sorry, this is counterfeit.

218
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Whoa.

219
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I was like, what?

220
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
We've called the police and then you got arrested.

221
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And then I, the next time I was at the Target, I explained the situation.

222
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I was like, do you have a receipt from the snack bar?

223
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And I was like, I did not ask for a receipt for the hot dog.

224
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I fucked up.

225
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So you wouldn't tried to get so open for real dollars.

226
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
No.

227
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And I think I eventually gave it to the Bank of America.

228
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Like I looked up, what do you do with counterfeit money?

229
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And they're like, mail it to the FBI or just give it to your bank and say, I received this

230
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and they will turn it in because they want like, you know, they want samples, you know?

231
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Oh, like somebody what somebody's handiwork is like what their, their little signs and

232
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
the artistic flourishes might be.

233
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Not the story of me being scammed that I thought I would start telling today, but I will tell you.

234
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Oh, yes.

235
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You have another one.

236
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
We got a scam.

237
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Well, let me hear.

238
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'll keep one instead.

239
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What I was getting at was that I went back to the Atomic Cafe.

240
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I was like, you know what I want is the signs for the smoothies because that's what I was

241
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
obsessed with an Emmy previously came to a live show and wonderfully gave me a magnet

242
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
for my favorite type of fries smoothie, which she took from a Sacramento area store.

243
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And that was for the smoothie called the Peach Boys.

244
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And that is on my fridge now.

245
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It will always be on my fridge.

246
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
There will come a point not too far from now that my son will be competing for spate, like

247
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
trying to get his drawings on the fridge and I'll be evaluating.

248
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Well, is it better than the Peach Boys?

249
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I don't know.

250
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Like, look, this spate, we don't have all the space in the world.

251
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So yeah, but he's gonna have to strive now for higher and higher highs in his art.

252
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
He's gonna have to have a sense of urgency.

253
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yes. And apply the principles of team knowledge every day to make cuter drawings.

254
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You should take this down and put it in his bedroom.

255
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
God, you're absolutely right.

256
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah, yeah.

257
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
He's yeah, you know, you guys are setting your ways here in your 30s.

258
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah, we my son's all life is ahead of him and he could be inspired by Charlie.

259
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I mean, you should have bought the full Charlie costume and just put it in the corner of his room.

260
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yeah, should reveal that his name is Charles Chip Gardner.

261
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But anyways, I tried to I was like, can I I am interested in something I would like to buy the Peach Boys magnet specifically off of this.

262
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And it was like somebody who spent a lot of money already wanted the board.

263
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And I was like, are you sure that they want the Peach Boys?

264
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Like, I'm not sure about that, but they spent a lot of money already and I at least owe them the all right shit.

265
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm not getting out of here with a second Peach Boys, but I turned and what should I find?

266
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But the crown jewel of this entire thing to me, the sign for the Atomic Cafe.

267
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Wow.

268
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
With the hours Cafe hours, 311 a.m. to 3 p.m.

269
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It is an overhead shot of, as I described this fake sci fi dine in theater with the call with the open air cars.

270
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And if you look closely, they set up a little scene.

271
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
They got they got extras to wear like poodle skirts and pink lady jackets.

272
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
They set up the ideal what the I thought the fifties immersive experience that the Atomic Cafe could be.

273
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And that's in my garage.

274
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's made me so happy to drive in and see every time I was so excited to show you guys today and try to not refer to it.

275
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So we started recording the site.

276
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It took me like a couple like I'm setting up.

277
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm looking at it and I'm like, what?

278
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Like it really I could feel the moves in my brain figuring out what it was again.

279
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And then I'd referred to like I got a little look at a week to talk about it.

280
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And then the office is the sign broke.

281
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Is it falling over?

282
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah, well, the guy told me if you just you know, you could just you could screw it.

283
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I don't think that's beyond salvageable.

284
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Yeah, that's it's not only the sign, but in a little like blue, you know, stand up, you know, I put it in front of my house and people would think it was a cafe.

285
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Right. And this so there's screws on the bottom.

286
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's not just like bonded to the base.

287
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
No, no, no, I think I could tighten that up.

288
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That could be standing. Yeah, I got a fiddle in the I finally have work to do on the workbench in the garage.

289
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
That's otherwise unused.

290
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Well, you have a welder's mask that you've had swung up the whole time.

291
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So I can tell you're eager for it.

292
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yeah, we got to wrap this up so I can get to work.

293
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I got hours to muscle to put into this atomic cafe sign.

294
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Congratulations. This is obviously these are the first three items on your way to like 20 years from now having your own.

295
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
That's from Fry's Electronics Sale, a showcase exhibition, hopefully.

296
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Oh, yes. Like the Richard Craft.

297
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

298
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Absolutely. And while the fries greats will be there, the fries family will come.

299
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
We'll come to a Q&A.

300
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Oh, and I forgot one. I'm wearing it.

301
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Zip. Whoa.

302
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I got a shirt and I forget even what it says.

303
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's like for their geek squad.

304
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah, fries now. Same day. Local delivery.

305
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Yeah, I don't even know that's a geek squad.

306
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I think that's just a delivery person.

307
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yeah. You know, the famous character, the red guy, the red delivery guy.

308
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
There were so many of these shirts.

309
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Some total of all the items I described. 60 bucks.

310
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Wow, really? Yeah, I made it out pretty great.

311
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And I also, you know, not only was this a great experience, it reminded me of how happy I am in the marriage that I'm in.

312
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Because knowing that I could come home, say that this is what I've been doing and look what I came back with.

313
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And she's like, oh, sweet.

314
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And not what have you done with your time and money.

315
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So thanks, Aaron, for your support.

316
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Thanks, Emmy, for letting me know about this and for the Peach Boys to begin with.

317
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I have one quick other facet to this before you tell your story, Jason, which is I was thinking I was like, I got to like refresh people's memory.

318
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
How do you describe this particular, the vibe of this Burbank fries?

319
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And I came up with that. I was like, oh, yeah, it is kind of like Tim Burton's Burbank.

320
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Because if you don't know, he grew up in the area where we record the show.

321
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And, you know, he was stuck in one of those Burbank little boxes, you know, the kind that's like the ultimate dream anyone could ever have now to spending two million dollars on one.

322
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Yeah. But so anyway, that's I was thinking about that.

323
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That like it's funny that that fries was like 50s B movie and it's complete and very Mars attacks and so close to where I was like, where did Tim Burton grow up?

324
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And I looked it up. Oh, interesting.

325
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And he was like half a block away from this huge cemetery, the Valhalla cemetery, which you guys may have passed by.

326
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah, yeah, you fly over it if you're using Burbank Airport.

327
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yeah, it's got like a giant cartoonish, like almost Arc de Triomphe in it.

328
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Yeah, a huge sort of like temple looking thing. I always I remember seeing it from the fries parking lot. What is that?

329
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Now I realize it was in the the cemetery, which I've driven through. It's kind of a fascinating drive, like a cool environment.

330
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
The Burbank fries shares a border essentially with that.

331
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Wow. Big cemetery, as did like Tim Burton grew up half a block from it.

332
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
He was obsessed with it because you go film little movies there and sneak off to there.

333
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And it reminded him of the cemetery where the grave robbing happens in Plan 9 from outer space.

334
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And as I'm looking at the overhead, wow, Tim Burton's house really close to that cemetery. What's that over there?

335
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Oh, a specific Google Maps marker for Criswell's grave.

336
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Criswell, the narrator of Plan 9 from outer space.

337
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Burton was out of there. Criswell died.

338
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Ultimately, a character in Ed Wood played by horrible man Jeffrey Jones.

339
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Right. Yeah. The final resting place of that guy.

340
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Right where Tim Burton grew up. That's wild.

341
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Isn't a weird little little tie together.

342
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And not only that, the same interview, because this led me to this article that was about Tim Burton retracing his Burbank steps.

343
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I got a lizard joining us. Got a lizard in the garage.

344
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Tim Burton. Oh, he just tried to jump on the door and missed. He wants to check out the fries stuff. I understand.

345
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So anyways, Tim Burton made it out of Burbank to the, you know, the much better, the hallowed grounds of Valencia, California, where he went to Calar.

346
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And built up his body of work to lead to his career.

347
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Valencia home not only to CalArts, but also to Magic Mountain.

348
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And I'd never heard this before in my life that to help pay for art school, Tim Burton would take nighttime work as a Scarecter at Six Flags.

349
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Wow. No way. Magic Mountain. I've never heard that before.

350
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The guy with the crazy hair was a Scarecter? Yeah.

351
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yeah. Yeah. But probably covered in the only one that he name checked was being a mummy.

352
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
That he'd be wrapped up in a very vision restricting mummy costume, running around trying to scare other Valencia teens.

353
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But that mostly they would get the upper hand and like he and his Scarecter friends would get beat up by the Valencia customers.

354
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
He's what in his early 60s? Am I crazy or is he late 50?

355
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
If I'm trying to place this, it's late 70s, early 80s. The article referred to it as Fright Fest.

356
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And that's when I freaked out. Like Fright Fest, our favorite thing to talk about.

357
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And Tim Burton was one of the Valencia teen. Yeah, Tim is 63.

358
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I don't think they were calling it Fright Fest. Yeah. I don't think that's accurate.

359
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm calling this article the task. But either way, he's not making this up.

360
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Like he for sure Tim Burton was a mummy in Magic Mountain, which is delightful to me.

361
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You're right. That's what I was wondering because yeah, Halloween, whatever their Halloween fest at the time was,

362
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I just wanted to I was wondering, yeah, was it Fright Fest proper or not?

363
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
So yeah, he's 63. So that was many years ago. But yeah, yeah, yeah. No, late 70s, early 80s. I don't know exactly.

364
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Yeah, you hear a quote. You get so abused. Once we got chased around by gangs of teenagers,

365
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
people just want to abuse characters in a theme park, punching out Winnie the Pooh or something.

366
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Then add Halloween to the mix. It's pretty rough. Wow.

367
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
So Tim knew all about it. It might have inspired. I don't know, either, you know, like the like the brutal,

368
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:50,000
the Penguin Gang, the clowns in Batman Returns or the brutality of the apes who've taken over the planet

369
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
in his classic film from 1999 or 2000 or whatever that was.

370
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
We've got to get Tim on here and not ask about any movies. Yeah, yeah. I mean, that'd be impossible.

371
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
100 percent of it. So like, would you where would you check in?

372
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And what was the what was the minimum wage at that time?

373
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And did you make it all the way through the season? Did they have an unlimited dining plan?

374
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Yeah. Was the building was the sign that has a little room at the bottom of it next to the Wendy's?

375
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Did you ever go in there? Was that ever open?

376
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You know, that's right. I was you know, it's funny. That's exactly where I was right before going to the fries.

377
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I was like, I need to I need to make a stop at the weird Wendy's, the get the closed gift shop in a Wendy's

378
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
parking lot for Magic Mountain way outside of the park.

379
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Well, I'll transition from there because I ate at that Wendy's like five days ago on the road trip on my road.

380
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah. On the way. You were also a go to for both of us is that weird that weird Wendy's.

381
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I befuddled a Valencia teen at the cash register with my order to Junior Bacon Cheeseburgers, please.

382
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And he kept ringing up every other burger on the menu.

383
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And I was like, no, no, the Junior Bacon Cheeseburgers up there right up there.

384
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Anyway, you know, I befuddled them by asking if I wanted one of these strawberry frosties that people are talking about and have it yet.

385
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So yeah, it didn't work out for either of us.

386
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Update. So behind the Wendy's is a red lobster behind the red lobster coming soon in an out burger.

387
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
OK. So happening in this happening. Yeah. Boy, oh boy.

388
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So, yeah, Jane and I went up to Napa Valley, specifically St. Helena.

389
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I think that's how you say it for a wedding.

390
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
One of her college friends was getting married.

391
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Congratulations to Kathleen and Eric, who are also listeners to this program.

392
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Oh, great. I believe they met working on the great movie.

393
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
What? Oh, wow.

394
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
So we're getting married. See?

395
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And hello to the guy who came up to me at the very end of the night and said he had seen us on the George Lucas talk show.

396
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Oh, well. So that was very fun.

397
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
So I had never gone up to Napa Valley before.

398
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Beautiful area. Lots of wineries.

399
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Big wedding business at those wineries.

400
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And I have had issues.

401
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You know, I think we've all had some issues with calling lifts and new beers and stuff.

402
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Sure. Oh, boy. Last year or two. Oh, yeah.

403
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Less people are driving. You know, it's not the best gig to have during a pandemic.

404
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
So it was kind of staking everything out.

405
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:37,000
We got up there. We stayed at a very quaint roadside motel called El Bonita Motel, which a beautiful grounds and nice amenities.

406
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:46,000
The rooms were probably the height of luxury whenever a year after sideways came out when they clearly were redone.

407
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
But now they're getting the point of like the dresser.

408
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You know, this dresser drawer is missing a few knobs or like this light switch doesn't really do anything.

409
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So that said, the gotten out of breakfast was pretty good.

410
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Mixed review. Yeah. Anyway, so they got married at the Charles Krug winery, which is owned by Peter Mondavi.

411
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I started freaking out when I saw the sign is that the lift driver was telling us like, oh, it's the son of Charles Mondavi.

412
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Oh, Mondavi. Got very excited by the other Mondavi.

413
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
So, yeah, I've been looking in the morning to make sure like, OK, well, I'll just I'll just drive down there.

414
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It is three miles away from where we were staying.

415
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I will drive down there if we can't figure out a lift like half an hour before, but I'll keep checking.

416
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So we scheduled like a pickup and I don't know if that really ever does anything.

417
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
But we do get a lift on time and we get a lift there.

418
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And I'm like, OK, well, then surely we'll be able to get one coming back.

419
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And I that is apparently where I was wrong.

420
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So, you know, this is they have like hard outs.

421
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I think the wineries, there's a lot of restrictions like they can't serve distilled liquor.

422
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
They have to serve fermented like liquor, like their fermented whiskey, gin, vodka.

423
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It's just we're all of the area.

424
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Interesting. I think it's like old blue laws or something to like old protect the wineries and stuff.

425
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Oh, that's right. And there's like those weddings are pretty like it's 10 or 11 and you're out.

426
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Yes. And so we were, you know, stuff was winding down and we we stepped outside for some air and we start checking for a lift.

427
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And it's like still looking. Not a lot of drivers on the road.

428
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Still looking, still looking. We're doing it on both our phones.

429
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Tried Uber to and then they both just timed out and said there's no drivers.

430
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
None. And again, we're three miles down the road.

431
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
There's not much of a shoulder to walk on. Oh, yeah.

432
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And so I just go to Google and I search St. Helena taxi companies and the first taxi, the first listing that comes up, I call and a voice mail voice message place.

433
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It says we're currently booked all night until 10 p.m.

434
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
If we have availability, we'll turn the phones back on then.

435
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Oh, God. And I was like, well, that was strange.

436
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Fuck you for calling. Fuck you for calling.

437
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
The second number I call, I get a dispatcher.

438
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
They say, hello. Yeah. Blah, blah, blah.

439
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Taxi company. It's like, hi, we're at this.

440
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
We're at the winery and we're going here.

441
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
We, you know, can we get a cab?

442
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And they're like, well, we have. Yeah, we have a cab on the road.

443
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It's in downtown Napa right now.

444
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
So it'll be about twenty five, thirty minutes. And we're like, OK, I guess.

445
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Yeah. And they're like, I do need your credit card and I need to run it before we hang up.

446
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And I'm like, oh, OK.

447
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
But we're just like so tired at this point.

448
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
We're so tired and like ready. Whatever to get. Yeah, whatever.

449
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
And I was tired enough. I didn't think to ask the question.

450
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
How much is that? So three mile for three miles.

451
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Three miles. That important detail.

452
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
So I get a text message saying here is your receipt.

453
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And can we guess? Yeah.

454
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Would you like to guess what my credit card was charged to go?

455
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
OK, so they were OK. Yeah, they did pick you up 30 minutes later.

456
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Like everything. Well, yes, that is that gets complicated, too.

457
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
But they do get there eventually. They do eventually get there.

458
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And then it's three miles from where they picked you up to the motel.

459
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
The motel. Excuse me. All right.

460
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
So how much do we think for Jason to be upset by it, too, is an extra little bit.

461
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I do skew it a little bit. Yes.

462
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Now, I I rolled with the punches. I'm not saying you did a good sport about this.

463
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I'm just trying to add that into my assessment of what the price is.

464
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Yeah. Be kind. And that's a good question.

465
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Because I think, OK, if I'm I think even in that because in that situation,

466
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I think you're so exhausted that even though, you know, I think we've gotten to lift an Uber

467
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
will use to lift the Uber prices sometimes, which are also going up.

468
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And also, we should use those anyway, because it's bad.

469
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,000
But I think we've gotten used to like that costing like 30 or 40 dollars at most in a scenario.

470
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
So that's my baseline.

471
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,000
So I would expect to pay over 650 or so.

472
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I would expect something crazy kind of just because it's a taxi.

473
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
So I'm guessing you were charged.

474
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Ninety dollars for this ride.

475
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I mean, then I if you go lower, then I'm going to go higher if we're if we're in a store.

476
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
You might be right. You might be right.

477
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
OK, I'll tell you the answer and then I'll tell you how it played out.

478
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
The answer is seventy five dollars.

479
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
That's perfect.

480
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Guess Mike.

481
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Pretty good. Yeah, that's still again.

482
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
It's expensive. I'm not saying it's expensive.

483
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Yes, but it's not like that.

484
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Here's my thinking.

485
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Here's my thinking.

486
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
It was Friday night on the other side of this winery.

487
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Far enough away that we didn't even really hear it.

488
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
There was a jazz festival going on.

489
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
OK, it's a lot of competition.

490
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:27,000
There's there's people around and this is a tourism, an area where their tourism is based on alcohol.

491
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
So I was thinking, well, surely there will be drivers on the road.

492
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
We're not all pulling a Paul Pelosi, you know.

493
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I was I was very we were too tired.

494
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I really wanted to see where that we're trying to figure out where he got pulled over.

495
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It was around there, right?

496
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It was around.

497
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It was in Napa Valley.

498
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Nancy Pelosi's husband.

499
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
So eventually we are waiting so long.

500
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Anyone else left at the wedding starts coming out and offer.

501
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Hey, do you want to ride?

502
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Hey, we're going that way.

503
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Do you want to ride?

504
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But it was like you've already paid.

505
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I've only I've met one of them was Paul Pelosi.

506
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Hey, do you want to ride?

507
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Hey, you want to ride?

508
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Will you be cool about it?

509
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
But I I went I I we were like, OK, well, yeah, this is the the the the.

510
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
All right. The the you know, these other people Jane was friendly with, you know,

511
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
we're like, all right, I'll just call the taxing cancel.

512
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I don't feel like still waiting.

513
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And I called them and they they answered and they said, we're here.

514
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I was like, what? And they're like, yeah, we're here.

515
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
We're trying to find where to go.

516
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And I'm like, OK.

517
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And so eventually they do show up.

518
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
They pick us up.

519
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Was it was the right estimate of time?

520
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
What's that? How did you say it was about the amount of?

521
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It was maybe like five minutes more than maybe 35 minutes.

522
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
That's not bad.

523
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Well, no, it's not bad.

524
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
But when they pulled up and they had said this on the phone, it's like it's going to be a black Ford Flex.

525
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And I was like, OK.

526
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And what you doing like that?

527
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Well, I was like, well, that that was very specific.

528
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,000
But when they pulled up, there was a driver and in the passenger seat, there was someone with a laptop.

529
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And I was like, oh, driver dispatch.

530
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
This might be the company.

531
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Oh, interesting. That's weird.

532
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And so really, yeah, they're driving us back and they were perfectly pleasant.

533
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
They were mostly telling us about all the Thomas Keller restaurants one town over.

534
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And I go at the hotel.

535
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I start looking up Yelp reviews for cab companies in the area.

536
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And they're all two stars.

537
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
They're like and they all say the same thing.

538
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
This is one guy with a Prius and a cell phone.

539
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
This is not real.

540
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
This is not a cab company.

541
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
This took an hour to get here.

542
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
They charged me an insane amount.

543
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And then I found like a tourism like tips for Napa, just some travel website.

544
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And they're like, it is very hard to get around Napa Valley without a car.

545
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
There are taxis and lifts, but they are not reliable.

546
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And I know.

547
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Interesting.

548
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
OK.

549
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
So that's happening up there.

550
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So why do they need to be two people?

551
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
What do you mean?

552
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Why does there even need to be a person in the passenger seat?

553
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I do.

554
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I think that's just the way this one was set up.

555
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It's just like someone they were taking the calls, print those receipts, get those credit

556
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
cards charged, which is pretty that's shady.

557
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
But then I end up feeling like an asshole because like when we pull up at the hotel,

558
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
it's like, can I give you a tip on the credit card?

559
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And they're like, we already ran the card.

560
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And I was like, OK, I have five dollars.

561
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
This is all I can do for you.

562
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Yeah.

563
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I didn't expect.

564
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
They don't even have like a square account where you can like flip it over and you hit

565
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
the button.

566
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
This seems to be an old school operation.

567
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Yeah.

568
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So.

569
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Wow.

570
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Interesting.

571
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I would have a great time otherwise.

572
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Sounds interesting, though, at least.

573
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Yeah, it was an interesting experience.

574
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Were they like because all I can think of like, were they like were the driver like a Judd

575
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Hirsch type and the passenger dispatcher, Danny DeVito type?

576
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Were they like cabbies?

577
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Or more of a Queen Latifah and a Jimmy Fallon?

578
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Or were they more Queen Latifah, Jimmy Fallon?

579
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
No, not kind of really big presences, just kind of two quiet women.

580
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
OK.

581
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
All right.

582
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Well, that's a bummer.

583
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Not the joy ride of your life.

584
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
No Louis de Palma energy is what I'm getting at.

585
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
No, we saw a lot of charter buses and a lot of like party buses.

586
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
And I think that's part of the wedding business up there is like, oh, if you have to stay

587
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
in a block of rooms, the hotel rooms you get are a little far away.

588
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Like part of the package when you book is there a shuttle?

589
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

590
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
We do.

591
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Jason should start that.

592
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I'll drive and you be the dispatcher.

593
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Sure.

594
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:48,000
We can get like 75 bucks out of some suckers coming home from like some festival at the

595
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
at the Greek theater.

596
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Yeah.

597
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Starlight Bowl.

598
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
You're going to do it here.

599
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Well, look, look, Uber and don't you have to do it in St. Helena?

600
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I guess, yeah, you probably because there's like maybe a lot like there's a loophole in

601
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
the laws.

602
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
That's what I was picturing.

603
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Yeah.

604
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I guess, right.

605
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I think our podcast hosted by occasional TV writer and to scam one taxi taxi driver.

606
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Yeah.

607
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
What do you want?

608
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
You want a taxi?

609
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
We're sending one right over there.

610
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
We got to run the card.

611
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Give me your digits.

612
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
We got to run the card now, though.

613
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Don't ask what the price is.

614
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That'll be all right.

615
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I just need the expiration date, security code and your social security number.

616
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
All right.

617
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I don't want to end up in the news.

618
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Do you?

619
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Yeah.

620
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Sounds fun.

621
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Well, good tip.

622
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Thank you for alerting our audience to this possible way of getting scammed.

623
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I did like how that played out.

624
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
We're like, what like good.

625
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
It is not a good number.

626
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
It's definitely not a good number.

627
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It's not a good number.

628
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
It wasn't really wondering what this means in the hundreds range.

629
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
The fun was the reveal of the fake taxi.

630
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It was hidden there because I thought the fun of the story was just going to be the

631
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
price.

632
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Yeah.

633
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And the price is again high, but not insane, insane high.

634
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Not insane.

635
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I thought maybe it was a hold at first.

636
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I thought it's like, oh, they're going to hold this and then they'll charge me 30

637
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
bucks when they see the actual distance.

638
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Right.

639
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I'm saying like it was almost like a magic trick, like the prestige and you had an

640
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
extra level of the dispatcher was also riding shotguns.

641
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Two weirdos.

642
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Yeah.

643
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Yeah.

644
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Well, either good way to not get scammed up there or a good business idea for you and

645
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
a friend.

646
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
That's right.

647
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Yeah.

648
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And I guess with that, let's turn it over to the audience and open up the PTR post

649
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
office.

650
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You know, it's like you open up the mail bag is the doughboy.

651
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
The feedback we're opening up that we have to open a store with a physical location

652
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
with a bunch of keys.

653
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Which one is it?

654
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Damn it.

655
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And the doors stuck.

656
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Bell jingle jingle.

657
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
But we're getting it done.

658
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Call out anything that you.

659
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Oh, go ahead.

660
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
OK, I got one that's really like it's going to involve us to think of things really

661
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
fast.

662
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Oh, because I'm going to say it because it's just fun.

663
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
This is like this is a good way to ease in because this is a this is a theme park question.

664
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
You know, there's going to be weirder stuff about Aerosmith coming.

665
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I'm sure.

666
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
But not this is standard.

667
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Which five different IPs would make up your ultimate islands of adventure?

668
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Five.

669
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
My God.

670
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I'm just going to go with the first two part question.

671
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Well, you do it all together, right?

672
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
We don't all have to think of five.

673
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
You just think of five and we have to do it quickly, though.

674
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I'll time us each so we can be efficient here.

675
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Us individually.

676
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Yeah, us individually.

677
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Jason, are you up for it?

678
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Does it have to appeal to the audience?

679
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
No, it doesn't.

680
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
It's just for each individual existing ones.

681
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
You're just going to keep the ones that are there.

682
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
They feature said, hold on.

683
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Let me let me.

684
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Let me start.

685
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Let me start here.

686
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I'm going to trade your fees.

687
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
You're right.

688
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
You're right.

689
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
OK, keep going.

690
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
OK.

691
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
King Feature Syndicate Marvel Comics.

692
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
OK.

693
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I love Lucy.

694
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
OK.

695
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Full island.

696
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I love Lucy.

697
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
It sounds good.

698
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I'm going to give you I'm going to give you 45 seconds.

699
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
So you still want on the clock here.

700
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
OK.

701
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
You're fine.

702
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye.

703
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
All right.

704
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Fantastic.

705
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And the Bazooka Joe comic strip universe.

706
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Is that not the little King Feature doesn't know that does not.

707
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
OK.

708
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Perfect.

709
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
All right.

710
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Scott, are you ready?

711
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Yeah, I think so.

712
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Go.

713
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
OK.

714
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
The Beach Boys Full Beach.

715
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Boys Island.

716
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I don't want to waste the time, but probably like you get on the goats from the Pets Sounds

717
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
cover.

718
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Great.

719
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Ride them around.

720
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Back to the future.

721
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Back to the future.

722
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Ride is back and it's all to it's all 2015.

723
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Oh, boy.

724
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
OK.

725
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
The Canadian the old Canadian show The Littlest Hobo.

726
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Oh, God.

727
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Oh, God.

728
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
15 seconds left.

729
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
OK.

730
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
The old Canadian show The Littlest Hobo.

731
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Oh, God.

732
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Oh, God.

733
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
15 seconds left.

734
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
OK.

735
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
The old Canadian show The Littlest Hobo.

736
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Oh, God.

737
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Oh, God.

738
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
15 seconds left.

739
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Oh, God.

740
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Oh, God.

741
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
15 seconds left.

742
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
15 seconds.

743
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Fuck shit.

744
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
This should be how we do all the questions.

745
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
New HR Puffins to HR Puffins stuff is back as scary as it was with the pinball.

746
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And because of my son, just a bunch of garbage trucks milling around.

747
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Garbage truck island.

748
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
OK.

749
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Garbage truck island.

750
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
All right.

751
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It's going to love it.

752
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Great.

753
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
OK.

754
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I'm going to time myself here.

755
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
OK.

756
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,880
Ninja Turtles Island, but specifically the Mighty Mutanimals, the side characters like

757
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,880
Mando Gecko and Man Ray.

758
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,880
Wow.

759
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,880
No turtles there at all.

760
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,880
Just those characters.

761
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,880
Number two, Zubli Zoo.

762
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,880
The show Ben Vareen was on as a children's show that I watched as a kid.

763
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,880
It's terrifying.

764
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,880
It's like cat style.

765
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,880
So that's Zubli Zoo.

766
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,880
Let's see here.

767
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:50,880
Island based on David the Gnome, the cartoon that Tom Bosley voiced that was a Weinstein

768
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,880
production.

769
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,880
That has nothing to do with it.

770
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,880
We bought the rights, so it's OK.

771
00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:00,880
Four Aerosmith Island, which Revolution X ride.

772
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,880
Obviously, I have one more.

773
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,880
And then Green Day Island.

774
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,880
Good job.

775
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,880
We all did it.

776
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,880
We rushed those last ones.

777
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,880
But that leads directly into the one that I'm looking at, which got a lot of likes.

778
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,880
This is from Chris at the Rope Drop.

779
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,880
Matt Apodaca once called Soren the Josh Groban of rides.

780
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,880
What is the Green Day of Rides?

781
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,880
Yes.

782
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,880
The Green Day of Rides.

783
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,880
To you, that is a perfect ride.

784
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,880
Well, yeah, it depends.

785
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,880
I mean, Green Day is a band.

786
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,880
They have highs and lows.

787
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,880
So if it's Green Day themselves, it's tough because if it was just one album, I would

788
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,880
find it easy to do this.

789
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,880
But the band itself, that's tougher.

790
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,880
But it's got to be here.

791
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,880
Let's see.

792
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,880
What are the core tenets of Green Day?

793
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,880
Rock?

794
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,880
Hair dye?

795
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,880
Hair dye, eyeliner, rebellion.

796
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,880
Anti-establishment.

797
00:42:53,880 --> 00:43:00,880
Which is tough in a corporate theme park setting.

798
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,880
Yeah.

799
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,880
How do you even square that?

800
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,880
How do you square such an un-corporate band as Green Day with the very corporate?

801
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:16,880
I mean, how wild and anti-the-man can this factory of Broadway musicals be?

802
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,880
Right.

803
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,880
Right.

804
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,880
It's a good question.

805
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,880
So yeah, you want something that at least has the spirit of it.

806
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,880
So you want something sort of wild.

807
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,880
So I feel like you want something at Six Flags because it's so, it's just not polished.

808
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,880
It's a little bit scary.

809
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,880
It's a little bit raw.

810
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,880
All of Six Flags rides feel like...

811
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,880
They get scary.

812
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,880
And it's either in its music, in its edgy guitars, or in its reminding us of the draconian

813
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,880
nature of the Bush administration.

814
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,880
That's right.

815
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,880
Yeah.

816
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:53,880
So you're thinking like the great American scream machine, but the overhead thing is like...

817
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,880
It's a little loose.

818
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,880
A little too loose.

819
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,880
The restraint is a little loose.

820
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,880
Yeah, exactly.

821
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:05,880
Or it's properly clicked in, but there's like a weird sound at the worst moments, like on

822
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,880
a curve or a loop.

823
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,880
Yes, for sure.

824
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,880
Yeah, yeah.

825
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,880
So I think, yeah.

826
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:16,880
A Magic Mountain roller coaster where the restraint is loose.

827
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,880
Exactly.

828
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,880
That's the perfect green day of a ride.

829
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,880
I was thinking it could be...

830
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,880
It's not that far from...

831
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,880
I looked up the name while we were talking.

832
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,880
When there was...

833
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,880
It's not...

834
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,880
This isn't what it is anymore, right?

835
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,880
It's a Sally Ride at Hershey Park Reese's Extreme Cup Challenge.

836
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:32,880
Oh yeah, yeah.

837
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,880
You know, edgy, edgy enough to drop that E from the word extreme, one of the Es.

838
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,880
I think that's a little tonally similar to green day, right?

839
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,880
Yeah, I think so.

840
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:47,880
I want to quickly shout out that was Sam Hudson's question that I asked earlier.

841
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,880
Sorry.

842
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,880
Oh, okay.

843
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,880
Oh, right, right.

844
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,880
I just wanted to shout out.

845
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,880
Okay.

846
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,880
Seeing anything else?

847
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,880
Yeah, I think I have...

848
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,880
Jason, do you have something or I can go again?

849
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,880
Yeah, that ride is now Reese's Cup Fusion.

850
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,880
Yes, that's right.

851
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,880
Yeah, yeah.

852
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,880
So it's more of a jazz fusion.

853
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,880
Now it's the Chick Korea of rides.

854
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,880
I do have...

855
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,880
I have a couple.

856
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,880
Well, here's one.

857
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,880
Chris E. Hayner, asbest in-park table service restaurant?

858
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,880
In-park.

859
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,880
In all parks?

860
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,880
I think you can call it your shot.

861
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:27,880
Tempted to say Carthay, but now I'm flashing a Disney World, which I'm just doing sit-down less there.

862
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,880
Well, you know, I did like Mythos, I'll tell you.

863
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,880
I don't know if it's better than...

864
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,880
It does have that banner, that Mythos, Inlands of Adventure, the fake rock restaurant.

865
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,880
That meal we had there when we were down a couple years ago was pretty fantastic.

866
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,880
I don't know if it's better than Carthay.

867
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,880
Yeah, Carthay...

868
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,880
Yeah, I don't know.

869
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,880
Mythos was fine.

870
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,880
I think I had a cheeseburger at Mythos and it was fine.

871
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,880
It was good.

872
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:52,880
Yeah.

873
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,880
I had a great meal one time at Selye, the steakhouse in Canada.

874
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,880
Oh, yeah.

875
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,880
Oh, is that good?

876
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,880
Yeah, I've never been there.

877
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:08,880
I thought it was very good, but I feel like this happens every so often where the restaurant

878
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,880
that people say is the best, within a year people go like, well, it's gone downhill.

879
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,880
Yeah.

880
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,880
And so, I probably got there like eight or ten years ago, so I don't know what it's like

881
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,880
in the meantime, but I remember it being very good.

882
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,880
We had Ohana...

883
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,880
Well, that's not in park.

884
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,880
Yeah.

885
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,880
Yeah, the hotels are different because I love that animal kingdom where this is called

886
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,880
Gico.

887
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,880
Oh, right.

888
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,880
And I never did...

889
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:34,880
Yeah, but that's not in park.

890
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,880
At the top of Contemporary is good, but then we're not talking about that.

891
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,880
Not in park, yeah.

892
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,880
It's a really specific area.

893
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,880
There's not a lot where it's like, and here's the check.

894
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:43,880
Right.

895
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,880
It's a kind of a rare...

896
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,880
But they tend to be good, like if a theme park commits to doing that.

897
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,880
Is that BR Guest Restaurant not so great?

898
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,880
I've had it twice and it is pretty good, but I don't think it's better than Carthay.

899
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:02,880
It's definitely better than Blue Bayou, which I, of course, think is great, but Blue Bayou

900
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,880
is kind of like the food is...

901
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,880
Perennially overrated.

902
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,880
It's more of an atmosphere.

903
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,880
Well, now you can get a hurricane there so that my food might taste a little better.

904
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,880
We should try sometime.

905
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,880
We should get the jump on that and do a Blue Bayou episode.

906
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,880
You can get an alcoholic drink in Blue Bayou.

907
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,880
Yeah, that changed in the last year, yeah.

908
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:20,880
I guess I missed that.

909
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,880
Yeah, Walt's values decaying.

910
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,880
That skeleton is spinning and spinning.

911
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,880
Spinning and spinning.

912
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,880
You know, something about BR Guest, because we thought about going there in Florida and

913
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,880
I always...

914
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:38,880
For the longest time, it was table service dinner, quick service breakfast.

915
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,880
And then when we looked, it had switched now and it's prefix all day.

916
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,880
Oh, okay.

917
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,880
That is like a cheap cash grab thing.

918
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,880
Because I think that space restaurant is the same thing unless you eat in the bar.

919
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,880
Oh, yeah, we haven't done the space restaurant.

920
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,880
Nobody here has, right?

921
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,880
No.

922
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,880
So we can't officially put that into the mix.

923
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,880
Because that's another three course like required thing.

924
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,880
The bars first come first serve.

925
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,880
Yeah, for the bars, fun.

926
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,880
But do we lock in answers though?

927
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,880
What do you think?

928
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,880
Yeah, I guess it's Carthay for me.

929
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:10,880
It feels uninteresting to say that.

930
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,880
Carthay or Six Flags Magic Mountain Full Throttle Lounge?

931
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,880
I believe closed.

932
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,880
I think a listener...

933
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,880
Yeah.

934
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,880
Oh, you shivered.

935
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,880
I believe.

936
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,880
I think I saw a listener pointing that out.

937
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,880
Was not open when I was there in September.

938
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,880
I think maybe you've done for good.

939
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,880
Look it up if you feel like it.

940
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,880
This is resolved.

941
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,880
I'll read this quickly though.

942
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,880
I'm interested in this interaction from hockey fan.

943
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:40,880
Okay, if I bribe Eva Anderson with a copy of Dick Tracy Daley's Volume 22,

944
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,880
do you think she will come back on the show soon with a Dick Tracy Part 2 episode for us?

945
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,880
Fingers crossed that episode still amuses me very much.

946
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,880
Eva responds, that is so thoughtful, but I have acquired it.

947
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,880
So no bribery necessary.

948
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,880
I've heard it's been... everything's been very successful.

949
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,880
The finding of the Moon Maid comic.

950
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:07,880
I think there was even an exchange of Moon Maid comics that made it from Eva's brother to Griffin at our show in New York.

951
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,880
So Moon Maid has been found.

952
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,880
Moon Maid's going around.

953
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,880
And I don't think bribery is required to get Eva back around these parts.

954
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,880
No. Yeah. So yeah, that's... everything was settled before the tweet it sounds like.

955
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:27,880
Which of you is most likely to name a child after a country bear?

956
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,880
This is a very important question. It's from Liza Omni Moving.

957
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:40,880
Me or the relationship? Like me alone maybe it's I, but the chances of that happening.

958
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,880
Well, could you sneak one in?

959
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:46,880
Let's think about these names. Is one of them just an acceptable enough name?

960
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,880
No, not Zeb. Nope. No, out.

961
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,880
Tennessee Bear.

962
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,880
Henry. I feel like you don't need a lot of Henry.

963
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,880
You could go Henry and then...

964
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,880
Trixie.

965
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:06,880
You and Lindsay wouldn't talk for like two days because she's insisting on like, no, we're naming them after a last unicorn character.

966
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,880
That's different IP that she would be pushing.

967
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,880
Different IP. Well, no, I know you eventually compromise where one of you gets...

968
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,880
where a country bear gets a first name and a last unicorn character gets a middle name.

969
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,880
My son's name is Mondo Gecko. That's what I insist on.

970
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:26,880
Or Jaguar or Dreadmon.

971
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:34,880
Could do Teddy. I mean, you could go Albert and then if things go away, like, you know, if you want to start casually calling him Big Al.

972
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,880
Sure.

973
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,880
Shaker, I don't think works, but...

974
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,880
No.

975
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:43,880
Up to you. Wait, but that doesn't answer who's the most likely. I mean, you're considering it a little more, I'd say.

976
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,880
I guess, yeah.

977
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,880
Because I like, yeah, I like...

978
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,880
I like the bear.

979
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,880
Buff.

980
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,880
Buff Gertner.

981
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,880
Buff is funny.

982
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,880
Could be me if it's Buff.

983
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,880
I tried, I was telling Mundy for a long time that he should name a son Tex.

984
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,880
Oh, that's cool.

985
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,880
Tex Mundy. And that's a real country bears-ish name.

986
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,880
Yeah.

987
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,880
Tex is fun.

988
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:04,880
So the answer is Mundy.

989
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,880
I got one in our email.

990
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:08,880
Sure, go ahead.

991
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:17,880
From Tyler Harper. Before I get to the question, he just wanted to add, you know, he had played the McGruff songs for his wife.

992
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:22,880
His wife doesn't listen to the show, but played the original McGruff albums.

993
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,880
Played some of the songs and then played the newer songs that we, you know, created.

994
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:29,880
They were created by us.

995
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,880
Mike, yes.

996
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,880
My 100%.

997
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:44,880
Well, I say we because he specifically adds compliments go to Scott because his wife could not tell the difference between the original ones and the ones that Scott made.

998
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,880
So nice work, Scott.

999
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:48,880
I can't. I simply can't.

1000
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,880
There are still people who don't know what the difference in our voices are.

1001
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,880
So he probably listened to the episode and was like, Scott says he made these songs.

1002
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,880
Could be. I'm confused. I don't think we're that similar, but it does.

1003
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,880
Well, I it's interesting. I don't think so either.

1004
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:09,880
I do think once in a while, at least me, I start to like mimic both of you speaking.

1005
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,880
Oh, sure. Sometimes just because that's what happens.

1006
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,880
We all merge as one. Yeah.

1007
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,880
So I start to like there's episodes where I'm listening and I feel like I sound like a little different.

1008
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:24,880
So maybe I'm moving. My mom also was like, you know, you you say restaurant now like Jason does.

1009
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,880
And I go, what?

1010
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,880
And she goes, it's a rest. It should be restaurant.

1011
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,880
So I was like, oh, I guess so.

1012
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,880
And she's like, Jason says restaurant.

1013
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,880
And I go and then she goes, now you're saying it.

1014
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,880
You never said that. I go, OK, are you?

1015
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,880
Yeah, this is the type.

1016
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,880
This is the type of thing my mom is listening to when she listens to the show.

1017
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,880
I've said this many times. She's looking for enunciation.

1018
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,880
She's looking for the quality of my voice.

1019
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,880
She's zoned out completely when it's coming to like jokes or information.

1020
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,880
You didn't finish that tea.

1021
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,880
You didn't end strong on that tea.

1022
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,880
She's just. Yeah, she just wants.

1023
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:02,880
It's almost like, yeah, some sort of a recital or something that Jane was like, I said, Woodard earlier.

1024
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,880
I mean, you've been around you too much.

1025
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,880
Yeah, he's saying words like I'm not saying water.

1026
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,880
I'm not saying milk. I'm not saying whatever the other ones.

1027
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,880
And Tyler, Tyler's question, of course.

1028
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:17,880
Yes, Tyler, it was Mike who made the songs.

1029
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,880
But thank you so much for the compliment.

1030
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:25,880
Tyler was asking, are there any new songs coming out from the podcast to ride in general or McGruff?

1031
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:29,880
Are there new? I mean, we've got a new Club 3 theme song.

1032
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,880
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1033
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,880
This stuff, there will be.

1034
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,880
I have nothing to tease. I have no stuff to tease.

1035
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,880
Yeah. What would people want?

1036
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,880
I mean, yeah, there's other things we could do the styles of.

1037
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,880
Certainly, I think we could I think we could fanfic a sunny eclipse song.

1038
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,880
Sure. Yeah.

1039
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:59,880
I want to put a ring on her like Saturn, but smaller, though, to fit a finger.

1040
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:04,880
It depends. Some like some of this stuff takes a while to make.

1041
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,880
And ultimately, it's for a couple thousand people.

1042
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,880
You're demanding with the mixes to anytime there's been a new song.

1043
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:17,880
I'm not there. I'm so bad at mixing and like I can put all the stuff together and I can play stuff.

1044
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,880
But the mixing drives me nuts. Yeah, I'm not a good mixer.

1045
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:25,880
Everything's radically different on on computer speakers on a TV.

1046
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:29,880
Yeah, you're not supposed to mix and you're not supposed to mix in your headphones.

1047
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,880
I was you're supposed to have like mixing speakers for it.

1048
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,880
And then I go in the car and I'm listening and all sounds like I'm compressing.

1049
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:42,880
It's a big pain. Plus you insist on doing what you call like Phil Spector did with the Ramones,

1050
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,880
which just means having a loaded gun on your desk on your computer.

1051
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,880
So no one wants to be anywhere near that room.

1052
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:51,880
That's right. I don't want any bullshit.

1053
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,880
We even point it in a mirror.

1054
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,880
Yeah, the sunny eclipse rag has got to be good.

1055
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,880
It's got to be the best.

1056
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,880
If this I will if this podcast was as popular as like, I don't know,

1057
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,880
we'll like smart lists or something we would be I don't know.

1058
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,880
Maybe I'm maybe would be exactly the same thing.

1059
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,880
We'd be in the garage still. I'm so sorry.

1060
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,880
As popular as what isn't it smart list smart list in America's favorite podcast.

1061
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,880
Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes.

1062
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,880
That is smart list mania out there.

1063
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,880
I think it's very popular on the time and I don't even I've never heard it.

1064
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,880
So I don't even I'm not even trying to put a little something on it.

1065
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,880
I'm just saying it's a very popular thing.

1066
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,880
But in my mind, fresh ads are so much better than their house.

1067
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,880
You know, I'm just saying like we had the budget.

1068
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,880
There were you get full albums based on every I have a news would have an album

1069
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,880
like we'd be traveling to all of these places.

1070
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,880
I think you need some you need somebody to like, you know, you need an engineer or a mixer.

1071
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,880
You need to call 24 7 like you could just you have a melody in your head in the bathroom

1072
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:02,880
and you could go now go. Yeah, start singing and it could be on the album despite being it's not an echo bathroom.

1073
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,880
You could say do your vocals right there while shitting. Of course.

1074
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,880
And it would. Yeah.

1075
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,880
Semper if you could manage to sound like McGruff taking a big dump.

1076
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:13,880
Oh yeah. That's actually very easy.

1077
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,880
Yeah. Leave the toilet flushes in.

1078
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,880
No, I want to have it. That actually leads into since McGruff has come up.

1079
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,880
Here's this exchange with Ellie Warren.

1080
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:28,880
Ellie wrote that seeing as how we're all close friends with at McGruff, whatever the handle at McGruff at NCPC now.

1081
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:34,880
What theme park ride or attraction would you design for him and are any McGruff songs part of the experience?

1082
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:42,880
So if you haven't caught this, there's been an odd amount of interaction between us podcast, the right on Twitter and the official McGruff account.

1083
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,880
Yes. There's a lot. I'd say a ton.

1084
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,880
I'd say more than once a week, including now because I'm a big fan of the McGruff song.

1085
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:59,880
I'd say more than once a week, including now because the response to that was McGruff, the crime dog with the rights reserved because he cares about copyright law.

1086
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,880
Don't get ripped off by counterfeit Twitter handles.

1087
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:09,880
Make sure if you're calling a taxi, it's not just a guy in a big dispatcher in the passenger seat.

1088
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,880
It's a number one scam in Napa Valley.

1089
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:21,880
So McGruff responded to this question with like kind of darting eyes and can you imagine?

1090
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,880
So McGruff's on board.

1091
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:29,880
I think we talk about wanting official properties and McGruff might be closest we're going to get.

1092
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,880
I mean, let me just start. I don't want to jump on anybody.

1093
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:41,880
But while I have the idea, we never got that Dick Tracy Crime Stoppers attraction, which felt like maybe a similar conceit to Spider-Man where like there's crooks on the loose.

1094
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,880
Get out into the street.

1095
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,880
You thought you were just going to do some kind of test vehicle and target practice or like Men in Black.

1096
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:51,880
But, you know, something like that with McGruff, we're like, now I need you out on the street.

1097
00:57:51,880 --> 00:58:04,880
And then you're capturing like, you know, people selling their own paint outside a paint store instead of letting it get mixed properly.

1098
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,880
They're not. Look at them.

1099
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,880
They're not using the real shake it up machine.

1100
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,880
Improperly mixed paint is a scourge in America.

1101
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:19,880
You may not notice it in the first decade after you paint, but in year 11, it'll start peeling and cracking all over your lawn.

1102
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:24,880
Sherwin Williams was a great American who deserves his company to be respected.

1103
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,880
Listen up. You need to get in McGruff's squad car.

1104
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:34,880
We're tackling the scourge of counterfeit salon quality hair products.

1105
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:45,880
Here's why you shouldn't buy Paul Mitchell shampoos or conditioners from from stores that aren't salons or have salons in them.

1106
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:50,880
Don't trust third party sellers on Amazon to have the real thing.

1107
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,880
Watch. I'll blast one in front of you with a lighter.

1108
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,880
Look at a fireball. Look out.

1109
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,880
Trying to condition my coat with this garbage.

1110
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,880
Give me a fucking break.

1111
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,880
Wrong shade of brown. Now I look like a dope.

1112
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,880
You just want to thicken your fur, but you end up burning your scalp.

1113
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:15,880
Trust Alta only buy things that Alta or super cuts.

1114
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,880
Super cuts is a great store.

1115
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,880
What is it? You can't call it crime stoppers.

1116
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:26,880
What is it? It's like, yeah, it's McGruff's grievance.

1117
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,880
Copyright grievances.

1118
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,880
McGruff's grievance.

1119
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,880
Don't counterfeit Marvel t-shirts.

1120
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,880
Stan and Jack wouldn't like it.

1121
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,880
It could certainly be all McGruff's.

1122
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,880
McGruff's fake busters.

1123
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,880
How about that? Yeah, he's busting fakes.

1124
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:48,880
And it's the most like grimy city where you're like, oh, God, is somebody going to offer me drugs or am I going to get shot?

1125
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:54,880
But what makes it grimy is just that around every turn there's a bootleg Bart shirt.

1126
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

1127
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:59,880
An early copy of Taca Maverick.

1128
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:04,880
Between real vintage and vintage style shirts.

1129
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,880
Vintage style is just lifting designs and printing it on gilded.

1130
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:16,880
There's a kid using a torrent to download the entire series of taxi from 1970.

1131
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,880
That money should go in that window. Shoot him.

1132
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,880
James L. Brooks should be getting that money.

1133
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:23,880
Not the actors.

1134
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,880
Poor, don't you.

1135
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:29,880
Before you commit that crime, think about Babalu Mandel.

1136
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:34,880
He worked hard to develop his voice as a comedy writer.

1137
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,880
He didn't have city slickers money yet.

1138
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,880
He was grinding it out.

1139
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,880
Yeah, so every, it's just a lot of those.

1140
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:44,880
It's a lot of low key stuff.

1141
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,880
Those windows are a little too tinted.

1142
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,880
There should be a little.

1143
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,880
They put the tint on themselves.

1144
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,880
Yeah, the rule says 75% visibility.

1145
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,880
These look like 85%.

1146
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,880
Let's get into 100. Blast the window.

1147
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,880
Crash.

1148
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,880
And then they're all tied up at the end.

1149
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:11,880
You got them all like at the end of Spider-Man, but it's they're all 15 years old.

1150
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,880
They don't really understand what happened.

1151
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,880
They're looking at their like, is that a crime?

1152
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:17,880
It sure is.

1153
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,880
Only one way to learn, bucko.

1154
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:25,880
Anyone who makes Wayfarer style sunglasses that are not the official Ray-Ban company

1155
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,880
should be put in jail.

1156
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:32,880
If you buy Disney pins on Amazon, you're getting put away for good.

1157
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,880
Jason Sheridan.

1158
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:35,880
Money.

1159
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:42,880
The money, the money received by scrapper pin salesmen are used to buy cocaine and firearms.

1160
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,880
Scrapper pins are a scourge.

1161
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:51,880
Don't wear scrapper pins on your fancy little vest.

1162
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,880
Disneyland people.

1163
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,880
I'll know I can spot a fancy little vest.

1164
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,880
I still carry a 1990 phone book and it's coming right for your head.

1165
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,880
If I spot a scrapper pin.

1166
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:05,880
It's my girl.

1167
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,880
Shoot the pins.

1168
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:12,880
If you end up hurting the person behind the pins, well, they're hurting the world.

1169
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,880
Collateral damage.

1170
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,880
Michael Chicklis is McGruff.

1171
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,880
Yeah, so that's great.

1172
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:23,880
I mean, you want to do something quick and then I mean, that's the ultimate.

1173
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,880
I think we could get this done.

1174
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,880
I just don't know where and how.

1175
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:28,880
Yeah, we could look.

1176
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,880
McGruff is obviously good friends with us now.

1177
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:32,880
Has he ever heard the show?

1178
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:33,880
I don't know.

1179
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,880
No, I'm not sure.

1180
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,880
That's the big question out there.

1181
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:44,880
But we'll find out when we start proposing, when we start sending like the here's the chord sheets to the songs that we're making.

1182
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,880
McGruff, has he heard the song about hookup apps?

1183
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:56,880
Has he heard that my characterization of him is that he doesn't want to talk to a woman before they get married?

1184
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,880
I don't know.

1185
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:04,880
Don't go to Napa and drive drunk if you're the husband of the Speaker of the House of America.

1186
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,880
Paul Pelosi is a great man.

1187
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,880
We all make mistakes.

1188
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,880
It was tricked by the liquor companies.

1189
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,880
Stop the advertising, I say.

1190
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,880
Put the guy making bootleg Bart behind bars, not Paul Pelosi.

1191
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,880
Great American.

1192
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,880
Pelosi claps so low.

1193
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,880
Turn those hands weird.

1194
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,880
One more to go out on.

1195
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,880
Sure. Yeah, I don't know.

1196
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:33,880
Is there another McGruff?

1197
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:34,880
There is another McGruff.

1198
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,880
I think it's the it's just like please do this.

1199
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,880
This is boy, this is overwhelming.

1200
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:43,880
Hey, are you want to you want your you want your honey?

1201
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,880
Yeah, I got a gripe.

1202
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,880
How would you plus up rock and roller coaster, aka the bad boys of Bust in the Ride?

1203
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,880
How will we plus it up?

1204
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:52,880
It's hard when it's perfect.

1205
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:53,880
Let's see, though.

1206
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,880
I guess there's always room for improvement.

1207
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,880
First of all, OK, there is actually a lot to be done here.

1208
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:04,880
Number one, all Aerosmith songs possible are available to hear on the ride.

1209
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:10,880
Cycle through their entire discography on rock and roller coaster, not just the whatever five or four.

1210
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:15,880
You can listen to because they own the Nimglue song from Epic.

1211
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,880
Listen, people.

1212
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,880
So you could I want I want that on there.

1213
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,880
Yeah. And even like live tracks.

1214
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:28,880
There's a track that Steven Tyler keeps posting a clip from of Jeff Goldblum playing big 10 inch record with them.

1215
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:33,880
From like back in the seemingly the Jurassic Park days, it looks like it's 20, 20 years old.

1216
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:37,880
And Jeff Goldblum playing like the piano while Steven Tyler shirtless and singing.

1217
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:43,880
That was Aerosmith, the musical guest when Jeff Goldblum hosted Saturday Night Live in that era.

1218
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,880
That might be true.

1219
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,880
Oh, sure. Yeah. So they could have been there.

1220
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:48,880
Maybe they got to be buddies.

1221
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:53,880
But yeah, it was some live on stage and Goldblum's like, you know, hamming it up, playing that song on the piano.

1222
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,880
And they're going everything from honking on Bobo.

1223
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,880
Well, yes, honking on Bobo, their blues or their old.

1224
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,880
Yeah, their old blues cover album.

1225
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:01,880
Oh, is that what it is?

1226
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:02,880
Oh, yeah.

1227
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,880
That was the most of my alley thing honking on Bobo is all covers.

1228
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,880
I do know that.

1229
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,880
So, yeah, all the songs available.

1230
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:15,880
Now, the thing is on the rock and roller coaster, I like the ride vehicles.

1231
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,880
I like the ride itself.

1232
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:23,880
I like the neon, but there's not enough Aerosmith like the people on the ride.

1233
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,880
So robots, robots.

1234
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,880
I think that's probably the best way to do it.

1235
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,880
But I will also because I am budget conscious.

1236
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:41,880
I will also take like 40 feet high, like wooden painted pictures of all the musicians from the different eras as we're going by as well.

1237
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:50,880
So if it's too hard to do robots because they're going to be you're going so fast, maybe just like 40 foot picture of Joey Kramer,

1238
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,880
like painted a painted picture of Joey Kramer, like kind of waving at you as you go by.

1239
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,880
You could do the Mr. Incredible and credit coaster approach.

1240
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:03,880
Yeah, but it could be more like even like kind of like street art version of Joey Kramer, like painted.

1241
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:09,880
But yeah, also maybe Mr. Incredible where it's just a static Joey Kramer and he's like he's got his coffee is his coffee.

1242
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,880
He's holding it out to you as you go by or something.

1243
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,880
So they could add stuff like that.

1244
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,880
I'm on Wikipedia just trying to find out when they last put an album out, which has been a long time.

1245
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:20,880
It has been a long time.

1246
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,880
There's a there's a section of the Wikipedia.

1247
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:29,880
It's very confusing because it starts with Tyler Perry feud and then such and such tour, which I forgot Tyler Joe.

1248
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,880
That is now I've realized that is their last.

1249
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:35,880
It isn't that the band Aerosmith in full had a feud with Tyler Perry.

1250
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:36,880
Right.

1251
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,880
I would love to know what about what we got.

1252
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,880
What got them disagreeing?

1253
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:48,880
Did they try to do a song using media esk language, gaburam or whatever?

1254
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,880
They played his birthday and they did a parody song.

1255
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:58,880
They did a parody of Jayden like, hey, my dear, what a one to one.

1256
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,880
Yeah, he's got a gun.

1257
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,880
Gonna teach discipline.

1258
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,880
There you go.

1259
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,880
Uh huh.

1260
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:15,880
So, you know, what would be good, actually, because it does like the band is they seem to hate each other.

1261
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:19,880
I don't know necessarily when it comes to like Bradley Whitford and stuff like what.

1262
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,880
But like Joey Kramer was kicked out of the band a year or two ago.

1263
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,880
He tried to go to the rehearsal and a security guard blocked him.

1264
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:26,880
Where do you think you're going?

1265
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,880
Because he had some sort of illness or something.

1266
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,880
And then they were like, I don't think you can cut it on the drums anymore, pal.

1267
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:32,880
And then he was like, this is my band.

1268
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:33,880
I should be in the band.

1269
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:35,880
And then they were like blocking him from it.

1270
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:39,880
So like there was issues with him and there was issues with Joe and Stephen constantly.

1271
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:47,880
So I think they should represent the tumultuous relationship they all have with each other somehow.

1272
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,880
And I'm trying to figure out how to do that.

1273
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:56,880
There should be some should be some chaos as the chaos like the lawnmower on the revenue.

1274
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,880
This is a sign to wrap it up.

1275
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,880
Did you have one more Jason?

1276
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,880
Sorry, you just have to put up with that putting back there.

1277
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:04,880
If you hear it.

1278
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,880
I lost it.

1279
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:08,880
We don't have to.

1280
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:09,880
All right.

1281
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:10,880
I got it.

1282
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:18,880
Brian BJ Higgins at BJ Higgins asks, the disco Yeti is arguably the opposite of a plus up, a minus down.

1283
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:24,880
The arm swing is clearly superior that the overall impact on the attraction isn't huge.

1284
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:31,880
As with B mode Kylo Ren in a ship, a first time guest might not notice, but fandom will have opinions.

1285
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:37,880
If you were tasked with minusing down an attraction, which ride and element would you choose?

1286
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,880
The ride itself shouldn't be fundamentally changed.

1287
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,880
Just one aspect essentially has to be in B mode for the ride's lifespan.

1288
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,880
Whoa, an acceptable step down.

1289
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,880
Wow. Yeah, that is tough.

1290
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:50,880
That's fascinating.

1291
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:57,880
We are taking something away, but it's not, you know, this won't be my answer, but I was saying on Buzz Lightyear, I wouldn't mind if it looked worse.

1292
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:03,880
I was comfortable with a lot of the elements of Buzz Lightyear looking worse because I was so focused on the gaming part of it.

1293
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,880
But that's not going to be my answer.

1294
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,880
But something in that vein, perhaps.

1295
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:11,880
Oh, yeah.

1296
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:19,880
Looking like, because the problem with the Kylo Ren example is that that's such a big part.

1297
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,880
It is fun to watch the things blow out behind him.

1298
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,880
So it's tough to know.

1299
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,880
It's interesting. You can go a lot of ways with your logic here is what I'm trying to articulate.

1300
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,880
We do have to think about like what's a big...

1301
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,880
It's like Navi Shaman of Song is a big one.

1302
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,880
That can't go. That can't be in B mode.

1303
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:41,880
No, I mean, I think I've been on rides and we're on Guardians of the Galaxy mission breakout.

1304
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:44,880
And sometimes at the rocket animatronic isn't working.

1305
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,880
There's a video of him that plays.

1306
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,880
I'm sure the people of writing it for the first time didn't really notice.

1307
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,880
Yeah, but that bums me out.

1308
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:52,880
It bums me out.

1309
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:53,880
Yeah, I hate that.

1310
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:59,880
I think I think a star tour is alternative where C3PO is broken or dead.

1311
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:04,880
And a voice has to come in and say, bad news, everyone.

1312
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,880
C3PO no more.

1313
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,880
Whatever the... I don't know the years in Star Wars, but like...

1314
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,880
C3PO has been compromised to a permanent end.

1315
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:13,880
And then he's there.

1316
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:18,880
Then you have to watch his unmoving body and all the same things could happen.

1317
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,880
But like, and how do you fill the space?

1318
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:26,880
I guess that's maybe that's R2 mode, like the way that you could do Chewie mode on Millennium Falcon.

1319
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:33,880
So it's just R2 beeps with an occasional like, if you're interested in attending the memorial service.

1320
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,880
For C3PO.

1321
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,880
Thank you for everything.

1322
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,880
Today we salute a cold robot.

1323
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:45,880
Close cast it, but we are putting his red arm on top of the casket.

1324
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:48,880
Yeah, kills.

1325
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,880
Yeah, in canon kills C3PO.

1326
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,880
That's fun.

1327
01:10:52,880 --> 01:11:00,880
Maybe if the country bears robots weren't working and they said, we need someone from the audience to get up and sing for you instead of the bears.

1328
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,880
Oh, inviting, having a mode where you just invite people up.

1329
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:04,880
Yeah.

1330
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,880
And then possible that being the tallest person in the room.

1331
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,880
That's right. Me maybe.

1332
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:10,880
Follow the bouncing ball.

1333
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,880
And then it would still be pretty fun.

1334
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:17,880
I mean, I guess you would still like you would have limp bears dangling.

1335
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:18,880
Like they would still be there somewhat.

1336
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:24,880
I guess you could hide them, but you could say like, oh, we're going to try to bring the bears to get them, get them awake.

1337
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,880
They're singing and then you don't at the end, but it was still fun to try.

1338
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,880
Okay.

1339
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:33,880
But yeah, it's tough because because B mode is always reserved for something so special.

1340
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:42,880
I mean, Disneyland Tomorrowland, the whole area has kind of been stuck in B mode for like 15 years or so.

1341
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:43,880
20 years.

1342
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:44,880
Yeah.

1343
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:45,880
But yeah, I'm trying.

1344
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:48,880
I'm sure it'll get I'll figure it out later.

1345
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:56,880
But if there was some sort of element where something being broken actually made it creepy or weird and there was an element that's good.

1346
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:57,880
I got it. I got it.

1347
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,880
The riverboat scene at Splash Mountain.

1348
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,880
Sometimes everyone is just, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1349
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:07,880
Sometimes none of the animatronics are moving and that is kind of more haunting.

1350
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,880
So no song. It's just a bunch of and you put in.

1351
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:12,880
No, the song is playing.

1352
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,880
But I'm saying maybe you justify it.

1353
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:15,880
That just seems like an accident.

1354
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:22,880
But in B mode, you just turn it off and it's just crickets and maybe a little bit of unsettling banjo like deliverance as their creepy eyes.

1355
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,880
The ride is creepy as hell.

1356
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,880
For a few reasons.

1357
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:33,880
But like it is it is not a place I want to end if I was just rolling a canoe past that boat, I'd be like, how fast can I go?

1358
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:36,880
Why are all these pigs and crocodiles alive?

1359
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:44,880
Because like the walls, all the things that have broken on the ride, I think over the years have added to it being this just weird, weird vibe in there.

1360
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,880
But yeah, at the end, what's the weirdest vibe is just a bunch of static animals.

1361
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:55,880
Mid like high kick in there and they're like whatever saloon dresses.

1362
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:01,880
What happened? Is there some like just atomic wave and froze them all in position?

1363
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:07,880
Yeah. Oh, if you swap out the audio, there is audio, but it's just a test pattern.

1364
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:11,880
If it's just like color bars, like a set level.

1365
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:15,880
That's good. Oh, yeah.

1366
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:20,880
Like it's so the the apocalypse came to Splash Mountain.

1367
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,880
Yeah, like the kids in the hall, like the DJ at the end of the world.

1368
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:25,880
Yeah, it's all sketch.

1369
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:29,880
The new time is run out here at the Chickapin Hill.

1370
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,880
I like that. Well, I think that's I think that's plenty.

1371
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,880
Thanks, everybody, for your for your questions.

1372
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,880
So, Wade, and the one was the Aerosmith one.

1373
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,880
Austin, all the egos. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for your questions.

1374
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,880
You survived podcast, the ride.

1375
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:49,880
Thanks for subscribing to the second gate. And hey, with all of this listener interaction, don't forget that we have a new tier.

1376
01:13:49,880 --> 01:14:00,880
If you want to dig even deeper, you can join us on our new patron tier club three, where you get one more bonus episode every month and our regular episodes ad free that extra bonus episode, of course, voted on by the audience.

1377
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:05,880
We've gotten so many great ideas. It's actually some business we got to do now, not on the show.

1378
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:10,880
Although if you want us to release the deciding the topics, that's extra content.

1379
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,880
That could be arranged. But there was this question.

1380
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:19,880
I don't know if we even want to answer this, but just in the interest of talking about Club 3, this is from Chad.

1381
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,880
Hey, hey, I don't know how to say your name. I'm sorry.

1382
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,880
He had hidden peanuts. Chad H.

1383
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:28,880
What inevitable listener voted topic are you dreading the most for Club 3?

1384
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,880
Oh, yeah. Or what do you want to steer people toward?

1385
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:39,880
And I don't know that we want to nudge the votes at this point, but I I'm intrigued by the possibility of punishment.

1386
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:43,880
I haven't seen a lot yet that I've done. I'm like, oh, Jesus, no, not that.

1387
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:48,880
But I think we have to be open to the idea that we're getting torture.

1388
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:56,880
I feel like as the years go, like I feel like I just discovered the other the other second gate we're recording today.

1389
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,880
I was going down the rabbit holes of what else?

1390
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:05,880
And I discovered videos of other stage shows I'd never heard of TV specials.

1391
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:15,880
So I think there's a lot of those stockpiled TV specials, parades, a big time weird forgotten movies.

1392
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:25,880
I mean, we've gotten a couple that have been like the dollar store versions of a movie release or like the ones your distant relative would be like, look, I got you Aladdin.

1393
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:31,880
And it's like, well, it's called a ladder, but it's something they write.

1394
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:41,880
Oh, yeah, I was just telling in front of the show Andrew Griswold about the movie I saw at the library called Pets Three, not Secret Life of Pets, not a secret sequel to Secret Life of Pets, which is called Pets Three.

1395
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:50,880
It's just pets, CGI pets who never move from their one position watching clips of real filmed pets getting in hijinks.

1396
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,880
Yeah, I'll look at that. I'll talk about Pets Three.

1397
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:57,880
Yeah, but I yeah, I don't want to give the hints of how what could be torture.

1398
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:07,880
All I want to do is say if you want to send us in some bizarre directions and give us viewing homework, we love that you Jason wants to build up his his cue his video bullshit.

1399
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:08,880
Q.

1400
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,880
Watch later playlist.

1401
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,880
Very handy feature.

1402
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,880
I love is insane is totally insane.

1403
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:20,880
Yeah, because I started adding if I was working on show stuff and I didn't want to lose track of video.

1404
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:21,880
I started putting stuff in there.

1405
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:25,880
But then if I added too much other stuff, but just generally interesting gets buried.

1406
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:29,880
So now I have a PTR playlist for me to also reference.

1407
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:30,880
I was like, don't lose this.

1408
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,880
Mike, you've been saying buried like Jason.

1409
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:37,880
Is everything is anything wrong?

1410
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:39,880
The shows are really taken.

1411
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,880
I don't want to be so cruel, but the show's really taken a nose dive.

1412
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,880
You're saying buried.

1413
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,880
You're going to it's all going to crumble.

1414
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,880
All right. Thanks for listening, everybody. Bye bye.
