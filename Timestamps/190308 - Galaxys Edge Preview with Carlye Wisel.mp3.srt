1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,040
Warning, the following podcast contains souvenir pricing estimates, operations questions that

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:17,520
Disney refuses to answer, construction speculation, and oh yeah, I guess some talk about, you know,

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,800
rides and stuff.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,120
Our guest, Carly Weisel, has been to Galaxy's Edge and lived to share the tale on today's

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,120
podcast, The Ride.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:51,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three men who'd rather have

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,840
an appetizer at the upcoming Epcot space restaurant than talk to a real astronaut.

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,920
My name is Mike Carlson.

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,640
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,960
Yeah, I would agree with that.

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,200
Yep, Scott Gardner also here.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,320
But I disagree because I would really like to talk to Buzz Aldrin, but not about going

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,400
to space, but rather about when he performed She Blinded Me with Science live with Thomas

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,480
Dolby and he was the old man doing science.

17
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,080
And there's one part where he gets it wrong.

18
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,280
He clearly has barely been coached in this and instead he says, silence.

19
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,400
And he does it like a beat late.

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,380
It's one of my, it's my favorite, one of my favorite videos that I, that is not viral

21
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,120
that I wish was viral.

22
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,280
Late Buzz Aldrin saying silence.

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
How old is it?

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,000
A couple of years ago.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,440
And Thomas Dolby's playing a crazy like little like, you know, pack strapped over his chest.

26
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,720
He's like hitting the drum pads and it's a funky little version of it.

27
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,720
It's pretty good.

28
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:56,320
And Buzz Aldrin, clearly Buzz Aldrin not familiar with this pop hit of 1982.

29
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,680
So I would like to talk to Buzz about that.

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,080
I'll skip the space part though.

31
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,080
Okay, yeah.

32
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,080
Who gives a shit about space?

33
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,840
But those appetizers are going to be really good.

34
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,000
Yes, I've got space.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,200
Still prioritizing those.

36
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
Absolutely.

37
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,200
We have a guest today.

38
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,400
Let's bring her in because we have a ton to talk about.

39
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,480
Folks, you know where she's a prominent theme park journalist.

40
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,520
Please welcome Carly Weisel.

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Hi.

42
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,000
Hey, welcome to the show.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Thank you for being here.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm thrilled.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,040
Yeah, we're very excited.

46
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,760
There's a lot of stuff you've done.

47
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,040
I will say you did just do something that's insanely exciting that we're very jealous

48
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,040
of.

49
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,560
We're of course talking about you being on the Disney Dish podcast with Jim Hill and

50
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
Lentesta.

51
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,960
I'm not gonna lie, career highlight.

52
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
I agree.

53
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
I'm very exciting.

54
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,440
Exclusive dream that not everybody...

55
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,320
I don't know, it was like the closest I'll ever come to sitting on the couch at Kimmel.

56
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,320
You know what I mean?

57
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,800
This was really my Hollywood moment to be in the middle of the internet.

58
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,760
Well, and it's funny that you bring up the talk show thing and I was thinking about that

59
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:04,680
because we reached out to you to talk about some other stuff besides all that.

60
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,440
And your response was, I would love to come on.

61
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,760
I should tell you that I am doing Jim and Len.

62
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,280
And I was like, huh, is this the beginning of a 90s Leno Letterman-esque guestbooking

63
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,280
war?

64
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,240
I'll be the first of two there, just wanted to let you know.

65
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,960
I just wondered, does it start to become that, you know, like, do they start now?

66
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,960
You chose them first and we respect that.

67
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
Well, they did ask first.

68
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
They did ask first.

69
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,840
They were on the ball.

70
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,960
But does it start becoming...

71
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,160
They get Jeff Garland and they get...

72
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,080
Yeah, Jim and Len poached Jeff Garland from us.

73
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,080
We have him scheduled, but obviously he's like, I can't do it!

74
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,200
Do it, Jim and Len!

75
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,600
He wouldn't disrupt everything to go to Celebration Florida?

76
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,480
Well, it depends.

77
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,080
There may be a whole thing, Len may have a private jet we don't know about.

78
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,560
He starts flying guests out.

79
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,640
Who knows how bad this war is going to get.

80
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
We don't have a jet.

81
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
We don't have a jet.

82
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,880
And then suddenly we ask one of our significant others, Aaron or Lindsay, to be on and they're

83
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,880
like, oh, you know what?

84
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
I'm doing Disneyland.

85
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
I'm doing Disneyland.

86
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Come on, no.

87
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,680
Aaron will only do Disney dish.

88
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,680
I just like their show better.

89
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,480
Jim and Len seem more pleasant than you guys do.

90
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
I know.

91
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
I'm so sorry.

92
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,480
It's just that's the way it is.

93
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
We understand.

94
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
We understand.

95
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
How was...

96
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
How did you...

97
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
You went on to talk about the...

98
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,120
Some of the Star Wars rides that you may have heard about.

99
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,320
Yes, the hottest planet in the galaxy.

100
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
Is that right?

101
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Yes.

102
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,320
How was your...

103
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
Tell us about...

104
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
Tell us about...

105
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,720
Well, I do think that you guys are way more interested in hearing about going on the Disney

106
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,720
dish than...

107
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,840
When we're leading with it, just because we knew we wanted to give a lot of time to it.

108
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,960
And if we have overrun time, also address some of these Star Wars...

109
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
If we get there, yes.

110
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,960
We don't like...

111
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,560
We keep our own pace.

112
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,960
We don't like the machinations of giant hyper corporations to drive our content.

113
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:09,120
So, you know, when all this news came out, I think at least my reaction was, oh, god

114
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,280
damn it, we have to do an episode about this.

115
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,280
Geez.

116
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,080
We just did one about the entryway and the Today Show Cafe and all that.

117
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,880
Listen, you know, I have a gripe about that because I think I'm the only person in this

118
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,040
business who is psyched about the Today Show Cafe.

119
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
Oh, yeah.

120
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
We did just talk about a little...

121
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,040
I am.

122
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,640
It does seem like the food is a higher quality level than what Universal has been offering.

123
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,480
Before, I think it was that Beverly Hills Boulangerie or whatever.

124
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Yes.

125
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
I'm pretty sure.

126
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
What's the place?

127
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,920
It's a place that I have never eaten food from.

128
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,480
I assumed it was just like the Tinseltown Cafe.

129
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,480
It was like a nothing.

130
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
Yes.

131
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,480
It was like an airport sandwich where everything's focaccia.

132
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
It was kind of like that.

133
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,480
All right.

134
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
And I don't know.

135
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,480
I like Al Roker.

136
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,360
I'm very curious about what food he will feed me.

137
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,400
I'm sure there's going to be some brown rice with an edamame.

138
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,720
It'll be something kind of healthy.

139
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,000
Did you get it on an email?

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Did you get the press release?

141
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You get all the press releases, right?

142
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes.

143
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You probably get more than we do.

144
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Well, that's the thing.

145
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,600
They don't really email you lately.

146
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
They'll just throw it up.

147
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,520
I mean, at least for Disney, they'll throw it on the Parks blog and then you'll freak

148
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,520
out if you miss something.

149
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
Oh, really?

150
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,520
I'll definitely come to us.

151
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,240
Though I do get a lot of press releases about animals being born in Animal Kingdom.

152
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
Oh, really?

153
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,240
That is fun.

154
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
Yeah.

155
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
But I'm also like...

156
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Any good ones lately?

157
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,560
I mean, I got a press release about a new giraffe and I got a press release about the

158
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,000
kid city at Epcot and that was basically it.

159
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Interesting.

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,600
So far we've been shut out of any sort of Disney official press releases.

161
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,400
Universal, both coasts are very...

162
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Oh, wow.

163
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,040
They send us a ton of press releases and stuff.

164
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,920
And Mike got an exclusive interview.

165
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,000
I got to interview the Grinch a few months ago.

166
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh my God.

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What a get.

168
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yep.

169
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah.

170
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So Universal is...

171
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
They're very friendly to both.

172
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So far Disney is not...

173
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,920
We would love those press releases about the animals being born because we would...

174
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
I'll see what I can do.

175
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,360
We could get two hours out of every one of those, certainly.

176
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,080
We do have so many questions for you about your general career covering the parks and

177
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,120
we were saying it does seem like you're always at one.

178
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,520
You're traveling around a ton.

179
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,520
Yeah.

180
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,840
I spend a lot of my free time in Florida alone, which for most people would be a red flag,

181
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,680
but for me is just another day at work.

182
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
Sure.

183
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
You did...

184
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,520
Because I was looking at your Instagram live videos and it was a week or two ago and you

185
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,400
were doing something that I was very on board with and I think Scott would be very stressed

186
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
out by.

187
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,720
You were there for a very limited amount of time and I'm not exactly...

188
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
You'll fill it in.

189
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,160
And you were just going somewhere so you could get to Epcot maybe for a few hours.

190
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,440
Do I have the story at all correct?

191
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,280
Yeah, you have it pretty correct.

192
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:51,160
So okay, a long story made probably very long by the end of it, but I had to be in Sarasota,

193
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,000
Florida on the 15th of February.

194
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,400
It takes a whole day to fly from LA to Florida, as you guys probably know, like west coast

195
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
east coast whole day.

196
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,440
So I had to fly out the day before so I could drive the next day, but it was Valentine's

197
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,240
Day and I thought it was very sad to spend Valentine's Day alone on a flight.

198
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,720
Keep in mind I am married, but that did not factor into my plans to go to Florida alone.

199
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,080
So I thought I will wake up at, I think I woke up at 5 a.m. to take a 710 flight to

200
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,640
Florida and then after I got a rental car, all said and done, I had four hours to cram

201
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,800
a solo Walt Disney World vacation in and I did it.

202
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,480
Yeah, I really did it.

203
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,600
I like this is the thing this gets like of the show.

204
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,320
I mean, Jason, I think there's a spectrum here of people that like to do something like

205
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,040
that. That's insane. I think I'm the one who likes to do something like that.

206
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,720
The most Jason next then Scott.

207
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,840
I think that stresses him out.

208
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,560
Oh, I don't wait.

209
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't know what you're saying though, because me just just spending four hours in

210
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,920
Epcot or something that sounds I'm also the guy who likes to just pop in.

211
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,400
That's true too.

212
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,240
No, I crammed a whole vacation.

213
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,200
You crossed the border.

214
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,000
She did the full.

215
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,560
Oh, yeah.

216
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,800
You like, yeah, that would not be wild.

217
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,600
Would not be on my.

218
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,400
Well, what did you do?

219
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,840
How did that play out?

220
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,320
OK, so I got the car took way too long.

221
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,680
Very stressed about it.

222
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,880
I changed into Florida clothes in the driver's seat of the rental car, went straight to Epcot.

223
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,640
Clothes and shirts that said Florida.

224
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Oh, no, like warm weather stuff.

225
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,120
OK.

226
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,840
No, I wish.

227
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,080
Sure.

228
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,000
I mean, like a casual Mickey Mouse sweatshirt.

229
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,040
You should have one in a go bag at all times anyway.

230
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,320
You never know when you'll suddenly end up.

231
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,080
I mean, I'd laugh to just put a Disney parks poncho in my trunk yesterday being like, who knows?

232
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,880
Yeah, because if you're anywhere nearby, you might as well pop down.

233
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:36,400
So I drove very fast to Epcot and then I sped walked to the Germany Pavilion of the World

234
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,000
Showcase to get caramel corn because that's stop one.

235
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,720
Oh, stop one.

236
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,760
And then I ran into a friend, which was great, but it cut about 45 minutes off of my time.

237
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,240
Oh, yeah.

238
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,360
Just very stressful.

239
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,240
Human contact.

240
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,960
I don't know about this.

241
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,640
No, it was it was fun.

242
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,200
It was worth it.

243
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,080
I was happy to see him.

244
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,000
And then I walked so quickly back to my car and then I was going to.

245
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,280
That was it at Epcot.

246
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:57,840
Oh, yeah.

247
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,120
Just caramel corn and that way.

248
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,920
Very efficient.

249
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,080
Wow.

250
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,720
Yeah, I know.

251
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,520
Yeah, I don't.

252
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,800
I really don't understand.

253
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,600
Well, keep in mind, I spend a lot of time in Florida.

254
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,000
Right.

255
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,920
I was there like three weeks before that.

256
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,480
Of course.

257
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,120
Oh, OK.

258
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,280
Yeah.

259
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:09,920
Well, there you go.

260
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
So then I was driving back.

261
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,280
I was driving in the Magic Kingdom and I was like, I can't do it.

262
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,400
And I just turned.

263
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,720
I just took a left and I went back and I went to Fort Wilderness because I wanted fried chicken.

264
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:21,520
Wow.

265
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,040
Yes.

266
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,520
And so there is a specific fried chicken in Fort Wilderness.

267
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:25,760
Yeah.

268
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,840
So the Hoop-Dee-Doo musical review.

269
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,440
I don't know if you guys are lucky enough to have experienced the weirdest show ever.

270
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,520
It's the longest running show at Disney World.

271
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,640
I almost did it.

272
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,360
I went with two friends last March and I was like, hey, would you guys want to go to the Hoop-Dee-Doo

273
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,080
music review?

274
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,560
When I was a child, I went.

275
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,360
I think it also holds in a record, at least in America.

276
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,880
I think the Agatha Christie play is at the Mouse Trap.

277
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,040
It's like still running in England for like 60 years straight.

278
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,320
Something crazy like that.

279
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,240
Is some sort of like the most consecutive performances record that Hoop-Dee-Doo has set.

280
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,560
Yes.

281
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,360
In America.

282
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,960
Simpsons of live entertainment.

283
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,200
Except a bit more dated.

284
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,520
Oh, so they saw the old show.

285
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,040
They haven't even updated the show at all.

286
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah.

287
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,400
Do you have an example of that?

288
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,280
What's the dated?

289
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,760
Well, they're all acting kind of like the show just rolled up through town and it's

290
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,480
very Western and they're wearing like period dress.

291
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,440
I like that.

292
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,960
Yeah, but I do not like the show, which you just lost all of your listeners.

293
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,280
I apologize, but I love the fried chicken.

294
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,960
So did you see the show or did you get to go at the Hoop-Dee-Doo?

295
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,080
There is next to there is Trails End, which is a buffet, but inside Trails End is a to-go

296
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,680
counter where you can get the chicken to go.

297
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,000
Got it.

298
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,160
So I sat outside of a playground like a female pedophile, just eating a ton of chicken and

299
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,720
macaroni and cheese all alone on Valentine's Day and honestly loving every second of it.

300
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,800
It's the opening of Little Children 2.

301
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,200
It's a deep cut for the Little Children fans out there.

302
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,840
What is that?

303
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,800
Kate Winslet.

304
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,840
Isn't that what that's called?

305
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,480
Oh yeah.

306
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
Kate Winslet, Jackie Earl Haley movie.

307
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:04,720
Okay.

308
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,440
Never mind.

309
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,560
You might be probably right.

310
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,680
You are married though.

311
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,240
Yes, I am.

312
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,280
Yeah, that's so.

313
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,520
Did you just repeat that to yourself like a mantra?

314
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,480
It kind of it made it a safe space.

315
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,080
You know, I had something to lean back on.

316
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,200
I didn't only have my sad cup of macaroni and cheese.

317
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,600
There are other things in your life than a cup of mac and cheese.

318
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,080
So was that the extent of the four hours or did you cram more in there?

319
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,560
No, no, no.

320
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:26,800
Okay.

321
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,400
So after that, the problem is that for I'm so this is so boring.

322
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,160
Four Wilderness has an internal bus system, which I am not a fan of internal bus systems

323
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,040
at Walt Disney World.

324
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,000
No, no, no.

325
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

326
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,480
To get you to the specific lodging.

327
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,280
So then I had to wait for a bus to go back to the front of the campgrounds to get my car.

328
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,920
And then I was like, I got to catch Happily Ever After.

329
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:48,720
Right.

330
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,280
The Fireworks show.

331
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,400
The evening fireworks show.

332
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,440
So I foolishly goofed on what time it was at because it's usually at nine and I feel

333
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,560
like it was at 830, which was really upsetting.

334
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,200
And so I saw it from my car driving to the Magic Kingdom and it was great.

335
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,440
Oh.

336
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,400
It worked so thoroughly.

337
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,360
You have a little private shell for it, I guess.

338
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:07,760
That's kind of cool.

339
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,320
And I was in traffic, I think, because no one was driving because they were like,

340
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,760
look at the sky, it's exploding.

341
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,160
Right.

342
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,920
So I got to watch the show from my car and then I made it there and I sprinted to a fast

343
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,200
pass I had for Peter Pan.

344
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,600
And then I made it to Big Thunder, I think at like 850 and I had a fast pass set for that.

345
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,440
Then I just enjoy the rest of the night.

346
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,080
That's great.

347
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,920
I mean, I like it because I like the idea of that sounds like a mission, the whole thing.

348
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,680
It's not a pleasure, but it's a mission.

349
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,480
But I like a feeling of like time crunch.

350
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,040
I'm Ethan Hunt and then we have to get in and out and we have to do it.

351
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,320
Which I did the other day.

352
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,120
And listeners will hear on an upcoming episode in and out in three hours.

353
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,320
Maybe I don't want to spoil too much, but it involves two pizzas.

354
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,000
It involves $20.

355
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,440
Three hours.

356
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,320
Yeah, yeah, we can't spoil it.

357
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,920
It's a pretty big, it's a lot of, we make a lot of hay out of it, but Jason,

358
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,320
let's just say there's two pizzas involved.

359
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,440
That's we'll leave it at that.

360
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,560
Can I ask one question?

361
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:02,960
Yeah.

362
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,280
Do you really like pizza or was one very bad and you had to redo the experience?

363
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,600
Oh, it's a different angle than you're thinking.

364
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,480
But they were both pretty good.

365
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,360
But this is a killer tease for a future episode.

366
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,480
You know, people are going to be like, I know what the people want.

367
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,040
Yeah.

368
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,880
And I have a follow up question that I think people also want to hear.

369
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:36,640
Fried chicken at the trails end better than the Plaza chicken in Anaheim on Main Street.

370
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,640
Okay, so this is what I'm going to say.

371
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,960
The fried chicken at Hoop-Dee-Doo review is the superior chicken.

372
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,440
I think one, because it comes in a boneless bucket, which everything is that round of a bucket.

373
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,840
And two, I think because it's times for all that to be put on your table at the same time,

374
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,440
it's the perfect temperature.

375
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:55,840
Okay.

376
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,080
And sometimes with Plaza on a trails end, you get where there's just a few pieces left and it's kind

377
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,120
of sad. You get those like real like gross pieces of chicken.

378
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,680
Yeah.

379
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,200
So that's why I would say.

380
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh, but it's made with like dinner theater precision.

381
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,760
If you see the show, it all comes out at the same time, like a,

382
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,920
like a high end multi-course meal where they put everything on the table together.

383
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,360
That's like what we experienced at the pirates dinner adventure in Buena Park,

384
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,200
with the difference being that it sucked.

385
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,280
Besides that similar idea.

386
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,120
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense.

387
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,880
That is the most I ever feel like my mother and I don't do it off.

388
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,680
It is like, I, I see there's a fresh tray coming out. I'll wait a second.

389
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,400
Yes. Yeah.

390
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,280
My thoughts exactly.

391
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,480
But as I get older, I realized like, well, she is right. I mean, no skin off,

392
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,920
no skin off the workers. They're just going to dump the old ones and mix them up anyway.

393
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,760
Yeah. Why not?

394
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,320
I feel like we also have to, we have to ask you about this list that you just

395
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,800
posted where you have ranking.

396
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,960
Ranking the Disney world attractions.

397
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,640
Yes. I will mention that is an old list that got updated.

398
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,520
Oh, interesting.

399
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,520
Yeah. So I already kind of dealt with people sending me screenshots of cast members and

400
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,280
private discussions, making fun of me. And now it's all coming back again.

401
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:13,840
Oh no.

402
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,000
Interesting.

403
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,280
Oh, really are within the Facebook group for this show. I know this was posted and people had very

404
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:26,560
strong opinions. And this was sent to me by Mike, but by like, like, oh, this list, boy,

405
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,760
a lot of hot takes here. And I read it and I was like, yeah, sure. I don't know.

406
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,520
I wasn't too upset.

407
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,080
I got the list. I will say this. I got the list texted to me from a friend who lives in Illinois

408
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,400
that like knows I'm into this. And she was like, I think I'm trying to figure out exactly what was

409
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,000
the controversial order.

410
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,840
The only thing that I think everything for, depending on what person it is.

411
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,080
I guess that's the problem. The only thing I found offensive was country bears. So low,

412
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,280
but that's it. Other than that, I was like, okay, you really called me on here to answer for my sins.

413
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,880
This is where you're to get into the, uh, into the stuff.

414
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,120
I was wondering about the lit cause yeah, a lot of people were talking about it,

415
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,680
but like your top 10 very much made sense. And I,

416
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:17,440
like as I'm reading it, I mean, I think it's, uh, uh, working in media. I mean, we,

417
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:23,440
we try to be, I try to be self, uh, aware cognizant. You are writing for a large

418
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,560
general audience. Like travel and leisure is a general interest, like large audience magazine.

419
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,160
Yes. Full spectrum of fandom.

420
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,320
Also what's the, there is no list that makes everyone happy. Obviously.

421
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,160
No, there really isn't.

422
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,680
Cause like my list is country bears. Number one, but that's crazy.

423
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,600
Yeah. That is wildly inaccurate.

424
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,160
I'm searching my feelings and it's right. So how would that ever be a possible

425
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,960
in terms of, and that list is also not my personal list, right? Right. Right. Right.

426
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,200
Because personally, all I do is go on space mountain and I get a fast pass. This is a

427
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,720
Disney world and I go, Oh, no, no, no. I only write on the right-hand side. And then I make

428
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,560
them let me go to the right-hand side. And then I, depending on how I feel, I choose a certainty.

429
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,480
What's up with right-hand? What's right-hand side?

430
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,720
So I believe the right-hand side is the original track. And then they duplicated it on the left

431
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,360
and the left is generally where standby goes. But sometimes if the, cause they don't fill the whole

432
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,880
queue for the fast pass, they'll shove you to the left to go on the standby. And I don't stand for

433
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,400
them. Interesting. Do you think it's a better track or it's just more fun to go on the original?

434
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,800
I think that it's a better track. But also I know which way it leans. So it feels like home.

435
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,040
Oh, interesting. I got to do that.

436
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,120
Will it also beat you up?

437
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,240
Is bad.

438
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,800
Like, yeah.

439
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,640
It's a little like, they're both rough.

440
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,040
It is Space Mountain. Is there, is there a component, what, what have you found people

441
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,840
have like, have been upset about in that, in your rank?

442
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,880
Everyone just thinks I'm an idiot. It's just like the general consensus.

443
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,680
It's cause either it's, you know, a fan faction where they're like, you gotta,

444
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,760
you gotta lift up the old rides. Like the rides that people have a lot of nostalgia about.

445
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,760
And then I think everyone else just likes to hate, but I kind of tried to approach it as a,

446
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,560
you know, like what, like quintessential Disney attractions. Like, where is there a lot of story?

447
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,680
Where is there like a full range of experiences? Which is why I did one for Disneyland also.

448
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,640
And I put Splash Mountain one, even though I never go on Splash Mountain.

449
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,040
But I still think it's like, if you go to Disney and you ride one ride and you leave,

450
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,960
that'll give you the gist of what the park is.

451
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,520
Exactly. That's, I think I did Everest. Number one.

452
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,320
Yeah, I think that's right.

453
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,440
Yeah. Because if you, you know, if you show up to animal kingdom and you go on Everest,

454
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,520
I feel like you can figure out what Disney in 2019 is.

455
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:39,840
Right.

456
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,240
But people don't like that answer.

457
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,240
This is just like the one that Rolling Stone published, the top SNL cast members,

458
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,800
and everyone was upset. And obviously a list always is going to be controversial. So.

459
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,040
Big dis on Robert Downey Jr.

460
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,440
Robert Downey Jr. was like second to last or something?

461
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:55,840
Or the last.

462
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,840
He's like one of the country payers of the cast.

463
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,920
I guess. Pretty much the same thing.

464
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,240
Yeah.

465
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,240
I guess when you, when you talk about writing for a wider audience, yeah, I recognize it.

466
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,680
Wider, wider, not white.

467
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,040
Not white. No, no, no.

468
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,160
Yes, yes, let's just clarify that.

469
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:14,320
Oh, he's just a whites only. Oh my God. A wider audience. You, like,

470
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:21,600
I recognize that it requires levels to enjoy the carousel of progress. You have to be,

471
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,680
you have to have the disease where it's like, oh yeah, isn't it crazy and great that it's

472
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:34,640
VR that hasn't changed since 1994 for like a family from the Midwest visiting,

473
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,960
like that, like probably a seven year old child does not have the level of wait,

474
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:46,000
why is 1994 VR different than current VR? And why is that something I want to do whatsoever?

475
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,240
So I hear what you're.

476
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,280
I really have to code switch a bit, I guess, just kind of like,

477
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,080
cause I mean, you know, in the fan community, like I get everything that's going on,

478
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,480
but I can't really say that to someone who, you know, saves up for six years and goes to

479
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,680
Disney World. And they're like, I hear this carousel of progress is really tight.

480
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,360
And then they go in and are like, why are we trapped in this room for 45 minutes?

481
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,800
Yeah, it is crazy. Like, cause cause some of us are in our thirties. And we like,

482
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,960
imagine we weren't a nerd for theme parks. You just going into that right now today.

483
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,120
You didn't know much about Disney and you're in a theater and there's an old man talking about

484
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:25,760
an oven and that's the animatronic. He's talking about an old oven and what it was like to use an

485
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,120
old oven. And you're like, this is the thing everyone's been talking about.

486
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:35,120
Yeah. Then he shames his daughter in multiple ways through multiple decades. He mocks her

487
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,600
for costumes she's wearing and he explains the phenomenon of commuting.

488
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,680
And then they have like their uncles like drying out in a bath tub.

489
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,880
Uncle Larville, who gets no privacy for decades.

490
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,760
All this stuff that I've described, we love all the robot talking about an oven, but I guess a

491
00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:00,000
roller coaster is roller coaster might be there. He has broader appeal. It is so funny. Any, anytime

492
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,960
any list is published, it's I don't, there's never been a list where everyone was like,

493
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,480
that's it. That's the perfect one. You guys should just make like a prank list where it's all of your

494
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,640
favorites and everyone will agree with you and the internet will love you. Yeah. I think we talked

495
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:19,520
about that. We talked about, we are like UCB performer people from the upper instance brigade

496
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,240
theater, comedy theater, and we would improv there for many years. And I just wanted to do an

497
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,920
unpublished, like an unauthored anonymous list of the top improvisers in Los Angeles.

498
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,200
Just a list of names and like just soft public publishing and like never say who did it. Wait,

499
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,600
I think someone did do that. I think someone did do a similar thing later, but there was some

500
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,040
UCB list where it was like every performer and it was just unranked. I think someone did a,

501
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,640
maybe a bit, there was, it was more of a bit about like, you know, how they have like the

502
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,600
up and coming comedians or whatever. And I think that I think that's what you're talking about.

503
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,200
Yeah. They're like the best thousand comedians. Oh, yes. Well, that's an annual, this guy does

504
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,120
this annual bit of the top 1000 comedians. And last year, like now they're starting to be like

505
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,080
every year there's a different twist on it. Like last year it was all women. This year it was the

506
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,960
top 2000 finalists. And at the live show they would reveal the top 1000. I was happy to say

507
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:24,080
I was in the top 2000. I don't know. Yes. My entire sketch team made it in the top 2000. I don't know

508
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,720
if I made it into the top 1000. I still have to find the video. That's the funny,

509
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,320
nice, fun bit version. Mine was just going to be this weird thing that was going to drive everyone

510
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,640
nuts by ranking them. But you were going to put like, like, like Ian Roberts was going to be low,

511
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,480
but then like some random student was going to be like, yeah, yeah. Or like, yeah, yeah.

512
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,960
Matt Besser would be number like 15. And then like some kid who had been doing it for a year was one

513
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,160
ahead of him. I love that. I love that so much. This is where people of theater gets burnt down.

514
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:57,360
Yes. This article. Yeah, we didn't have it. But it was such a fun fantasy too. To imagine.

515
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,480
Better than the current where it happens for the insurance money.

516
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,080
And there's some problems at the theater financially.

517
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:12,640
I'm sorry. Anyway. So let, hey, I'm safe. If it's a, if the list is a dark memory, I'm sorry.

518
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,480
I was not expecting it to be promoted on Facebook. That's what happened.

519
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,480
Is it recently got promoted on Facebook? So I keep getting screenshots. Listen,

520
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,160
it's great. Listen, like I, the company gets a ton of clicks. Everyone's discussing Disney.

521
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:32,640
What's better? Yeah. Yeah. I appreciate the debates out. No one has sent me. There are some

522
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,920
very mean comments about me on the internet. Oh no. No one has sent me anyone. Yeah. If you

523
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:43,920
guys want a good time, check out my eater video series. It is dark. Oh no. No. No. Sorry about

524
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:49,360
that. What about YouTube comments? Oh yeah. And I fully looked at them and it was the thing is

525
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,960
though, nobody made fun of my appearance. It was all the way. I held a fork and knife.

526
00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:00,080
Really? Yes. Like Cotillion etiquette. Yes. People. It was very, and they were very upset about it.

527
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,680
That's not a salad fork. Like what were they? They were just, I can swear here, right? Yeah.

528
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:11,040
It was just like, bitch doesn't know how to hold a knife. Why is she hosting this? And it was like,

529
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,880
I'm just here to put cake in my face and get paid for it. Like, why are you giving me a hard time?

530
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,240
I mean, you didn't hold it with the blade in your hand, cutting your hand,

531
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,000
did you? Cause if so, I like to cut with a fork sometimes. It's just,

532
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,160
that was the problem. I don't know. I stopped looking. Yeah.

533
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah. You mean to tell me it's difficult to be a woman on the internet. Now I've heard everything.

534
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,760
You'd be shocked. Yeah. All right. Even in this joyful community.

535
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:45,200
It is a more, do you, do you find that though, that like with theme parks is your primary source

536
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:52,240
material? Is it like nicer? Do you think that writing about general whatever or broader pop

537
00:25:52,240 --> 00:26:01,680
culture, whatever? Maybe not. I don't know. I don't know. Interesting. Because there I've never,

538
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,400
I mean, I've written about a lot of different things. I started writing about theme parks

539
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:10,320
about four years ago and I've never experienced a group of fans so passionate about everything

540
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,880
you do and everything you say. Like I'm currently filled with anxiety that I'm going to mispronounce

541
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,840
a star Wars reference and I will never live it down. Well, that's the perfect, you know,

542
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,880
Venn diagram, right? Theme park fans and star Wars fans. Like that's a lot.

543
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,640
Yeah. If there is a train shall meet. Blood will boil. Cities will be toppled.

544
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,840
I think every now and then like something will come up that is like, ah, like fandom behavior

545
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,600
happens, but like spending so much of my life reading comics and learning about the history

546
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:50,720
and the culture around it, like very little surprises me of like insane fan behavior,

547
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,080
wrestling too, getting to know more about wrestling. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Nothing in theme

548
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,120
park has quite surprised me of like compared to comics and wrestling. Yeah. People have a lot of

549
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:08,480
time on their hands and a lot. Now they have a space to put their thoughts. That's really what's

550
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,920
going on. That's what it all was down to. That's really what's going to destroy all of our brains.

551
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:16,560
Well, let's open up, let's open up the floor to mispronunciations. Let's start talking about,

552
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:21,120
yeah. I'm so sorry in advance. I won't know. I won't be the one who knows. I don't know any

553
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,760
of this. The only way I'll correct you is if it's like one of my favorite pod racers.

554
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:32,160
So it's, you'll be fine. He's gotten years of comedy off of just knowing a dozen pop racer names,

555
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:39,520
like in multiple formats. Yeah, I'm laughing already. You're going to be very disappointed.

556
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,960
So funny. That's what I mean. My phone, when I was trying to type out the phrase Hondo Onaka,

557
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:52,640
my phone gave me the prompt. Did you mean condo non-com? Which is also kind of a good Star Wars.

558
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,880
I mean, imagine we were at this, we were at this three day Star Wars Galaxy's Edge press event.

559
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,960
Yeah. And we were not allowed to take any photos. And typically when you're reporting,

560
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,640
you take photos of, you know, like food signs. So you get the ingredients, take a photo, you type

561
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,320
it up later. No photos. So I was with my iPhone trying to write down all of these space food names

562
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:18,080
and it's just auto-correcting everything. And it was so stressful. Oh my God. You just got to shut

563
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,120
it off entirely. Well, so to, let's, let's explain the whole thing. Yeah. You have just, you've just

564
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,840
returned from this giant press tour. Wow. Wow. One of the first to go. You wrote an article,

565
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,800
or you've written about it in Travel and Leisure and for, yes, I wrote one story for Eater and I

566
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,880
wrote a set of six stories for Travel and Leisure that are, there's two more coming out this week.

567
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,960
Oh my God. Really? Okay. So if you're listening to this, you may have already heard some Carly's

568
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,000
work about this, but yeah, the main thing is you've been there. We have not been there.

569
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:56,080
And you got to walk through, through queues and through parts of rides and you've experienced

570
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:02,560
food months ahead of, well, I might, we might not be able to do it for a year and a half.

571
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:09,520
In my head, in my head, it does feel like I'm talking to someone who like touched heaven,

572
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,760
like went to the other side and now you're back. Cause I'm thinking like you have been in the ride

573
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,920
because we, do we go by and I always make my girlfriend, we, I stop on the top of the parking

574
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:25,200
garage and go, that's where the ride's going to be. And I like think about it. Same thing every time.

575
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,920
Sometimes we have a time. And does anyone think we're not all in on that, that we are not part of

576
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:37,040
the fandoms we have described? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Oh my God. Yes. Yeah. When I, yeah,

577
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:42,400
I take the parking garage photos. Yeah. We're out of our minds. Yeah. I do hope that heaven

578
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:48,000
doesn't have a nine hour line, but if, but I would argue though, that if heaven is as good as people

579
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,080
say, worth it to get in for a nine hour line. So that's the same way in like, are there bathrooms

580
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:00,560
in the queue for heaven or no, okay. That a picture with Bruce Springsteen. Yeah. Jason,

581
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,200
eight hours to meet Bruce Springsteen once. Was it worth it? Yes. It was pretty satisfying.

582
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,360
Yeah. Anyway, so you did this incredible three day. So yeah, explain exactly a whole thing.

583
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,040
So it was, it was a three day press trip. It started in San Francisco at Lucasfilm. So we were

584
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,200
in a conference room there and they were kind of giving us general, general ideas. And at that

585
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,120
point, you know, them even saying the name of a character was news. So we were all like,

586
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,760
oh my God, we were like eating it up, not realizing how in like the next three days would go. Like it's

587
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,400
as though we've been to war and came back to tell about it. But we got like a little,

588
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,640
little quick trip through the office to look at it. It's beautiful. Those people are so blessed.

589
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,280
And then we went on a plane and flew to Glendale or flew to Burbank, stayed in Glendale, went to

590
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:51,120
Walt Disney Imagineering the next day, then drove to Disneyland that night, stayed at Disneyland and

591
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:57,680
then had some meetings, tasted the food and then went into galaxy's edge. Wow. How many folks are,

592
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,720
were invited? Like how big was the group? I want to say like about 15 journalists at the beginning.

593
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,680
I think at the beginning there were about 10 and then for the final day we had,

594
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:11,040
we might've been up to 20. Wow. This is an elite group of theme park journalists too.

595
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,680
Yeah. I mean, I've really never been in a situation where you're with like capital

596
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,880
R reporters. Right. So every question, every single person asked was beneficial. It was amazing.

597
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Interesting. So yeah, that's great. Yeah. Because if we were there, it would have been a lot of like

598
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,120
me asking about, well, are there pod racers on this ride? Like, so these are people that like

599
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,360
they can format a question so fast in their head because they do this, you know, all the time.

600
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,920
It was like all of us learned so much more because a lot of it was asking and seeing if you could get

601
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,440
an answer. And we learned a lot of things just by, you know, tossing something out there and seeing

602
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,240
if we can get a response. Right. And because everyone was so much better at their jobs than I am,

603
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:56,160
I got a lot of info. Sure. Yeah. I read the, I think I read the, I read the tech crunch coverage,

604
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:02,000
the entertainment weekly story is I can't understand 80% of what he ever writes. And I'm always like,

605
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,320
can you explain it to me? Like I'm an old person who's dumb and I still don't get it, but he knows

606
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:12,560
he got the most interesting details. Yeah. The technical side was very interesting. A friend of

607
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:18,320
the show, Todd Martins wrote about a free LA times, a kind of honed in on the play aspect,

608
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:25,120
entertainment weekly, a kind of like an overview. What are you? I'm laughing because the episode

609
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,520
right before all this came out, I trashed the play Disney app. Yeah. Well that and it's apparently

610
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:37,840
a big part of Star Wars. All the stuff they said sounds awesome and cool. So I was just specifically

611
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:44,480
saying the space mountain game left us very frustrated. Well, the amount the company has

612
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:51,040
used the word play recently is starting to get to me the way like 10 years ago, IP and content were

613
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:56,640
like, Oh, that's bumping me the wrong way. But then eventually I guess you just get used to it. Sure.

614
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,040
But everyone kind of have it. The entertainment weekly, similar to your article, is kind of an

615
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:05,200
overview of everything and split up into sections, which was helpful. What's really interesting is

616
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,360
that we all seem to have gotten like one tidbit other people didn't get. And like I know that like

617
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,040
me and a few other people have kind of been exchanging those little bites, but it was really

618
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:19,360
like there's little bits of information. Like I don't know if I got that you're going to carry

619
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,200
your droid around in a backpack, which I was not aware of. Yeah. We wouldn't carry your droid

620
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:32,000
around. Yeah. So when you go to the droid depot to make your own R or BB type droid, the droid

621
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
can physically move throughout the land, but for obvious reasons, it's not recommended,

622
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,560
which there's not a chance I'm not going to be using my droid in the land. But it's you put your

623
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:45,360
little droid in a little backpack and then it like beep boops when it goes near stuff. Oh, and wait,

624
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,600
so what does it do in the land? Am I getting ahead of myself? Do we want to go like top town?

625
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,840
Let's finish this part. But basically what you're saying is I think is that there'll be like in the

626
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,280
Harry Potter land or whatever, there's like certain spaces or certain spots where you use your wand

627
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:06,880
and it'll do something fun or it makes it rain or whatever. In this strip, there'll be like a bad,

628
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,160
not a stripper thing. There'll be like a bad guy or something. And then your little R2 unit

629
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,360
will notice that because there's some sort of signal it gets and it goes beep boop and like,

630
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,120
and maybe it alerts you to something or something like, oh, so it'll be like,

631
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,040
yeah, you're on a little adventure. So then because, you know, typically at Wizarding World,

632
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,480
you have a wand and you have to do a specific motion with the wand. Typically, it does not work.

633
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,520
Typically, everyone's children are confused and crying.

634
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,880
Yeah, it's very, it's a very specific like loop de loop up down.

635
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,520
It's like old we emotes on Nintendo.

636
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,080
But with the droids, supposedly, from what we understand, they will communicate to each other

637
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:48,080
and with droids in the land. So you won't have to do anything besides like hug it close.

638
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,480
Right.

639
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,120
And it will.

640
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:57,600
I laugh because the cast member picture that came out had someone carrying the droid in like a droid

641
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,040
carrier that looks like the Build-A-Bear. Oh, really? I haven't seen that.

642
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,800
Carrier thing. I forget where that was.

643
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,280
Yeah. So will everyone get a backpack?

644
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,520
Oh, no, I think I think it's probably a purchase item.

645
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,600
Oh, so you have to purchase a backpack also with the droid.

646
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:14,000
The backpack was like a sidebar that I got of like a side interview with Scott.

647
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,120
So it was just like a little like a little nugget of info.

648
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,080
Who's Scott?

649
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,440
Scott Trowbridge.

650
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,400
Okay. And I've heard that name.

651
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:20,560
Imagineer.

652
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,000
Who is he as part of this?

653
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,160
I would call the captain of the galaxies at a ship.

654
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,800
Oh, okay.

655
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,440
Interesting.

656
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:31,120
I believe their title is like portfolio lead creative, which none of those words make any

657
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,040
sense to me. But you're making all the cool stuff for the spaceships and the lasers.

658
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,920
That's complicated to put on a business card.

659
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,880
I'm sure there's like nerds screaming in their car right now about his full title and his

660
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,680
very brilliant outlook on everything that's being created. But he's yeah.

661
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,000
But you're following this guy around for three days.

662
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,360
Oh, he was. He gave like some lead presentations.

663
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:53,760
Okay.

664
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:59,280
Because the thing is at these events, we're like a ragtag group of journalists asking a

665
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,840
lot of questions that they're not allowed to tell us answers for.

666
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:09,120
You said on the Disney Dish podcast that you were kind of stonewalled about any operational stuff.

667
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,680
Yes.

668
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,400
Which is, I mean, very much our interest.

669
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,840
Of course. All of us. All anyone wants to know is how am I going to get in here?

670
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,560
How long am I going to wait? Am I going to get on a ride? What's it going to cost?

671
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,960
How do you think you're going to pull this off?

672
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,160
Yes. And we were given, I mean, the first day I was told like, no, no, no, no, no, this is

673
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,200
top level. Like we're telling you what animatronic you're going to see,

674
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,560
which is understandable because you know that they will release that closer to opening day,

675
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,800
but doesn't get not going to stop me from being curious.

676
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,880
I mean, hopefully it's that like, yeah, we're fine tuning everything. We don't want to say

677
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,040
anything until it's confirmed. Every now and then you hear horror stories about like,

678
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,080
oh, Imagineering doesn't communicate with operations that much.

679
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,920
Oh, no, there were multiple panels where they were like, this is the first time we've had

680
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,320
operations involved from the very beginning. Oh, great. Yeah. So it's definitely, they're not

681
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,840
not saying anything because they don't know. It's just that, you know, once Disney says anything on

682
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:04,480
the record, it is like God's word. Yeah. So I think they're just waiting until it's

683
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,360
right. Very, very specific and done. Interesting. Sure. Well, how do we tackle this?

684
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,840
Well, yeah. So yeah. Yeah. Okay. I guess we start a little bit. Do you want me to

685
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,760
visually walk you through the lens? That would be good. Sure. All right. Let's start. I guess.

686
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,120
So where did they put you up? What kind of per diem are we talking about?

687
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:24,720
I'm a freelance writer. I lost money on this. Okay. All right. We've all been there. Yeah.

688
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,800
They took us to the Lucasfilm gift shop. So I lost money. Sure. Yeah. So they have a, what are the,

689
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,880
what's the exclusive merch like at Lucasfilm? So basically they're like, if it says Lucasfilm,

690
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,920
it's exclusive. Okay. So I bought a very cute sweatshirt. Okay. And I bought a very cool water

691
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,080
bottle. That's it's like the opening credits. So it looks like a sky. It's like black with like

692
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:49,120
little white dots. I like that. Terrible water bottle, but it's very pretty. Oh, that's good.

693
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,800
I like that. When we got to go to Imagineering, I got an Imagineering mug and it sucks. I have

694
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,320
to reheat my coffee in like 10 minutes. So I feel you on merch that's still worth having, even though

695
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,280
it doesn't do its function. Definitely. I have a lot of promotional water bottles from events over

696
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,320
the years and it's all like a knockoff swell bottle. Yes. If you know what I mean, it's like

697
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,800
that aluminum with a twisty top, but it's not a swell bottle. So it, the top doesn't like fully

698
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:20,720
fit. Right. But I still paid $29.99 for it and was very happy. Yeah. We've all dropped some money

699
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:27,040
at Mickey of Glendale. Oh, did I need to buy an $18 goofy pin dressed in his outfit from the

700
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:33,920
current 90th birthday celebration? No. Did I? Yes. Does he have a similar Mickey outfit, the party

701
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,200
suit, or does he have a different? He has like a fun little hat and then he has a handmade confetti

702
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,760
vest. Okay. Yeah. So similar to Mickey minis. Yes. I'm into that. So, so when you get,

703
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,200
did you know, cause this, this, this is my experience with the day that you guys got to

704
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,920
all put these articles out. I was seeing a movie with my girlfriend and I got out and I said,

705
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,600
Oh my God, I have 30 texts from Jason and Scott. And I went like, did some, did something wrong?

706
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:07,440
Is something, did somebody die? Did somebody die? Like what's going on? Yeah. Did Walt Disney rise

707
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,640
from his grave and we have to do a quick episode to cover this. And I'm clicking through and I was

708
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:19,200
like, what? I couldn't even, there were so many articles. So, so did you know that this much info

709
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,760
was happening when this trip was proposed? Did it say we're going to do X and Y? So did you know,

710
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,880
I'm going to get to go to the land. I'm going to get to go to Lucasfilm. Did you know the extent

711
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,840
of the trip? Yes, because there was the most travel that's ever been involved in a work trip

712
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,680
before. Right. Okay. So you'd need it. We traveled every day and stayed at a new hotel every day.

713
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,400
Gotcha. But we knew there would be an embargo. I don't know if we knew at that point what day

714
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,800
we'd be able to publish. I think they just told us you'd have a few days. We'll let you know more

715
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,720
once you're there. But we knew we didn't know what we'd be doing. We didn't know what the panels

716
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,600
would be. We knew where we'd be. And I think I had to have known. Yeah. We knew we'd see the land,

717
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:59,200
but I kind of don't, I, until I'm physically there, I don't trust anything because anything can change.

718
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,280
Of course. Yeah. But I knew that we would be releasing information. I didn't know what would

719
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:10,960
be at midnight Eastern time. Oh, that's right. That's why it was. Yeah. Okay. It was at 1201 Eastern.

720
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,520
I'm still not really sure why, but anyone who went to bed early that night, it really lost out.

721
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:23,280
Yeah. Yeah. I was like on my way to an early, I was trying to keep it mellow and then the

722
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,120
news dump happened and I lost my shit. It feels like this is the only time it's happened after

723
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:32,160
office hours where they're like, Oh, were you going to go to bed? Never. Like just everything

724
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,400
came out. And I tweeted about this, that I did feel like the kid in the Disney world commercial.

725
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:44,320
I'm too excited to sleep. Which I don't, I, this is jumping around, but we did, let's just, the

726
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:50,640
thing that I found out via you and you, okay. You said, ask me, you said, ask me. Yeah, let's get this out of the way.

727
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:57,680
The speed of sound I typed is Paul Rubin's back as Rex. You did not know it was, that was like a little

728
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,000
dagger. Cause I was worried. Maybe I didn't know because I might've been clinically brained

729
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,400
at it this time. Cause I had been writing, I threw an Oscar's party. So I started writing two days

730
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:13,200
later than everyone else cranked out five stories in 24 hours. So I was, um, that's why I was like,

731
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,360
Oh no. Yeah, sure. Well, thank you for helping me anyway. Cause you refer me to your friend at

732
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,440
Nerdist. Is that correct? Amy Rockleff who knows everything about everything about star wars. She

733
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,160
is a brilliant genius and I knew she would know the answer and she did. And the answer was yes.

734
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:35,200
Paul Rubin's is back as Rex, as DJ Rex in the, in Oga's Cantina. Uh, I true, like you guys know,

735
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:42,000
I don't like, there's not a ton of IP that I am crazy for. I w I felt like such a little,

736
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,920
I had such a flurry, such a swell of a mode. I'm not kidding. I was too excited to go to sleep.

737
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,920
I could sense that from the, I think I said to once I go, I think this is the most excited

738
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:57,360
Scott has ever been. I could tell from the text messages that you were like on the highest of

739
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:03,520
highs, just of going on. I mean, it's as we've said, it's, it's become a joke, but I do think

740
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:09,760
it's true that Rex is my favorite character in fiction and knowing that he'll, he's back,

741
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,680
he's, he's back with his actual, because if it was not Paul Rubin's and also, I mean,

742
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:22,160
I love Paul Rubin's anyway, and this is, uh, you know, this is a great gifted comedian's second

743
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:31,120
most prominent character in the world. It goes, uh, Pee Wee Rex, Penguin's dad. Yeah. No, no,

744
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:36,720
side of that. Penguin's dad's really good. Like there's more mythology coming to my favorite

745
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:43,040
character and it's really him. This is, uh, God, I was at D 23 two years ago and I texted both of you

746
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:48,880
when they announced the Rex was going to be back in the land and it was like, uh, the Avengers

747
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:55,680
coming on stage. It was that the audience was that Jack. So it's, I'm, so I'm saying a lot of people

748
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:01,520
have this affection. So I get, I mean, I feel it too. I have more like feeling in my heart right

749
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:08,400
now than I ever have on the show. I can't believe what I can't believe is that you're, you're new to

750
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,560
all this. I love Rex so much. So people can't see your face right now, but I wish they could.

751
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:21,440
You're, you're elated. Yeah. Yeah. I'm a little like red in the face. I just felt relief. I was

752
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,800
like, Scott's going to be so worried until he gets a firm answer. And hopefully it's going to be the

753
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,640
right answer. And thankfully we got it really quickly. What would I do? I don't know. Rex is

754
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:40,400
played by Josh Gadd. Oh God, God, God. I'm in the casino. Trevor Noah's doing it.

755
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:49,760
Introducing Megan Treanor as Rex. Oh no, no, he can't do everything. Um, yeah, incredible new,

756
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,520
but what I, I was getting concerned because, um, you know, the announcement was made that Adam

757
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:00,640
Driver and the, you know, the, and, uh, the, you know, Daisy, really the cast of the current films

758
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:07,280
is going to be in it and not seeing a specific name confirmation for him really made me afraid.

759
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,200
Yeah. Cause they're all involved in the, and I will give a formal attraction name. So PR doesn't

760
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,320
send me an email in case they ever listen. Who knows, but it is star Wars rise of the resistance.

761
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,920
Okay. Right. The cast of the current sequel trilogy, as I've learned through writing many

762
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,400
stories last week, that's what it's called. Um, that they are there in the ride, but there,

763
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:30,000
I think they're only seen within the attraction. Right. Okay. Gotcha. But I told you, I, I saw

764
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Rex, right? I wait. No, I'm not sure if you did. Maybe you didn't maybe I'm forgetting.

765
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,440
You did. Well tell me, tell me. They showed us. Oh my God. Do you see them in operation? Yeah.

766
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:48,800
Oh my God. All right. Take me through every step of that. And then I swear we'll talk about it.

767
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,040
You knew this was going to be the next hour though. I've got ribs. I need to cover. Okay.

768
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:59,680
Okay. No, hot dogs, space hot dogs. There are space hot dogs. Oh, yes, there are. Yes.

769
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:05,360
There are space hot dogs. But okay. So I'll try to, uh, uh, but I kind of want to drag it out

770
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,960
because I want you to be as happy for as long as possible. You could do, we could tease it.

771
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,200
You could, you could get to it because if it's part of the bigger story, well, it's just that we,

772
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:18,400
so they, on the day we went to imagineering, um, they took us to the animation building where we

773
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:25,600
saw Honda Anaka and we saw doc on dark and we saw the most important, of course, and they,

774
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:31,120
I got caught for recording sound cause I didn't know you weren't supposed to. So, um, I didn't

775
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:38,240
have, but I didn't start that until after, um, we've heard him bop around and play music and

776
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,440
give DJ commentary. You heard him talk. You heard new dialogue. Like wail his little arms. Can you

777
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,800
say anything you heard? Maybe not. Um, well, you know, so he, he said something during that,

778
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,680
but then he also, this is just going to be a big old jumble, but there's also, as you know,

779
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:59,120
as we've talked about, they're selling a small toy shaped racks that can just like

780
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:05,360
scoot around your apartment and play music. He moves. Oh, he moves. Oh yeah. God damn.

781
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:09,760
Big news. I didn't read that. Like boogies around on the floor, like a Roomba, but he can also

782
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,600
attach to your smartphone so you can play music through him. Don't get too excited yet because

783
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:19,360
you can also have him do commentary over it. And he will make like noises.

784
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:29,200
Cause he's a big fan of air horn. Bullshit. Oh my God. It was like peak toy execution.

785
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:34,800
Wow. Who's around? You can play any music you want through recs. Oh my fucking Lord.

786
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:42,400
So Gang of stuff. Whoa. Make a drink. Gasolina, Despacita. Weezer's Africa. All my favorite songs.

787
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,160
All of our, yeah. I mean, God willing, if you're able to get one, you can have. What do you mean

788
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,720
God willing, if you're able to get one? People are going to be, yeah, it's going to be as many

789
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,640
as possible. What do you mean? I just, I don't know. It's going to be really hard to get.

790
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,840
Okay. All right. Now you have to stand in line with us. Yeah. That's the wrong one.

791
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,320
You have to go first day. It's good. It's like a, it's, they did a very good job. You saw the toy.

792
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:14,000
Yeah, we saw it. Like so here, larger question then how tall are these droids available for

793
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:20,160
purchase? Okay. So the droids are like a foot. I would say maybe the, the height of a character

794
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,960
popcorn bucket, a little taller than that. Okay. So they're not, they're not miniature,

795
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,560
no, but they're big enough where like an adult can carry it under one arm.

796
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:36,000
Okay. Like a baby. Like my child. Like very much like baby training to carry one around.

797
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:44,640
My God. They are, they are very cool. So, all right. Dialogue. How's he sound? How does he do?

798
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:50,320
How's he doing? How's he been since his flight disaster? The way that they kind of explained

799
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:55,360
it to us was that he had like pivoted jobs. I think there's a whole backstory. I think as he

800
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:01,200
ended up on planet Batu at black spare outpost, which is the like marketplace center,

801
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:09,120
Cantina, et cetera, area of planet Batu. But he ended up there. He, Oga supposedly gave him a job,

802
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:15,680
I think is the backstory. And then he's there just playing like an hour. I tried to fact check it

803
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,840
the other day. I was like, now is it a three hour show or one hour repeats, or is it three hours of

804
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:24,640
original music? And I think it's, I didn't hear back in time. I apologize. Okay. I think it's at

805
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,840
least minimum an hour of original music with him in like interstitials. And you said the music,

806
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:35,200
it's bangers. So good. What's described. I mean, what I read was synthy poppy eighties,

807
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,120
which drives me absolutely insane. This is the most made for me. I almost want to say it's a

808
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:44,640
little worldly, which is very general because it has like alien languages in it. I think. And it's

809
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:50,080
very neck. My favorite thing in the star wars franchise, the song in return of the Jedi.

810
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:57,440
Oh boy. So real quick in case the listener, uh, there were two versions of, uh, with many

811
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:02,400
versions of star wars, uh, not unless should I return to Jedi? The original had this like very

812
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:08,480
princy sounding song. That's a cool ass song done by John Williams, son, a long time member of Toto.

813
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:15,120
Yes. Um, yeah, yeah. Current singer of Toto. Uh, and then it was replaced by in the special

814
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:24,320
editions, Jedi rocks. The worst thing I've ever seen. Yes. The thing, what's the piece of your

815
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:30,560
throat? The dangles. Yeah. You see the aliens, uvula. They go so close on this fake looking.

816
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:36,320
I hate that they replaced a cool ladies jam with that. Oh no, this is, this is a fuck ton of fun.

817
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:42,560
Oh, man. Oh man. Oh man. Okay. Can you, and then I'm sorry to keep our fingers. Yeah, we will,

818
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:47,360
we will get there. This is a special seven hour. I can relax if we clear all this. Can you remember

819
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:52,240
anything that he said or are you allowed to even say that? Um, I can't remember, but I could listen

820
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:57,440
to my audio from the toy presentation and figure out what he said and then text you later. Okay. I

821
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:02,720
will accept that. Uh, sorry audience, but you know, I hope you're all on my side. You're all here

822
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:09,920
rooting for me. I think it's some like radio puns. Okay. Okay. That's neat. As long as he's trying

823
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,480
his best. That's all we care about. He's doing a great job. That's what it is. I was connecting,

824
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:19,360
like I went on star tours last night and I was, and I was the spy for the second time, by the way.

825
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:26,080
Wow. The tips that I know how to play out now. Yeah. The audience with Kyle's there's Kyle had

826
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:30,560
a tip and it works. I think he said, yeah, he said it's just something about like it's, it's like

827
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,720
looking bored, but in a way that reads, it's like playing out. It's like finding your light

828
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,720
or finding the camera. It's like, yeah, it's sort of like you never look too much down. I think you

829
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,160
just put your belt on, but always look kind of straight ahead, but kind of like have just like

830
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,920
bemused or whatever, like a non plus look on your face. You can't act it up too much. Right. You

831
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:55,760
got to still play it down. But yeah, you know, it's like a sort of like a photo bomb. Like you have

832
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:01,200
to still like, you know, why you have to be like a figure that reads. Right. And as my wife pointed

833
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:07,680
out, you know, you can do that all day. However, if, if there's somebody with Mickey ears or wearing

834
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:12,640
something silly, it's going to be them. But if you're in a cabin without silly hats, you're in

835
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,480
the clear and you could potentially be the rebel spy. But I'm just so impressed that we learned that

836
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:22,560
tip and I've actually made it happen twice. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like I got an act for it now, but

837
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:27,440
anyway, start tours. I was just reminiscing about Rex and I was thinking it's what you were saying

838
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:33,440
about Buzzy. He's like, you know, he's a little guy trying his best and there's some, maybe I

839
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,400
didn't connect to star wars as much as a lot of kids because I, you know, I, everybody seems so

840
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,600
official and they know the universe and they know what they're doing and they speak in all this

841
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:47,520
jargon. I get on star tours and Rex is just like a regular bumbling guy. He fit. I just like,

842
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:52,960
he was your every man. Yeah, absolutely. I guess more, I guess for some reason, more so than Luke

843
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:58,880
to me. So yeah, if star wars has started Rex and not Luke, you would have loved my favorite movie.

844
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,840
You know, it actually, I seriously do equate it to Marty McFly because I love back to the future

845
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:09,680
a lot more than I love star wars. And I think it being like just a regular nervous, geez, I don't

846
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:14,880
know. I just connect to it more than like somebody would the rebel Alliance will be like,

847
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,200
well, they're going to have to, they're going to have to physically remove you from the cantina.

848
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:24,240
That's what I don't, I don't know how I'm going to stay there. You love so much. I've really made it

849
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:29,920
clear. I think like, if we have to call his mouth is a gape, I just, I mean, I feel, honestly,

850
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,680
I feel guilty that I've seen him and you have it. I did not cherish it this much, but you answered

851
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,840
my question. You passed, you, you didn't have an answer to my question, but you passed it along

852
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:45,680
immediately to somebody who did. And so I, I owe you very much for that. And you came here with very

853
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:50,720
little notice, like, like very little lead time to tell us about all this. So I'm indebted to you on

854
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:56,160
that love. You're it's, it's, it's great. Exactly what he said. I promise. Sure. You're a journalist

855
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,600
too. Like Scott, if you were in there, it would have been embarrassed. He would have been, we've

856
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:03,600
been trying to hug him and yeah, like, and yeah, and they would have to like be, sorry, excuse me.

857
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:08,480
We have to revoke your press clearances and credentials. Like, so sorry. Like my feelings

858
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:14,400
about Adam West and it's like, like there's very few things that occupy this or Prince or like,

859
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:20,320
there's very few pieces of pop culture. Adam West, Prince and Rex. All right. Let's start.

860
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,800
You guys take it from here. I'm spent that that sort of reaction the other night is like,

861
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:34,000
if we have to divide our efforts to, to experience this, I know Scott is just going to post up in

862
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:44,320
August canteen. I sure am for other reasons. I'll get, yes. Or other reasons. I, I think my big

863
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:52,080
pick would be a rise of the resistance. I think you're correct. Are you crazy? The main attraction,

864
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:57,760
Mike, you're doing the Falcon then. So, uh, just by possible limitation, sorry to saddle you with

865
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:06,480
the pod. I'm going to just hug that giant, a pod racing engine in Rondo to Rondo. That's fine.

866
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:13,040
Space hot dog. All right. Back to the start. Let's go. All right. So let's talk rise of the

867
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:17,200
resistance, which is sort of like, I would call it the Star Wars colon rise of the resistance.

868
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:24,240
Okay. I'm totally kidding. I'm totally kidding. Please. We love punctuation. We have a colon in

869
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:31,280
our title. So yeah, you're calling, um, yeah, Star Wars colon rise of the resistance. Uh, let's see,

870
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:37,360
what is everyone actually going to call this ride? The resistance ride or the, the big ride.

871
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:44,000
Yeah. What's the like, like just in the way that regular people are going to call it Star Wars land.

872
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,920
You mean like how I don't, I'm not going to call it Michigan. I don't call it the other one. I think

873
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,960
just the other one, probably the other one. Yeah. Right. Cause they're going to call it Millennium

874
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:56,480
Falcon. The big one or something. Yeah. The big, Hey, you want to go to the big one? Yeah. So you

875
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:04,640
have been to the big one. You've been inside the big one. Um, it's, so they showed us a portion of

876
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,240
the attraction. They did not show us the whole thing. We sadly did not get to go in that little

877
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:13,600
eight seat droid powered track with vehicle, but I did see a lot of artists renderings of it. So

878
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:18,080
I feel like if I convinced myself, I've been in it, it could, I didn't even, uh, it wasn't even

879
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:22,960
like to sit in there in the ride. There was no sign of those vehicles. No. So this is what I didn't,

880
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,040
cause, um, as I think you guys have talked about before, the description of the ride has been

881
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:32,720
utterly vague. They're just like, you're going to maybe see somebody bad. Like there's nothing

882
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:38,400
about it. Um, but I didn't realize that it's so the second day of the trip, they told us that it's

883
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:44,480
essentially four attractions in one, which we were like, go on. Um, and they showed us what we

884
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:50,160
think is one and a half out of the four. Okay. So there's still mystery as to what the four are.

885
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:57,440
Yes. Oh, because you, the coverage, the verdict seemed to be you all got to see one third of this

886
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,240
ride. So I, um, yeah, I asked the guy after I was like, so how much did we see? And he's like,

887
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:07,360
you saw about 30%. Yeah. Really? Just started screaming. And he's like, he looked, the quote

888
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:12,080
he gave me was like, yeah, it's a monster. People are going to freak out. Yeah. Did you see that

889
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:16,000
number that was floating around 28 minutes? Yes. They commented on it and said it was inaccurate,

890
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,840
but it is, um, one of the longest attractions they have. Interesting. What is, do we know the

891
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:28,320
longest attraction? Pirates. So the thing is though, that it's not all sweet, completely upends any,

892
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:34,320
any idea, like basically what you think is an attraction. This thing will explode because it's

893
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,080
part of it is walking something like something that would generally be a Q situation. Whereas

894
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:44,160
like you walk, you turn a corner, you walk is part of the attraction. Right. So, so like, yeah,

895
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:50,000
like two different ride systems bridged by walking that all counts in the time for the attraction.

896
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,960
Basically. Yes. So you're not sitting in a little vehicle for 20 something minutes, but you are

897
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,720
part of it's the attraction or universe of energy. It's probably the,

898
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,840
yeah.

899
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:05,920
This is kind of like the new universe of energy.

900
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:11,920
There was a thing I'm always, I read a lot of the message boards for rumors and like two years ago,

901
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,000
there was a rumor that it was a ride you would get to get off in the middle of.

902
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:23,680
Yes. I mean, so I think it's hard to tell because so the part that I experienced was we walked the

903
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:29,760
entire queue, which it's big. I'm just going to leave it as that. And you said, I think on the

904
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:34,480
other Disney, Disney dish, it's like probably as long as the avatar queue. That's what it felt like

905
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,560
to me. But unlike the avatar queue, I don't know if you guys have had the pleasure of really walking

906
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:44,640
that entire length. It's not, it's not kind of like there's small spaces, then big spaces like

907
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:49,040
the lab and then small spaces. It's really all themed similarly. So it's all kind of small

908
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,720
corridors through laser knife cut openings.

909
00:57:53,360 --> 00:58:01,600
Oh, yeah. So you're like in this cavernous expanse for TBD amount of time. And then you get into a,

910
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:06,000
I believe it's like a communications merge room. And then that's kind of where the ride starts.

911
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:11,840
So you merge like the standby fast pass, and then you see BB eight and raise there. And she's like,

912
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:17,120
come help us. And then you go out, then you go outside. Right. So like this door opens,

913
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:20,640
you know, like a star Wars. Is there a technical name for like a fancy star Wars door?

914
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,000
I don't think so. So you go and then you board this

915
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:31,280
outside. Yeah. Wait, I didn't know this. Yes. Okay. So it's like you're in a merge point.

916
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,960
And then from there you enter the first room. I guess I'll just give you the whole spiel.

917
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:40,960
Okay. So then BB eight's like, what's up? And then they're in a group of, I think it's like 48 to

918
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:46,720
55 people. Okay. So imagine like you, once you enter the haunted mansion, you're waiting to go

919
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:52,800
into the stretching room. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. There's quote unquote stretching room is Ray via

920
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:57,280
hologram BB eight explaining to you the mission that they need you to go on with the resistance.

921
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,320
So from there a door opens and instead of going down a terrifyingly cramped dark hallway,

922
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:08,480
you are outside and pose X swing. Is that yep. He has an X wing. Yeah. Okay. I'm scared. There's

923
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:14,080
like some secret official name for it besides like generic X-Wing. I only know about Rex. So you're

924
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:18,400
fine with that. I don't know. I live true. I don't know about anything else. You're all set. I just

925
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,920
can't mess up in front of the other two. So that new fun, new Han Solo's there. Uh,

926
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:31,120
Han Solo, but different is there. Uh, so a couple of questions. Uh, so there are bench,

927
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:35,120
bench like seating carved into the walls in that queue area. Of the queue.

928
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:42,960
You're asking a lot of benches. Operational questions. Uh, single rider line. So I could

929
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:48,240
not confirm. I, I, I listened back to my recordings and it's just me, pathetically asking

930
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:52,720
multiple men being like, hi, I saw four doorways leading into the merge room. Does that confirm or

931
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:58,000
deny that there's a single rider? And they're like, you need to walk away. But I did physically see

932
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:04,160
the single rider sign in the Millennium Falcon opening. So I, so I saw the sign literally

933
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:10,800
that is happening, but they have not said in this very long, uh, uh, rise at star wars, calling rise

934
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:15,600
the resistance, right? You didn't see a sign of any bathrooms halfway through the queue. There are

935
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:20,560
not. Okay. I mean, I definitely asked them and I think it's, um, the type of thing where I don't

936
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:25,680
know if you guys have seen the way that they load in flight of passage and animal kingdom at Disney

937
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:30,080
world, but they hold the line and the walkway to Africa. Okay. So they hold the line for the most

938
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:34,560
part outdoors now, instead of in the actual indoor queue, I think so you can like get out to get

939
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:37,840
coffee or get out to get a snack and they have little snack truck there so you can get food. So

940
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:41,280
you don't just like wait hours and hours before eating. So I think it'll probably be something

941
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:47,440
like that because the ride is separate from the rest of the land. Okay. Yeah. It's down a pathway

942
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:53,040
to the left. So I think there is room just in that general space to hold an outdoor queue. If you like,

943
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:58,240
I assume that's what they'll do. But that's just an assumption. Yeah. They were kind of doing that

944
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:03,440
opening summer of green guts. They had a lot of snack stands in line and like a return system.

945
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,280
If you want to use the bathroom, it was, yeah, worked pretty well. I think it'll be like that,

946
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,680
but I don't think there will be a single rider line because you do move in this massive group.

947
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,840
Sure. Oh, right. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. So we're outside.

948
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,200
Fine. Listen, when I saw, I saw the seat, the bench seat in the queue and I pointed it and was

949
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:28,080
like, what is that? Yeah. It was thrilling. No, that is a need that they give you.

950
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:31,600
It's not the whole queue. Don't get too excited. It's only a portion. Okay. Sure. So then the door

951
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:36,560
opens and you're outside on a loading dock. And what we're told is that there'll be sounds of like

952
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:41,120
ships taking off and a lot of things happening. And then you and your, your crew of a zillion people,

953
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:47,040
you enter the first quote unquote ride vehicle, which is a ship. I don't know the name of it.

954
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:51,040
They didn't know the name of it. I think it's just a general transport ship. Right. Sure.

955
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:56,080
Oh, I, yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I know. I think I know who pilots it though. I think I read.

956
01:01:56,080 --> 01:02:03,440
Yes. Should we all say it? That's the way I say it once. Nine. It's nine. And I realized for years,

957
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:08,080
I was mispronouncing my name. I thought it was neon, but his real name is nine. And he is,

958
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:14,400
are you talking about in the Falcon, the smushy face in return of the Jedi. I stopped paying

959
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,720
attention after the Toto song. I don't know. He shows up in force awakens to apparently I thought

960
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:30,240
he dies in last Jedi. No, only Akbar dies silently. Yeah. I agree. I was telling them

961
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:36,160
before you got here. I only just a couple of days ago saw solo for the first time. So before all

962
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:41,680
this dads, all this star stuff was coming out, I was like, I, this is getting me interested because

963
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:48,160
after solo my star was interested is at an all time low. Do not enjoy that movie. I am

964
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:52,640
enjoying all of this. All this stuff that's come out about the land though. So yeah,

965
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:58,240
the land is the best movie already. I have a number one. Yeah. It's for sure the best movie.

966
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:04,640
There's no way. So yeah. So, so you're in there with an interesting thing is that I,

967
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:09,680
as far as I can remember, they said during this, this ship, they said there's two pilots.

968
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,760
I feel like they said, oh no, no, they said there's two animatronics up there.

969
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:21,120
The only one they named is nine and no, nine and no, so they are not ready to reveal

970
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:25,360
the other animatronic or it's like a small nothing. That's not even worth thinking.

971
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:29,760
Like it's the back of someone's head that you don't even see. Yeah. So not sure. But I know that

972
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:35,680
Finn, yeah. Finn patches in, no, Pope patches in while you're on the ride because he's your escort.

973
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:40,720
He's no, he's like, he's coming with you, but he's on his own ship. Right. Yeah. So he, I know that

974
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:45,520
he then like, you know, there's something happens as something always does and then they fight.

975
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:52,240
And then I know that Poe leaves. Yeah. He escapes and then you get sucked into a star destroyer.

976
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:56,960
Right. Are you looking up nine numb? Yeah, I do know nine numb. You see, you know,

977
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:02,160
it's like if you put a pancake on your face, he's like, he's a little mole guy. All right.

978
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,640
Yeah. So you're in this, this ship and the thing moves, which I'm really curious about because it

979
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:11,520
moves, but you're not, you're not holding onto anything. You're not seated. You're just standing.

980
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,480
Oh, that's interesting. Yeah. Which is a ride system that I don't think they've used before,

981
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:22,080
unless you've been on the Armageddon attraction at Walt Disney Studios in Paris. Yeah. The world's

982
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:30,640
worst ride. Yeah. My wife glared at me. Like the, maybe the low point of our honeymoon was like,

983
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:35,120
why did you make me go? Oh, that is the first attraction I went on when I got to the park

984
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:43,600
and my husband's like, we're going home. We both lost our spouses essentially. Wow. It's a marriage

985
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:49,440
ruining ride. Wait, wait, how is it? But that's like a thing you like sit on that or you're like,

986
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:57,200
it shakes. It's like, it's not dissimilar to like the parts of back draft and twister ride it out,

987
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:01,920
have little like plat for your standing, but it shakes around. Yes. Okay. There's a void.

988
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,880
When we did the void, you are in a transport ship and you're standing and you feel the room.

989
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:11,280
Oh, right. Yeah. Is that at the end or is that the one where you're over all the fire?

990
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:16,400
Early on. Oh, it's, it's what's taking you down into the law of the world. But this,

991
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:23,200
it does like physically move through space a bit and it moves like by itself. Oh, okay. Okay.

992
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:29,440
There's an effect on journey to the center of the earth in Tokyo that feels like that. It's,

993
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:33,520
yeah, Scott's going. He doesn't want spoilers. Let's know. We made it this far.

994
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:37,280
All right. I guess I can't say. Do you know nothing about the attraction? I don't. This is

995
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:41,760
my first chance to have a couple rides where I don't. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. He left.

996
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,360
So we did an episode. He left in the middle of it when we were reviewing it. Yeah. I don't know

997
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:49,440
what happened in that episode. I'm excited to check it out. We'll give a spoiler warning for the whole

998
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,120
thing before this too, because these are some spoilers. Yeah. No kidding. Yeah. Well, I'm going

999
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:57,200
to tell you as much as I know. Of course. Sure. Yeah. All right. So this platform. You didn't go

1000
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:01,280
in the ship. You just. No, I went in the ship. Oh, you did. Okay. Yeah. It just wasn't zooming

1001
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:06,240
around. Yeah. I mean, the experience I'd relate it to is probably a stretching room in that sense.

1002
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:10,160
Then, you know, you're with a group of people, you cram in, there's stuff happening in the room. It's

1003
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:15,360
moving, but who knows how much I mean, moving at least on this coast, but yeah. So, and then you

1004
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:19,920
get off, it's like something happens. Then you get sucked in and the door. So you basically, you board

1005
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,480
and you're looking at outside, looking at the landing deck. You're looking at post stuff. The

1006
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:29,760
door closes. Then the other door opens later on and you're inside the star destroyer. Oh,

1007
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:37,520
it's so amazing. It's like a big reveal of what they called one of many reveals. Okay. It's a

1008
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:44,000
massive room. I cannot, I cannot underst like it. This is the biggest room. Like I walked in and

1009
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,040
was like, how do you have space for this? How is there a ride after this? This is the biggest room

1010
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:52,800
I've ever been in my life. Yeah. It's a hundred foot screen, which is very big. Yeah. And it's

1011
01:06:52,800 --> 01:07:00,480
just, it is all consuming. Yeah. I mean, yeah. I, I'm now getting very excited. I've been excited

1012
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:06,080
the whole time, but I mean, my recs, heart swelling, I've had like physical palpitations.

1013
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:13,760
I'm nervous in this. I'm like, I've, I don't know. I like my, my body is experiencing weird,

1014
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:18,880
weird feelings. Right. Yeah. I get the vibe that everyone who works on this attraction is like,

1015
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:24,400
oh, you guys think the Falcon's going to be good. And they're like, just wait for it. Okay. Okay.

1016
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,880
All right. So the, when you're on it, obviously everything's not worth it. They don't have all

1017
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:34,000
the sound effects. So when it opens, I'm assuming there would be music. Did you get a full soundtrack

1018
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:40,560
thing? No, no, no. I mean, okay. To set the scene, I am walking through a dusty construction zone

1019
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:47,680
with like full cranes, like potholes. I'm wearing a pair of men's boots loan to me, safety goggles,

1020
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:52,720
a helmet and a vest. Sure. So I'm like just like flopping around and it's, everyone's just working

1021
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:57,760
on the attraction. So they're just walking us through and being like, here is room scribbled

1022
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:04,000
down as many notes as you can before we move on. Right. So, so you were, we'll open it up and

1023
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,400
there'll be like a big score and lights and you open it up and there were like 50 men in hard hats.

1024
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:13,120
Yeah. It was just people being like, why are you in my workspace? Right. But there will be,

1025
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:18,800
they say 50 AA or no, not 50 stormtroopers, some of which are AA's. So some of them will be

1026
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:25,200
animated and kind of like scare you. Oh, some of them wouldn't be humans. Well, no, I think some

1027
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:29,520
of them are just statues. I see. But if there's enough, you wouldn't necessarily notice that the

1028
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:34,400
one in the back is just static. Yeah. And then I think there's the cast members who are just as

1029
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:40,400
first order officers are yelling at you or escorting you into a hallway to go to a detention cell.

1030
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:47,680
Oh God. Fantastic. Scary. And did you go in the detention cell? And is that where your tour kind

1031
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:52,480
of stopped? Like that's it. Yeah. And that's where they said will be the first time we see Kylo Ren

1032
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:57,600
and it'll be, he'll be up top as he like came in on a balcony and you're just locked in a detention

1033
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:02,560
cell. You have to figure out how to get out. Is that an animatronic or is it? That's what I asked.

1034
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:07,280
They wouldn't confirm. They said it's one of the many forms you will see him in. So I think there

1035
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:14,000
got to be an animatronic of him, but I don't know if that's the one. Wow. I've never been so scared

1036
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,200
in an episode. I'm so freaked out. I'm scared for you having been there. It seems like it might have

1037
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:24,800
been like a, was it all sort of like a freaky place to see, especially in its weird nascent form?

1038
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:29,120
I think the weirdest part is that it's like seeing a 90 minute movie and then being like,

1039
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,800
you need to absorb every single thing you're viewing because you're going to need to talk

1040
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:36,880
about it for the next three months and just being like, I can't remember. Yeah. Yeah.

1041
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:42,720
Cause you know, you can't take any photos, but it, it, it looks like it looks exactly like the

1042
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:47,840
movies. Like it feels like, I think what you're saying, and maybe I'm wrong is that I think,

1043
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:53,600
you know, certain theme park fans like us might have like a lot of dream literal dreams and

1044
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:58,480
nightmares involving theme parks. And I do think I've had dreams where like I'm walking through an

1045
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:03,360
attraction and it's like half built and the lights are on. Like it does seem creepy what

1046
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:08,240
you're describing in a way too. And maybe that's just my own. Is that what you're thinking?

1047
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:12,000
Well, I mean a little bit that, but more just, this sounds like a scary ride. Like the first

1048
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:18,480
time we all do this, not knowing what's coming. Cause you don't even know to take it all the way.

1049
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:22,320
You don't, you've done some of this. You don't know what happens at the end of this ride. It

1050
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:27,600
doesn't seem like, okay, okay. Oof boy. So it's going to be scary, but I'm thinking of it in the

1051
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:32,480
half as much as I, if they invited me to go to this, I would of course do it. But part of me

1052
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:36,240
thinks like, cause we've all had nightmare. Like we've all thought about how scary it would be like

1053
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:42,800
the post-apocalyptic theme park. That's like by half built and there's like people working in,

1054
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:47,360
like it just seems like that to me. I'm someone who can't look at the thing Banksy did.

1055
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:55,280
That like makes me actually ill. No, this is just more like, like, Ooh, like they're making a cake.

1056
01:10:55,280 --> 01:11:00,560
Sure. That's a good way to think of it. It does sound like they're getting people out of their

1057
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:05,760
comfort zone in terms of expectations for theme park. I think it's, there never has been an

1058
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:11,120
attraction like this. I think that any, any way you view a ride will be upended by what you go on.

1059
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:16,400
Sure. That's what a lofty statement. Holy shit. Well, I mean, when else are you, is the part of

1060
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:21,600
the attraction like walking into a ship and then walking off a vehicle and then walking to something

1061
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:27,040
else? Yeah. And with the haunted mansion is an analog that that's the way more way beyond that

1062
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:33,280
certainly. But like I, what a cool, what a type of move Disney's really only done once or maybe

1063
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:39,680
twice. Like it's very, it's really different. Yeah. And it does like it definitely like, this is

1064
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:45,600
sounding like what they're talking about with the hotel and with every, like this feels very much

1065
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:51,280
more like there's a full narrative and you are really in it. Whereas most rides it's a very,

1066
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:54,480
you're still, even though you're in the car and you're supposed to be going through the thing,

1067
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:58,880
it's a much more passive kind of experience. You're much more of a specter. This really feels like,

1068
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:03,520
yeah, both of them are right. Yeah. Literally on the other one. Is there more, is there more to say

1069
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:07,680
about rise of the resistance or should we move on to? So I mean, that's kind of where we, where

1070
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:12,400
we were ushered out and kind of thrown back to the rest of the land, but it is very interesting that

1071
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:16,880
kind of their top level viewpoint of galaxy's edge is that they want you to feel like you're,

1072
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:22,080
you're in your own star Wars story, which is the exact PR messaging. But like the way they set up

1073
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:25,840
the ride is that it's cinematic. So you feel like you're in a scene, like you feel like you're in

1074
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:30,320
scenes in the movie throughout. And I think a lot of that is the scale. Like the, the art we've all

1075
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:33,840
seen is that you're in that little vehicle and like the ad-hats are like very tall and you're very

1076
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:38,320
small under them. And I think a lot of that will be feeling like you're in scenes and like things

1077
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:44,320
are scary and large and intense. Yeah. I do think that will the size of the AT-ATs will scare me.

1078
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:50,320
Yeah. I think I feel it's big things in a small room. Scott has a fear of big things in a small

1079
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:55,600
room. Is there anything in a ride specifically that, you know, thankfully I don't get it in rides a

1080
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:02,640
lot, but I get it from just 16 bit super Mario worlds where if you're in a small space with that

1081
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:14,640
big ghost, big boo, big boo. It's all fake and like the most like many generations ago graphics,

1082
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:19,120
but the idea of you open a door and then a ghost that big. Yeah. I can tell you're like really

1083
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:22,080
working through some stuff with this ride. You're like how scared should they be? Yeah,

1084
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:27,120
I know. You've kind of gotten me to this vulnerable place in general. There's a, I think, yeah, well,

1085
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:34,880
I think the level of detail extending to of like your, your eyesight of like your eyes almost as

1086
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:40,960
the camera of like all the coverage years included talking about walking into the land and like

1087
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:47,360
everything slowly revealing itself. Yeah. Yeah. Like, um, yeah. What do you know about like when,

1088
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:52,160
when a guest just enters galaxy's edge, what's the deal? So we, the one thing we didn't do is

1089
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:57,440
actually physically enter through either, either the three entrances. Those are walled up, I guess.

1090
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:02,560
And then the entrance that's by like back by critter country where you'll enter through the

1091
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:08,160
resistance forest is that area. So that you don't really get as, as much of the whole like,

1092
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:12,640
cause the whole area that unfolds is black spiral outpost, which is the main section.

1093
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:18,000
So that's the frontier land and the fantasy land entrances at Disneyland TBD at Disney worlds,

1094
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,640
because we don't really know the orientation.

1095
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,720
You'll pass to pizza riso, I think. God bless pizza riso.

1096
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:35,040
The pizza is garbage, but it is run by a rat. All right. That seems like in the middle.

1097
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:40,240
I love the theming. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. That's a notch in Doug's belt.

1098
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:44,960
Well, do you guys know about the, the, what happens to the sign at night? No. So at night they have

1099
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:50,320
this big neon sign outside. It says like pizza riso and there's some slogan under and like about

1100
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:55,520
every 15 seconds, the lights flicker and some of the letters blackout. And then it says it's rat pizza.

1101
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:05,840
Brilliant. This is the most embattled thing in a theme park. People have been hard one way,

1102
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:10,240
hard the other. That's an interesting, I mean, I'm not liking the food I can get,

1103
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:14,720
but not liking the theming. What's wrong with you? Wow. Well, the guests have said that I

1104
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:19,200
feel like you were not, but you missed some stuff. I missed the upstairs room, which was the,

1105
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:23,200
like the disco room, which I, it sounds really great, but as far as just like kind of walking

1106
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:28,000
in and out, you really have to look hard for a lot of the detail. Cause like when you think

1107
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:33,280
Muppet restaurant, I think my, my expectations were pretty high. Yes. So it's just sort of like,

1108
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:37,760
well, there's a sign that has a reference to the Muppets, which is nice, but I was thinking,

1109
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:41,520
I was hoping like there'd be a rat with a chef's hat on. Oh yeah. I would love a Muppet character

1110
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:45,520
dining. I think that's my dying wish. Yeah. So I think that's really where it's coming from,

1111
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:49,840
but yeah, I had a, there's a feud with friend of the show, Doug Jones, who started texting me

1112
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:56,480
angrily from Orlando that pizza risotto was good. And then apparently I, I told the story of him

1113
01:15:56,480 --> 01:16:03,360
texting me on the show and he said that I trashed him and then we hashed it out on another episode.

1114
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:08,480
So there's a whole long, and then when I go back to Orlando, I will reassess pizza risotto.

1115
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:12,400
I'm not trying to be just a hater, but we can't, we can't, we're getting too much.

1116
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:17,600
We're talking about that. I'm still stuck on the fact that you will transition from, I love that.

1117
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:22,640
I love that a lot. I'm stuck. I'm hung up on the fact that you will transition from critter country

1118
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:29,040
into resistance forest. That is what crazy neighbors. Yes. But it, I think it'll work.

1119
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:33,600
Yeah, I think so too. Cause I was on the Mark Twain the other day and I was like, oh, the rock

1120
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:42,400
work. Yeah. No, yeah, I'm always on the Mark Twain. But the eyes, the, the eyelines, the rock work

1121
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:52,080
around the train tracks and the rock work slash petrified trees of black fire outposts did look

1122
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:58,320
right together. There is one opening of trees where you can see a clearly star wars turret.

1123
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:01,840
So hopefully they'll put some more trees right there. They just started putting in trees. Oh,

1124
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,480
okay. Cause I was asking them very specific tree questions and they're like, uh, I have no idea.

1125
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:11,760
Can you tell me the name of this tree? And they were like, I worked on the ride. Like, no.

1126
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:18,000
So they're putting, cause also when you, um, so when you're on, I guess rise, I guess that's what

1127
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,240
we'll call it. Sure. When in that area where you go outside to get on the cargo ship thing,

1128
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:27,840
currently you can see the whole land from there, but they will be filling it with trees so that

1129
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:32,320
nobody from outside in the land can see that portion of the attraction. So there's a lot of

1130
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:36,800
landscaping to be, cause that'd be like the, the allies and the access were like looking right at

1131
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:41,680
each other. Cause the resistance is set up in the woods. The first order is set up in black fire.

1132
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:51,120
I'm Sarah Palin seeing Russia Russia from Falcon. We talk. Okay. So, um, I guess to go back to the

1133
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:56,000
entrances. So it's the thing that I can, we've compared it to this on Len and Jim's podcast,

1134
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:01,280
but it's like coming under the railroad when you enter magic kingdom or Disneyland, where you

1135
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,640
enter, where you can't see anything from the gate and you get like a little more and then they

1136
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:09,120
shrink you down and then they expand it back open. And that's what it's like. But once you enter,

1137
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:14,160
you can't see the Falcon. You have to go kind of into black square outpost in the middle of the

1138
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:18,880
town. And then it appears. What do you see in first? You see kind of the buildings, the different

1139
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:23,920
structures, depending on which one you walk in. If you walk in fantasy land, there will be, um,

1140
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:29,920
a first order ship on your right. Yes. Or left your right. Cause that's like the first order side.

1141
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:35,280
Basically is the entrance through fantasy land. And then if you enter through frontier land,

1142
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:38,400
you'll be kind of in the center. And then there's, if you look at the model or photos of that,

1143
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:42,240
there's that stairway. There's like a little stairway and then a walkway and you can go up

1144
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:47,600
that. And then it would be Falcon time. Okay. Okay. Falcon time. Well, if it's Falcon time,

1145
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:51,680
uh, what can you tell us about that? You've been inside, you've been, you've been in a cabin. Yes.

1146
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:56,800
I've pushed all the buttons. I've pulled the levers. Wow. There's a lot of them. I guess.

1147
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,400
There's so many buttons. Do they really all, and they all do something. Do you have to?

1148
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:05,040
That's the thing is that I, you guys have been on mission space, I assume. Yeah. Yes. Where it's

1149
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:10,800
like push the, and then if you don't push it, it's just like, it doesn't override and it does it.

1150
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,720
And I can't really get an answer on if that will something like that will happen or not. Yeah. But

1151
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:19,760
there are a lot of buttons and I don't know how many will be lit for you to push it once, but it,

1152
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:23,760
I mean, it feels like the real thing. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Like even the chairs, I was looking at

1153
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:28,800
photos, like the chairs look exactly the same. And I, from the description, I forget which

1154
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,800
article said that it was a religious experience being in the Falcon, but one of them did.

1155
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:37,040
And I think I was like, they were like, yeah, everything feels like it's not a chintzy

1156
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:43,520
like little button. It's like, these are like, it feels like a real machinery. Yeah. It's not pretend.

1157
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:48,160
Right. But I guess we should, so we should talk about the fact that, so you wait in the queue to

1158
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:53,360
get in there and the queue is two levels and it takes you past the whole outside of the ship.

1159
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:57,200
So you get to see the ship from the level of the top of the ship, which is very cool,

1160
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:00,800
which is not an angle. I thought that would be worthwhile, but it's like to your left and

1161
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:05,680
it's just there and it's very neat. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Cool. This is cause you are loading into

1162
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:11,040
the Bay of, I believe it's Onaka transport solutions. Don't quote me on that. That is,

1163
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:17,200
no, that you can quote them. Is that right? Yes. Got it. So Hondo Onaka, a character only seen in

1164
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:25,280
the cartoons has started a transport company and she has loaned him the Falcon. I love

1165
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:30,400
bureaucratic solutions to ride. Probably love like fake companies and rides and stuff. Yeah.

1166
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:35,120
They like plot this character from cartoons and made him the second most advanced audio animatronic

1167
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:42,400
they've ever built. Yeah. Shaman. Yeah. Shaman of song, but also not from a film. It's weird that

1168
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:49,040
the two most original. Yeah. Kind of neat. Which I have two, one that it's always easier to make

1169
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:55,520
an alien creature look more realistic than try to get into uncanny Valley territory. That must be

1170
01:20:55,520 --> 01:21:01,040
why. The other thing is, and this is probably too cynical of me, but I'm like, if that was a chewy

1171
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:07,280
animatronic, everyone will want to stand and watch it. But if it's a character they care less about,

1172
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:12,160
they'll be impressed and move on. Maybe. Maybe that's my personal theory. The great Jim

1173
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:19,040
Cummings doing the voice. Yeah. He does it in the cartoon in star wars rebels. Yeah. Yeah. He,

1174
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:24,400
I mean, what do you know him? He's, I mean, he's always dark winged dog. Of course I weirdly go,

1175
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:29,280
but he's been winning the poo for a long time. I weirdly go back to Pete as much as Pete is not a

1176
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:33,680
major. I just, when I hear, when I hear his voice, especially being, being mean and gruff, I think of

1177
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:38,080
the big fat cat Pete from goof troop and goofy movie. This is going to sound stupid, but I didn't

1178
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:44,240
realize Pete wasn't a dog until about three weeks ago. Whoa. What is he? Pizza cat. Oh,

1179
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:50,400
that's why he's after Mickey and steamboat Willie. Okay. Anyway, that's fine. With everyone. I mean,

1180
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:57,520
they're very complex creatures, cats. So, uh, yeah, but I think how do I mean, he looks great. Like

1181
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:03,680
the, what they believe in action. He was good. He kind of like swirls on his base. He swirls like

1182
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:08,400
back and forth, but he has full hand motion. They like went into a lot of detail about how

1183
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:13,200
they like specifically did everything to make him look real, but also to fit in extra.

1184
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:19,680
I mean, read Matt's story. He knows all the, yeah, it's like electric transistors in the heads.

1185
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:26,160
Yes. It's easier to make fluid movements then, and you don't have to have hydraulic lines running

1186
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:31,680
into the animatronics. So like you have more space for other components. I only kind of understand.

1187
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:38,800
We have a lot of panels on those type of details and I was like, TNL really doesn't cover the

1188
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:47,440
science of your audience. Yeah. You saw that in imagineering. Yes. Right. I think we saw him in

1189
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:52,320
the ride also, but I can't remember if he was animated or not at the time. Oh, so there was

1190
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:57,360
probably an animatronic. So the animatronics we saw at WDI were the ones that are being shipped

1191
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:03,120
to Florida. Oh, okay. So it's, you know, it's the exact same one, but just those are being finalized

1192
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:08,320
to be shipped. Oh, cause they don't need them there yet. Cause that one's a few months like

1193
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:13,520
further on the schedule of this one. Wow. When you're in imagineering, do you like

1194
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:19,680
look over and like is Bell's animatronic from the Japan, uh, you saw that? Oh, yeah. Okay.

1195
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:27,200
Yeah. Cause I was sort of thinking it would be like, well, they only let you see this one thing

1196
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:33,520
in the specific place for star wars. They do tend to like push some things away. Like there's this

1197
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:38,560
one hallway that's sort of a conference room at WDI that every event like this is held in.

1198
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:43,200
And then next to conference room is a workshop where they work on a lot of stuff that is usually

1199
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:47,760
newsworthy. And I found it very interesting that this time when I had to go to the bathroom, I took

1200
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:53,600
the long way. Oh, wow. Like we will assure you to take three right turns so that you don't take a

1201
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:59,680
left. Oh, interesting. So they definitely hid that from us this trip, but, um, no, like, uh,

1202
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:05,440
we saw the beast and we saw bell, but what were, I think there were two A's. Yeah. We saw them

1203
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:09,520
working on it. There's that. I saw that in that video was the horse bell. Oh, I don't think I saw

1204
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:13,440
that. I mean, it was a little like, I was trying so hard to write stuff down and I didn't pay

1205
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:18,880
attention, but it was there. They're working on it. Was there any Spiderman anywhere? No. Oh,

1206
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:24,640
no, no, no. They, we did see the thing that actually Matthew covered at tech crunch.

1207
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:30,000
The, I forget the name of it. The, um, the AA that they fling in the air. Oh, yes. Yes. I

1208
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:35,360
forget the name of that project. Yeah. It's a stunt. Yeah. The robot stunt. Yes. Whatever

1209
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:41,600
the specific name of that is, we saw where that was filmed. Oh, it's like right behind the animation

1210
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:46,080
building. Right. Yeah. Wow. Really? Yeah. Awesome. But yeah, we did see that.

1211
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:53,360
She's building and out. You're seeing Florida, Honda, Honda and Florida. Rex.

1212
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:57,680
Oh, and Honda also has a Droid with him, but I don't know if it's, I don't know what Droid.

1213
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:01,600
Right. Okay. I don't know. I don't know who Honda's Droid is, if that exists.

1214
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:05,200
Anyway, you gotta learn about, we all have to immediately love Honda.

1215
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:09,600
I love him already. And I love his Droid, but I don't know what it looks like or what his name is.

1216
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:15,680
It'll be a good time. So you're in that room with him and TBD Droid, and then you go down

1217
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:20,240
a hallway, et cetera, et cetera. And then you are in what I believe is called the guest quarters

1218
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:26,000
of the Millennium Falcon, the main area with like the holo chest thing. Yeah. And they change the

1219
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:31,280
way that they queue the rides that you get to hang out in there. How many of those do you think

1220
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:36,640
there are? There's one. There's just one of those. How many cockpits of the Millennium Falcon are

1221
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:42,400
there? So, okay. I've asked some follow-up questions and they kind of were like, whatever are you

1222
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:47,600
talking about? But the way they designed it so that it feels like there's six people that load

1223
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:52,800
onto one and it feels like you're the only person that's in it. Sure. But I'm very curious to know

1224
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:57,920
the mechanism by which that works. There might be multiple Millennium Falcon ones. I don't know.

1225
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:01,520
The thing is they took us down very specific hallways. So I don't know if there were other

1226
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:05,360
hallways or if it was the only hallway, but regardless, everyone will feel like they're the

1227
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:12,320
only person who's piloting or gunning or engineering the ship. Right. It's a very neat trick and a

1228
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:17,680
much different from like say the Back to the Future or Simpsons ride where you can see

1229
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:23,920
all of the doors. All of them pulling at once. Chewy, we're home. Chewy, we're home. Chewy,

1230
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:28,800
we're just down the line. That's what the cast members will say when they take your picture with

1231
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:33,440
your eye. All right. Everyone say Chewy, we're home. Well, actually, I don't know if there are

1232
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:41,680
multiple because it must hold like 60 people. Okay. You mean multiple areas before the cockpit.

1233
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:46,640
Guest quarters of the Millennium Falcon. That's a good question. Because you hang out in there for

1234
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:50,880
a bit. So I don't know if it's just like a queue where they would just hold the next 60 in line in

1235
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:57,680
one place. Yeah. We're in general finding ways to have areas that are you're still in line and

1236
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:02,000
you're still waiting. This is going to sound like a stupid comparison, but it's almost it seems like

1237
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:07,360
what they've started to do over at the Race Through New York attraction. That's exactly what I compare

1238
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:11,600
it to. Okay. Okay. Huh? Interesting. Because it is the type of thing where you wait until

1239
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:16,720
your group is called. Okay. Well, that's cool. That's a better way to give you this stuff up.

1240
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:20,160
I mean, I don't know if they'll have like tabletop games. Why is the holo chest?

1241
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:25,920
Well, yeah. But if there's only one of those tables, that's going to be a fight. Yeah.

1242
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:33,520
People will die. Yeah. What else on Falcon? You went inside, you touched buttons. Any

1243
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:38,240
weird factoids about that? No, I mean, the screens weren't up and running. So it was just kind of,

1244
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:44,160
we only got to experience sitting there. But I mean, I don't know how operationally they're

1245
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:48,400
going to decide who gets to sit in the first two seats. Yeah. I know I would murder someone

1246
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:52,960
to be able to sit there. Yeah. That's, that feels like a big problem coming, right? Cause like,

1247
01:27:52,960 --> 01:28:00,000
who, it's like, doesn't come down for their like, especially for less weird people, like unlike us,

1248
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,640
who we're going to go a lot or try to go a lot of people for their one vacation and they want to

1249
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:07,840
sit in that front seat. So here's what's interesting is that I know that there's

1250
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:12,720
not a lot of information out about how play Disney parks factors in or how your reputation

1251
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:16,320
follows you throughout the land. That whole thing that none of us have any clear details on.

1252
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:20,640
I think that I don't know if it's part of that, that you have to do different positions that that,

1253
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:24,800
cause I know it's like a group score. I don't know if sitting not in the front two seats is

1254
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:30,320
beneficial for you. Who knows? Interesting. But I mean, in every Disney ride, you can always request

1255
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:35,120
where you want to sit. Right. Yeah. And I can't see it being different for this, but they're going

1256
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:39,440
to need like a two hour line for all the people that request. Maybe they have that. Maybe they

1257
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:45,040
have it. Cause I always request where to sit on flight of passage. Oh, what is the secret for that?

1258
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:50,640
What is the, I think it's seat eight. Cause you know, it's two rows of, it's 16 seats. I believe

1259
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:55,600
first date and then second eight. No, I request seat nine because it, it, that means you're in the

1260
01:28:55,600 --> 01:29:01,840
middle of the screen. I wrote a whole story about this once. And then I request like what level is,

1261
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:05,840
yeah, I like to be in the middle one, but it really doesn't make as big of a difference as long as

1262
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:11,200
you're in the middle of your interesting 16 seat thing. A question about both rides that I'm not

1263
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:18,880
sure I saw gift shops after exit. We were not, we were not taken through, but there are, who knows?

1264
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:24,240
I don't know because they did. So they, all of the stores they referenced, there's like a resistance

1265
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,600
posts where you can buy a resistance gear and then there's like a first order or something.

1266
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:32,640
We were first order stuff and those aren't at the ride exits. Right. So maybe not. Maybe not.

1267
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:39,600
You're going to have plenty of ways to spend your money. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You have doc,

1268
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:44,400
owned ours den of antiquities shop. Yes. You do have doc, hundreds of antiquities,

1269
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:50,560
which I forget what I tried to say his name earlier. Oh, what? Uh, the other episode we were

1270
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:57,360
recording later, but yeah, you Jason called them like doc on or don't go. Yeah. I think it was

1271
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:05,200
confusing him and Hondo Onaka. Uh, how could you? So now he is the animat, he's the animatronic,

1272
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:10,160
right? He's like the gruff shop owner, but he's a big animatronic and, but you do not actually

1273
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:15,120
haggle with him. That's been, that's the rumor, but it seems like it's kind of been debunked

1274
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:20,400
because that's, that would be where I would be immediately. I think it's not imperative to the

1275
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:26,800
checkout process, but I think that the cast member in the store haggles with him. I did clarify,

1276
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:31,360
which I thought was maybe the smartest question I've ever asked is does he speak English? And

1277
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:36,800
the answer was no. Whoa. Which means that I think that you never get to converse with him. Sure.

1278
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:41,520
Cause he doesn't speak English. I believe they call that standard. The language is called standard

1279
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:46,640
in star wars language is what English is called. Oh, okay. I didn't know that.

1280
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:55,200
So like depending on what the line is like, the human performer could like decide how much business

1281
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:59,600
they'll have with the robot and the customer. Maybe. Well, also the other thing is that I think a lot,

1282
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:05,040
I think this is like a high end store. So I think maybe if you're buying like a fancy collectible,

1283
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:10,720
then the interaction would happen. Is this the store that sells, I saw a picture, there were

1284
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:16,960
gold busts of Jedis, including Yoda, Mace, window, and my favorite Jedi council member, Plo Koon.

1285
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:25,520
Is this that place probably? So, yes, I think they also said a lot of Sith related goods.

1286
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:29,520
Why would it in the same store? I'm pretty sure that's where those are being sold.

1287
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:36,480
Interesting. So this is like not the jewels of Biff. I cannot confirm or deny where the jewels

1288
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:44,480
of Biff will be. So Galactic Basic is what English is called. Oh, that is such a good insult.

1289
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:50,640
Yeah. Standard. And then our Bush is the language is sort of the sea on a lot of stuff. Yeah,

1290
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:53,680
which will be throughout the land. I know that, but I'm definitely going to call somebody a

1291
01:31:53,680 --> 01:32:01,680
Galactic Basic if they're being annoying in star wars land. You're going to be calling 200,000

1292
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:07,600
people that phrase. So they, did they tell you like, this is more of an upscale store? Like

1293
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:12,800
it feels like this. And then the lightsaber thing also is upscale, at least price-wise.

1294
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:19,120
No, because I fact-checked that and it, I'm still, I sent a follow-up email. I'm still trying to

1295
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:24,960
find out, but I know that one publication ran with pricing, which was, I believe like, I want to say

1296
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:30,160
like a hundred dollars for a hilt and then like $49 for a blade. So it put the price of a lightsaber

1297
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:35,920
around 160. But from what I understand, that's not the main one at the shop that you would make.

1298
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:40,080
Oh, okay. So that's maybe a special one. So they said this thing called a legacy lightsaber. This

1299
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:45,040
is so detailed. I'm very sorry. No, no, that's what we want. So in one meeting they said

1300
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:49,360
legacy lightsaber, which was like a fancy lightsaber of a character. So like a Kylo Ren

1301
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:54,320
lightsaber. And then when we toured Doc Ondar's, they said like, this is where those legacy

1302
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:59,600
lightsabers we sold under glass and under glass means expensive. Right. Yeah. But I can't get a

1303
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:04,240
final word on if that 160 is for the legacy lightsabers or for something else. Interesting

1304
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:10,960
because there's a lightsaber show at the like salvage or place where you design one. Yeah.

1305
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:16,160
In experience. Yes. In experience. What are the sabers? How are they doing the sabers?

1306
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:23,600
Okay. So when you go to Savi, wait a minute, Savi's lightsabers. I know there's a dash in there.

1307
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:32,400
I'm seeing Savi's workshop. So I know that that, I mean, if you had to relate it to something,

1308
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:38,560
it would be going to Wizarding World and getting like the show with the wand, except that this is

1309
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:44,480
more handmade. I know that you have a say in what Kyber crystal and what kind of basic saber you

1310
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:48,560
want, but there's a lot of show elements they didn't tell us about, but I know it is a show

1311
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:53,760
attractiony experience. Wow. That's also merchandise. But then when you get it, what is it?

1312
01:33:54,880 --> 01:34:00,160
It's like two pieces, right? Like it doesn't extend. It's a good, it's not like a cheapy.

1313
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:05,840
No, it is not cheap. I was like, Oh, it's heavy. Like pretty significant. Sure. And then it, you

1314
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:09,840
know, when you push the on button, like it makes the noise, it lights up, whatever color crystal

1315
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:17,120
you have. And the crystals are interchangeable with a Holocron. Holocron. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

1316
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:22,560
And they're going to sell like a whole, like a sling for you to carry this around the land.

1317
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:27,360
So you're not just carrying a weapon, whacking people. Okay. Very interesting. You bring this

1318
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:32,480
up because I did mention that and they were like, it's no different from the sabers we sell in the

1319
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:37,840
park. So we don't foresee any issues. So I know that operationally they're already on top of that.

1320
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:42,480
But when I interviewed Scott, he did mention that they, there will be a sling because I,

1321
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:45,600
I was like, Oh, so I'm just going to be carrying like a bag of a drawing, like should be care,

1322
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:52,800
all this stuff. And he's like, yeah, interesting. Take a giant pole on a 20 minute ride.

1323
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,440
That's the thing is that you can't, I don't think you can bring it on the ride. Yes.

1324
01:34:56,320 --> 01:35:00,080
I don't know if they hold it for the end of the day after you make it. I don't know if you,

1325
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:05,760
they send it back to your hotel. The process is a little, um, yeah, yeah, they got to work something

1326
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:10,320
out there. It seems like they know what they're doing, but they haven't told me. Right. Uh, uh,

1327
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:17,280
colors. How many colors do we know? Purple, red, green, green and blue. Okay. I was wondering

1328
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:23,120
five different, or no, four, four or five different like genres. One's like power and light. And one

1329
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:30,400
is like evil. Sure. Uh, okay. Uh, my story comes out this week by the way. I don't remember.

1330
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:34,560
Okay. I was just wondering if there would be like a rainbow lightsaber, which is what I would watch.

1331
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:39,520
Maybe for gay days. That'd be cool. Oh my God. That would be my choice of color for it. Either

1332
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:43,920
a purple, I guess, like mace windows or rainbow as a kid. Those were my two favorite colors.

1333
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:51,840
Yeah. Uh, so we'll get back to the droid depot. Let's, let's talk a little toy,

1334
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:59,760
dairy and toy shop or whatever it is. A toy shop or toy fair. There we go. Is that in the

1335
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:04,960
marketplace? Yes. Okay. So everything we've just discussed is okay. Black Spire outpost is part

1336
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:09,440
sook. You know, like probably an old timey marketplace with stalls. And then there are

1337
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:15,360
individual standalone shops and buildings. So everything doc on DARS, Savi's workshop,

1338
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:20,160
Droid Depot, all that stuff, like the, the dining, the Cantina, that's a buildings. And then

1339
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:26,720
Ronto roasters is the entrance to this marketplace that leads you towards resistance forest. Yeah.

1340
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:32,960
And Ronto roasters is like meat stuff, including a space hot dog in a pita.

1341
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:40,880
And that is the official space hot dog. Yeah. It is a, I believe a Portuguese hot dog inside of a

1342
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:49,120
pita with slices of pork topped with a slaw and a clutch sauce, which has says one peppercorn in it.

1343
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:54,400
I just want to say this whole episode has been frigging clutch sauce.

1344
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:01,200
So yeah. So what is it? What is a Portuguese hot dog? What is the difference?

1345
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:09,680
It's kind of spicier Portuguese sauce. I didn't, I found it to taste much like a generic American

1346
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:17,760
hot dog. But perfect. They said it, but I was told it was Portuguese. I didn't find the hot

1347
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:23,600
dog to have any spice in it. It was mostly the clutch sauce. I will be filling a droid backpack

1348
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:30,160
with them to wait, to wait in line for rise of the resistance. It'll probably get me to at least the

1349
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:38,400
whole thing. So I start bartering with first water troops. You don't even go on the ride

1350
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:43,200
because you just exchange hot dogs for your escape. I am making my own Disney play app,

1351
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:53,840
which is all hot dog bartering based. So yeah. So a toy, a toy dairy toy maker is one of the stalls

1352
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:59,520
in this marketplace. So we only went in one of the stalls. We went in the creature stall, which is

1353
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:06,160
small. I mean, this isn't like, this is not a shop. This is just a little, a nook. I mean, like a,

1354
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:13,600
like a shop size nook inside of the marketplace, but it's fully, Oh my God, it's fully propped out.

1355
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:18,400
So I think it's going to be a very, very themed smaller environment. Having seen the creature one,

1356
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:24,800
I assume it's going to be a lot of like references to characters via toys, like soft plushes,

1357
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:30,480
little squeezy things. Is there any sort of, cause a toy Darien, for those of you who don't know,

1358
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:40,000
is the Wado's alien race. Is there a Wado around? We have asked that and we have not gotten the

1359
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:47,680
straight answer. But I know there is like a few toy Darien toys. I saw a picture of a toy Darien

1360
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:54,720
toy, but I would like a robot Wado to be flying around in there. But the plush Wado is really

1361
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:59,280
cute. It's going to be strange if they're big, this black eye, like the button eyes that I look

1362
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:05,440
the plushes are really cute. But like, give me some real life aliens selling me some merch.

1363
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:10,000
Yeah. So that's what I saw. I, that's my biggest question I think for the land right now, not the

1364
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:14,400
rest of the 70% of the ride, but will I get to talk to a toy Darien?

1365
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:19,600
So the way that it's been conveyed to me is that there is an opening day plan and then there was

1366
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:24,960
a further rollout from there. Oh, interesting. So I don't, I cannot tell if that means that

1367
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:30,960
the answer is yes, but not yet. Cause I forget if you were talking about this on Disney dish, but

1368
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:34,160
because at first they were talking about droids roaming the land sort of autonomous,

1369
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:38,720
autonomous, but every piece of artwork, but there's no way for the first so many months

1370
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:42,720
that's possible, right? Cause there'd be too many people and kids pushing them over.

1371
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:48,880
And I think it depends on what the actual ops are once it opens. But I, I mean, from what I've

1372
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:53,920
been told that is intended to be part of the land. I don't think they've been like, let's just

1373
01:39:53,920 --> 01:40:00,320
forget it. But also like, I want to see a droid, but I mean, there's going to be stationary things

1374
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:04,560
like outside of Droid Depot, there's going to be a lineup of droids like in the fourth movie where

1375
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:10,880
like, you know, they beep boop at you and stuff. It's funny. You said earlier, like, you know,

1376
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:17,520
stuff Disney saying publicly and press releases and stuff, like they're very careful because it

1377
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:23,520
like, Oh, then that becomes rule of law, word of law, whatever. But in the early stuff they have,

1378
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:29,360
there was going to be like a table service dinner club. And that is seems to be off the table now.

1379
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:34,000
Um, yeah. And they did not publicly mention that it was not happening until we were like,

1380
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:38,240
is this the only dining option? Because you definitely mentioned a very dope supper club.

1381
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:44,080
Yeah. And no, um, I can't tell if there's room for that on the backside, like past the cantina

1382
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:48,480
and they just haven't, that's maybe a phase two thing, but that is definitely not happening

1383
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:54,080
right now. Cause Ronto Roasters is like quick service meant to be kind of more like a kiosk.

1384
01:40:54,080 --> 01:41:00,160
Yeah. More like a kiosk. There's the popcorn at that's got a Cotzakas kettle. Yes. Cotzakas kettle.

1385
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:06,880
Docking Bay seven is the big quick service table, like sitting down at a table,

1386
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:10,880
quick service restaurant. Yeah. Interesting. Uh, like it does feel like with that restaurant,

1387
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:13,920
it's like, I'm sure they would make a ton of money. So I wonder what the reasoning

1388
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:20,000
for getting into that is. I mean, this is me just speculating. I have to assume it was just

1389
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,960
something that they could be like, we don't have time. Let's do this later. Um, but I mean,

1390
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:30,400
that would be a huge upsell. Yeah. That's what I mean. I would be, I would not be surprised if they

1391
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:36,480
announced that in like two years. Right. Yeah. What's, um, okay. So I have some of these food

1392
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:42,320
items in front of me and we're like the, you know, if I refer to the, no, not literally, but, uh,

1393
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:48,800
you know, what is this? Correct me. Put me in the right place. Uh, but where, which, where's

1394
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:54,640
the place where I get the, uh, smoked cadu ribs? That is a docking bay seven food and cargo.

1395
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:59,280
Okay. Great. Which are ribs served with blueberry cord bread. Yes. Well, here's what's interesting

1396
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:05,200
is that they sliced the ribs in half the other way instead of going down the line, they slice it

1397
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:10,400
and then in half the other direction. So they have a kind of like alien shape to them, which I guess

1398
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:13,840
is, um, like a butcher cut that they had to specifically order and get.

1399
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:19,760
Which is pretty cool. They reimagined cutting meat. Oh, and then the, um, what is the chicken called?

1400
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:28,800
The, the fried endorian tip. Yes. That is also, they said that they sourced in all white breast

1401
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:38,320
meat that comes naturally compressed in a rectangular cubic shape that they then, um, they coat in a,

1402
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:44,880
house made, this is how much work I've done, a house made flour breading. And then they deep fry

1403
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:52,800
it. Yeah. So it's this like, like unique alien chicken nugget. Uh, I, it's, I cannot wait to watch

1404
01:42:52,800 --> 01:43:00,720
heat stroke dads go like, all right, I need three, uh, fried yip tips. A couple of the

1405
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:07,120
can candy, where it can be a job. Shrimp noodle salad. Yeah. Uh, uh, just trying to,

1406
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:13,360
it's not the pollution garden spread or not blue milk or green. I don't know. Just a milk. There's

1407
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:19,760
two milks. Oh boy. Milk in the milk. What are you talking about? Milk in the milk. There is no milk

1408
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:24,400
in the milk. Yeah. Yeah. That is no milk in the milk. Yeah. Yeah. Did you get to try the alcoholic

1409
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:30,880
drinks? We tried one. Okay. Um, the food and beverage program I would say is, you know, it's,

1410
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:37,520
it's a bit alien in look and in style, but it's not drastically different from a Disney bar. I

1411
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:43,520
think that it's, um, it still feels very Disney in terms of the beverage program. It feel all of it

1412
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:51,200
feels like familiar things presented in a unique way. Like it's not flavors that conflict. It's

1413
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:56,800
like, Oh, it's ribs and cornbread, but maybe you don't have blueberries and every kind of cornbread

1414
01:43:56,800 --> 01:44:00,880
you eat, but it's like a complimentary side dish. I mean, they, I think what they've done is they've

1415
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:06,080
snuck some flavors in that the general audience will be shocked by because that blueberry cornbread

1416
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:10,400
has a little cayenne in it. Oh, that's really fun. So it's kind of stuff where like they've,

1417
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:15,120
they've taken these spices from around the world and like shove them into these foods that look a

1418
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:19,280
little alien, but are a little normal and to make kind of please everyone. And I think they did a

1419
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:26,400
good job of that. And a lot of vegetarian and vegan friendly stuff, which is future rate, like

1420
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:31,120
gets more and more future. All the time. I thought I was going to be eating like a ham hock. I don't

1421
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:37,600
know if there's meaning a ton of meat and the last, no, we're going to eat rath char or, um, uh,

1422
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:45,360
the thing that almost ate Luke and Jedi. Oh, um, not a taunt. A tauntaun is what he rides.

1423
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:49,040
That's possible. And that, that plush tauntaun very cute. Oh my God. And when you pet it,

1424
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:53,920
like not squeeze it. When you pet it, it goes like, Oh, it makes a little noise. Okay. All

1425
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:58,640
the creatures in the creature stall are like these future pets where it's, I mean, the poor,

1426
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:02,160
the party is very fun, but it's a puppet. So you have to put your hand in it. But the other stuff,

1427
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:06,880
like, um, the rath stars, the thing with the teeth, they have one of those that's plastic.

1428
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:11,600
It's not as soft, but when you activate it, it just like freaks out and shakes and jumps around.

1429
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:18,320
Wow. That's wild. What drink did you have? I want to say a tatami and sunset. That's probably

1430
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:24,000
inaccurate. Did you have the milks? No, we did not have the milks. I know. I want to have those

1431
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:32,000
milks real bad. I was mad when they did like the, um, whatever they called it in 2015, when they,

1432
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,840
they did hyperspace mountain and they did all this star Wars food. I think they actually did

1433
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:42,640
themselves a favor by setting the bar so low on this, that stuff. Then this stuff seems extra

1434
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:48,000
impressive now. Yeah. I mean, it's going to be served at the milk stand frozen, like a smoothie.

1435
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:54,320
So, um, it sounds much more appetizing than a lukewarm glass of milk. Yeah. Jason's going to be

1436
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:57,520
disappointed though. I think he was looking forward to a lukewarm glass of milk. Well,

1437
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:04,160
in, in Ogas, it's milk milk. Someone has close read some articles. I have read an obscene amount

1438
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:11,520
of articles. It is served chilled at Ogas Candida with a rice crispy cookie on top. Oh, really? Yeah.

1439
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:17,280
Yeah. Oh, now I'm into this milk with a little like bantha horn fondant thing.

1440
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:24,400
Wow. Well, let me move things to, to what perks me up beer and wine. Yeah. Cause there obviously,

1441
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:31,440
yes. Not only Rex is playing synth music in the place where Rex is playing synth music. It's also

1442
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:36,480
the place you can get alcohol. I was, I was starting to wonder, well, is it all star Warsy

1443
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:41,360
drinks, which all sound like fun, but also like, you know, I read the fuzzy tauntaun. It's like a

1444
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:46,480
fuzzy navel. I don't think I'm drinking a fuzzy navel probably. Uh, there's a rum punch and a

1445
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:51,920
bloody Mary. I would, I don't like bloody Mary's, uh, bloody rancor, which comes with a meringue

1446
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:57,200
bone you can put in your mouth. What? It's very, okay. So there's, I don't know how much time you

1447
01:46:57,200 --> 01:47:01,840
guys spend at Disney world, but there's this place, Amorettes Patisserie in Disney Springs,

1448
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:06,240
which is like Dean and DeLuca pastries. It's so fancy and it's so beautiful and nice.

1449
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:10,000
You buy like a petite cake and you eat it, maybe share it with people or eat it alone. If you're

1450
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:16,720
me, but it's so good. And that dude made the meringue bone. Wow. And he also made the desserts

1451
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:24,720
at docking Bay seven, which were very good. Right. Yes. One was an orb. And then one was this like,

1452
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:29,920
I want to say it's buttermilk, but it was like this crusted green thing that I,

1453
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I think it was maybe Jim or Len who mentioned like, or no, no, it was my, it was my editor

1454
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:38,640
eater was like, is this supposed to be a reference to that bread that Ray makes? Like that portion

1455
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:42,160
that kind of grows very fast. And I think it might be because they haven't told us the name

1456
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:46,000
of it yet. Interesting. So it's this green thing and then you burst it like burst open with like

1457
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:54,480
purple colored raspberry filling. So good. It's like high end pastry. Good. She is in a more

1458
01:47:55,200 --> 01:48:00,960
reputable Baker made a meringue bone just for a type of Bloody Mary. They have the level of

1459
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:05,600
detail they're going to get that bone for the Bloody Mary, which you're only going to drink

1460
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:10,240
like the first three hours of the day. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Presumably. So I think there's a lot

1461
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:13,280
of like, I think the drinks look like Disney drinks, like you were saying, like they look

1462
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:17,120
like things that a Disney audience will be safe with, but they're filled with ingredients. You

1463
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:22,720
would not expect, right? Yeah. They sneak them in there. And yet on top of it, custom beer and wine,

1464
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:27,040
because I thought it was all going to be weirdo cocktails, but in fact, beer and wine, you can

1465
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:36,320
only get there. Uh, well with weird, you know, white Wampa, a whole imperial red cabs have, uh,

1466
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:39,520
will you do the Imperial red? You think Scott, Scott, like,

1467
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:47,840
a tone array from Alderaan. Yeah, that's a, that's very rare. Cause that planet doesn't exist

1468
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:54,640
anymore. You gotta get that cast. If it's, if it's aged enough that the planet it's from isn't

1469
01:48:54,640 --> 01:49:01,920
around. So you gotta go with that. Um, we tried the IPA. Okay. Um, and I'm not a beer person,

1470
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:10,240
so I, unfortunately my notes were like hops. Okay. Okay. Um, it was palatable, I guess. Okay.

1471
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:18,320
Okay. But I just can't believe that like on top of that, like that it is a full menu with this bar.

1472
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:24,960
Yeah. And, and let me, uh, Mike, your favorite detail that you've pointed out in text, uh,

1473
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:31,600
that they are, they have done so much research and done so much backstory that they know what Padme

1474
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:37,760
ordered at the bar. Yeah. So I forget who said it and what article was set in, but they said that

1475
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:42,640
in their story and their backstory for the land and for this Cantina,

1476
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:49,280
Darth Vader has been here. Padme has eaten here and they've gotten so detailed with it. They know

1477
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:55,440
what she ordered there. They didn't say what it was. I have what she, oh, you do. Oh, from the book.

1478
01:49:55,440 --> 01:50:00,480
Yeah. All right. Cause it's in the book. Oh, this is big news. That's of course where they

1479
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:06,000
brought Timothy's on back to write a new extended universe. Oh yeah. Well, I knew that obviously.

1480
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:14,080
Uh, I, uh, this was in the gizmo gizmo, the article. So then Padme ordered white wine,

1481
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:22,000
motherfucker. I, I guess she joined the dark side and doing white wine. So I think that's what I

1482
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:28,320
might have to go with. You are wine buddies. Yeah. I'm joining a wine club with Padme. It's kind of

1483
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:33,440
crazy how like this detail will, some people won't even notice it, but like the people who

1484
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:38,880
are looking for it will find so much joy. I am going to get Padme's beverage of choice.

1485
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:43,040
And everyone else will just be like, give me a white wine. I don't care. Sure. Yeah. It's cool.

1486
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:48,560
It's way, it appeals to any kind of a white wine drinker. I think they knew they were,

1487
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:54,480
they were going to be getting an aggressive type fan and they really catered to them. Yeah. Yeah.

1488
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:59,600
Without sacrificing the main audience, which I assume is maybe impossible to do. Yeah. And in

1489
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:05,040
this they've crafted the only thing that I could be an aggressive fan of a place where I can

1490
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:10,160
experience both Rex and white wine. It's really insane. I don't like, I'm really worried. I'm

1491
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:14,080
not going to be able to be there for a long time. I don't know if I'll be able to make it in here.

1492
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:19,760
You haven't experienced it. What do you like? Do you think it's going to be possible to breach

1493
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:24,000
the wall or people going to be able to get into this place? So, okay. This is what's interesting

1494
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,480
is that at Disneyland, they came out and said that you have to consume your beverage within the

1495
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:33,120
Cantina, which means that people at Disney world might be filing in and out more quickly

1496
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:38,160
because that's an alcohol friendly park. Oh, okay. Oh, right. Right. So specifically the line at

1497
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:44,000
Disneyland might be longer because you have to complete your drink in there. Jeez. But we know,

1498
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:49,200
it sounds tough. I mean, we still don't know. I know they've had to do this with the Harry Potter

1499
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:56,800
lands before, like you get a reservation just to come into the land. Now I would hope they would do

1500
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:04,880
that with Galaxy's Edge as opposed to just insane lines snaking through the entire park. That said,

1501
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:09,360
you see pictures of opening day star tours or Indiana Jones and there are insane lines

1502
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:14,080
snaking through the park. I think that they are so prepared and they're just not telling us anything.

1503
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:18,720
I hope so. Okay. Because they know, like the thing is the only question that people keep asking me

1504
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:23,280
is related to like, how do I get in? So they're feeling that times like a hundred thousand.

1505
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:28,880
Yeah. So they're, I mean, they, I know you can't, you can't have the whole place just be lines.

1506
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:33,520
No, no. But I'm curious to see how they do it. I'm curious to see how they do it. And the other thing

1507
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:38,480
is, and this, I think the major thing we haven't really talked about is how the Disney play app

1508
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:44,800
integrates with a lot of the land. When I was there the other day, I could not get a consistent

1509
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:50,640
wifi signal between frontier land and main street. And that is like a smaller than a one mile radius.

1510
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:55,600
They only have hotspots set up around fast pass kiosks. I think. Is that what it is? It's

1511
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:59,920
the words like near right. They're not, it is not full coverage. Yeah. And they said that they would

1512
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:04,880
be working to update that before the opening. Okay. But yeah, it's, it's like a broken wifi system.

1513
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:09,360
But within the land, if they're building it from scratch, I'm assuming the whole thing will be

1514
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:15,200
blank. I think it has to be built the land with the app in mind. Yeah. And some of it I think is

1515
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:19,760
like, it's more Bluetooth. There's like, I think it's possible you don't have to have wifi. That's

1516
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:24,800
true. Yeah. But I think for the app you do. Really? Okay. I read something. I'm not sure.

1517
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:31,040
I think a lot of stuff is Bluetooth powered, but I think the, I think for the app you might have to.

1518
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:37,040
Well, especially if, did they say anything about like, because the rumor is that fast passes will,

1519
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:44,560
it will only be fast pass plus in galaxy's edge as opposed to paper ones. Is that really? I don't

1520
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:51,280
know. I think that's all, I don't know. I've seen every version of speculation. So I don't know what

1521
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:57,280
that is. Like, yeah, I don't know. I don't think there's also a lot of things I've read that's

1522
01:53:57,280 --> 01:54:02,480
been like, it's just going to be sort of, they're not going to do a ton of that for a while. Like

1523
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:06,320
they're just going to sort of. It's all just standby. It's all just one line. So I don't know. I

1524
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:10,640
don't know. I don't have any information. I mean, for years, Universal did not have any of the Harry

1525
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:15,760
Potter attractions on the express pass until they added them. Yeah. I don't know. Who knows?

1526
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:20,720
I think, well, yeah, it's, it's like the big question that won't be answered. What's your

1527
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:27,280
galaxy's edge plan when it opens? We don't have a, cause it's the second one. That's an

1528
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:32,080
unfree question to ask. Were you able to get a fast pass while you were there for June? I was not.

1529
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:36,160
That would have been dope. That was like the handout. No, I got a baseball cap. That's cool.

1530
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:43,360
Pretty good. Yeah. That's cool. I wanted to draw it, but I'll ask. I don't know, but I can

1531
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:46,880
tell you, I'm going to be writing a lot about it once I do know, cause there's going to be a strategy.

1532
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:51,760
I just had to figure it out. It's also depends on like, they might literally only have one area

1533
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:55,680
for an entrance. They might like have time tickets. They might have something you buy for the first

1534
01:54:55,680 --> 01:55:02,400
month. It could be anything. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Not announced. I don't know. I don't, and we,

1535
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:05,840
you know, we talked about this a little in an episode recently and we came up with a plan. We

1536
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:10,000
think could be a plan. And then we bleeped the plan and people were mad. And I do

1537
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:14,560
issue an apology, but we also aren't sure that the plan works. I guess Jenny Nicholson had the idea

1538
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:19,200
and then she was like, didn't want to reveal it. And then we bleeped it out. And I have had,

1539
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:23,920
I just had a listener come up to me a couple of days ago and he goes, what was the plan?

1540
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:28,720
Yeah, I've, I'm getting a lot of, we're getting a lot of like DMS. It can't be a secret if nobody

1541
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:34,880
knows. If you go to our Facebook group, people kind of people pretty much figured out what it is.

1542
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:39,600
It's not an impossible thing. But I don't know if it, I don't know if we'll talk about it.

1543
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:43,120
We don't know if it'll work. It's Jenny's idea. So I don't want to reveal. It's hers to reveal.

1544
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,560
So we can tell you off the podcast. That's her content. Let's let her do with that content.

1545
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:53,360
See, I'm mostly a Disney world person. So for me, like in Disney world, there's a,

1546
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:58,000
you're used to booking things 180 days in advance. Oh, right. That's true. So it's only like the

1547
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:02,400
Disneyland people who are losing their minds. Like we're used to planning things freakishly long

1548
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:09,040
ahead. That's me. I hate all this. My, when I, I've had friends who just went and I didn't know what a

1549
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:15,120
like hellscape it had become in terms of the, the mega booking. It drove me crazy. It makes me

1550
01:56:15,120 --> 01:56:22,240
furious. I mean, I guess it's, it's what it has to be. You like that. I love it. God, I like it too.

1551
01:56:22,240 --> 01:56:26,880
They have a way spreadsheets out and shit to have a go on a fun ride.

1552
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:32,000
They've already got me out of the land in Florida by distracting me with a new transportation

1553
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:40,640
system. I'm excited for those guys. Skyliners, yes. They're on the track. They're testing them out.

1554
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:46,720
Still have not used the phrase air conditioning when discussing it, but I think they have that.

1555
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:50,960
They, they seem like they figured something out for it. It's gotta be breezy. I think it's breezy.

1556
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:57,120
Yeah. The roof fed a kind of a fast race. Yeah. It's mostly Disneyland people that are

1557
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:02,880
is there anything I'm exhausted now? I'm mentally and physically,

1558
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:08,640
and we recorded another episode too. So I'm just like, I'm so sorry. No, no, no. I, are you kidding?

1559
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:14,480
You have at least to apologize for any guests. I really am. But everything else too, that you've

1560
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:19,200
like, you've given us info. I didn't know. I mean, is there any random question you have that I might

1561
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:25,040
for listeners, the plague app integration, the Carly wrote about it in the LA times and the tech

1562
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:28,560
crunch articles. They go into a lot of detail. Yeah. But read mine. Screw you, Todd. Yeah.

1563
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:38,960
We love you, Todd. But also read my story. He wrote a wonderful piece. Yeah. I do have a small

1564
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:43,760
piece coming out about it, but basically you're, they didn't give us, they told us what you could

1565
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:47,360
do in the app, but they didn't really tell us how it would actually work. Like when you're in the

1566
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:52,960
land, when you ride the Falcon, when, you know, what the actual operations of it would be.

1567
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:58,400
Yeah. And it will be interesting. The operational differences between the two coasts, because we

1568
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:02,800
don't have magic bands out here and they have that in Florida. And also points of purchase.

1569
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:06,880
It's much smoother in Florida and here. How are you, how do you keep a credit card in story?

1570
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:11,600
Yeah. Right. Oh yeah. I think you mentioned cause yeah, it's easier if you're in magic band,

1571
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:16,880
you can scan it or they doesn't even matter. Your movement and it makes more sense. Right. Yeah.

1572
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:20,480
Yeah. But here. So they didn't even mention anything about, cause there's a whole talk of,

1573
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:25,520
if you do badly on the Millennium Falcon ride, is there any talk about how that works out here?

1574
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:30,080
No. And your credit doesn't work in the score. They reject your cards if you do badly on the

1575
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:35,440
Falcon. But I do know that it's not your individual performance. It's your groups. Right. Right. Right.

1576
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:41,040
So it's how all six of you work together. But is it potentially that you scan something on your play

1577
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:46,080
or your Disneyland app before you do Millennium Falcon ride? And that's maybe how it works. Who

1578
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:53,760
knows? And then no hotel talk yet. Of course out here. The hotel is so, so far away. Okay. Yeah.

1579
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:58,960
Yeah. I know there's a whole issue they have to work out with other things. That was a very

1580
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:02,800
early announcement. Right. Oh, this isn't a question, but a thing to talk about.

1581
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:08,720
Apparently Star Tours not going anywhere. Apparently. Yeah. Happy to hear it. Very

1582
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:14,800
relieved as you know. Or are they just saying that so we get comfortable? Yeah, maybe. I don't know.

1583
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:22,480
But I, you know, to me you take that out in the first year of galaxy's edge or gutting tomorrow

1584
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:27,440
land. You're like, there's nothing there. That's a people eating attraction that, uh, you know,

1585
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:31,440
why not? And people are going to want to go on. It's going to spread crowds around. I'd say it's

1586
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:35,760
like, depending on what the system is, like if it is a time dentry or something like that, being able

1587
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:41,040
to like pregame with Star Tours is great. Cause then you land on Batuu and then you're like,

1588
01:59:41,120 --> 01:59:45,520
I'm ready. Oh yeah. That kind of looks like a little preview. It's getting you into it a little

1589
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:51,280
bit. I think it'll actually be probably have longer lines for the next two years. Yeah.

1590
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:56,160
People getting amped just cause they're in the Star Wars mood. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah. And

1591
01:59:56,160 --> 02:00:00,400
they do have the problem with it where it's like not there's the Star Wars area, but then Star

1592
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:04,080
Tours is far away from it and they're split up and then where does it land on the timeline?

1593
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:09,600
My response to that is who the fuck cares? Leave the fun ride open. But they will be most likely,

1594
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:13,440
I mean, if history repeats itself, when the new movie comes out in December, they'll add new scenes

1595
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:18,960
to Star Tours. Okay. For the past few years. Interesting. Let's get Greg Grunberg,

1596
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:25,600
snap one friend. That's his character name. See him in there. Uh, was there any talk on the two rides

1597
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:30,720
of, um, I assume there's like variations on things, but there's no talk of like, you get a totally

1598
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:35,360
different scenario on the Falcon or you could get, there's different paths to go on on the ride. Like

1599
02:00:35,680 --> 02:00:40,320
I asked them about the spectrum of opportunities, like, because it's not that you can just crash

1600
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:44,160
in the right ends in three seconds. You will have the same length. It's just how well you perform.

1601
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:48,960
But I couldn't figure out if it was like, you do great. You do medium. You do okay. I can't figure

1602
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:55,360
out how many variations there are. Right. But there are supposedly many, any chance of Will Smith

1603
02:00:55,360 --> 02:01:02,880
rating your performance, all of the men in black alien attack. Right. God, I wish. Y'all did okay.

1604
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:07,920
It's the worst locker area in the entire park. Is that right? Oh God. Oh really? What's the,

1605
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:11,760
what's the problem? Oh, it's just, you're always, you're always on the ride in that queue for too

1606
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:16,160
long. And then you're like, I was once a child, like that I, nothing makes me feel old and sad

1607
02:01:16,160 --> 02:01:23,600
more than going on that attraction. But it's got so many, it's just a wealth of standard definition

1608
02:01:23,600 --> 02:01:31,120
screens and rap songs from over 20 years ago. Being in an empty office, you know, the portion

1609
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:36,400
of the queue where it's like people do work at this desk. Oh yeah. It makes me very sad. You can

1610
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:41,360
get a, apparently if you just, it used to be like an exclusive thing. But now if you just ask a cast

1611
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:46,480
member, can I go down, walk around the floor? They're like, yeah, come on. Not a highlight.

1612
02:01:46,480 --> 02:01:52,640
I want to meet the twins. Prices. How much will the Rex toy cost? Do we know? We don't know, but

1613
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:58,000
I'm going to say 64 99 and see in a few months if I'm correct. That's just like your guess. Yeah,

1614
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:04,640
it's my guess. It's like a high end toy. And you can't, I would pay $1,000. Yes, he knows.

1615
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:08,800
Scott does not have Amazon dots or anything, but he will get a Rex for the living room,

1616
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:14,400
one for the bedroom, one for the office. I'll introduce them to each other. They'll all have

1617
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:19,120
parties. On Twitter. I said, I'm going to go in for every room because of the music. Yeah. What

1618
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:24,960
are the, oh wait, also, so there's also like BB date style. Yeah. Well you can build your own BB or

1619
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:29,440
our style droids. Yeah. But you can add like different colors and different panels. And one

1620
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:33,360
had a little pop out camera and then you can put different chips in them to make them make different

1621
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:37,120
noises and have different personalities. You can't build your own Rex. Rex is a standard.

1622
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:41,440
Rex is one you just buy. Right. And there's a, why would you change something that is perfect?

1623
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:49,360
There's a C three PO one as well. That's the same size. It's like, I'd say it's more like an

1624
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:55,120
action figure doll. Okay. But cause it's a little taller. Okay. And then if you pop his head off,

1625
02:02:55,120 --> 02:02:59,440
he, they only showed us them popping his head off, but every time you like pops out or put it on

1626
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:03,840
backwards or put it back in, he says different stuff. So he knows what's happening. Like if you

1627
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:07,360
put the head backwards, he's like, I can't see. Right. And then if you put them back the right way,

1628
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:15,440
he's like, oh good. What else? Expansion pad next to Star Wars land. They tell you the third ride

1629
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:20,800
or something. I also have heard that gossip and I don't know where that would go.

1630
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:28,000
Well, we've looked at Google maps a lot of the area and there is space there, but it's unclear.

1631
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:33,040
Like it's cause yeah, it's unclear. Exactly. It's on the, like if you're looking overhead,

1632
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:38,880
it's like, uh, east, like Northeast a little bit this way, like Hagrid's magical rollercoaster

1633
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:44,560
ride, whatever it's called. Like that took eight years, nine years for it to open. Yeah.

1634
02:03:44,640 --> 02:03:49,360
And they had to demolish a roller coaster to build a roller coaster. So, well, I mean,

1635
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:55,200
it's gotta be better than dragon challenge, but they're not going to build a third attraction

1636
02:03:55,200 --> 02:04:00,320
for at least not a main amount of time. Yeah, I would think so. That's tape. Take her easy guys.

1637
02:04:00,320 --> 02:04:05,680
You've done a lot. This is if they've created an attraction that is mind bend, that changes your

1638
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:11,680
idea. I'm also like, what is it going to be? There's gotta be imagineers though in Glendale,

1639
02:04:11,680 --> 02:04:16,480
like every week going like, I can't believe the fantasy land theater has not had a wrecking ball

1640
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:23,120
taken to it. It's so big. It's so you can do so much with that plot of land. Well, what I want

1641
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:30,880
them to do is to like merge worlds and make kind of a, like a star wars a fide new videopolis

1642
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:37,840
where you can see a hologram concert by Jefferson starship, a la the star wars holiday special.

1643
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:44,240
Now that might be just me, but I think they got room in tomorrowland. Yeah, make it out. Yeah.

1644
02:04:44,240 --> 02:04:48,560
You got the space. Just put up a hologram driven. So we would, I know Mike and I have joked about

1645
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:55,120
like a holiday overlay of life day. The wookie holiday celebrated in the holidays, but they need

1646
02:04:55,120 --> 02:05:01,760
to own life day. They don't know what they're sitting on. Life day. Life day rules. Oh my God.

1647
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:08,400
All right. I mean, I'm sure I have a hundred more questions, but are we in longest episode

1648
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:11,840
territory right now? I don't think so. I don't think so. Okay. Should we keep it rolling?

1649
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:15,520
Let's see if we can get there. Let's just stall. I think we get like a tight 20 out of you about

1650
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:22,720
Rex for sure. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I did already. I'll do it again. It's not tight. It's tight in that

1651
02:05:22,720 --> 02:05:28,160
Rex is tight. Well, if you guys or anyone else has questions, they can annoy me on social media and

1652
02:05:28,160 --> 02:05:32,720
I will let you know, or just give you PR speak that says they didn't tell us. Sure. Well, I guess

1653
02:05:32,720 --> 02:05:38,320
with that being said, Carly Wisell, you survived podcast, the ride. Let's exit through the gift

1654
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:42,400
shop. Anything you would like to plug in. Where can people find you? Oh, so I mostly write for

1655
02:05:42,400 --> 02:05:46,160
travel and leisure and I write occasionally for eater, but you can find me on Instagram because

1656
02:05:46,160 --> 02:05:50,960
I'm a freelance writer. So I got a lot of free time. And my Instagram is Carly Wisell spelled

1657
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:56,320
C A R L Y E W I S E L. I spell it because there's too many letters and you almost wouldn't believe

1658
02:05:56,320 --> 02:06:00,560
how many there are. And then I'm on Twitter sometimes, but mostly Instagram or Twitter. I

1659
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:04,800
will lead and I will just post a bunch of links to random T and L stories that I write. Right.

1660
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:09,840
Well, and your dot com is nice and tidy. There's all your, like a lot of your best articles.

1661
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:14,880
On a vacation to Walt Disney World and you need help visit Carly Wisell dot com. Have you been

1662
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:20,480
to every park? Yeah. Wow. Jeez. Yeah. Pretty good. Do you have a crazy trip coming up?

1663
02:06:21,120 --> 02:06:27,520
Um, I'm trying to do, I tried to call this 2019 year of the regional theme park. So I'm trying to

1664
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:32,400
hit like every East coast park I haven't been to. Cool. I haven't been to Dollywood, which is crazy.

1665
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:37,760
Well, Wildwood Grove is coming. I know. I want to see all those butterflies in real life.

1666
02:06:38,720 --> 02:06:42,320
So I'm trying to do that. I'm trying to hit like everything this year so that

1667
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:45,840
I just covered it. I just went to Bush gardens in Tampa, which I'd never been to.

1668
02:06:46,720 --> 02:06:53,120
Yeah. I fed a giraffe. Wow. Cool. It was thrilling. I bet. I mean, animals. Yeah. They're crazy.

1669
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:56,880
There's a lot of great theme parks out there and it's a shame that they have to wheel that we've

1670
02:06:57,520 --> 02:07:00,240
we probably haven't done our due with regional theme parks.

1671
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:04,640
Well, there's so much going on right now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The big dogs are really owning it.

1672
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:10,400
We still want, we want Dollywood to fly us out and cover and, you know, we'll do a whole thing.

1673
02:07:11,120 --> 02:07:15,680
They don't have a good budget for something like this for a really niche theme park like us.

1674
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:21,520
Things are very different between the people who are owned by gigantic media corporations.

1675
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:27,200
Okay. Interesting. People in a theme park that has a bunch of butterflies in a dry county.

1676
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:34,480
That's true. That's my sister-in-law. I was like, looked that up and was like, nope, not going.

1677
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:37,920
In Pigeon Forge is a dry county? I don't know that every

1678
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:41,840
single part of it. I think it might be like restrictions on when you buy from stores.

1679
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:44,560
Oh, I see. I see. Margaritaville Hotel. There is a Margaritaville Hotel.

1680
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:50,880
There is one there. They just opened a huge Margaritaville Resort near Universal Orlando.

1681
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:55,600
Well, yes. There'll be a future episode. You'd be amazed how much of our podcast

1682
02:07:55,600 --> 02:08:01,360
has been about that. Really? Yeah. Yeah. We've, I'm glad we finally given Galaxy's Edge its fair

1683
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:06,240
shake because we've been very Margaritaville Resort heavy. We will tease in a few, a couple of weeks,

1684
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:12,240
there's a big reveal about us and Margaritaville Resort that again, we only can tease on this

1685
02:08:12,240 --> 02:08:16,400
episode, but we'll tell you once we're done recording, it's pretty incredible.

1686
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:20,080
Oh my goodness. I didn't realize you were such like Margaritaville heads.

1687
02:08:22,640 --> 02:08:28,160
I'm the big one and there, yeah, we've been- Is this something that CityWalk spurred in you or?

1688
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:32,800
No, no, no. City, we liked, we had an affection for CityWalk before Margaritaville, but then when

1689
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:37,200
it moved into our, it was already at CityWalk, obviously in Orlando, but no, that's just a

1690
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:43,200
perfect marriage. Margaritaville, Jimmy Buffett in general, I got kind of fascinated with like

1691
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:49,360
five years ago when I was going through his music on Spotify and I came across a song called Math

1692
02:08:49,360 --> 02:08:55,520
Sucks and it was S-U-K-S and it's just a song about how he doesn't like to do math and from

1693
02:08:55,520 --> 02:09:00,720
then on I was hooked. I was like, this man is so fascinating to me. And then ironic fixation became

1694
02:09:01,680 --> 02:09:08,240
as genuine as Rex is. Yes. And then that extends to all of his lifestyle brand and his resorts and

1695
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:14,880
his hotels and et cetera, et cetera. And yeah, so- So look up at Margaritaville on Instagram,

1696
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:19,280
check him out on Facebook, Twitter. Please, they need it. They need your support.

1697
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:24,480
Listen, a math sucks on Spotify and get the numbers up because I don't think that's one of

1698
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:28,400
the top, let's get that in top five. I don't want to listen to a rich man complain about counting

1699
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:32,640
his money, honestly. My theory was- It's so hard to get those dividends.

1700
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:38,960
I don't know what, hey. My theory was that he had done, he was having a hard time tipping at a

1701
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:43,680
restaurant and then he was like, this math sucks. And then that was it. And then he wrote a song

1702
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:47,920
about it and he wrote it in five minutes. He just laid down a $500 bill and was done with it.

1703
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:53,440
Whatever. And then he- I like to imagine Jimmy still doing his own taxes with the paper forms

1704
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:58,320
and the calculator that spits out the paper roll. And all the papers are flying away because

1705
02:09:58,320 --> 02:10:03,360
he's at a desk on the beach. Yeah. I do this happens every year. Why do I keep doing this?

1706
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:09,360
If you have time to do anything else after with all of this extra homework,

1707
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:16,560
check us out on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and check out the second gate, patreon.com

1708
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:22,400
podcast, the ride. This has been something else, exhausted, more exhausted than any other episode.

1709
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:24,560
Wait till we actually go. But exhausted in a good way. I mean,

1710
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:30,960
I mean that listener also like high, like adrenaline surging the whole time. Exhausted,

1711
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:35,280
not exhausted in the sense that we're like fatigued by the too much information.

1712
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:38,960
Really brought the whole crew down, huh? No, no, no. No, no. I mean, yeah.

1713
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:40,720
Satisfying. Up and all around.

1714
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:42,800
It's just so, it's too much information. It was.

1715
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:47,520
It's you, I shouldn't. Yeah. If you feel euphoria for two hours, your brain is going to crash.

1716
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:49,920
There's just no way around it. I do think I'm going to go home and then,

1717
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:54,400
and just like sit silently for a while. Just take it all in, just try to just kind of like

1718
02:10:54,720 --> 02:10:57,520
meditate. It does kind of feel like I've been there too. I know.

1719
02:10:57,520 --> 02:10:59,440
Yeah. You did a great job. Thank you.

1720
02:10:59,440 --> 02:11:04,560
Yeah. Definitely starting to feel more real. Do you think there's another media

1721
02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:09,440
day like this weekend, like this coming up? I heard that no one's going in the park till

1722
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,400
like it opens. Wow. Wow. Interesting.

1723
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:16,480
Either till, like, I don't know what the format will be, but like this was the only hard hat

1724
02:11:16,480 --> 02:11:19,840
walking tour. Interesting. You were in rarefied air and thanks for.

1725
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:23,840
Yeah. It was wild. Thanks for bringing some of that air into

1726
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:27,520
this apartment. I'm glad I could like use my tiny P brain to remember details.

1727
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:30,720
You didn't need that camera. I didn't need this.

1728
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:32,720
Yeah. I just soaked it all up.

1729
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:37,200
Come back any time. Talk. We can have. Yeah. You do your other adventures.

1730
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:38,480
Yeah. Any other adventures.

1731
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:42,480
If you have any more controversial lists that coming out.

1732
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:46,960
Or if you just want, we'll do a two and a half hour episode on the Hoopty Doo review.

1733
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:50,240
Please. No. Okay. Fine. Fair. Fine.

1734
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:54,320
No. Fine. There's only so many washboards you can spray.

1735
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:57,120
All right. I don't know about. Yeah.

1736
02:11:57,120 --> 02:12:01,040
This episode's going long enough, but I'm feeling like between the country bears and the Hoopty

1737
02:12:01,040 --> 02:12:04,640
Doo review, maybe you have a bias against old time. And Dollywood.

1738
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:08,480
And banjo music. I come here with little to no nostalgia.

1739
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:09,920
Okay. All right.

1740
02:12:11,200 --> 02:12:15,680
Not pining for the good old, those good old jingle jingle days.

1741
02:12:15,680 --> 02:12:19,280
No, definitely. You don't like a man playing a jug, I guess.

1742
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:22,880
I don't think I do, but I love the food that is offered at.

1743
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:24,800
Fair enough. The jug celebration.

1744
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:28,640
Well, we'll find a different ride then. Hey, the dog's whining because he's

1745
02:12:28,640 --> 02:12:31,840
really upset how long we've been recording. Yeah. Well, I'm with him.

1746
02:12:33,600 --> 02:12:36,640
