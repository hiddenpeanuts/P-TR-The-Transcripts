1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, a theme park podcast that will not end until we've done a cross-country tour of every state fair where we rank the cute faces on all the blue-ribbon winning pigs.

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Scott Garner, who looks very confused and maybe upset.

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,000
When you said cute faces, I was like, that are drawn on a pumpkin or on a dessert or something, but then the face is on a pig.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
On a real-life living pig, yeah.

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Because I guess the normal way to say that would be the pig's faces, but faces on a pig, I think, threw me for a loop.

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Well, they're technically on the body of the pig.

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
There's nothing incorrect about what you said.

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
There might be a couple extra words in between two thoughts or ideas that maybe threw you off.

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Jason, did you understand? Jason Sheridan, did you understand?

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I understand.

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We're ranking the pig's cute faces.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah, Jason got it.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I got it. I did not get it.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
He was right along with me.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
There's just something baffling to me about, and do we really, like, the real pigs, do we think their faces are cute?

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You don't think pigs are cute?

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
At a state fair, a bunch of real big pigs run around. I don't know if they are cute. Their faces?

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Well, I mean, I actually didn't even think about another, like, cute debate happening on the show, which has happened many times.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah, this is an organic cute debate.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But I do think pigs are cute. Jason, what do you think? Jason Sheridan?

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I think they can be. I think at state fairs, they're often tired and sleeping and lying on their side.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's what I'm thinking.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Well, I was going to say it's very relatable, but look, I'm a side sleeper, you know?

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm a side sleeper, too. I'm just saying.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I think there was, look, that'll be part of it, though, is, like, will there be, like, an unnaturally cute pig that we'll find across America?

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm sure there are pigs that are cute. I just think your run-of-the-mill fair pigs, it's cute, isn't it?

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So maybe what your issue is-

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
A grown piglet, maybe?

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So maybe you're thinking we want more of, like, some sort of a fancy show pig versus a fair pig.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You're, like, looking for a city pig versus a country pig.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I would think, yes, that if the pig is in some kind of a show, then the cute likelihood is higher.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That's interesting. Are there pig shows? Did Jason, you know?

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Well, I think state fairs, that would be the cream of the crop. That would be the show pig, wouldn't it?

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You don't think there's, like, a fancy pig show somewhere that takes place in sort of a convention center, like a dog show?

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'd have to look into it. I want to talk out of my ass.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah, you're right. We don't want to spread misinformation.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I think that they keep these things outside or in sort of a, you know, open but covered area.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't think we're bringing a bunch of pigs into the Hilton, into the Marina Room.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Well, maybe we should bring pigs into a Hilton.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Fancy pigs, pigs that have more money, high-class pigs that are, like, nines and tens.

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're picturing swine. I'm talking about remarkable, classy pigs.

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Nine or tens on the scale, the Bob Guccione whatever scale of attractiveness.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm assuming that's the ranking.

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let me say this. I have nothing against pigs. I think pigs are neat.

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But I think pure face, cute, this is just what I question.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I don't know. Maybe I have too much cartoon pig on the brain. Maybe that's really what it is.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Because I'm looking at, I saw art of what we're talking about today,

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
in which Mickey has a cartoon pig nuzzling against him, and this absolutely is cute.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I have no, you know, pig depictions, certainly.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Well, when this comes out, I will try to find pictures of legitimately cute pigs,

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
post them along with the episode, and then the audience can decide, is the average fair pig cute?

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And maybe I'm wrong. I'm happy to be wrong in this instance.

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But I guess maybe, yeah, maybe I'm just getting, my brain is clouded with, like, the cartoon three little pigs.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Look, as I Google, I'm seeing cute pigs. I know there's cute pigs. There are.

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well, we're going to do it. We're going to go cross-country and figure it out.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Wow. Lots of things.

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Let's bring our guest in. He's a director, he's a writer, and he's a member,

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
most importantly, of my serious toy collector, Text Chain Chat.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Ah.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This is Justin Donaldson. He's here.

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Hello, everybody.

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And if you wouldn't mind, I would prefer to do a toy swap live on the air.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah, we can do this. I don't mind.

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Because we are going to do one of these right now.

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This is something that toy collectors do. They look out for each other, they find toys,

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and then they do a trade, and we're going to do this live on the air.

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Wow.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is very exciting.

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay. So you'd just be doing this somehow.

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We would meet up in the middle, usually, wherever we are, we'll meet in the middle,

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and I'm going to trade him a NECA belly bomb, which I've talked about.

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This is the one you said you wanted to kiss.

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll send it around if you guys want to take a look at it.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm very excited about this.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We talked about kissing this belly bomb on a recent episode.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
There's too many sharp teeth to kiss this guy.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Well, you kiss him on his teeth, you know, close the mouth,

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
because the mouth closes, and you can kind of kiss him on his teeth,

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
which is a line in a Ryan Adams song, I'm realizing, but I don't have to mention that.

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But the teeth, so you're talking about the surface of the teeth,

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
because I don't want to get near those points.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Well, yes, close the mouth, and then kiss on the sort of enamel of the teeth.

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I guess that's not far from what I always say, because I chose, in talking about kissable toys,

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I chose a street shark, and they have sharp teeth as well.

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Right.

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I guess it's, all right, so you close the mouth.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
No more objections, sir.

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah, it's a very phallic toy, and it's honestly one of the best toys I've ever owned.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I say this with no hyperbole.

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's so incredible.

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's a character I've never had before, and it's so well done.

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's really well done.

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Mike, I don't know, I mean, in terms of phallic,

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
what penises have you seen that get really fat at the end of the shaft?

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Well, on a recent episode, I also said there are penises

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
that are the shapes and sizes of things we can't even imagine.

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's right.

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
People have stuff going on down there that we don't know,

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
and I'm just saying, I bet someone's looks kind of like that.

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I suppose.

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Hopefully not with the eyeball and horns.

105
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
His eyeball and horns.

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Well, right, hopefully where the head is, it's not an eyeball.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's just where I start to feel like you, Mr. Prude,

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
are seeing penises everywhere and in everything.

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I've seen many YouTube toy guys mention the phallic nature of this toy also.

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
He's a pink color.

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's true.

112
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
He's got a long neck.

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I think the color and the shading and kind of like where he bunches up.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yes, he bunches up.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That's the most important part about the toy,

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
is that it bunches up in the right part.

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And I think that's where it does it.

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Now, that's not why, I swear to God,

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
that's not why this is one of my favorite toys of all time.

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But anyway, I'm trading this to Justin.

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Now, Justin has a very exciting toy for me.

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
He can say it.

123
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This is the Toilet Taxi.

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
This is a re-release of a classic 80s vehicle,

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
but with a new figure.

126
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The original didn't come with a figure.

127
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, I see.

128
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You would have had to get this without you bringing your own turtles to the Toilet Taxi.

129
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Right.

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Now you can get a Donatello with a helmet and goggles.

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But I do have this somewhere, but it's kind of broken,

132
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and they just reissued it, and I'm very excited.

133
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And we've talked about this vehicle on this show before many years ago.

134
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I think at this point, is that the turtle is sitting on an open toilet

135
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
while he drives his vehicle around.

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So you have to presume that shitting or pissing in it powers the vehicle.

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Why do you have to assume that?

138
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You would have to assume.

139
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Why do you have to assume that?

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I think a lot of the vehicles were...

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Powered by pissing.

142
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Sewage.

143
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah.

144
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
There was a lot.

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
There was a sewage theme.

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
They deal in sewage.

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
They live in sewage.

148
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It definitely seems like a function over form sort of thing.

149
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yes.

150
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What science allows poop and pee to...

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Well, in Back to the Future, Doc dumps a bunch of garbage into the time machine.

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So obviously he could have probably picked up a couple...

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So it's Mr. Fusion-esque technology.

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah, Donatello's the smartest Doc Brown.

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Mm-hmm.

156
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He can figure that out.

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So this is a live toy swap.

158
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You're seeing it now, how it happens.

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So it's very exciting.

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Technology that Big Oil is suppressing.

161
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Hold on a second.

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Donatello is the smartest Doc Brown?

163
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I think he is.

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We're all...

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Almost everything you've said we've found problems in.

166
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You've only said like four things.

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Donatello created a whole interdimensional travel portal that was in the sewer.

168
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
He would bring people through.

169
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I suppose that's true.

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's pretty good.

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So I'm just saying that's on par with what Doc Brown did.

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And now the toilet taxi is different than the Ghostbusters haunted toilet toy.

173
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Oh, absolutely.

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Which you sent to me, and it was one of the fastest purchases I ever made.

175
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Right.

176
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Well, please use the real name of the character, Jason, Fearsome Flush.

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Fearsome Flush, excuse me.

178
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yes, of course.

179
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But yeah, I guess he eats human waste.

180
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah, his tongue is coming out of the bowl.

181
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Right.

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And his eyes are on the tank.

183
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Mm-hmm.

184
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So there's many different vintage toilet-based things you can buy now.

185
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It was a big thing in the late 80s, I feel like.

186
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Right.

187
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And yeah, I'm glad to see it's coming back.

188
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Slime, toilet, poop.

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It was all the same stuff.

190
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Right.

191
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Because we were embracing gross out for the first time, maybe, the culture.

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Uh-huh.

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We were experimenting with it.

194
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Well, that was thrilling.

195
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Boxes, two men pulled boxes out, and now you have different boxes.

196
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Two men exchanged boxes.

197
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You both remembered to transport them.

198
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
One man gave the other man a toilet, and one man gave the other one a penis.

199
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Eyeballed penis.

200
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That was beautiful.

201
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yeah.

202
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It was a beautiful thing.

203
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But look, we got a lot to talk about today.

204
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yes.

205
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
We're going to talk Disneyland State Fair, which was another one of these limited-time

206
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
events.

207
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I keep wanting to say limited-time magic.

208
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Sure.

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Because that's the currency on the island.

210
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah, yeah, why not?

211
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But let's real quick.

212
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This is limited-time, and we'll get into it, but it was on the second gate by now.

213
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You've heard us talk about Blast to the Past, which was a 50s throwback event, and we need

214
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
to talk about the State Fair thing they did, and Justin has fond memories of the State

215
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Fair thing.

216
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes, thank you.

217
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But don't let that distract from where you're going.

218
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Oh, sure.

219
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I just want to bring up real quick.

220
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I mean, there's a lot of stuff.

221
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Justin is a big Disneyland guy, theme park guy, Orange County guy, and you went a ton

222
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
as a kid.

223
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yeah.

224
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I was born up here in Van Nuys, and we lived in Glendale until the summer between the second

225
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and third grade.

226
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,160
However, I don't know what age you are at that point, so when I was really little, I

227
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:39,560
was all about Universal, and also because I wanted to be a filmmaker, and back then,

228
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:45,040
making movies was exciting, and I would go to Universal and see how it was done.

229
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:52,840
I would go to Universal almost weekly, and then we moved to Orange County, and before

230
00:11:52,840 --> 00:12:00,800
we moved to Orange County, Disneyland was a two or three times a year thing, but then

231
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,240
once we moved to Orange County, it became an all-the-time thing, like Universal when

232
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,880
we lived up here.

233
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,960
Every time there was one of these limited time things, we had to go.

234
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:25,560
They would sell discount tickets for them at Ralph's, which is the California Kroger.

235
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:34,200
There was always some sort of deal going on at the same time as these events, and I don't

236
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,760
know if I saw them on television.

237
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:42,600
Somehow, myself and the family, everyone knew that these events were happening.

238
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,160
They were pretty heavily advertised, seemingly, and with big budget commercials, it was not

239
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,200
like, come on down, this weekend there's a thing.

240
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,560
They were shot filmically, and maybe presented.

241
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,600
Was not the blast of the past, wasn't there a McDonald's ad we talked about with Little

242
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,560
Richard that was a national ad, so yeah, they got the stuff in front of you.

243
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:10,520
The discount tickets there, so each one of these had a tie-in, so that was a thing with

244
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,720
my parents being like, oh, the other tickets were on sale, blah, blah, blah.

245
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,360
We ended up going to all of these in 87 and 88.

246
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:26,920
Which was kind of a new breed of, this is sort of an Eisner era invention.

247
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,040
I think we sort of touched on this on the second gate with blast of the past, but I

248
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,320
think there was a time, if you can imagine it, kind of right when Eisner got there, right

249
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,400
before, where it was just accepted, like, well, Disney's busy during the summer and

250
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,480
the holidays, and then we quiet down a little bit.

251
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,280
We even closed the park some days, and Eisner gets in, he's like, what are you doing?

252
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:55,280
You should be making money in every possible way, from every avenue.

253
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,640
Don't ever close the park down, and like, okay, what's going on here?

254
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,520
You got nothing between summer and winter?

255
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,080
Come up with some stuff, make some things happen, and that's where this particular

256
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,280
event and the others came from.

257
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,280
And it totally worked, I know, at least for us, because we went for our regular Disney

258
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,840
trips, and then we would also go for these special events, and we were there specifically

259
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
for the events.

260
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
Right, right.

261
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:28,920
There is a state fair Ralph's commercial on YouTube, and I believe what it was, if you

262
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:36,320
spent $50 at Ralph's, you would get a free child ticket with purchase of an adult ticket,

263
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,800
and I believe they said, like, a $16 value, and it's like, oh my god.

264
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:49,200
I know it was nearly 40 years ago at this point, but children's tickets must be ten

265
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,520
times that price at this point, right?

266
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,520
Yeah, I think so.

267
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,520
Yeah, they would have to be.

268
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,520
Yeah, easily.

269
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:02,240
But that's, yeah, and for state fair specifically, like you said, you did Blast to the Past

270
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,440
and other events, but I would assume, like, state fair was your favorite.

271
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,000
Absolutely, like, my favorite and, like, my whole family's favorite.

272
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,200
Like, I remember everyone being very excited the next year that the state fair was coming

273
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
back.

274
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,880
Yeah, this one they did twice, 87, 88, yeah, yeah.

275
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,480
The circus, I barely remember.

276
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,360
Like, the only thing I remember from it was the motorcycles in the middle of the hub.

277
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:34,360
There was, like, a metal ball that had motorcycles crossing each other in the hub.

278
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,480
So they're depicted in the Simpsons movie.

279
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
Yes.

280
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,520
These are all these cylinders of death.

281
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:46,760
And that's, like, all I remember from that, and then Blast to the Past, the main thing

282
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,680
I remember from that was the giveaways.

283
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:58,720
There were all these, like, 1950s toys, and with every ticket you could exchange for one

284
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
of those.

285
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Okay.

286
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,080
So I remember that and the parade, and I think they also had the shooting the guy out of

287
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,600
the cannon, which the state fair also had.

288
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
I believe so.

289
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,680
The TV ads for both feature human cannonballs.

290
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,680
Right.

291
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,680
Yeah.

292
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,680
Right.

293
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,680
All right, so at a state fair they would have that, and in the 50s they would have that.

294
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,160
In the 50s, human cannonballs were all the rage.

295
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,920
It was the main way people transported themselves sexually.

296
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,920
It was faster.

297
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
It was cheaper.

298
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,160
Freeways weren't everywhere yet, so yeah, just getting a cannon.

299
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,640
The state fair felt like so much bigger.

300
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,640
It's crazy how much stuff.

301
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,640
There was so much.

302
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,400
Like, lastly, I was trying to finish up, like, looking all this stuff up, and I kept finding

303
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,360
stuff and watching stuff, and I was like, this is wild how much they had.

304
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,280
It's very park-wide every corner of the park.

305
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,280
Yeah, yeah.

306
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,600
Tons of big produced events.

307
00:16:51,600 --> 00:17:01,000
But if you search Disney state fair, you also get, and this is a different episode, with

308
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,800
the inflatables going around to various actual state fairs in the 96, but that's something

309
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
else.

310
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
That's something else.

311
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,960
I'll say the names of all the things just to whet the appetite of the audience.

312
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,360
Do we think that's an episode?

313
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,360
Oh, yeah.

314
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,040
If we can't cover that in two minutes.

315
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,640
If we could find a video of it, I believe it's an episode, but I can't find-

316
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,880
Yeah, it's pretty, I think the undocumentation is the-

317
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,640
I found a video about it that had footage, and I found these articles.

318
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,080
I want to see the whole show.

319
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:34,600
There was Disney Fun Fair Extraordinaire, which Disney had a plan to run these weird

320
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,120
balloon shows at all the state fairs across America.

321
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,840
The Great Inflation Celebration.

322
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,440
Mickey's Inflation Celebration.

323
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,440
Which was a very expensive, very labor-intensive show to set up and perform.

324
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,680
Which they only, I think we all watched this video.

325
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,320
Midway to Main Street made a video about this, but yeah, they tried it at the Washington

326
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,880
State Fair and the Arizona State Fair, and after one, we're like, this doesn't work at

327
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,880
all.

328
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,800
We have to hire so many people.

329
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,440
How are we going to, okay, to set up tons of inflatable shit to do.

330
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,320
All right, so we got a lot.

331
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,280
Let's get as many hands as we can to transport all this stuff.

332
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,080
You all, you're in.

333
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,760
Later, people find out these are non-union workers, IOTC protests.

334
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,760
Yeah.

335
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,760
Oh shit.

336
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,760
All right.

337
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,960
Okay, so we're going to be regulated on this.

338
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
You know, how about not?

339
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
How about we don't do this?

340
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,000
That's the, how about we deflate the Great Inflation Celebration?

341
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,600
I love that there's just, you keep uncovering Eisner era failures.

342
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,920
So many Eisner era failures.

343
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,120
We still have never talked about, was it called Club Disney or Club Mickey or what?

344
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
Club Mickey.

345
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,840
Westlake Village, there's a shopping center that now is, it's a pottery barn.

346
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,800
But whenever I'm there, I remember, oh, that's where there was this weird Disney club thing,

347
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,320
which is different than Disney Quest.

348
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
There's, yeah.

349
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,360
That was a Chuck E. Cheese thing?

350
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,360
I think it was sort of Chuck E. Cheese-ish.

351
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
I don't know much about it.

352
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,360
Family entertainment center.

353
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,160
Did you ever do that, Justin?

354
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,040
No, like I didn't even know about it.

355
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,120
Most people I don't think knew about any of this stuff.

356
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,200
But it was like constant.

357
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,960
I was a really, like we talk about continuous.

358
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,640
And I was like on top of it, even back then, like I knew the like themed entertainment

359
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,680
news when I was a kid and I had no idea that place.

360
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,280
Justin, you lived in Southern California like all your life.

361
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,000
Did you ever go to, it's a thing I encountered recently and it's a chain.

362
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's called Boomers.

363
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,960
Oh yeah, well, Boomers.

364
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,220
It's a chain of family entertainment centers and it's still hanging in there despite having

365
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,980
multiple different, like locations are owned by different companies.

366
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:44,060
Yeah, so Boomers like came in and bought up a bunch of like miniature golf courses and

367
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,060
stuff like that.

368
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:50,900
And like the, one of my favorite places to go when I was a kid was Bullwinkles.

369
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,900
And Boomers.

370
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,900
Oh yeah, of course.

371
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,940
Yeah, Boomers bought the Bullwinkles in Fountain Valley.

372
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,500
So like I went to Boomers, but they weren't Boomers yet when I went there.

373
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:08,540
And then like, I remember after high school, they started opening up more miniature golf

374
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,860
course and like bowling places.

375
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:18,480
So I remember going to Boomers like just out of high school, but it wasn't really a thing

376
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,660
when I was a kid yet.

377
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,940
There were a bunch of like independent miniature golf courses and then Boomers bought them

378
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,140
up and like added other things.

379
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,860
What are the odds that you get into the weeds that you talk to the owners of these places

380
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:35,500
and discover that Boomers was a cutthroat, terrible pirate organization that like we

381
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,500
had to sell.

382
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,140
We had no choice.

383
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,020
The Boomers wave ruined the right.

384
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,020
It has to be that.

385
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:48,660
Before Boomers came in, like that Bullwinkles in Fountain Valley was just amazing because

386
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:55,820
you had the full Bullwinkles with the animatronic and the whole thing, plus you had bumper boats,

387
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,820
which were crazy.

388
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:02,420
Yeah, it was a very, very fun complex.

389
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,420
Wow.

390
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,420
You need a lot of land to have bumper boats.

391
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:09,580
Is there a place within 30 miles that you can get in a bumper boat right from here?

392
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,580
Yep, definitely.

393
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,580
Where are they?

394
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:17,180
I mean, Ventura, I don't know if it's within 30 miles, but golf and stuff in Ventura is

395
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:21,260
what I flashed to, which is right off the freeway, off the 101, so you can see that

396
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,340
very easily.

397
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,180
And it's on my mind because the Beach Boys filmed a very embarrassing music video there

398
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,380
for a cover of Crocodile Rock, and they're all in the bumper boats and shaking their

399
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:34,660
hands around, like doing jazz hands, wearing leisure suits and fedoras.

400
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,020
It's one of the worst things you'll ever see.

401
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,020
What year are we talking?

402
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,020
95, 96.

403
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,340
Stamos in it for sure.

404
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,580
Stamos is like a Latin lover.

405
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,860
They have slicked back hair, like dipping girls.

406
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,700
But I think maybe one in the Valencia-ish area too might have, I forget the name of

407
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,700
that.

408
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,420
I think it's the same golf and stuff as from Karate Kid too.

409
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,420
Oh, really?

410
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,420
I didn't know that.

411
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,420
Oh, wow.

412
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,420
Interesting.

413
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,420
Okay.

414
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,820
Oh, and then they moved all the balloons from the state fair to some show in Singapore,

415
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,860
some Disney Fest in Singapore.

416
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,860
Yes.

417
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,860
Yeah, yeah.

418
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:15,220
So, I would love if we can get a video of what that balloon show was, a highly produced

419
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,220
balloon show.

420
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,940
Jason's ready to go without the, Jason's putting his foot down.

421
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,940
We're doing it.

422
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,940
We don't need the footage.

423
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,740
It's all the inflatable parade balloon.

424
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,740
It's our guys.

425
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,140
He wants to list the balloons.

426
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,140
It's our guys?

427
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,140
What do you mean?

428
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,140
It's our guys.

429
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,140
He wants to list the balloons.

430
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,620
Tell us what our guys are.

431
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,020
Just that we like the balloon.

432
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:41,100
We always, I feel like we always speak fondly of the balloons in the parade.

433
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,100
We do love the balloons.

434
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,580
What do you mean by the balloons?

435
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,580
I don't know.

436
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,580
Are you talking about the balloons?

437
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,580
Like the party grub.

438
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,580
Party grub.

439
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,580
But that's not part of this, is it?

440
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,580
This is a different thing.

441
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,500
The video alluded to some of those balloons were in the show.

442
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,500
Ending up.

443
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
Okay.

444
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,340
But I don't know which balloons specifically, if it's the mini with the big fruit hat on

445
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,340
or something.

446
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,620
I just found it so strange that you're yelling it's our guys at me and I'm like, what are?

447
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,620
Who are?

448
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,620
They're my guys.

449
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,620
Some people.

450
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,060
If they're my guys, I should know what they are.

451
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:15,260
If somebody has the video, please send it to, email us and send it to us at JasonSheraton.com.

452
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,580
Did you go to the great inflation celebration?

453
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,580
Yeah.

454
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,300
Did you bounce in luxury?

455
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:26,580
Be very careful searching that now or you're going to find Mickey going like, oh boy, oh

456
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,580
I'm getting bigger.

457
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,580
I'm about to pop.

458
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,580
What?

459
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,580
Inflation stuff?

460
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,580
Inflation stuff is like a rule.

461
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,580
Is that a sex thing?

462
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,580
Like a rule 35.

463
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,580
I feel like inflation stuff is a sex.

464
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,580
Inflation stuff.

465
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,580
If you feel that, then you know that's true.

466
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,580
You're going to have to just admit it.

467
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,580
Are you into inflation stuff, Jason?

468
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,580
I am not.

469
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,580
No.

470
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,580
I just know.

471
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,580
I'm just an anthropologist, you know.

472
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,580
I'm just curious.

473
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,580
You study that people do this.

474
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:02,580
But do you think an example of that would be Mickey saying, oh, I'm getting so bald.

475
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,580
Oh, don't put too much hair in there or else I'm going to puff.

476
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,580
We haven't even gotten to the fairest feels yet.

477
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,580
I know, but what is inflation?

478
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,580
What is it?

479
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,580
Like being inflated.

480
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,580
Like being pumped in.

481
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:20,580
So there's porno or is it like cartoon porno where like a balloon is being inflated and

482
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,580
somebody gets horny because of that?

483
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,580
Like characters get inflated.

484
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,580
Justin, you know what I'm talking about?

485
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,580
No.

486
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,580
All right.

487
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,580
He maybe just invented a thing.

488
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,580
But don't send us this.

489
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,580
He maybe invented a thing.

490
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,580
Maybe that's an invented thing.

491
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,580
I assure you, I am not.

492
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,580
I think maybe you did.

493
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,580
I am not the expert here.

494
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,580
I am just a casual observer.

495
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,580
You're a creator.

496
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,580
You're a young creative who's come up with a new kind of porno.

497
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,580
No, he's not.

498
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:53,580
Because I've just found a Reddit where people are accusing the series Tiny Toon Adventures

499
00:24:53,580 --> 00:25:00,580
of being a way for the writers to make real their inflation fetishes.

500
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:05,580
And they're proving this by, you know, like Babs Bunny would get big sometimes.

501
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,580
Like Violet Beauregard or something.

502
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:12,580
Tiny Toon Adventures was practically the writers barely disguised furry weight gain and inflation fetishes.

503
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,580
Oh, my gosh.

504
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,580
Oh, no.

505
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,580
Wow.

506
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,580
Oh, no.

507
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,580
Jason, you're really lurking on the dark.

508
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,580
You're looking at the dark part.

509
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:24,580
You're not allowed to think of a part where a cartoon character blows up real big and

510
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,580
then that's...

511
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,580
That was fun.

512
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,580
That's just fun.

513
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,580
That's not just you trying to write your fetish into...

514
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,580
I think it's just good old fashioned fun.

515
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,580
Like a turn of the century state fair.

516
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,580
Donald puts his mouth on like a...

517
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,580
If you think you're segueing back with that, you're incorrect, Jason.

518
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,580
We're staying on this point.

519
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,580
Good try.

520
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,580
It might continue.

521
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,580
I was going to say like Donald puts his mouth on like a helium tank and he blows up and

522
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,580
he floats.

523
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,580
And he floats away.

524
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,580
That's good fun.

525
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,580
That's for perverts is what this Reddit person is saying.

526
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,580
That's for perverts?

527
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,580
Yes.

528
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,580
The only way you'd ever want to see a cartoon character blow up is to get off on it.

529
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,580
What?

530
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,580
This is awful.

531
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,580
Thank you, Jason, for bringing inflation stuff to our desk today.

532
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:05,580
I assume you then take the inflated cartoon character and like put it on your dick.

533
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,580
That's what it is?

534
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,580
I guess.

535
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,580
I don't know.

536
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,580
I don't know that that's a part of it.

537
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,580
Jason says it's not and he's an expert on this.

538
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,580
Jason, the inflation stuff expert.

539
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,580
You just look at the thing and inflate it.

540
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,580
He knows.

541
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,580
He's pretending he doesn't know.

542
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,580
It's not my thing.

543
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,580
But he knows.

544
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,580
He clearly knows.

545
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,580
It's not my thing.

546
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,580
Yeah, right.

547
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,580
Bullshit.

548
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,580
The more he says it's not my thing.

549
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,580
I think it's making them real big and occasionally popping.

550
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,580
Oh, it's the popping that's the...

551
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,580
This is what we're missing.

552
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,580
That might be an element.

553
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,580
This is part of it.

554
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,580
This is like how every snowflake is different, you know?

555
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,580
No two snowflakes are the same.

556
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,580
What?

557
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,580
It is?

558
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,580
Yeah, people...

559
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,580
No one has the same exact fetish.

560
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,580
You think different inflatable people like a different element of the inflatable thing.

561
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,580
Yes, exactly.

562
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,580
Some might not care about the popping.

563
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,580
Right.

564
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,580
Some might just like to see it.

565
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,580
No, it's funny.

566
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,580
The popping's not part of it for me.

567
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,580
It's too aggressive.

568
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,580
I agree.

569
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,580
I love the character.

570
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,580
They're my guy.

571
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,580
I don't want to see them pop.

572
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,580
So maybe this is why they had to shut to the state fair thing, the Mickey inflation celebration

573
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,580
down, because people are getting too horny watching the show.

574
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,580
This thing, if I go in there, it has inflation stuff.

575
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,580
Was that Michael Eisner?

576
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:16,580
No, that was a leering inflation man trying to buy tickets.

577
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,580
I guess my theory is that Eisner wanted to do it because he's an inflation guy.

578
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,580
I don't know.

579
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,580
All right, for this fiscal year, my proposition, inflation stuff.

580
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,580
I'd like to see Pluto get really big.

581
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,580
Not because I want to see him pop, I just want to see him get big.

582
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,580
Make it very clear.

583
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,580
Not into them popping.

584
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,580
I'd just like to see him bigger than normal.

585
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,580
Wow, inflation stuff.

586
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,580
All right, now segue us back.

587
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,580
Now we're ready.

588
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:50,580
They were inflating a lot of balloons at the state fair promotion, right?

589
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,580
He's upset now.

590
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,580
Maybe.

591
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,580
Huh?

592
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,580
It's unfair to make Justin deal with this.

593
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,580
No, he's all right.

594
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,580
He knows Jason.

595
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,580
He's known Jason a long time.

596
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:07,580
He's familiar with all his different interests.

597
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,580
Well, where does that lead?

598
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,580
Here, this is a good reset.

599
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,580
Let's watch a commercial for the state fair.

600
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,580
Yes, thank you.

601
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,580
Here we go.

602
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,580
It's not the Ralph Swan, but it's a whole big musical number.

603
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,580
And there's a part, as often with videos, where I'm just going to have to explain it

604
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,580
and the listener won't understand it at first.

605
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,580
But there's one shot that stands out to me.

606
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:29,580
Oh, the state fair, the Disneyland, state fair's coming.

607
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,580
I know there's something special there for me.

608
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,580
Disneyland brings 50 great state fairs all into one.

609
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,580
It's a whole park full of fun and games with all the ingredients for nonstop surprises,

610
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,580
with daily pig races and a down-home state fair parade.

611
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,580
All this and Disneyland 2 every day.

612
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:50,580
Oh, the state fair, the Disneyland is something special, something special.

613
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,580
Something special, really special.

614
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,580
Yeah, that's that.

615
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,580
It kind of gives you an overview of the sort of stuff they had

616
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,580
and the vibe and the Americana of it all.

617
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:08,580
But what's jumped out at me is that the musical number is being led by, I mean, is it Burt?

618
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,580
I guess it's Burt-esque.

619
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,580
He's got the suit on.

620
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,580
Yeah, it's the jolly holiday-type mode of Mary Poppins Burt

621
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,580
with the red and white stripes and the hat.

622
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,580
And then that, if we're saying that's Burt,

623
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:28,580
then there's a weird part where he is holding a bowl of chili with a ribbon on it.

624
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,580
And he's making a, and steam, only just now have I realized

625
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,580
maybe they're conveying that steam is coming out of the heat.

626
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,580
Yeah, it's hot chili.

627
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:42,580
And he's making a face like, yeah, yikes, hot, hot chili.

628
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,580
Burt can't, I live in England.

629
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,580
I don't know from spice.

630
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,580
I don't know.

631
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,580
How do you do this?

632
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,580
The food is bland there, yeah.

633
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:55,580
You put this kind of thing down, you shovel this kind of thing down your mouth, do you?

634
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:00,580
He also is dressed like Professor Harold Hill from The Music Man.

635
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,580
That's what I think they were going for.

636
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:09,580
Yeah, that song is the Wells Fargo wagon song from The Music Man.

637
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,580
A number that I don't think Harold Hill is in.

638
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,580
Which upsets you, because it's not accurate.

639
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,580
Well, no, that's the big song.

640
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,580
That's child Ron Howard's big song.

641
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,580
Okay.

642
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,580
I'm just saying, do you like the mixing of Music Man, like iconography?

643
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,580
I do like it.

644
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:38,580
I feel like a lot of the state fair music is just in the parade, especially.

645
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:46,580
It's just production numbers of the music played on Main Street nowadays, like the instrumental music.

646
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:52,580
Yeah, there's different types of state fair things going on.

647
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,580
It's not all sort of in the same Hello Dolly Music Man era.

648
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,580
Unfortunately for Jason, it is not all set in 1906.

649
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,580
Yes.

650
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:05,580
But a lot is, and I feel like the parade very much so.

651
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,580
Yes.

652
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,580
That's a big part of it.

653
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:14,580
Maybe this has something to do with the chili being in the commercial.

654
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:21,580
But the state fair was the first time that I ever remember food being a big deal at Disneyland.

655
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:28,580
Seasonal offerings just for the special event, something that's very commonplace now, and they really push.

656
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,580
We do really polished photos.

657
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,580
You've got to come here for these months because you're going to get this thing.

658
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,580
You're right.

659
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,580
This might be the first time that was ever done.

660
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:39,580
Getting that chili was a thing.

661
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,580
You remember getting the chili.

662
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,580
Oh, very much so.

663
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,580
Oh, really?

664
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:48,580
Maybe we felt like we had to because of the commercial, but I remember it being a big deal.

665
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:55,580
It was made out of buffalo meat, which was this mind-blowing thing at the time.

666
00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:01,580
I remember my family discussing if it was actual buffalo.

667
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:07,580
I feel like it's in the commercial for a reason.

668
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:11,580
The pies, I remember the pies being a big thing.

669
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:17,580
I think single-slice pies suddenly were available.

670
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,580
I don't know if it was just one place or all over the park.

671
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:27,580
Well, they had booths set up, so the areas that wouldn't be really themed like Tomorrowland.

672
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,580
That's a tough thing to marry.

673
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:35,580
There would be a booth with pies and maybe some carnival games and stuff.

674
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:45,580
Once again, Jason, this is a time where you could just grab slices of pie handily no matter where you are, even in Tomorrowland.

675
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,580
Well, you've got to wash down your chili with something.

676
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:58,580
It's funny because a lot of his stuff does look very fun, but also a lot of it is this chintzy, corny shit that Walt hated.

677
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,580
I wouldn't say a lot.

678
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,580
I can't believe Jason's mad at this.

679
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:07,580
No, I'm not mad at it. I'm just giving the other side.

680
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,580
The other side where it's shit. It's fucking shit. Fuck it.

681
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:23,580
They did have two Ferris wheels, but the way that they were presented and the places that they were, it felt not obtrusive.

682
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,580
Right, they were on the railroad tracks?

683
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,580
One of the years.

684
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,580
That's part of this, why he's upset. It's because they were blocking the railroad tracks.

685
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,580
It shut down because of Splash Mountain construction.

686
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,580
Oh, they weren't running the train?

687
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,580
At least one of the years.

688
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:44,580
Interesting. So you would use the train station as a line for a Ferris wheel.

689
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,580
Yeah, that's the one in the front of the park.

690
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,580
So you're looking at the parking lot on that thing. That's on the other side. Interesting.

691
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,580
And then there was one right in front of the castle?

692
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:58,580
One year, and then the other year it was over by the rivers.

693
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:13,580
Two Ferris wheels. I saw people online saying that they felt like this was another, in addition to his inflation interests, that Eisner was determined, hell or high water, to get a Ferris wheel into the park somehow.

694
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:26,580
Two of them he got. So when ultimately California Adventure happens and you have your big permanent Ferris wheel with several names that it's had, people theorize that Eisner really was dying for a Ferris wheel forever.

695
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:31,580
I think the Ferris wheels were at most of these events. I think they were also at the circus.

696
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:39,580
Oh, really? I think they were, oh yeah, the circus. I don't think they were a blast to the past, but I can't remember. I can't remember seeing them in any of the videos.

697
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,580
They'd have a big record on it.

698
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:47,580
Were you ever there when blast to the past with John Bowser Bowman from shenanah?

699
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,580
No, I think I would have remembered that because I was a huge shenanah fan.

700
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,580
Or you. Oh man, we should have had you on the first one too.

701
00:34:54,580 --> 00:35:04,580
We were baffled by it. We didn't understand this guy, his appeal. We watched a special where he's telling us about the blast to the past event and it's full of all these weird monologue jokes.

702
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,580
Remember the lunch ladies? They look like they stink.

703
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:16,580
I couldn't tell you why, but I remember as a kid watching shenanah and really being drawn to Bowser.

704
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,580
His Charisma Ice pose? I don't know.

705
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:23,580
Yeah, they picked up some of the Happy Days shine too, I feel like.

706
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:33,580
And recently I've been watching him out of the character as the host of Hollywood Squares and Match Game. They've been airing that era on Pluto.

707
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:39,580
Oh right. Yeah, they have a full Hollywood Squares channel. When was he a regular? He wasn't Bowser on it?

708
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:44,580
No, he was the host of Hollywood Squares and he was out of the Bowser character.

709
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:49,580
Whoa. Weird. Does he have like a crazy different, like an Englishman or something? Does he have a crazy different voice?

710
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:54,580
Not quite, but it's definitely like weird. Like I didn't recognize him. So it is a real put on, the voice.

711
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:58,580
Oh yeah. Like yeah. Huh. Yeah, Bowser was a gimmick.

712
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,580
Yeah, I knew it was a gimmick. I just didn't know how much of a gimmick.

713
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:06,580
Like I knew they were like a comedy act also in addition to a 50s revival act.

714
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:10,580
And also they ended up playing Woodstock because Hendrix was like a big fan.

715
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:15,580
That's why? Yeah. What? Why?

716
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:19,580
Part of him doing Woodstock was he had to book Sha Na Na.

717
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:25,580
Is Sha Na Na in the Demetri Martin movie about Woodstock?

718
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,580
Yeah, taking Woodstock. Taking Woodstock.

719
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,580
Well, look it up and see if Sha Na Na is in there.

720
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:35,580
I'm going to have to ask my mom because I feel like maybe we did that and I forgot.

721
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:40,580
Because going to Disneyland to see Bowser definitely feels like something I would have done as a kid.

722
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:45,580
I just don't know how often he was there because he was, yeah, using the promotional material for that.

723
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,580
We might have done a show with some kind too.

724
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:52,580
Because like Viral was at Knott's all the time in Halloween season.

725
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:56,580
I feel like Batman was a viral level celebrity.

726
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,580
You know, you could get him down for a few.

727
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,580
I got nothing going on.

728
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:08,580
Even as a kid though, that whole thing felt like it was trying to capitalize on Back to the Future.

729
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,580
Which I didn't appreciate.

730
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:13,580
Yeah, suddenly like there's a new angle.

731
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:17,580
There's a cool current thing with a lot of 50s stuff in it.

732
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,580
Yeah, that's an underrated part of why all that 50s.

733
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,580
Yeah, I didn't even think about that.

734
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:25,580
This ad for State Fair, we're talking about pies.

735
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:32,580
This ad is so good and kind of creepy and is so Knott's Berry Farm.

736
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,580
Yeah, well it's very Norman Rockwell.

737
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,580
Here, let's describe some aspects of this.

738
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,580
I have this too.

739
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:46,580
It's a drawing, but a drawing of Mickey, Minnie, and Goofy as they're suited in park characters.

740
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,580
Yes, and Mickey looks sharp.

741
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,580
Plaid, bandana, denim overalls.

742
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,580
Minnie looks lovely.

743
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,580
Beautiful, yes.

744
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,580
Well, what a bonnet.

745
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:04,580
And what kind of pattern would you say is on her dress?

746
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:10,580
I don't know, it looks almost like a picnic, like a cloth that you put on for having a picnic.

747
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,580
Gingham?

748
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,580
Is that what that's called?

749
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,580
A white something, but she's wearing kind of a little dress and a little hat.

750
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:22,580
And then Goofy is wearing a drum major outfit or a marching band outfit.

751
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,580
He's a music man again.

752
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,580
Yeah, he's got a conductor's wand, and he's got his arms in the air.

753
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:33,580
And Mickey and Minnie are holding a pie toward the viewer of this ad.

754
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:40,580
This feels like if you were at Knott's Berry Farm, you'd be pissed that they were infringing on your territory.

755
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,580
Yeah, it's that hominess.

756
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:47,580
Yeah, how much the whole thing feels like it, and just that the pie is like the thing they're presenting to the...

757
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,580
That's true, yeah, the Disneyland's all about pies for this stretch of time.

758
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,580
I would be furious if I were like, what the hell is this shit?

759
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,580
All we have is pies at Knott's Berry Farm.

760
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:03,580
They have all the good stuff and the characters, and here they come trying to take our market share.

761
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:10,580
Yeah, they already stole the idea of doing a teen nightclub, and they plussed it up by being less tolerant.

762
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,580
Right, yes.

763
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:17,580
To me, this feels like Ruthless Eisner, like kind of a Ruthless Eisner.

764
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:28,580
That is another thing I remember about this time period, is we always had to get out of there before nighttime because of the teens coming.

765
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,580
To Minneapolis? Wave, interesting. Oh, wow, wow.

766
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,580
Do you remember being interested in going, like, oh, if I was only a little older, I could go to Minneapolis.

767
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:42,580
Not at all, and I remember my mom making it out to be a very scary thing because teenagers were scary.

768
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,580
So no, we had to get out of there.

769
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:49,580
There's drugs, there's alcohol, there's inflation stuff, you don't want to go near this.

770
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:56,580
Don't want to go near it, although now you just give them an iPad, and they were all iPad kids, so you can kind of trick them.

771
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,580
Well, you could just have a couple iPads on you.

772
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,580
Yeah, just some old ones, yeah.

773
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,580
Can I say one more thing about this poster?

774
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:10,580
I'm stealing this from a Reddit comment, but somebody posted this, nostalgic for this event, and then in the comments somebody said,

775
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,580
boy, Minnie looks like she's seen some shit.

776
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:23,580
And you've got to look closely to see, but Mickey is definitely, he's looking at us, can't wait to see you, and she just looks like she's trying to hold it together.

777
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:27,580
Yeah, she's staring into the middle distance or whatever.

778
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,580
Why is she staring here?

779
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:35,580
She watched, earlier that day, she saw somebody get crushed in the gears of the Ferris wheel.

780
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,580
And then like, I don't know if I can do the photo shoots.

781
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,580
And she's like, you hold it together, okay?

782
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,580
The photographer is coming.

783
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,580
You have to do this in Zara Park.

784
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,580
You put on a brave face.

785
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,580
She saw Michael Eisner kill a buffalo and put it into the chiller.

786
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:56,580
He likes like Gus Fring style and Breaking Bad sliced the throat.

787
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,580
Come this way.

788
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,580
The buffalo habitat is just a few more steps.

789
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,580
It's just right through this tube.

790
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,580
Minnie, you didn't see anything.

791
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,580
Minnie, you saw nothing.

792
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,580
Shut your mouth.

793
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,580
Keep your mouth shut.

794
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,580
She got splattered by buffalo innards.

795
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,580
Come over here.

796
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:16,580
I'll wipe the entrails off of your snoot.

797
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,580
Don't talk about this.

798
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,580
Aren't you scared?

799
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,580
Aren't you freaked out by this goof?

800
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,580
Look, I'm here to do a job.

801
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,580
I don't ask questions.

802
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,580
So yeah, this lists the things that you could do there.

803
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,580
And I don't know.

804
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,580
Do you have any recollection of Justin's image?

805
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,580
No.

806
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,580
Yeah, that doesn't jump out at me.

807
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,580
But I would like a poster of this.

808
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,580
This is how much I like this image.

809
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,580
It's really good.

810
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,580
I also like that something I get nostalgic for,

811
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,580
I don't do it as much anymore,

812
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,580
but there was a while where I was buying a lot of like 80s magazines.

813
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,580
I mean, I own a lot of the Disney magazines from them,

814
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,580
but there was like LA Magazine and Orange Coast.

815
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:56,580
Did you ever have Orange Coast magazine?

816
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,580
Or the events that are happening this week

817
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,580
and listings of every bar and restaurant.

818
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,580
And yeah, I used to buy a lot of, I don't know,

819
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,580
maybe Bea Arthur's on the cover.

820
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:10,580
You get to see her vacation condo in Corona Del Mar.

821
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,580
But I would buy these magazines.

822
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:17,580
And something I always liked is like the sheer volume of copy

823
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:20,580
that like now ads have no words.

824
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,580
And it used to be like, pull up a chair.

825
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,580
I got five paragraphs for you.

826
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,580
But I find it very relaxed.

827
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,580
It really takes me back to the 88

828
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,580
and you're looking at the dense copy.

829
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,580
Right.

830
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,580
There's like four paragraphs, five paragraphs,

831
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,580
four paragraphs here.

832
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,580
Yeah.

833
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,580
The state you want to be in, it says.

834
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:42,580
And so the idea, they said in that commercial,

835
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,580
but it was like, we're combining the best

836
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,580
of all the state fairs in the country.

837
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,580
50 state fairs rolled into one.

838
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,580
Yeah.

839
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,580
And the different like things would also say like

840
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,580
which state they were from.

841
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:57,580
And I remember there was either like a sticker

842
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,580
or something from each state.

843
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,580
Yeah, these.

844
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

845
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,580
So they would sell, did you know that they would sell these?

846
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,580
These are stickers that have like characters on them

847
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,580
and then list like Minnesota and Donald has an ax,

848
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,580
I assume to chop down a tree.

849
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:11,580
Well, I saw that every, people would get them

850
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,580
when your car parked in a lot that would give you a sticker.

851
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,580
Oh, okay.

852
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,580
There was a different one like each day

853
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,580
to get people to come back to collect the stickers.

854
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,580
Yeah, and then some kids would like stand on Main Street,

855
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,580
like trading them.

856
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:24,580
Yeah.

857
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,580
Like they were trading.

858
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,580
Like the toy thing they did.

859
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,580
Like an early pin trade.

860
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,580
Right, yep.

861
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:29,580
Yeah.

862
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,580
That's cool.

863
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,580
Yeah.

864
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,580
I feel like there was something like that

865
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,580
for each one of the events.

866
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,580
Yeah, there was some sort of like collectible element to it.

867
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,580
Oh, and it's too bad that some of these

868
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,580
have Mickey doing things culturally

869
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,580
that he should not be doing.

870
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:46,580
Wearing clothes that, also there's one, the Texas one,

871
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:50,580
is it Mickey with a bandana over his face

872
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,580
holding two pistols?

873
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,580
Oh, I'm not seeing that one.

874
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:56,580
I think he's being like a Yosemite Sam.

875
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,580
They're stealing knots,

876
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,580
now he's stealing Yosemite Sam schtick.

877
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,580
Yeah, I just Googled Disneyland State Fair stickers,

878
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,580
and some are nice.

879
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,580
So like South Dakota, it's a Mount Rushmore

880
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,580
with our characters on it.

881
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:14,580
And then Wisconsin Mini's got butter urns.

882
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:15,580
What are butter urns?

883
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,580
A churn?

884
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,580
Yeah, a churn must be in my head,

885
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,580
but it can't be an urn, is it?

886
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,580
Jars, what do you put butter in when it's done?

887
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,580
The whole butter holder?

888
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,580
But both Texas and Wyoming,

889
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,580
Mickey is holding two different types of guns.

890
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:30,580
Really?

891
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,580
I'm trying to find out.

892
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,580
And then New York, Jason would like the New York one,

893
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,580
where he's like an old time chappy.

894
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:38,580
He's in a pinstripe suit and a bowler hat.

895
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,580
With like a bowler hat, yeah.

896
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,580
It's a little surprising for California,

897
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,580
he's the Zodiac Killer.

898
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:48,580
He's got a bag over his head.

899
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:53,580
Wait, John Wayne, he's the John Wayne Gacy clown?

900
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,580
What the fuck?

901
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,580
A different event I think you're looking at.

902
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:58,580
Oh, yeah.

903
00:44:58,580 --> 00:44:59,580
In the mid-90s.

904
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:03,580
Illinois, he's Al Capone?

905
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:07,580
He's throwing his enemies in a river?

906
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,580
Poor Chippendale.

907
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:12,580
Oh, for New Jersey, he's the devil impregnating a woman

908
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:16,580
to create his cursed spawn?

909
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,580
Why is he that?

910
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,580
Jersey Devil?

911
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,580
Jersey Devil.

912
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,580
Oh, okay.

913
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,580
Look, I'm looking at some nice ones.

914
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:26,580
Goofy's bundled up because he's in Alaska.

915
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,580
Oh, that's nice.

916
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:30,580
Ship sold in the Georgia peach.

917
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:35,580
Idaho, Donald's relaxing next to a giant potato,

918
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,580
and he has a big old gut.

919
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,580
He ate a lot of potatoes.

920
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:40,580
He looks like he's pregnant.

921
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,580
Yeah.

922
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,580
It is an interesting drawing.

923
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,580
Or has he been inflated?

924
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,580
Oh, no.

925
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,580
Inflation stuff.

926
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:51,580
That's a lateral move to, I believe the term is impreg stuff

927
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,580
with a pregnant Sonic.

928
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:54,580
I believe.

929
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,580
I believe.

930
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,580
I'll fool them if I say I'm not sure.

931
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,580
I don't want to seem like I miss you.

932
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,580
I don't want to seem like I'm disrespectful,

933
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:06,580
but I've definitely seen pregnant Shrek, pregnant Sonic.

934
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,580
And that's a sex thing.

935
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,580
Oh, yeah.

936
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:10,580
Right.

937
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:12,580
And is it just you look at it, or is there other stuff?

938
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:13,580
I don't know.

939
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,580
Don't even have to, yeah.

940
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,580
I don't know the mechanics.

941
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:19,580
I don't believe you, but we'll go through

942
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:22,580
because we already did too much on this.

943
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:26,580
This is like they still do like little stuff sometimes,

944
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,580
but it's like your annual pass holders go out

945
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,580
and they get like maybe a magnet once in a while.

946
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:34,580
But none of the magnets are Mickey shooting two guns in the air.

947
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,580
None of the magnets are that.

948
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:37,580
This is the time.

949
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,580
Yeah.

950
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:40,580
Do you remember having any of these?

951
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:43,580
Yeah, I think I still have one with Goofy on it.

952
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:44,580
I'm not sure which one.

953
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,580
There's a Montana Goofy.

954
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:47,580
It's so lazy.

955
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,580
It's just his big face and he's got a cowboy hat.

956
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,580
I think that's the one I have.

957
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:52,580
Is that the one?

958
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:53,580
Wow, wow.

959
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,580
But they couldn't think of an activity.

960
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,580
They couldn't think of like an action that is Montana.

961
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,580
We ran out of time.

962
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:03,580
Well, he's the governor inspired Yellowstone, you know.

963
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:06,580
Inspired later season plots.

964
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:11,580
There's like a lot of stuff online on eBay.

965
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:15,580
There's like hats that they had, like kind of cowboyish hats.

966
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:19,580
I did bring my State Fairer 87 button.

967
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,580
Oh.

968
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,580
Wow.

969
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,580
Yeah, there it is.

970
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,580
That looks nice.

971
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,580
There's a good logo, good bold.

972
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:26,580
Yeah.

973
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:27,580
Blue ribbons on here.

974
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:29,580
Like this poster.

975
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,580
Let's see if I can get a bigger version.

976
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,580
And the Ferris wheel square in the middle of the logo.

977
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,580
Wow.

978
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,580
The castle pushed to the side.

979
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:37,580
Yes.

980
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:38,580
Get out of here, Matterhorn.

981
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:39,580
He's never hated a castle.

982
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,580
He wanted to replace it with a Ferris wheel.

983
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,580
The Ferris wheel is given prominence.

984
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:46,580
It is up there with the castle and the Matterhorn.

985
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,580
It is an equal partner.

986
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,580
Yeah, he was pushing it.

987
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:56,580
This poster I found, that's like a really well-produced piece of art for this thing.

988
00:47:56,580 --> 00:48:00,580
You can feel the effort that was put into this event.

989
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:06,580
Yeah, especially I feel like this event, they did a lot of this stuff for the other events,

990
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,580
but this one felt like it had a little bit more than the other stuff.

991
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,580
Yes, I would agree with that.

992
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:16,580
We haven't even listed yet all the stuff that was there.

993
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:20,580
So we were talking about the Main Street area was more like Hello Dolly Music Man,

994
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:25,580
but then over in New Orleans Square there was a bunch of hillbilly nonsense.

995
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:29,580
And over at Videopolis there were like 80s...

996
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:33,580
The hillbilly stuff was more like Big Thunder Ranch,

997
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:41,580
where New Orleans Square was more of the lumberjack stuff.

998
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:46,580
Rivers of America had guys trying to balance on logs and stuff,

999
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,580
and then they'd fall into the river.

1000
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:52,580
And then log climbing competitions too?

1001
00:48:52,580 --> 00:49:03,580
Yeah, it was like a 20-minute to half-hour show that they would do a bunch of times a day on the Rivers of America.

1002
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:13,580
It had the competition between the lumberjacks, but it also had built-in bits and comedy things.

1003
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:19,580
It also had a band that was a different band from the pig races, which we'll get to.

1004
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:25,580
Captain Mike and the Cavalry Band, and I believe they're all dressed like Confederate soldiers.

1005
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,580
Good!

1006
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:31,580
Maybe they're Union, I don't know. The footage isn't so good.

1007
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:34,580
But they seem like Confederates to me.

1008
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:42,580
Yeah. You know, all 50 states were represented.

1009
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:50,580
So two families, I think it's the Aikens and the Barkers, maybe?

1010
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:51,580
Yes.

1011
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,580
And they were competing for a bag of gold.

1012
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:58,580
So they would send a member of each family to compete in the different events.

1013
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:03,580
One was climbing the big pole, one was out in the rivers running on...

1014
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,580
What do you call that?

1015
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:06,580
Log rolling?

1016
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,580
Yes, log rolling.

1017
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:13,580
Log rolling, and they would both be on a log, and whoever fell first lost.

1018
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:18,580
And this is wild. This one in particular, I think, is one of the wildest things to me.

1019
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:23,580
You could just see people in the middle of the rivers falling into it off of a log.

1020
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:27,580
Oh yeah, and doing bits on the logs.

1021
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:31,580
I don't know why I remember this.

1022
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:37,580
This must have been one of my earliest exposures to improv comedy.

1023
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:42,580
But I remember we had just had a big earthquake in Norwalk.

1024
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:53,580
And I was watching the Lumberjack show, and the emcee was doing crowd work across the rivers of America.

1025
00:50:53,580 --> 00:51:01,580
And he was asking people where they were from, and someone yelled out, Norwalk.

1026
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:08,580
And the guys on the logs did a bit where they acted all shaky because there had just been an earthquake.

1027
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:14,580
And I still remember that to this day, being impressed with that level of crowd work.

1028
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:19,580
And that you could go to Disneyland and hear something referred to that happened this month.

1029
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,580
Yeah, a topical joke.

1030
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:25,580
But I feel like that was more common at Disneyland at the time.

1031
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:31,580
And especially the State Fair had so many shows like this.

1032
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:36,580
Because you had that plus the pig racing, plus there was a diving show.

1033
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:42,580
And then there was a show on the train tracks in critter country.

1034
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:45,580
It was bear country at the time.

1035
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:48,580
With robbers and cowboys.

1036
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:50,580
Really? I didn't find that.

1037
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,580
So there was stuff all over the place.

1038
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:56,580
The all-star dive show was in front of Small World, I guess.

1039
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,580
Which is wild.

1040
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,580
The amount of stuff.

1041
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:06,580
But yeah, we've said this many times, a lot of the live performer stuff is what you end up remembering.

1042
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,580
Especially if you're a kid.

1043
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:14,580
But I've said this, the stormtroopers hassling people in Tomorrowland is stuff I love.

1044
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:20,580
And I feel like that stuff, it's so much more fun when you get tapped on the shoulder and the stormtroopers are behind you.

1045
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,580
That stuff you remember more.

1046
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:27,580
I was definitely more into the shows at Disneyland when I was a little kid than the rides.

1047
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,580
I was a scared little kid.

1048
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:32,580
So I didn't love dark rides.

1049
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:42,580
You had this mix of shows with live performers and then you also had America Sings and Country Bears.

1050
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:46,580
And that was the stuff I was always more drawn to.

1051
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,580
That's a different perspective.

1052
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,580
Yeah, I guess especially then.

1053
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:54,580
It was sort of a more show environment.

1054
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:58,580
It wasn't until Star Tours opened that I actually loved a ride.

1055
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,580
Oh wow. Makes sense.

1056
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:02,580
Real quick, I think Scott will be extra.

1057
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,580
We're all going to be excited about this.

1058
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,580
And maybe you've found this already.

1059
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:16,580
But there's a clip of Miss California from 1988 with the California Secretary of State sort of doing a little speech at Disneyland during State Fair.

1060
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:18,580
I don't know if you found this or not.

1061
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:20,580
And somebody makes an appearance.

1062
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:24,580
A specific version of someone makes an appearance, I believe, during this.

1063
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,580
So if it's not cued up, here we go.

1064
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:31,580
Welcome you to this momentous occasion as we honor the state of California.

1065
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,580
Welcome to Disneyland.

1066
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:36,580
I'm sure Mickey and Roger will agree it is a pleasure to have you with us.

1067
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,580
Right, Roger?

1068
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:52,580
It's me, the wrong one.

1069
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:54,580
It's the wrong, weird Mickey voice.

1070
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:58,580
This is what we're doing.

1071
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:01,580
We are comfortable having Mickey.

1072
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:05,580
Our biggest character sounds like this when you come meet him.

1073
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:09,580
Prime spot for Roger.

1074
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:13,580
You forget Roger Rabbit was on the level as Mickey back then.

1075
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,580
They clearly rushed to miss.

1076
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,580
That must have been because the movie comes out in 88.

1077
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:22,580
So by the 88 version, they're pushing Roger in the TV ads, in the parades and stuff.

1078
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:27,580
I feel like maybe right before that they mentioned our brand new character.

1079
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:31,580
Welcome our new guy to Disneyland, Roger Rabbit.

1080
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:32,580
They make a big deal out of Roger.

1081
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,580
I remember it being a big deal.

1082
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:44,580
I don't feel like, even though that was the beginning of the renaissance of Disney animation,

1083
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:49,580
he wouldn't see new characters in the park that often.

1084
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,580
Yeah, it wouldn't be a quick thing like that.

1085
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,580
And they went all in pretty quickly too.

1086
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:55,580
Yes.

1087
00:54:55,580 --> 00:55:03,580
But now I think they would, it would take three and a half years.

1088
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:08,580
And they try to make that, you got to come back to the park.

1089
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:15,580
I mean, I don't know who it would be now, but that's how long it takes at this point to just get a new suit.

1090
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:21,580
I would love it if they did a poochy kind of character of like our new character.

1091
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:28,580
I think they were maybe like back to our piloting the wishing star from Wish.

1092
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:31,580
And then that didn't really take off.

1093
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:38,580
There's a character that's a gag in Runaway Railway, the little chirpy bird at the end.

1094
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:39,580
Oh, right.

1095
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:45,580
And they sell stuffed animals and that's like, I feel like a joke in that.

1096
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:49,580
What you might miss is like, oh, it's our new character.

1097
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:52,580
Yeah, but they're not pushing the chirpy bird like he's Roger Rabbit.

1098
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:57,580
No, they're not pushing the chirpy bird and the star that you wish on did not really catch on.

1099
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:02,580
Yeah, Sean do type like from Sinbad where it's like a cute character.

1100
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:07,580
And maybe this will maybe it could turn into like a parks fun parks character.

1101
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:09,580
Yeah. Yeah.

1102
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:14,580
There's speaking of like so the original characters, there are I don't know if I should go here first.

1103
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:18,580
Let's let's go back to the cannonball guy because the cannonball guy is a character with a name.

1104
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:20,580
I don't know if you found this. Yes.

1105
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:26,580
Captain Zoom is the name of the guy who would get shot out of a cannon on Main Street.

1106
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:29,580
OK. And was it the same name for each of the events?

1107
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:37,580
I don't know the answer, but there was a whole intro on Main Street with Captain Zoom.

1108
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:44,580
There would be like there's a so you can see here in this in this YouTube video, there's a big banner that says Captain Zoom.

1109
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:49,580
And then a guy would come down the street in the like Burt outfit.

1110
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:55,580
So it's probably like the same whether it's the same actual performer, but it's same character as from your commercial.

1111
00:56:55,580 --> 00:57:00,580
OK, yeah. And he would do a little spiel introducing Captain Zoom.

1112
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:05,580
And I don't know that any of this is particularly good, but I'll play it just so.

1113
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:37,580
And the grace of the cosmos, so it's in God's hands now is what he's saying.

1114
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,580
The cosmos is feeling graceful today.

1115
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:44,580
And then I find this footage hilarious and scary.

1116
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:50,580
Like he really honest to God shoots himself out of a cannon down Main Street.

1117
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:53,580
And this is happening. Did you see this live? Oh, absolutely.

1118
00:57:53,580 --> 00:58:01,580
It's insane. They built the Spider-Man animatronic, you know, that does a less impressive thing in Avengers Canvas.

1119
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:04,580
But they had a human doing this multiple times a day.

1120
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:13,580
And this was like a level up from when he did it during the circus, because for the circus, I think it was over the rivers of America.

1121
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:17,580
And now this is over cement on Main Street.

1122
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:21,580
He could be kept in splat. So this footage is so crazy to me.

1123
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:25,580
I loved this as a kid.

1124
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:29,580
Listeners, you're going to hear a human cannonball.

1125
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:35,580
Oh, fuck. Oh, yeah. Why would you show us that? Oh, yeah.

1126
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:39,580
He exploded like a big bag of blood. Yeah.

1127
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:42,580
I can't finish the episode. I got to go puke.

1128
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:47,580
Come on. Like so mean. Very high.

1129
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:50,580
Yes, it's crazy. And lands in a net. Yeah.

1130
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:55,580
But it was like they're talking about now are like all these different like drone rules and stuff.

1131
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:58,580
They can't fly the drones over the heads of people.

1132
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:01,580
They were shooting guys out of cannon. They were shooting guys out of fucking cannons.

1133
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:04,580
Guys, they can do it. Yeah. Guy's fine. Guy is fine.

1134
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:10,580
He signs his life right away. But a little robot is too is too scary or too dangerous.

1135
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:13,580
So, yeah, Captain Zoom would do this.

1136
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:17,580
And, yeah, I don't know if it was always Captain Zoom or there was a different thing.

1137
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:21,580
I don't know if Disney owns Captain Zoom or this was this guy's gimmick.

1138
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:24,580
I guess we should look into. I would assume Disney owns Captain Zoom.

1139
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:27,580
So they just found a cannonball guy.

1140
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:35,580
Well, yeah, back then, I'm sure it was a lot easier to find a human cannonball than it is today.

1141
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:39,580
It was like it was a family tradition. Maybe people were doing it.

1142
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,580
It was it was people's livelihood in the 30s.

1143
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:44,580
And then like they trained their son and their son. Right.

1144
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:46,580
It was a trade. Maybe a daughter. You know what?

1145
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:52,580
Hey, first female. There was a lot of death death defying going on at these events.

1146
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:54,580
Wow. Like, yeah, what else would like?

1147
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:59,580
Was there anything like the high high divers also? Oh, sure. Very scary.

1148
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:05,580
The log climbing. I saw a video of the log climbing with the coming down because you want to pick up speed.

1149
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,580
You got to climb up and ring a bell.

1150
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:13,580
So but then if you allow yourself to just kind of essentially free fall down that thing, you can win a little easier.

1151
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:19,580
But that what cost that looks so scary. Yeah. Yeah.

1152
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:25,580
So yeah. And I guess the bike stuff was a little scary, but not as bad. Yeah.

1153
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,580
I will say that the I mean, I guess we should talk about it.

1154
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:33,580
There was a goofy suited character that would do like BMX tricks.

1155
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:39,580
Oh, yeah. There was a BMX. I forgot about this because like just not interesting to me.

1156
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:43,580
There was a BMX trick show at Videopolis.

1157
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:48,580
Yeah. This may have come up a little bit when we talked about Videopolis many, many years ago.

1158
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:49,580
I don't I don't really remember. Yeah.

1159
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:55,580
But it was I don't maybe I didn't connect the dots that it was for the state fair because it doesn't have the vibe of the rest of the state fair.

1160
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:58,580
Exactly. I think it's notable for its name.

1161
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:01,580
Wizards of Rad. Wizards of Rad.

1162
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:11,580
And this was during a point in time where I feel like most of the Southern California theme parks had something like this.

1163
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:18,580
Yeah, Nott's had like bike guys. Yeah, Nott's had it and SeaWorld had one.

1164
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:21,580
Oh, wow. Very odd.

1165
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:29,580
Like everyone had like a pre-extreme sports like BMX skateboarding type event or show at some point.

1166
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:32,580
Yeah, it's like that's what kids were into.

1167
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:35,580
So we got to get them. They've got to get the bikes there.

1168
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:42,580
Well, I also what I liked from the show is that the what song are they playing?

1169
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:44,580
Oh, it's You Can Fly, but a new lyric.

1170
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:50,580
But yeah, a rock version of it performed by a live band that was always that had to be there singing the song live.

1171
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:52,580
I don't think they're doing that these days.

1172
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:57,580
No. But yeah, a rockified You Can Fly, you know, like bikes do.

1173
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,580
They fly briefly.

1174
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:01,580
And it's long. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1175
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:03,580
It's a long version of the song.

1176
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:05,580
They solo and they shred.

1177
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:08,580
I'm just going to play the one, the little like lyric amending that I like.

1178
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:10,580
I think it's cute upright.

1179
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:21,580
Let's do the limit. Break out.

1180
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:24,580
I suddenly like this song. I like a Peter Pan song now.

1181
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:28,580
He's also like it's like supposed to be a rock version, but he's very lounge singing.

1182
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:30,580
He's a lounge guy as well.

1183
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:34,580
And like it's so it's a funny mix.

1184
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:36,580
And they're like, you got it.

1185
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:38,580
I'm kind of like Poison Meets Melt Torme.

1186
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,580
Right. So they had a Jason thing.

1187
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:47,580
They had a live band there and then a live band at the Rivers of America and at the Pig Races.

1188
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:49,580
So much live music.

1189
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:51,580
Tomorrowland and in Main Street.

1190
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:54,580
So you have five live bands.

1191
01:02:54,580 --> 01:03:00,580
I do. I legitimately it's upsetting to me that they don't do this level of live entertainment anymore.

1192
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:03,580
And they'll never go back to what I'm assuming.

1193
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:07,580
I mean, some of this is how would they ever approve any of this now?

1194
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:15,580
But even for something that's like synergistic with a movie, I just think it's never going to happen on this scale ever again.

1195
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:22,580
I mean, I was complaining about Pixar Fest this year not being to the level of Donald's Quacky Duck City in Tokyo.

1196
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:28,580
But this is this blows everything else out of the water as far as stuff you would go like original unique stuff.

1197
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:34,580
And this and it's this kind of thing that is why this podcast remains proudly pro Eisner.

1198
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:36,580
That's right. This thing.

1199
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:39,580
This decision that has been made that he ruined the company.

1200
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:41,580
And I'll look at this. Look what.

1201
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:42,580
Look what happened. Right.

1202
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:44,580
It's just one of the many that there are so many odd things like this.

1203
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:49,580
Not even counting all the new shit he added and then attractions and hotels.

1204
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:52,580
Right. Bob Iger does not approve confusing things.

1205
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,580
And that is the problem.

1206
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,580
That's right. It may all makes too much sense.

1207
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:58,580
It makes perfect corporate sense.

1208
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:01,580
Michael Eisner, you throw some weirdness at him and go to state fair.

1209
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:06,580
But there's BMX bikes and also there's a hillbilly pig show.

1210
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:08,580
Yeah. OK. That sounds great.

1211
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,580
Sign off on it.

1212
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:17,580
This is before PowerPoint presentations, you know, this before you had to present all your ideas with slides.

1213
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:20,580
You would have to verbally do saying you could get verbally.

1214
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:23,580
You think Eisner would have approved the slides in the 1980s.

1215
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:25,580
But there was slides.

1216
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:26,580
Overhead projector.

1217
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:27,580
But that's so expensive.

1218
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,580
Yeah. Overhead projector.

1219
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:32,580
Disney couldn't afford some overhead projector.

1220
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:35,580
I feel like these came so fast and furious.

1221
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:40,580
These events like one after the other that they had to even though they were impressive,

1222
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:42,580
they had to be kind of slapped together.

1223
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:43,580
Yeah. Yeah.

1224
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44,580
In order to happen.

1225
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:45,580
Sure.

1226
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:48,580
They had to be planning the next one as the other one was happening.

1227
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:53,580
Yeah. And then some of these like back blast to blast to the past.

1228
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:54,580
I can remember.

1229
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:56,580
It is kind of not the phrase.

1230
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:59,580
These are both in 88.

1231
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:01,580
But like there's an overlap.

1232
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:02,580
I was reading that.

1233
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:03,580
Yeah.

1234
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:06,580
88 were the two big years.

1235
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:08,580
So like there's stuff constantly happening.

1236
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:11,580
At the same time that you have Star Tours is brand new.

1237
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:12,580
Captain EO is brand new.

1238
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:13,580
More new.

1239
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:14,580
They're building Splash Moon.

1240
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:15,580
What a time.

1241
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:16,580
This was a time.

1242
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:17,580
Yeah.

1243
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,580
It was very, very exciting.

1244
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:22,580
I'm so curious what like just your Tony Baxter.

1245
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:24,580
Obviously he's working in Star Tours.

1246
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:29,580
But what did that core top level Imagineer think about some of these events?

1247
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:32,580
Which were seemingly slapped together.

1248
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:33,580
I wonder if they didn't like it.

1249
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:35,580
I wonder if they felt like if it felt.

1250
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:36,580
That's what I'm getting at.

1251
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:37,580
Yeah. Yeah.

1252
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:38,580
Because money was definitely spent.

1253
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:39,580
Yes.

1254
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:44,580
Like money had to have been going here instead of creating new attractions.

1255
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:45,580
Right.

1256
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:50,580
But at the same time, like Scott just said, like we were in this run of big attractions.

1257
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:53,580
Maybe you'd be in support of the theory behind it.

1258
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:56,580
But maybe think some of the execution was gen Z.

1259
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:57,580
That's yeah.

1260
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:58,580
I wonder.

1261
01:05:58,580 --> 01:05:59,580
Because yeah.

1262
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:00,580
You don't.

1263
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:01,580
Yeah.

1264
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:02,580
You hear all the big Imagineers talk about the big projects.

1265
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:06,580
But I'm always curious about what like what department did this stuff?

1266
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:09,580
And do they have any input in it whatsoever?

1267
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:12,580
And were they like there's a big Ferris wheel in the middle?

1268
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:17,580
This like I'm assuming some of them weren't pleased with some of the choices.

1269
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:18,580
But I guess it's temporary.

1270
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:19,580
And maybe they didn't care so much.

1271
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:20,580
I don't know.

1272
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:26,580
Well, have we talked about the notion, the theory that's out there that maybe we've said this some episode long ago.

1273
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:33,580
But that the Ferris wheel, I think people really hated the Ferris wheel being in the hub and blocking the castle.

1274
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:34,580
Yeah.

1275
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:36,580
And and then that was not the case the next year.

1276
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:39,580
And I think they even I forget what was there for circus.

1277
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,580
They kept these these events.

1278
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,580
I think nobody like motorcycles were there for the circus.

1279
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:44,580
Oh, it was motorcycle.

1280
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:45,580
OK.

1281
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:48,580
Well, yeah, I think people thought that was really silly and people in the company.

1282
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:58,580
And the theory is that the partners statue, the Walt and Mickey statue was built as a permanent thing that you can't move so that they can't put a bunch of bullshit.

1283
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:04,580
You can't have sumo suit wrestling for an entire summer in the middle and blocking the castle.

1284
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:10,580
What was funny with these events, though, is it was almost like you weren't there for Disneyland.

1285
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:24,580
Like you were there for the events, like especially like with my family in particular, like my mom had a very specific way that she liked me to experience Disneyland when we went,

1286
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:30,580
which was going down Main Street, crossing the drawbridge, going through the castle.

1287
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:32,580
You had to do it in that order.

1288
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:33,580
Interesting.

1289
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:37,580
Before you do anything else, you had to go over the drawbridge and through that castle.

1290
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:49,580
And then we would do the Fantasyland rides and then we would take the Skyway to Tomorrowland and do America Sings and that stuff and then walk across to Adventureland and then Tom Sawyer's Island and then Bear Country.

1291
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:50,580
Right.

1292
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:52,580
And then get out of there before the teenagers came.

1293
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:55,580
At the end of the day, a mad dash.

1294
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:56,580
Yes.

1295
01:07:56,580 --> 01:08:00,580
But for these special events, like that was off the table.

1296
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:02,580
Wow. Oh, then you broke the rules.

1297
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:04,580
It was all about these events.

1298
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:10,580
It was all about getting that like schedule at the beginning of the day with, okay, we're going to see the pig races at this time.

1299
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:11,580
We're going to see the lumberjacks at this time.

1300
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:15,580
We're going to do this, this and that, try the pie, try the chili.

1301
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:18,580
Like so it was almost like we weren't at Disneyland.

1302
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:21,580
That was kind of a secondary thing.

1303
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:22,580
That was fun.

1304
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:35,580
Like when we did that throwback night a couple of years ago, even though that was still like on brand Disney, it is interesting how just changing some of the music and changing a few things about it really does mess with like your normal Disneyland day.

1305
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:42,580
Like I could see all this new stuff just being thrown around and like you go like, well, it's this is a different thing.

1306
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:44,580
They've really, they've really changed.

1307
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:51,580
We were there to experience that, to go to the state fair, to go to the circus, to see the blast to the past stuff.

1308
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:53,580
Thumper's Easter.

1309
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:55,580
You mentioned this before we started recording.

1310
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:56,580
What was Thumper's Easter?

1311
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:58,580
It was like an Easter egg hunt.

1312
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:04,580
And, you know, the Easter bunny was there and it was very lightly themed.

1313
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:06,580
It wasn't like all over the park.

1314
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:08,580
Though I think maybe the Easter egg hunt.

1315
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:12,580
Well, like there was a real physical Easter egg hunt and then a sticker thing.

1316
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:14,580
Is there footage?

1317
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:17,580
I believe that only happened once.

1318
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:19,580
Okay.

1319
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:28,580
And then the other limited time events that I remember going to, which was the only one that I was very disappointed in, was the Disney afternoon.

1320
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:30,580
Oh, really?

1321
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:31,580
Oh, I loved it.

1322
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:33,580
Maybe I was just the right age.

1323
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,580
I would like whatever they gave me.

1324
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:39,580
But at the tip, those ride overlays and inflatable stuff.

1325
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:40,580
I like that balloon.

1326
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:50,580
I like those big, it had such a, I mean, my love of like, you know, 80s purples and teals is very influenced by those big inflatable tubes that ran through the small world.

1327
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:56,580
I did love the ride overlays, like the boat overlay with the gummy bears I loved.

1328
01:09:56,580 --> 01:10:04,580
But I just remember hearing that they were building Duckburg and I would be able to go to Duckburg.

1329
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:10,580
And when I got there, seeing Duckburg and just being so disappointed.

1330
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:11,580
Yeah.

1331
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:12,580
That wasn't very good.

1332
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:13,580
That was like flats.

1333
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:16,580
Yeah, if you're, I see what you're saying.

1334
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:17,580
You know what?

1335
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:23,580
I was, like the slight age differences make it such that I was not, DuckTales was not my show.

1336
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:32,580
Like the, it's so, the micro micro, like because what it was DuckTales and then Chip and Dale and then Darkwing, like those are so much more my show.

1337
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:38,580
So maybe I wasn't as offended by the lack of inaccurate depiction of Duckburg.

1338
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:42,580
But if DuckTales is your molten core, that makes sense.

1339
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:48,580
I wonder if this is a syndication thing because I watched hours of DuckTales.

1340
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:49,580
And we're like.

1341
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:50,580
I did too.

1342
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,580
I just don't, it wasn't like mine.

1343
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:54,580
Oh, well wasn't your, yeah, yeah.

1344
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:56,580
The other ones did come later.

1345
01:10:56,580 --> 01:11:03,580
I'd also seen in like magazines what was going on in Orlando with Mickey's birthday.

1346
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:04,580
Oh yeah.

1347
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:05,580
Oh, Mickey's birthday.

1348
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:06,580
Yeah.

1349
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:08,580
And the DuckTale integration there.

1350
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:09,580
It wasn't as good.

1351
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:10,580
It wasn't that good.

1352
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:12,580
I, but to me, like.

1353
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:13,580
It looked.

1354
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:14,580
Just seeing it in the magazine.

1355
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:16,580
It looked great.

1356
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:21,580
And I was expecting something on that level and I felt like it wasn't even on that level.

1357
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:22,580
It was bigger.

1358
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:23,580
I agree.

1359
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:24,580
It's not.

1360
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:25,580
Yeah.

1361
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:27,580
It was kind of chintzy on the general scale, but bigger.

1362
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:28,580
Yeah.

1363
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:29,580
I remember feeling that way.

1364
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:30,580
Seeing it.

1365
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:34,580
Cause I was like the, the idea that you would go see the money bin obviously was very exciting,

1366
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:36,580
but it was not giant.

1367
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:38,580
It was not yet to the, to the correct scale.

1368
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:43,580
I mean, I felt the same way about birthday land when I would see pictures of Toontown

1369
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:44,580
in Disneyland, which I would.

1370
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:45,580
Gotcha.

1371
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:46,580
And I would be like, oh, well that's amazing.

1372
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:47,580
Oh, this is okay.

1373
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:49,580
Like there's a less good.

1374
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:50,580
It's less.

1375
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:54,580
There was also like some of this limited time stuff.

1376
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:56,580
You would wonder why they didn't just keep it.

1377
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:00,580
Like why not keep the cutouts of the gummy bears in the boat ride?

1378
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:01,580
No, sure.

1379
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:02,580
Yeah.

1380
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:03,580
Why are you.

1381
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:04,580
Yeah.

1382
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:05,580
The boat ride was nothing.

1383
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:06,580
De-theming.

1384
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:07,580
That's a ride.

1385
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:09,580
We've never done an episode about motorboat cruise, right?

1386
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:11,580
That's a dry one, I think.

1387
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:12,580
Oh, that.

1388
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:15,580
I'm so mad I didn't get to ride the dry.

1389
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:16,580
That's so funny.

1390
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:17,580
Mike and I are both like.

1391
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:18,580
Boring motorboat cruise.

1392
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:19,580
Jason's like, I know.

1393
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:22,580
It tears me up we haven't done an episode.

1394
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:24,580
Let alone the gummy bears version.

1395
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:29,580
When we do our stressful pitch meetings of what episodes Jason stands.

1396
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:33,580
Oh, at any time there's one where it's like, oh, that's a little dry.

1397
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:34,580
That's a little boring.

1398
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:36,580
I'm like licking my chops.

1399
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:37,580
So I'm like, let me at it.

1400
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:38,580
Let me.

1401
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,580
I love the motorboats when I was a kid.

1402
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:42,580
It's a parking lot tram.

1403
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:43,580
It's exciting.

1404
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:46,580
Michael, Scott, Scotrick.

1405
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:51,580
I stand today again and say motorboat cruise should be.

1406
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:53,580
Where did you get Scotrick from?

1407
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:54,580
Why did you dress up my name?

1408
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:56,580
That's your official, that's your legal name.

1409
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:59,580
He's found an overhead projector.

1410
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:02,580
At much expense.

1411
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:08,580
Talking about Thumper's Easter.

1412
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:11,580
I don't know out here on the West Coast.

1413
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:14,580
I mean, I'm assuming it aired everywhere, but I remember growing up.

1414
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:17,580
The Disney Easter parade.

1415
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:22,580
Special was as big as the Disney Christmas parade.

1416
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:29,580
And so we would have to tape it before we went to church or like catch it.

1417
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:32,580
Before we left or whatever.

1418
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:37,580
But and I don't know when that went away, but they would do the full.

1419
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:42,580
You know, parade with the top hats and you know, the Hello Dolly stuff.

1420
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:43,580
Yeah.

1421
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:46,580
So many.

1422
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:48,580
There wasn't room on Main Street.

1423
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:51,580
All of it was filled with wide petticoats.

1424
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:57,580
Speaking of the Christmas parade, the Christmas stuff was the one thing I never saw.

1425
01:13:57,580 --> 01:14:02,580
Because as a local, like you stayed away from Disneyland during the holidays.

1426
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:10,580
So like I don't remember going to Disneyland and seeing Christmas stuff until I was like a teenager.

1427
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:11,580
Right.

1428
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:12,580
Wow.

1429
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:14,580
And then like, yeah, they didn't do Halloween on the level they do now.

1430
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:16,580
They didn't do Halloween at all.

1431
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:20,580
Like I think this was I think the state fair was kind of during that around that time.

1432
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:21,580
Yeah, maybe.

1433
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:24,580
I wonder when they first tried like they first did like a pump Mickey pumpkin.

1434
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:30,580
Like I don't remember any sort of Halloween stuff at the parks growing up.

1435
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:35,580
The first time I remember like you would go to Knott's Berry Farm for Halloween.

1436
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:36,580
Right.

1437
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:37,580
That was the thing.

1438
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:38,580
Wow.

1439
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:39,580
And then I remember.

1440
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:40,580
The creator of the haunt.

1441
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:46,580
When Horror Nights started at Universal and like Penn and Teller being there.

1442
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:48,580
Oh, wow.

1443
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:52,580
And also as a scared kid, like I didn't want to go to any Halloween stuff.

1444
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:53,580
Yeah, yeah, right.

1445
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:56,580
And the Disney version was a little too intense.

1446
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:57,580
Yes.

1447
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:58,580
Can I play a little bit?

1448
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:01,580
I just want to zoom through this actual parade, the state fair parade.

1449
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,580
Yeah.

1450
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:10,580
Just get a get a sense of the song and then get a sense of some of these characters I've never seen before and have not seen since.

1451
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:12,580
I assume you guys saw a little of this.

1452
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:13,580
Oh, yeah.

1453
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:17,580
But this is just a little bit of like the music you would hear.

1454
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:40,580
And like this is yeah, this is from 1988.

1455
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:43,580
Appetite for Destruction came out a year prior.

1456
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:49,580
I always like to think about kids are like into Guns N' Roses, but they're going to see this in 1988.

1457
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:50,580
State Fair.

1458
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:51,580
State Fair.

1459
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:55,580
And then maybe you have a song from Meet Me in St. Louis.

1460
01:15:55,580 --> 01:16:05,580
But yeah, a bunch of like straw hats and like, I don't know how you would describe it, like Bert from like Mary Poppins style jackets, green blues.

1461
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:07,580
The white suits.

1462
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:08,580
Yeah.

1463
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:11,580
And just this was a huge parade.

1464
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:12,580
Huge.

1465
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:15,580
There are so many floats and people and performers.

1466
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:21,580
And just like a couple of weeks before this, they would have been playing like fifties television characters in The Blast of the Past.

1467
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:24,580
Greasers were just they traded their greaser outfit.

1468
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:25,580
They went back.

1469
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:28,580
They went 50 years before The Blast of the Past.

1470
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:34,580
And then a couple of months before that, they would have been like lion tamers or whatever in the circus parade.

1471
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:35,580
Right.

1472
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:36,580
It's wild.

1473
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:37,580
Show your chops.

1474
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:45,580
And it's not like anything is so like crazy impressive expensive, but it's like just a tractor coming down Main Street.

1475
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:56,580
And there are weird scarecrow guys and weird crows and they don't look like Disney characters that I've seen before.

1476
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:58,580
They got all those.

1477
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:04,580
I was just saying they look like they look vaguely like the scarecrow from Return to Oz.

1478
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:05,580
Yeah, vaguely.

1479
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:06,580
But they don't think they had.

1480
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:08,580
Did they have Return to Oz ever in the parks?

1481
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:09,580
No, I don't think so.

1482
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:10,580
I don't think so.

1483
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:11,580
I don't think so.

1484
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:15,580
But I'm just like, oh, these suits seem like they might have been created for this.

1485
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:18,580
Well, then you got a whole original lineup of characters.

1486
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:19,580
You got the vegetables.

1487
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:20,580
Well, right.

1488
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:21,580
Yes.

1489
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:22,580
And that comes after this.

1490
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:25,580
So you see these scary scarecrow type characters.

1491
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:27,580
And I don't know if you saw these, Scott.

1492
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:32,580
These these are very much like Raggedy Ann, Raggedy Andy style performances.

1493
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:37,580
And they're dancing with crows that are also human size.

1494
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:38,580
Right.

1495
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:41,580
The scarecrow and the crows are getting along.

1496
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:42,580
Right.

1497
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:43,580
And then coming up behind.

1498
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:44,580
So this is like a tractor.

1499
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:45,580
I hate these crows.

1500
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:46,580
Oh my God.

1501
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:47,580
They're giant gaping mouths.

1502
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:48,580
Yeah.

1503
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:49,580
And now here come the vegetables.

1504
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:55,580
There's a giant anthropomorphic carrot, tomato, broccoli with these big nose like floppy.

1505
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:56,580
The broccoli boys.

1506
01:17:56,580 --> 01:18:04,580
Big floppy noses that look like they're inflatable noses that are just bouncing up and down.

1507
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:08,580
And have you seen these characters ever in your life at Disneyland?

1508
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:09,580
Where did these suits come from?

1509
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:10,580
Did they?

1510
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:11,580
I don't know.

1511
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:17,580
Like the corn has like overalls to act like it's his whatever is what do you call the

1512
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:18,580
outside of a corn husk.

1513
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:19,580
Thank you.

1514
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:22,580
And boy, it's just that's weird.

1515
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:26,580
And then here come like Chip and Dale and aprons.

1516
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:31,580
Like all of the costume characters like that had like different versions for each of these

1517
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:32,580
events.

1518
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:33,580
Right.

1519
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:35,580
And then it's into it like 12 minute parade.

1520
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:38,580
There's so much stuff they packed in here.

1521
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:43,580
I don't mind the the broccoli boys and the vegetables.

1522
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:46,580
I could say I could stand the vegetables hanging around.

1523
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:47,580
Sure.

1524
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:48,580
I'm not mad.

1525
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:49,580
I'm I would be interested to see all of them.

1526
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:50,580
I just wondered.

1527
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:51,580
Hey, I think the tomatoes look cute.

1528
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:52,580
Yeah, I agree.

1529
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:53,580
Beautiful eyelashes.

1530
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:56,580
Well, I mean, it looks beautiful.

1531
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:57,580
Yeah.

1532
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:58,580
A little sexy.

1533
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:01,580
If you really want to be honest, you feel free.

1534
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:02,580
I was complimenting.

1535
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:06,580
Well, I'm just you know, like I'm talking about like, you know, weird tomato porn stuff.

1536
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:08,580
That's what I'm thinking automatically.

1537
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:09,580
I don't know, Jason.

1538
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:10,580
Is there a tomato?

1539
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:11,580
You're being weird.

1540
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:12,580
You're a guy.

1541
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:13,580
I'm normal.

1542
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:15,580
I just said that her eyes sparkle.

1543
01:19:15,580 --> 01:19:17,580
Now here you are talking about tomato.

1544
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:18,580
I knew what you meant.

1545
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:19,580
I was reading your signals.

1546
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:20,580
Now the pumpkin.

1547
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:21,580
Hang on.

1548
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:22,580
Now the pumpkin.

1549
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:23,580
I don't.

1550
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:25,580
The pumpkin seems like a real meanie.

1551
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:26,580
Oh, yeah.

1552
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:31,580
This staring must of the pumpkin will foreclose your house on you.

1553
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:38,580
The Disney characters that get featured in this parade, the three little pigs are in there.

1554
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:39,580
Sure.

1555
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:42,580
Clara Kluck, I feel like is hanging out.

1556
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:43,580
She's in a barn.

1557
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:44,580
Yeah, she's in a barn.

1558
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:45,580
In like the top of the barn.

1559
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:46,580
Yeah.

1560
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:51,580
I had to double check that name when I was watching the parade.

1561
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:54,580
I was like, we chicken from old Disney.

1562
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:56,580
OK, Clara Kluck.

1563
01:19:56,580 --> 01:20:02,580
And I believe one website about her referred to her as an old friend of Mickey's.

1564
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:04,580
OK.

1565
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:07,580
So I guess she was in some old shorts with them.

1566
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:09,580
From before I was famous.

1567
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:10,580
I keep her around.

1568
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:11,580
I got to be nice.

1569
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:12,580
The people you came up with.

1570
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:13,580
We had a thing.

1571
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:14,580
We had like a Nicholson Mather.

1572
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:16,580
We dated for a while.

1573
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:17,580
And then we were working together.

1574
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:18,580
We were a comedy duo.

1575
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:25,580
And then we kind of stayed friendly, but we're not as close as we used to be.

1576
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:30,580
And then they just start bringing live animals down Main Street.

1577
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:31,580
Oh, boy.

1578
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:38,580
There are like these big pens or cribs that I think there's a cow and there's maybe a sheep in there.

1579
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:42,580
There's maybe a pig in one of these, but I think there's a cow.

1580
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:43,580
There's these weird.

1581
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:45,580
I don't know how you even describe these.

1582
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:53,580
I guess pens like fancy kind of fancy cages, fancy cages that are being dragged down Main Street with like sleeping and real life animals in them.

1583
01:20:53,580 --> 01:21:01,580
And then like more animals like Dopey is in a car being pulled by a mule, like a real life mule.

1584
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:03,580
Dopey is behind the animal husband.

1585
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:04,580
Right.

1586
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:09,580
And there's there's like a human being like making sure the mule doesn't go out of control and run into the audience.

1587
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:13,580
But then there's a goat just being like pulled down Main Street and horses.

1588
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:20,580
And what what are these ox like oxen like oxen are coming down Main Street.

1589
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:23,580
I didn't make it to the animal part.

1590
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:29,580
These are notoriously cantankerous animals to be surrounded by people.

1591
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:30,580
There's a bunch of them.

1592
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:34,580
And we're six minutes into a 12 minute parade at this point.

1593
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:36,580
So I like I was just like, this is wild.

1594
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:42,580
And this is where Justin tells us that he was attacked by the angry ox spirit.

1595
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:44,580
He had to recover for many years.

1596
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:45,580
And this podcast takes a very serious turn.

1597
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:46,580
Right.

1598
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:48,580
They would let you pet the animals.

1599
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:51,580
Like they were not like close by.

1600
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:52,580
Yeah.

1601
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:53,580
Like they were encouraging it.

1602
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:54,580
Right.

1603
01:21:54,580 --> 01:21:58,580
And then we get to the part where you get an anthropomorphic box of sugar.

1604
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,580
You get like a sugar box.

1605
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:01,580
Weird.

1606
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:04,580
And then like I think this is a milk bottle with eyes walking down.

1607
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:06,580
I completely missed all this.

1608
01:22:06,580 --> 01:22:07,580
Who are these characters?

1609
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:08,580
Where do they get all these?

1610
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:10,580
These are the elements of the pie.

1611
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:11,580
Right.

1612
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:13,580
These are the pie ingredients walking down Main Street.

1613
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:14,580
What's that one?

1614
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:15,580
What's the bottle?

1615
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:16,580
Vanilla.

1616
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:17,580
Vanilla extract.

1617
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:21,580
A bottle of vanilla extract with a big bow and gloves.

1618
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:24,580
Now this, Jason, you have to admit, turns you on a little bit.

1619
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:26,580
This feels like Jason's vibe, yes.

1620
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:28,580
This is for all fair.

1621
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:30,580
This is for private times.

1622
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:31,580
This is just wild.

1623
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:35,580
We're seven minutes in now and we have the ingredients for pies walking down Main Street.

1624
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:38,580
Well, Jason doesn't want to hook up with any of them.

1625
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:41,580
He wants them to all get in a big pile.

1626
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:46,580
Because when these guys get in a polycule, the baby they make is a pie.

1627
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:48,580
A polycule.

1628
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:52,580
Polycule of, that's what you refer to in baking.

1629
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:54,580
It's a molecule of ingredients.

1630
01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:57,580
Makes a delicious pie.

1631
01:22:57,580 --> 01:23:02,580
Jason's starting his own polycule that's all anthropomorphic pie ingredients.

1632
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:04,580
Makes a lot of sense.

1633
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:07,580
So yeah, okay, so yeah, we're going down and there's...

1634
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:09,580
Is there a butter stick?

1635
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:10,580
I don't, hold on.

1636
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:12,580
This is, I don't know who that one was.

1637
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:14,580
Who ran by.

1638
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:15,580
He looked mischievous though.

1639
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:18,580
There's a little, like in the Itchy and Scratchy parade where there's a little cute axe.

1640
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:20,580
That's what that looked like.

1641
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:21,580
Yeah.

1642
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:22,580
It's one like scurrying behind.

1643
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:24,580
There's flour, that's milk, that's vanilla.

1644
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:27,580
And then what, is this salt or sugar?

1645
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:28,580
Like the sugar was over here.

1646
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:30,580
It's too far away and it's overexposed.

1647
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:31,580
I don't know.

1648
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:33,580
Yeah, that looks like a sugar bowl.

1649
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:35,580
Maybe a dish of some kind, yeah.

1650
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:38,580
So I don't, I'm just, yeah.

1651
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:43,580
Yeah, and then there's a country bear representation here in like big floats.

1652
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:49,580
And then I'm trying to see if there's any other real, like Donald shows up and I don't know.

1653
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:50,580
This is wild.

1654
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:55,580
And then like full like marching band style, like performers are coming down with and they perform with,

1655
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:57,580
I don't know what you would call this.

1656
01:23:57,580 --> 01:23:59,580
People that perform with sticks in a marching band.

1657
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:01,580
What do you call those performers?

1658
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:03,580
Yeah, they got those marching sticks.

1659
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,580
Then there's flag performers.

1660
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:09,580
I like, this is more ambitious than any parade, even like Paint the Night.

1661
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:13,580
Paint the Night has like, I feel like 10 performers in it and impressive floats.

1662
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:15,580
This has like 200 performers.

1663
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:18,580
And like that's a big reason why these events felt special.

1664
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:22,580
Like all the performers, like it was kind of overwhelming.

1665
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:23,580
Wow.

1666
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:24,580
So like, yeah.

1667
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:26,580
I didn't know the grandeur of this.

1668
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:29,580
I had always heard they did a state fair thing in the end.

1669
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:31,580
Yeah, I didn't know the scale.

1670
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:34,580
We've only briefly mentioned the peak races.

1671
01:24:34,580 --> 01:24:35,580
We got to get there.

1672
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:37,580
Yeah, that is the main event.

1673
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:38,580
I mean, we can get there.

1674
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:39,580
Believe me, we can get there.

1675
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:48,580
We can do that right now because yes, back in Big Thunder Ranch, they were having an event called Pig Mania.

1676
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:53,580
When I told my mom that I was coming on the show to talk about the state fair,

1677
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:55,580
she immediately said, oh, the pig races.

1678
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:58,580
I loved the pig races.

1679
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:01,580
Like my family loved the pig races.

1680
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:05,580
And it was another thing that I remember openly wondering like,

1681
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:08,580
why is this not just here all the time?

1682
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:11,580
Because there was nothing else going on back there.

1683
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:13,580
This is before the barbecue restaurant.

1684
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:15,580
Right, Big Thunder, whatever it was called.

1685
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:16,580
Before whatever is there now.

1686
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:17,580
What's that thing called?

1687
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:18,580
I don't remember.

1688
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:19,580
Galaxy's Edge?

1689
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:20,580
Something like that.

1690
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:21,580
Something like that.

1691
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:22,580
Were the goats back there?

1692
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:24,580
The goats were back there.

1693
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:27,580
This is the first time I ever remember going back there.

1694
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:29,580
It was for the pig races.

1695
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:32,580
It's possible to know you didn't go to this.

1696
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:37,580
If you're a kid and you don't go on Big Thunder, maybe you don't go back to that part of the park at all.

1697
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:38,580
Exactly.

1698
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:42,580
Yeah, because we would do Fantasyland and then Skyway over to Tomorrowland.

1699
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:44,580
So I don't know if I ever went back there.

1700
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:47,580
The pigs lured you to this zone.

1701
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:50,580
Four pigs at a time, seemingly.

1702
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:52,580
Yes, four pigs at a time.

1703
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:55,580
And then they would do like a hee haw type show.

1704
01:25:55,580 --> 01:26:04,580
Yeah, it was another big production show where you had another emcee just like at the Lumberjack show and you had another full band.

1705
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:08,580
And they were doing bits and they were also doing crowd work.

1706
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:11,580
Are you going to make us do a second gate about hee haw?

1707
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:14,580
Justin's the expert on hee haw.

1708
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:15,580
Oh, really?

1709
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:16,580
He loves hee haw.

1710
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:19,580
He can't after the show.

1711
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:20,580
Yeah, we'll do it.

1712
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:21,580
Talk about that.

1713
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:23,580
That just seems like a Mike campaign of the future.

1714
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:25,580
I love Hillbilly Nonsense.

1715
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:28,580
I love it more every year.

1716
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:30,580
I love it more every year.

1717
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:33,580
You love Hillbilly Nonsense more every year?

1718
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:35,580
This is an effect I knew about you.

1719
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:37,580
When I was a kid, I was very much only space.

1720
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:38,580
I didn't like the past.

1721
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:40,580
I was not interested in the past in any way.

1722
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:43,580
I didn't care about that type of thing like fiddles or banjos.

1723
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:47,580
I was already a huge Country Bear fan at this point.

1724
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:50,580
Country Bears was my favorite attraction at the park.

1725
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,580
He's a longtime Hillbilly Nonsense fan.

1726
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:54,580
Oh, yeah, from way back.

1727
01:26:54,580 --> 01:27:00,580
So this was like a live version of the Country Bears, which was great.

1728
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:06,580
So yeah, in the last decade, I'm much more into this genre.

1729
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:08,580
It's the little Jimmy Dick.

1730
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:12,580
We talk about the old time country music I'm into after In the Wake of Bob Wills,

1731
01:27:12,580 --> 01:27:13,580
little Jimmy Dickens.

1732
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:21,580
This is definitely another episode, but several times I went to the Country Music Awards at Universal.

1733
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:22,580
They did it at the amphitheater?

1734
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:25,580
Well, they would do the awards in the amphitheater,

1735
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:29,580
but then they would sprinkle the acts throughout the park.

1736
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:33,580
So it would be like live from Jaws, Brooks and Dunn.

1737
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:34,580
I didn't know that.

1738
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:37,580
And then they would do their song and out would come Jaws.

1739
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:39,580
In the performance, really?

1740
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:40,580
It was wild.

1741
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:41,580
Whoa.

1742
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:42,580
Wow, yeah, we got to do that.

1743
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:46,580
I mean, I meant to bring it up earlier, but your father had a hit song in the 70s.

1744
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:47,580
Yes.

1745
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:48,580
Billy Don't Be a Hero.

1746
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:51,580
If he was here, he would tell you three hit songs.

1747
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:52,580
He would correct you.

1748
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:53,580
Oh, I'm sorry, yeah.

1749
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:54,580
He is not a one-hit wonder.

1750
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:55,580
He would be mad at me.

1751
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:57,580
You're on the flip side of the Buffett thing.

1752
01:27:57,580 --> 01:27:58,580
He was in the top 43 times.

1753
01:27:58,580 --> 01:28:02,580
The 20 songs that all Jimmy Buffett, that all regular people know.

1754
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:05,580
And a sane person would refer to him as a one-hit wonder.

1755
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:07,580
Sure, sure, okay.

1756
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:09,580
Hang on, I'm a three-hit.

1757
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:12,580
But yeah, Bo Donaldson and the Haywoods.

1758
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:13,580
Bo Donaldson and the Haywoods.

1759
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:14,580
The Haywoods, yeah.

1760
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:19,580
So you were around a lot of the old music, not the old time like Jimmy Dickens, but the

1761
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:20,580
old music.

1762
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:24,580
Well, eventually I was because, so my dad had a pop hit in the 70s.

1763
01:28:24,580 --> 01:28:25,580
Right.

1764
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:29,580
And then his band broke up in the early 80s.

1765
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:35,580
Actually, toward the end, he was playing a lot at the Disney parks.

1766
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:36,580
Right.

1767
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:40,580
They were one of the regular bands on both coasts.

1768
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:41,580
Geez, wow.

1769
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:47,580
And I actually, I had been searching for footage of them playing at the parks my whole life.

1770
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:51,580
And finally someone uploaded footage just a couple of months ago.

1771
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:52,580
Really?

1772
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:54,580
Of them playing on the Tomorrowland stage.

1773
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:55,580
Oh, cool.

1774
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:57,580
On the terror of the rising 12th.

1775
01:28:57,580 --> 01:28:58,580
Yeah, exactly.

1776
01:28:58,580 --> 01:28:59,580
Wow, that's cool.

1777
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:04,580
So that was also a thing as a kid is like, since my dad played there all the time, he

1778
01:29:04,580 --> 01:29:08,580
knew about like the behind the scenes of the park.

1779
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:09,580
Wow.

1780
01:29:09,580 --> 01:29:15,580
My dad was always telling me about like the underground corridors and stuff like that

1781
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:16,580
when I was a little kid.

1782
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:18,580
Oh, so it maybe sparked the interest.

1783
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:19,580
Yeah.

1784
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:24,580
And then my mom would also like tell me the history of the park.

1785
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:28,580
Like she would always be like, oh, this is where the flying saucers used to be.

1786
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:30,580
And this is where the House of Tomorrow.

1787
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:34,580
So I was getting both sides, I feel like.

1788
01:29:34,580 --> 01:29:39,580
So really making me like a Disney junkie at a very young age.

1789
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:41,580
Your dad, I feel like I talked to your dad.

1790
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:43,580
Was it about Michael Iceberg?

1791
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:44,580
Yes.

1792
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:46,580
Like the last time I saw him.

1793
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:48,580
The keyboard guy at the Tomorrowland.

1794
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:53,580
My dad said that he was one of the best musicians he's ever seen live.

1795
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:54,580
Wow.

1796
01:29:54,580 --> 01:29:59,580
There was a bar at one of the hotels in Florida that like all of the musicians would hang

1797
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:00,580
out at.

1798
01:30:00,580 --> 01:30:03,580
And my dad would hang out with him.

1799
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:04,580
Wow.

1800
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:05,580
Yeah.

1801
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:06,580
Oh, and Iceberg.

1802
01:30:06,580 --> 01:30:07,580
That's amazing.

1803
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:08,580
Yeah.

1804
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:09,580
He loved him.

1805
01:30:09,580 --> 01:30:10,580
Wow.

1806
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:13,580
It's the guy who would like, and there'd be mirrors on stage so you could watch what

1807
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:14,580
his hands are doing.

1808
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:15,580
Yeah.

1809
01:30:15,580 --> 01:30:16,580
We should do more.

1810
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:19,580
We should go more in depth than this real quick because we just were talking about him

1811
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:20,580
recently.

1812
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:24,580
When your dad would tour, did he tour with Bobby Boris Pickett?

1813
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:25,580
Oh, yeah.

1814
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:27,580
Well, this was not in like.

1815
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:28,580
The Monster Mash guy.

1816
01:30:28,580 --> 01:30:29,580
The Monster Mash guy.

1817
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:36,580
So in the late 80s, early 90s, my dad's band reunited.

1818
01:30:36,580 --> 01:30:38,580
Right.

1819
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:47,580
The morning, LA morning disc jockeys, Mark and Brian, reunited my dad's band.

1820
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:48,580
Wow.

1821
01:30:48,580 --> 01:30:51,580
And I think like 91 or 92.

1822
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:56,580
And once he was back together, he was like, we're hitting the road.

1823
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:57,580
Like we're doing this.

1824
01:30:57,580 --> 01:30:58,580
Wow, he meant it.

1825
01:30:58,580 --> 01:30:59,580
OK.

1826
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:01,580
So he was really into country music at the time.

1827
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:04,580
So he put together a country band.

1828
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:11,580
And because like my mom was really into country dancing, which we would also do.

1829
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:12,580
Like line dancing?

1830
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:13,580
Yes, line dancing.

1831
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:14,580
She taught line dancing.

1832
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:22,580
And actually, we spent so many nights at the Neon Cactus at the Disneyland Hotel doing

1833
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:23,580
line dancing.

1834
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:24,580
Oh, I was worried about that.

1835
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:27,580
So that sign really takes me back if I look at old pictures.

1836
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:29,580
We spent so much time there.

1837
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:30,580
Wow.

1838
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:37,580
Because it was one of the only all age line dance places in Orange County.

1839
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:41,580
So my mom could bring me while she was line dancing.

1840
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:46,580
So it was during that time that my dad started a country band and we'd go to the country

1841
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:47,580
music awards and stuff like that.

1842
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:50,580
This is in Prime Billy Ray.

1843
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:51,580
Prime Billy Ray, my mom.

1844
01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:54,580
Where'd you find any room in the line dancing club?

1845
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:59,580
My mom made me cut my hair into a mullet because of Billy Ray.

1846
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:02,580
Like we were all into this early 90s country stuff.

1847
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:04,580
Oh, you were a mulleted kid.

1848
01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:05,580
Oh my God.

1849
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:12,580
But when that didn't work out, my dad decided to go back playing the hits from the 70s.

1850
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:19,580
So he went on the road in the mid 90s with a bunch of other acts from the 60s and 70s.

1851
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:22,580
And I went with him.

1852
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:27,580
First to just like help out and then I became their road manager at 14.

1853
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:29,580
Oh my gosh.

1854
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:34,580
So I went into like a school work program where I would just take my school work with

1855
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:39,580
me and we were just on the road for my teenage years.

1856
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:44,580
And one of the acts that we were on the road with was Bobby Boris Pickett who did the Monster

1857
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:45,580
Mash.

1858
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:46,580
Wow.

1859
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:50,580
I remember meeting him for the first time in Boston when I was very, very young.

1860
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:59,580
And he was just a very reserved, nice, private man.

1861
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:05,580
I remember we'd all go to like a Cracker Barrel and he would ask for a different booth so

1862
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:08,580
he could just like quietly read his book.

1863
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:09,580
Just like a nice.

1864
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:11,580
Can I not be with them?

1865
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:12,580
Yeah.

1866
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:15,580
Just like did not feel like a showbiz guy at all.

1867
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:21,580
And then he would come out every night just to do the Monster Mash and he would turn it

1868
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:28,580
on and he did all the faces with the voices and he had a lab coat with a fake spider on

1869
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:29,580
it.

1870
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:30,580
Sure.

1871
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:31,580
Yeah.

1872
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:32,580
As you would.

1873
01:33:32,580 --> 01:33:33,580
Well he was reserved.

1874
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:34,580
The horrors he'd seen.

1875
01:33:34,580 --> 01:33:37,580
Dracula's, Frankenstein's, Wolfman, you know.

1876
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:44,580
And Bobby's, my favorite thing about Bobby is that his rate went up the closer it got

1877
01:33:44,580 --> 01:33:45,580
to Halloween.

1878
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:55,580
So he had a set rate from November through August and then September it would start climbing.

1879
01:33:55,580 --> 01:34:00,580
It's like Homer Simpson investing in pumpkins.

1880
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:08,580
And there was a theme park that he had a standing Halloween date at that like booked him out

1881
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:09,580
for like years.

1882
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:10,580
Wow.

1883
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:11,580
I don't remember what the park was.

1884
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:12,580
Permanent contract.

1885
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:13,580
Huh.

1886
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:16,580
Yeah Bobby was a super, super nice dude.

1887
01:34:16,580 --> 01:34:17,580
That's nice.

1888
01:34:17,580 --> 01:34:18,580
What do we do?

1889
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:19,580
Disneyland's got state fair.

1890
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:20,580
How do we compete?

1891
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:22,580
We've got Pickett.

1892
01:34:22,580 --> 01:34:25,580
We've locked in Pickett for 20 years.

1893
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:26,580
It's ironclad.

1894
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:29,580
We have three minutes of entertainment every Halloween.

1895
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:33,580
It's going to bring people out.

1896
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:35,580
No one else can do the voice.

1897
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:38,580
No one can perform this song.

1898
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:40,580
It's an impossible impression.

1899
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:41,580
Impossible.

1900
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:42,580
No one does an impression.

1901
01:34:42,580 --> 01:34:43,580
What's his name?

1902
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:49,580
Well we've got to do more like old time Tomorrowland like rock band stage stuff I feel like.

1903
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:51,580
And if your dad has more stories or anything.

1904
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:52,580
Oh he has a ton of stories.

1905
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:57,580
Also I have mentioned on the show before that you put me on a three way call with your mom

1906
01:34:57,580 --> 01:35:03,580
to talk about Randy Runyon aka Chuckle the Clown because she remembered him from the

1907
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:04,580
old days.

1908
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:05,580
She remembered the show.

1909
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:11,580
Yeah my mom grew up in Hollywood and like spent a lot of time just like being in the

1910
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:15,580
audiences of shows like that.

1911
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:17,580
And your grandfather was a performer.

1912
01:35:17,580 --> 01:35:24,580
Yeah my grandfather was on a variety show called the Western Variety Hour.

1913
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:27,580
The KTLA Western Variety Hour.

1914
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:33,580
And he was around like during the days of like KTLA almost becoming a national network

1915
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:36,580
and stuff like that.

1916
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:43,580
And yeah so my mom like grew up in Hollywood around the entertainment industry and like

1917
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:46,580
went to a lot of those tapings.

1918
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:47,580
Right.

1919
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:48,580
Yeah local kid things.

1920
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:51,580
Yeah it was just like what you did after school.

1921
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:53,580
Sure she knew all the locals.

1922
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:58,580
She knew all the most famous clowns in Los Angeles.

1923
01:35:58,580 --> 01:36:05,580
KTLA almost becoming a national network reminds me of a thing that fascinates me and a lot

1924
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:07,580
of it is lost media at this point.

1925
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:14,580
But the Dumont network one of the first television networks and it's just like it's gone.

1926
01:36:14,580 --> 01:36:18,580
Like all that stuff is like hardly preserved.

1927
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:19,580
It's in every night at home.

1928
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:22,580
Where is Dumont stuff?

1929
01:36:22,580 --> 01:36:25,580
Siri download Dumont Plus.

1930
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:33,580
So let's go back to Pig Mania real quick.

1931
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:37,580
Maybe not real quick maybe long.

1932
01:36:37,580 --> 01:36:43,580
So the character the Barley Boys were the band and the host and some of the performers

1933
01:36:43,580 --> 01:36:48,580
would go on to be Bill Hill and the Hillbillies who played at Disneyland for years.

1934
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:51,580
And then they got fired right before Star Wars land.

1935
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:58,580
Yeah I think this is kind of the lasting thing of from the State Fair is that the band

1936
01:36:58,580 --> 01:37:09,580
that was over with the Lumberjacks they would go on to be the house band at the Neon Armadillo

1937
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:11,580
at Pleasure Island.

1938
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:17,580
Because Eisner saw them performing at the State Fair.

1939
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:19,580
He did a full like that guy.

1940
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:23,580
He was like this is special you got to be performing at one of my hot clubs.

1941
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:30,580
The band at the pig races became Bill Hill and the Hillbillies who played it for years at Disneyland.

1942
01:37:30,580 --> 01:37:34,580
So this was the beginning of that like with more comedy a larger band.

1943
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:39,580
Right and then they were hired I don't know if they're still at Knott's but they were hired by Knott's after that.

1944
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:40,580
Pretty quickly.

1945
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:45,580
Yeah but I don't know what their status is right now if they're still going or not.

1946
01:37:45,580 --> 01:37:49,580
But yes they would have they would do a whole like hee haw-ish routine with jokes.

1947
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:55,580
They would play swan-y but they would play it with they would say it's swine-y instead.

1948
01:37:55,580 --> 01:37:58,580
There would be a lot of pun style pig jokes.

1949
01:37:58,580 --> 01:38:04,580
And much like the movie posters that we would get it eventually at Muppet Vision.

1950
01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:09,580
There were like fake movie and event posters with pigs in them.

1951
01:38:09,580 --> 01:38:19,580
Yeah so like this is a picture of like a Jaws parody with like a warthogs throat and underside like and it says chops instead of jaws.

1952
01:38:19,580 --> 01:38:27,580
And there was like a Rambo parody and like a Frankenstein parody Pigcasso Albert Einstein.

1953
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:31,580
So that was all in the queue to get into the tent where the races were.

1954
01:38:31,580 --> 01:38:34,580
Hambo Rambo.

1955
01:38:34,580 --> 01:38:35,580
I like the phrase Hambo.

1956
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:36,580
Pretty good.

1957
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:39,580
Like this is like Chuck E. Cheese style animal parody stuff.

1958
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:40,580
Huh.

1959
01:38:40,580 --> 01:38:45,580
And there was a big like kind of circus tent where the show would take place.

1960
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:46,580
Yeah.

1961
01:38:46,580 --> 01:38:47,580
And it's interesting.

1962
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:49,580
I'm kind of confused by the geography of it.

1963
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:51,580
I remember the barbecue restaurant.

1964
01:38:51,580 --> 01:38:55,580
But it's pretty much exactly where the barbecue restaurant was.

1965
01:38:55,580 --> 01:38:58,580
So yeah I'm just interested to see what because it feels so big.

1966
01:38:58,580 --> 01:39:02,580
It feels so this feels so much bigger than the area around Big Thunder Ranch.

1967
01:39:02,580 --> 01:39:03,580
My memory of it.

1968
01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:05,580
How does that all fit in there?

1969
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:13,580
Because I know there would be like would open up certain things for events even 10 years ago and Jason and I were going when we were all going a good amount.

1970
01:39:13,580 --> 01:39:14,580
Yeah.

1971
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:16,580
Crazy Kirk and the Hillbillies.

1972
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:17,580
Oh yeah.

1973
01:39:17,580 --> 01:39:21,580
Their new name still seem to be performing regularly at Knott's.

1974
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:22,580
That's good.

1975
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:27,580
Disney held on to that Bill Hill and the Hillbillies trademark with an iron grip.

1976
01:39:27,580 --> 01:39:28,580
Oh yeah.

1977
01:39:28,580 --> 01:39:32,580
They wouldn't let them they wouldn't let them take that name to Knott's.

1978
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:33,580
There's some lawyer.

1979
01:39:33,580 --> 01:39:38,580
Well it's like pro wrestling like oh you can't leave you can't be Teddy outside at WWE.

1980
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:39,580
I know.

1981
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:40,580
But you can be Ted.

1982
01:39:40,580 --> 01:39:41,580
Sure sure.

1983
01:39:41,580 --> 01:39:42,580
It's different.

1984
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:44,580
I just think they should have allowed it.

1985
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:45,580
That's all I'm saying.

1986
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:49,580
But I guess if you want somebody you know you want the option to do the show again.

1987
01:39:49,580 --> 01:39:51,580
It's precious IP.

1988
01:39:51,580 --> 01:39:56,580
But I don't you know what I don't feel like they're going to ever really bring back Full Hillbilly nonsense to Disneyland.

1989
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:57,580
Never say never.

1990
01:39:57,580 --> 01:39:58,580
I feel like it's sort of not a vendetta.

1991
01:39:58,580 --> 01:40:00,580
I have no idea what a vendetta this was for you.

1992
01:40:00,580 --> 01:40:05,580
I don't think I would have ascribed you as being interested in Hillbilly nonsense at all.

1993
01:40:05,580 --> 01:40:06,580
You don't think so?

1994
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:07,580
No.

1995
01:40:07,580 --> 01:40:08,580
I haven't caught this.

1996
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:11,580
Because of the country bears whenever they kind of reignited.

1997
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:12,580
I like country bears kids.

1998
01:40:12,580 --> 01:40:22,580
What's probably happened is that I've put up a wall when you talk about you know who I've been listening to is little whizzy biggins.

1999
01:40:22,580 --> 01:40:26,580
Can I make a face that shows I don't want to hear anymore about little whizzy biggins.

2000
01:40:26,580 --> 01:40:28,580
I know you don't want to hear about it.

2001
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:30,580
He died of cholera on 1990.

2002
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:34,580
It was the first noted case in America in 100 years.

2003
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:39,580
Well Jimmy Little Jimmy Dickens has a song called Hillbilly fever and that it's he talks about how it's going around.

2004
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:42,580
Did you encounter much of this in Illinois.

2005
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:43,580
No.

2006
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:44,580
Oh OK.

2007
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:45,580
I didn't care about it when I was a kid.

2008
01:40:45,580 --> 01:40:47,580
This is all mostly an adult thing.

2009
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:53,580
When you were so when you were a seven year old child you weren't interested in Hillbilly music from the 1910s.

2010
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:54,580
No I was not.

2011
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:55,580
What kind of child is this?

2012
01:40:55,580 --> 01:41:01,580
I just meant more as you got further into the sticks or like the Wisconsin.

2013
01:41:01,580 --> 01:41:06,580
When I would be seven and we'd be driving into the sticks to go to like an old creek.

2014
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:10,580
Look Pennsylvania has some sticks.

2015
01:41:10,580 --> 01:41:12,580
I think maybe I encountered that a little more.

2016
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:22,580
If I had seen pig mania but I think as an eight year old whatever I was when I was younger than that and I went to Disneyland and it's like OK there's a there's pig races over here or star tours.

2017
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:28,580
I have a feeling I would still have been like star tours is awesome and I'm confused by this.

2018
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:30,580
It was a maybe it's too sophisticated.

2019
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:36,580
I was too kind of a dumb little child to understand the sophistication of the Hillbilly humor.

2020
01:41:36,580 --> 01:41:38,580
I'm going to you're putting down your child.

2021
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:40,580
So I was a dumb ass.

2022
01:41:40,580 --> 01:41:44,580
You see now I understand that Hillbilly nonsense is where it's at.

2023
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:46,580
Why go to space when you can roll a log.

2024
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:56,580
You know what if I'm really analyzing myself if I really if I think when I really start to get into country music or the start of it is getting into Wilco in college.

2025
01:41:56,580 --> 01:42:04,580
Alt country early Wilco's considered which is an annoying title alt country and there's a lot of no depression music no depression.

2026
01:42:04,580 --> 01:42:05,580
Yeah. Yeah.

2027
01:42:05,580 --> 01:42:07,580
And Uncle Tupelo Jeff Tweedy's original band.

2028
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:15,580
So that that's maybe a straight line to me listening 20 years later to get into the Wilco eventually leads you to like.

2029
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:17,580
Oh I got Hillbilly fever.

2030
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:18,580
It's right.

2031
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:20,580
Yeah.

2032
01:42:20,580 --> 01:42:22,580
Listening to Bob Wills.

2033
01:42:22,580 --> 01:42:24,580
Now I live in a pig pen.

2034
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:27,580
Something like a song like pecan pie.

2035
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:31,580
Like this is definitely a connection between the two piece of pecan.

2036
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:32,580
Yeah.

2037
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:33,580
But forget the flowers.

2038
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:39,580
I'm being like there's plenty of little like country shuffle type music songs from the early Wilco.

2039
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:56,580
So that leads yet to me listening to like I'm trying to think what the y'all come by little Jimmy Dickens song about everybody coming over having my wife and he got one tooth between us.

2040
01:42:56,580 --> 01:43:03,580
I like the idea of a song about everyone come over now.

2041
01:43:03,580 --> 01:43:04,580
You hear.

2042
01:43:04,580 --> 01:43:06,580
That's all it's about.

2043
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:09,580
And that like that comes back to the country bears.

2044
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:10,580
Yeah.

2045
01:43:10,580 --> 01:43:11,580
I get it.

2046
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:12,580
I understand.

2047
01:43:12,580 --> 01:43:16,580
And you you're a big country bears guys and you're very pro new show from what I remember.

2048
01:43:16,580 --> 01:43:17,580
I think it's great.

2049
01:43:17,580 --> 01:43:18,580
I do.

2050
01:43:18,580 --> 01:43:19,580
I think it's great.

2051
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:31,580
Like it when I was a kid you know the country bear attraction felt like it was always changing because we had the summer overlay and we had the holiday overlay.

2052
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:38,580
So like I don't think it's like necessarily wrong to precedent.

2053
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:39,580
There is precedent.

2054
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:40,580
Sure.

2055
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:41,580
Change.

2056
01:43:41,580 --> 01:43:53,580
The things that bothered me were very very small but they bothered me a lot just like removing the stove top hat from Henry from Henry.

2057
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:54,580
Right.

2058
01:43:54,580 --> 01:43:58,580
Like to me he doesn't look like Henry anymore.

2059
01:43:58,580 --> 01:43:59,580
He's a different jacket.

2060
01:43:59,580 --> 01:44:00,580
Yeah.

2061
01:44:00,580 --> 01:44:01,580
The jacket's fine.

2062
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:02,580
Right.

2063
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:04,580
Like but why lose the hat.

2064
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:06,580
Well because Sammy would be in the stove.

2065
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:07,580
Yes.

2066
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:08,580
That's the whole game.

2067
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:11,580
You can wear a hat and there's not a skunk in it.

2068
01:44:11,580 --> 01:44:13,580
It's still possible.

2069
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:14,580
That bothers me.

2070
01:44:14,580 --> 01:44:17,580
The name change I feel like is a little clunky.

2071
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:18,580
Yeah.

2072
01:44:18,580 --> 01:44:26,580
But the actual show itself like I think like I have the same kind of feeling about that that I have with Tiana's which was.

2073
01:44:26,580 --> 01:44:31,580
Like Splash Mountain was so broken down in a shell of what it was.

2074
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:32,580
Yeah.

2075
01:44:32,580 --> 01:44:33,580
Yeah.

2076
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:36,580
And the last time I went to Country Bears like it felt the same way.

2077
01:44:36,580 --> 01:44:41,580
So like I'd rather see these rides be updated like this.

2078
01:44:41,580 --> 01:44:42,580
Whatever juices it up.

2079
01:44:42,580 --> 01:44:44,580
Then just rot away.

2080
01:44:44,580 --> 01:44:45,580
Yeah yeah.

2081
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:48,580
Can I name the pigs that would take place in the race.

2082
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:49,580
Yes.

2083
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:57,580
First race featured Chop Suey, Pig Oh My Heart, Four Squeal Drive and Pigfoot.

2084
01:44:57,580 --> 01:45:03,580
I like Four Squeal Drive the best I think of all of them name wise.

2085
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:05,580
I think that you're just you're just laughing at all this.

2086
01:45:05,580 --> 01:45:06,580
Second.

2087
01:45:06,580 --> 01:45:07,580
And then it's.

2088
01:45:07,580 --> 01:45:15,580
It was done like medieval times too where it would be like this section is for this pig.

2089
01:45:15,580 --> 01:45:17,580
That section is for that pig.

2090
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:20,580
And then they put the names of the pigs up on a board and.

2091
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:22,580
Would you get anything if your pig won.

2092
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:23,580
Just the pride.

2093
01:45:23,580 --> 01:45:24,580
Sticker.

2094
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:25,580
Oh OK.

2095
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:27,580
So was anyone gambling on these races.

2096
01:45:27,580 --> 01:45:28,580
Oh I'm sure it had.

2097
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:30,580
It had to do it on the slice.

2098
01:45:30,580 --> 01:45:32,580
Because these were real pigs.

2099
01:45:32,580 --> 01:45:34,580
So it wasn't like they could rig.

2100
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:36,580
Yeah I guess we should have clarified.

2101
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:37,580
Yeah these are real pigs.

2102
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:38,580
These are real pigs.

2103
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:39,580
It's not animatronics.

2104
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:40,580
It's not suits.

2105
01:45:40,580 --> 01:45:49,580
They would do a fake out before the final race where they would build up that the final race was happening.

2106
01:45:49,580 --> 01:45:52,580
And then instead of the real pigs coming out.

2107
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:53,580
Right.

2108
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:58,580
The three little pigs and the outfits would come out and do the race.

2109
01:45:58,580 --> 01:46:01,580
Sometimes chased by the big bad wolf.

2110
01:46:01,580 --> 01:46:02,580
Yeah.

2111
01:46:02,580 --> 01:46:03,580
And then they would do the final race.

2112
01:46:03,580 --> 01:46:04,580
Right.

2113
01:46:04,580 --> 01:46:05,580
So the way.

2114
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:06,580
Well first of all let me go back.

2115
01:46:06,580 --> 01:46:09,580
Second race was boar Winkle Piggy Sue Pig Pig.

2116
01:46:09,580 --> 01:46:12,580
And the curl next door.

2117
01:46:12,580 --> 01:46:14,580
Which I guess the curl is the tail.

2118
01:46:14,580 --> 01:46:15,580
I suppose that's the joke there.

2119
01:46:15,580 --> 01:46:18,580
And then third race features three little pigs.

2120
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:19,580
The old limb pigs.

2121
01:46:19,580 --> 01:46:20,580
Nineteen ninety eight.

2122
01:46:20,580 --> 01:46:27,580
And this is followed by a race of four very hefty black pot belly pigs who fall and crash into each other a great deal.

2123
01:46:27,580 --> 01:46:33,580
The show ends with the band and the three pigs singing and marching into a rousing version of the Battle Hymn of the Republic.

2124
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:36,580
With new lyrics about pigs.

2125
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:39,580
Well now that they need in Galaxy's Edge.

2126
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:40,580
We need some.

2127
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:41,580
The Battle Hymn of the Republic.

2128
01:46:41,580 --> 01:46:44,580
Yeah we need to see all the characters singing that.

2129
01:46:44,580 --> 01:46:49,580
And yeah this is like a 20 I think 20 minute show that you would get.

2130
01:46:49,580 --> 01:46:51,580
And it had like a full set.

2131
01:46:51,580 --> 01:46:54,580
Did you see that you watched the videos and everything or saw a picture of it.

2132
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:56,580
I didn't watch the full pig race video.

2133
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:57,580
No I'm not asking for the full.

2134
01:46:57,580 --> 01:46:58,580
I'm just saying you saw the set.

2135
01:46:58,580 --> 01:46:59,580
I know that they had this.

2136
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:02,580
They had a little set here.

2137
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:07,580
And yeah so I was I was trying to figure out I think I would have liked.

2138
01:47:07,580 --> 01:47:14,580
This may be blasphemous to say after I was talking about hillbilly music but I think I might have even liked the parade better than the pig races.

2139
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:16,580
But I wasn't there I wasn't feeling the thrill.

2140
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:18,580
Yeah you weren't feeling the thrill.

2141
01:47:18,580 --> 01:47:21,580
Of the live pigs racing.

2142
01:47:21,580 --> 01:47:24,580
And it was a mixture of everything like it was the atmosphere.

2143
01:47:24,580 --> 01:47:26,580
It was the excitement.

2144
01:47:27,580 --> 01:47:31,580
You got to meet the pigs after.

2145
01:47:31,580 --> 01:47:37,580
Yeah I remember just absolutely loving this as a kid and everyone in my family loving it as well.

2146
01:47:37,580 --> 01:47:42,580
And being very excited that it was coming back the next year.

2147
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:47,580
I believe these are the lyrics to their new version of Battle Hymn of the Republic.

2148
01:47:48,580 --> 01:47:50,580
Suey Suey hallelujah.

2149
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:52,580
No one loves you like we do.

2150
01:47:52,580 --> 01:47:55,580
We raise our banner and salute thee.

2151
01:47:55,580 --> 01:47:56,580
Our pigs go racing on.

2152
01:47:56,580 --> 01:47:58,580
Our pigs go racing on.

2153
01:47:58,580 --> 01:47:59,580
Suey.

2154
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:02,580
So you would all do a sing along at the end there.

2155
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:05,580
Yep they would bring that banner out and you would read the lyrics.

2156
01:48:05,580 --> 01:48:11,580
Is that disrespectful to the United States of America to rewrite the lyrics.

2157
01:48:11,580 --> 01:48:15,580
I feel like somebody I made like a parody of the Pledge of Allegiance one.

2158
01:48:15,580 --> 01:48:19,580
Some adult told me that that was like a very disrespectful thing to do.

2159
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:21,580
And does that extend to all the different.

2160
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:23,580
I pledge allegiance to the fart.

2161
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:25,580
Yeah right.

2162
01:48:25,580 --> 01:48:29,580
And like does that extend to all the different sort of America songs like this.

2163
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:30,580
I don't know.

2164
01:48:30,580 --> 01:48:35,580
It feels like Walt wouldn't have liked it if it was and I don't know they would have disrespected his legacy.

2165
01:48:35,580 --> 01:48:38,580
The whole thing was a salute to America at the end of the day.

2166
01:48:38,580 --> 01:48:39,580
Well of course yes.

2167
01:48:39,580 --> 01:48:42,580
But yeah so I guess they approved it.

2168
01:48:42,580 --> 01:48:45,580
They approved it with Ronald Reagan and I'm sure he signed off on it.

2169
01:48:45,580 --> 01:48:48,580
Ultimately it's his country at that time.

2170
01:48:48,580 --> 01:48:50,580
I mean his mind was gone.

2171
01:48:50,580 --> 01:48:52,580
Nancy was running the country.

2172
01:48:52,580 --> 01:48:53,580
Sure yeah.

2173
01:48:53,580 --> 01:49:00,580
But yeah I just I don't know there's probably stuff we're even forgetting or leaving out here.

2174
01:49:00,580 --> 01:49:07,580
But I just I feel like I'm so worried that you're going to find more pig names more lyrics to these songs.

2175
01:49:07,580 --> 01:49:10,580
Around every turn I'm like what's left.

2176
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:11,580
They changed.

2177
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:13,580
They probably changed the names yeah.

2178
01:49:13,580 --> 01:49:15,580
No I don't have anything really.

2179
01:49:15,580 --> 01:49:20,580
I mean I was just looking through like there was a like a blimp that had state fair on it.

2180
01:49:20,580 --> 01:49:23,580
I don't know if this was just for an ad or if this would do you remember.

2181
01:49:23,580 --> 01:49:26,580
Watch out for that's going to hit those Space Mountain spires.

2182
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:27,580
It did not. As far as I know there was not.

2183
01:49:27,580 --> 01:49:30,580
And it scanned which will cause it to pop.

2184
01:49:30,580 --> 01:49:31,580
Oh.

2185
01:49:31,580 --> 01:49:33,580
And remember not everybody likes pop stuff.

2186
01:49:33,580 --> 01:49:35,580
No but some people really like pop stuff.

2187
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:36,580
Really into the pops.

2188
01:49:36,580 --> 01:49:45,580
So yeah this is just one where I just I again I get sad I get upset that we'll never get some dumb thing like this on this scale ever again.

2189
01:49:45,580 --> 01:49:48,580
The things that cause your depression on this show.

2190
01:49:48,580 --> 01:49:49,580
Yeah.

2191
01:49:49,580 --> 01:49:51,580
I don't get to go see Quacky Town.

2192
01:49:51,580 --> 01:49:56,580
There's a there's a parade with three big Donald butts walking around and I don't get to go.

2193
01:49:56,580 --> 01:49:59,580
Pixar Fest.

2194
01:49:59,580 --> 01:50:04,580
If I had to choose between Donald's Quacky Duck City or State Fair I would want them to bring back State Fair.

2195
01:50:04,580 --> 01:50:05,580
Hands down.

2196
01:50:05,580 --> 01:50:10,580
And I liked a lot of obviously I really liked a lot of the Quacky Duck City stuff.

2197
01:50:10,580 --> 01:50:18,580
But the idea that you would have so much new dumb stuff to see at Disneyland is would be very exciting to me.

2198
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:19,580
I don't know.

2199
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:21,580
I guess we should end the episode.

2200
01:50:21,580 --> 01:50:22,580
Should we just stop recording.

2201
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:29,580
I am finding I am finding that your enthusiasm for this is oddly high.

2202
01:50:29,580 --> 01:50:31,580
I think you're waiting for us I think to go.

2203
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:32,580
Hell yeah.

2204
01:50:32,580 --> 01:50:35,580
I'm not expecting you to do that.

2205
01:50:35,580 --> 01:50:36,580
I'm expecting this guy over here.

2206
01:50:36,580 --> 01:50:37,580
He's not backing me up.

2207
01:50:37,580 --> 01:50:39,580
I've known him for over a decade.

2208
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:40,580
He's not backing me up.

2209
01:50:40,580 --> 01:50:42,580
I know I'm into it.

2210
01:50:42,580 --> 01:50:45,580
I'm just quietly pleased I guess.

2211
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:48,580
Are you thinking about balloon stuff.

2212
01:50:48,580 --> 01:50:52,580
No I'm thinking about turn of the century set musical.

2213
01:50:52,580 --> 01:50:54,580
I'm thinking about the music man and L.O.

2214
01:50:55,580 --> 01:51:01,580
Oh that's why we said the names of the songs two hours ago and now they're just spinning in his head.

2215
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:05,580
I'm thinking about chili pots and pies.

2216
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:10,580
He's thinking about chili pots and pies and a poly-cule of anthropomorphic ingredients.

2217
01:51:10,580 --> 01:51:14,580
What is a recipe but a poly-cule.

2218
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:15,580
Perfect.

2219
01:51:15,580 --> 01:51:18,580
In perfect tune.

2220
01:51:18,580 --> 01:51:19,580
Yes I do really.

2221
01:51:19,580 --> 01:51:24,580
In the way that you thought I was going to be into blast to the past I'm into this.

2222
01:51:24,580 --> 01:51:25,580
Yes.

2223
01:51:25,580 --> 01:51:26,580
Wow.

2224
01:51:26,580 --> 01:51:27,580
The true.

2225
01:51:27,580 --> 01:51:28,580
It's not.

2226
01:51:28,580 --> 01:51:35,580
You would rather you'd forego your beloved rock and roll in favor of hillbilly nonsense.

2227
01:51:35,580 --> 01:51:37,580
I guess we just learned a lot about you here.

2228
01:51:37,580 --> 01:51:42,580
You would have loved the Western stunt show at Universal on the upper lot.

2229
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:43,580
Oh yeah yeah I've seen some.

2230
01:51:43,580 --> 01:51:44,580
Yeah I've watched some of that.

2231
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:45,580
Yeah.

2232
01:51:45,580 --> 01:51:46,580
Yeah that sounds good too.

2233
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:48,580
It's like you put dynamite in your pants and.

2234
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:49,580
Yeah.

2235
01:51:49,580 --> 01:51:50,580
More hillbilly fun.

2236
01:51:50,580 --> 01:51:52,580
It blows your penis off.

2237
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:53,580
Yeah that's funny.

2238
01:51:53,580 --> 01:51:56,580
Live real penises burn off every show.

2239
01:51:56,580 --> 01:52:02,580
I also liked seeing I didn't realize that Disneyland did grocery store promotions.

2240
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:09,580
Like obviously I saw that a lot with Six Flags growing up but I feel like Disney World was not.

2241
01:52:09,580 --> 01:52:14,580
There was Disney World promotions at McDonald's because you had the anniversary.

2242
01:52:14,580 --> 01:52:15,580
Right right.

2243
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:17,580
You had different events and stuff.

2244
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:20,580
But you're excited by the idea that you would go into Albertsons.

2245
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:21,580
Yeah.

2246
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:22,580
Go into Ralph's.

2247
01:52:22,580 --> 01:52:23,580
Spend enough money.

2248
01:52:23,580 --> 01:52:24,580
Get a free coupon.

2249
01:52:24,580 --> 01:52:25,580
Right.

2250
01:52:25,580 --> 01:52:28,580
Coupon is you have to do this to activate the coupon.

2251
01:52:28,580 --> 01:52:29,580
Right.

2252
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:31,580
Which is very much Disneyland now.

2253
01:52:31,580 --> 01:52:32,580
You want steps.

2254
01:52:32,580 --> 01:52:35,580
Well if you buy a ticket you have to make a reservation.

2255
01:52:35,580 --> 01:52:36,580
Of course yeah.

2256
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:37,580
All right.

2257
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:38,580
Well that is.

2258
01:52:38,580 --> 01:52:44,580
Something about now that we're talking about excitement over Disneyland market promotions.

2259
01:52:44,580 --> 01:52:48,580
I think suddenly I'm feeling like I think I'm relating to the way David Sims has been

2260
01:52:48,580 --> 01:52:51,580
feeling at the end of every blank check episode lately.

2261
01:52:51,580 --> 01:52:52,580
I think I'm simsing.

2262
01:52:52,580 --> 01:52:53,580
OK.

2263
01:52:53,580 --> 01:52:54,580
This is a reference not for everyone.

2264
01:52:54,580 --> 01:52:55,580
Sure sure.

2265
01:52:55,580 --> 01:52:58,580
For some listeners it's an overlap of course.

2266
01:52:58,580 --> 01:52:59,580
You know you've heard it.

2267
01:52:59,580 --> 01:53:00,580
You know what I'm saying.

2268
01:53:00,580 --> 01:53:01,580
I know what you're talking about.

2269
01:53:01,580 --> 01:53:02,580
OK.

2270
01:53:02,580 --> 01:53:03,580
With that look I'm calling it.

2271
01:53:03,580 --> 01:53:06,580
Justin Donaldson you survived podcast the ride.

2272
01:53:06,580 --> 01:53:07,580
Thank you.

2273
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:09,580
My current feeling is not withstanding.

2274
01:53:09,580 --> 01:53:12,580
Thank you for bringing us this this topic and all this stuff.

If you're here in L.A. at dynasty typewriter you can see Tournament of Nerds.

2279
01:53:25,580 --> 01:53:29,580
We've been doing the show now for 16 years.

2280
01:53:29,580 --> 01:53:30,580
Wow.

2281
01:53:30,580 --> 01:53:35,580
We did it for 13 years at UCB and now we're at dynasty.

2282
01:53:35,580 --> 01:53:39,580
So come check us out.

2283
01:53:39,580 --> 01:53:49,580
You can watch a web series I wrote and directed for All Elite Wrestling called Johnny Loves

2284
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:50,580
Tyah.

2285
01:53:50,580 --> 01:53:53,580
A new season of that is coming out soon.

2286
01:53:53,580 --> 01:53:56,580
Isn't Hillbilly Nonsense Boy and some of that stuff.

2287
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:57,580
I'm in it yeah.

2288
01:53:57,580 --> 01:53:59,580
I don't know if I'm in season two but I'm in season one.

2289
01:53:59,580 --> 01:54:01,580
We're riding you in there.

2290
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:02,580
OK good.

2291
01:54:02,580 --> 01:54:03,580
Yeah.

2292
01:54:03,580 --> 01:54:04,580
Yeah.

2293
01:54:04,580 --> 01:54:07,580
Mike plays the dog's agent in the show.

2294
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:08,580
Johnny Tyah's dog.

2295
01:54:08,580 --> 01:54:14,580
Oh it's about time we got him taking more bumps.

2296
01:54:14,580 --> 01:54:15,580
Yeah.

2297
01:54:15,580 --> 01:54:16,580
You need me to do.

2298
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:19,580
I claim that it's professional wrestling's first romantic comedy.

2299
01:54:19,580 --> 01:54:23,580
I don't know if that's true but that's what I like to say when I'm on these things.

2300
01:54:23,580 --> 01:54:24,580
Sounds good.

2301
01:54:24,580 --> 01:54:25,580
Yeah.

2302
01:54:25,580 --> 01:54:26,580
It's a good tagline.

2303
01:54:26,580 --> 01:54:27,580
Yeah.

2304
01:54:27,580 --> 01:54:29,580
That's about it for now.

2305
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:30,580
Great.

2306
01:54:30,580 --> 01:54:31,580
Great.

2307
01:54:31,580 --> 01:54:32,580
Well yeah.

2310
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:37,580

2316
01:54:56,580 --> 01:54:58,580
We do demand a little more money for that.

2317
01:54:58,580 --> 01:54:59,580
It's worth it.

2318
01:54:59,580 --> 01:55:03,580
But I realize I just found a button you get when he says my pig won at Disneyland.

2319
01:55:03,580 --> 01:55:06,580
So I'm assuming you got a button that said your pig won.

2320
01:55:06,580 --> 01:55:07,580
Look at that.

2321
01:55:07,580 --> 01:55:08,580
You don't say.

2322
01:55:08,580 --> 01:55:12,580
Now if I hit the red button down there that would stop the recording.

2323
01:55:12,580 --> 01:55:15,580
Can I just reach down and that would just.

2324
01:55:15,580 --> 01:55:18,580
It's actually it says extend the recording an hour.

2325
01:55:18,580 --> 01:55:19,580
It's actually.

2326
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:21,580
Well we gotta talk about this new button.

2327
01:55:21,580 --> 01:55:22,580
You gotta talk about the button.

2328
01:55:22,580 --> 01:55:23,580
I'll just leave.

2329
01:55:23,580 --> 01:55:24,580
You can do it.

2330
01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:34,580
