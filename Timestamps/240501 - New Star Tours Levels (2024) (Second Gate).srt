1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
5, 4, 3, 2, 1

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
May the first be with you!

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's an early...

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
May the fourth...

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
While it should be more like...

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh yeah, much better, yeah.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah, yeah. Star Wars.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Airhorn. Hey, it's an early

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Star Wars

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
day episode because it's

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
more trouble than it's

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
worth to change the release date to

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
actual May the fourth. So here we are

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
now. We're getting it done. Hey, we're unwrapping

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
our life day presents

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
early this year. I'm Scott

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Garen, you're Mike Carlson. Hi. I'm here, yes.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
A life day has come

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
early. Enjoy it.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You know, I'm trying to remember, there's of course

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the Star Wars game

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
where the characters dance.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I've shown you these videos before, I think.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh yeah, I already don't remember the name of it.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I forget what is the name of the game, but it's like

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
instead of... It's from Xbox

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Kinect, right? You would hold the

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
orb connector. And you would

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
dance along. It's like the games just dance,

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
yes. Jason Sheridan providing that

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
information. Ah, yeah. I was also

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
sitting here as we were about to get started.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Well, we could always say May the first

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
be with me. And so, very

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
happy to hear it. Happy season

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
of the Force to you both. Yeah, I mean

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
season of the Force at Disneyland.

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I was thinking that's the thing. No matter

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
when we put it out, the point, you know,

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
as long as it happens within

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
the season of the Force and as long as

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
the season of the spirit is with us.

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Well, it's Pixar and happy Pixar

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Fest season of the Force.

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Oh yes, depending on which you celebrate.

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If your

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
tradition is Pixar Fest, then we

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
honor that. If you're a season of the Force

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and if you're everything or none

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
of the above. We celebrate all of it.

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Well, what would you say you guys are?

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Jason, you're like a devout Pixar

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Fest follower. I mean,

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
yeah. You know,

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I love... You're an orthodox Pixar

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Fest follower. Yeah. And you're a

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
reform season of the Force.

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
More of a reform season of the Force. We're a little

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
looser with what we believe as far

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
as Star Wars is concerned, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We don't accept... Look, I've seen all

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
nine movies. We don't accept all of it

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
had to have happened that way, you know?

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We're a little looser. It's about the

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
message. It's about the message of Star Wars

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
versus actually enjoying maybe all nine

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
episodes of the movie series.

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's all. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No, it's not, you know,

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
you know, the way these things work with

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
the, you know,

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
different authors might have muddied

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
up the text over the years.

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yeah, that's why I'm reformed. But ultimately you

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
go back to what the original

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
mission and thought was. The sacred

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
texts. What it's all about. Which is, of

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
course, tiny little beings in your

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
bloodstream who give you magic

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
powers. Right. That's what it is.

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Ultimately. Ultimately.

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, you gotta wish... You know

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
what? I mean, we've talked about those wills.

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We've talked about that

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
George Lucas's versions of

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Episode 789 would have been about

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
the tiny creatures, the wills who

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
make up... They are the...

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
They're the force? Or they are what...

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Even though I've read

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
a lot about the wills and have spoken at

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
length about the wills, I can't remember...

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You've given several speeches at

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Oxford and... Yeah, yeah.

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Cambridge. Yeah. I can't remember.

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Are the wills part of midichlorians? Are they

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
smaller? Are the wills what make

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
midichlorians and the midichlorians are what make the force?

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Or are those one and the same? I don't know,

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
but I love the wills. Whatever it is, I love them.

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It doesn't matter. The point is that you love them.

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I was gonna say

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
the real failing

104
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
in those not happening is

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
not getting Star

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Tours levels

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
where you go and meet the wills.

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Where you get microscopic.

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Although, if that's what

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
all the movies were gonna be about, you would have been

111
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
microscopic the whole time, I guess.

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It would have been like Toy Story.

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Star Wars. Even tinier.

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
More like

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Bugs Life, but maybe smaller still.

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I don't know.

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But you could have a big

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
bunch of wills, like

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
the minions in the minions ride.

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
They all kind of band together

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and make shapes.

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Form a shared climb onto each other. Yeah.

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Well, that's what's happening, I think.

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Every second

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
in Luke's body

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
is constant

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
like team will chains.

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's really what we

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
these would be movies set entirely

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
in the bloodstream of the characters

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
that we know.

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We'll finally know what was going on

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
in their veins

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and in their arteries.

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And maybe in their private parts, too.

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm for sure in their private parts.

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I think we would have spent a lot of time seeing what the wills

138
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
are up to in Luke's dick.

139
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Something magical.

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Cranking it.

141
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Cranking that lightsaber.

142
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The low lightsaber.

143
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Or maybe not so low.

144
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Well, this isn't Doughboys.

145
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We shouldn't speculate on Luke Skywalker's

146
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
dick size.

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We need to stay away from their territory.

148
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You know, look,

149
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
we're here on May the fourth

150
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
week, once again

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
participating in what is

152
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
definitely the most beloved

153
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
yearly tradition that Podcast

154
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
the Ride does.

155
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We hear about it all the time.

156
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We're lauded for it all the time.

157
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It definitely lands that we do this.

158
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
People definitely do

159
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
notice and remember that

160
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
we do Star Wars episodes

161
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
every year. Frankly, you don't need

162
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
to send the letters anymore, the physical

163
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
letters. We get the point.

164
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You're welcome. You're very

165
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
welcome. And the

166
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
pandemonium that must be happening now that

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
we're doing it again.

168
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And like we said, we were talking about

169
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
knowing what's going on.

170
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
When it comes to 2020 Star

171
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Wars events, we definitely

172
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
know. Yeah, hell

173
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
yes. I definitely understand

174
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
what's happening. Although something

175
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
today, I might

176
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
be back on board. I might have to catch

177
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
up. I don't know if there's enough hours

178
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
in the day to do that because there's

179
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
so much stuff now. There's a lot

180
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
of stuff. So what do you

181
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
refer though? I'm referring

182
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
to the new scene

183
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
with the space

184
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
whales, the Purrgill. Oh, yes.

185
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Well, that's the main course.

186
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That's what we're hearing. So yeah, let's not jump

187
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
too ahead on Purrgill talk.

188
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We'll tease it, tease it, but

189
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
it's pretty exciting. I didn't know all the

190
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
details. Ah, okay.

191
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Now I'm back on board.

192
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This is a fun addition. If you don't know what

193
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
we're talking about for

194
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
this year's season of The Force,

195
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
of course we know it. You know

196
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
in your heart that this is happening and that

197
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
this was done. But for the first

198
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
time in a little bit, although they've been

199
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
pretty regular about these, there has been a new

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
addition of scenes to

201
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
the beloved Star

202
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Tours franchise.

203
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The adventures keep

204
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
continuing for this

205
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
beloved simulator ride.

206
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
They've added scenes based on

207
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
episode 789 and maybe other

208
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
things that I am not remembering.

209
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But this is kind of the block that

210
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
celebrates the

211
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Disney Plus series

212
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
in a bigger way that

213
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
represents Mandalorian

214
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and Andor

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and Ahsoka.

216
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Let's get this right from

217
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
the get-go because I don't watch

218
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
the show or know. Just say Ahsoka.

219
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Jason said her name crazy

220
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
a couple days ago and I can't remember

221
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
how I think so. Ahsoka. Ahsoka.

222
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I forget what you said. I don't know.

223
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Ahsoka Tano? Tano?

224
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Tano? But no, you got,

225
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
we were on a different planet. I don't

226
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
know. Well, it's okay. All I

227
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
know is I would love to get my

228
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
own vehicle so that

229
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I could yell the now

230
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
20 year old movies. I know these

231
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
actors from like, it's

232
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Zorzario Dawson from 25th

233
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Hour. You want your own vehicle

234
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
to yell it? It's the guy from E2 Mama

235
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Tambien. They jerk

236
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
off into the pool.

237
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We stay, we're staying odd here. E2

238
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Mama!

239
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Mama! That had a lot

240
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
of zest to it. Yeah. Well, he's

241
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
excited. Were you saying

242
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
you want your own vehicle, like your own Star Tours

243
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
vehicle to pilot solo?

244
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Well, I don't want to annoy people

245
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
yelling out their other roles.

246
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We did that motorcycle

247
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
movie, I think. It's

248
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
probably not the voice

249
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
but could be of Pedro Pascal

250
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
who I know from many

251
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
fan cams where he is looking

252
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
delish, am I right?

253
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Can't see him here, but

254
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
this is all the stuff we would yell at if we had our own

255
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Star Tours vehicle to ourselves, our own

256
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Starspeeder. You're looking

257
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
delish. I assume

258
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
under there. I think so. If you're part

259
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
of this. And again, I would put my money on

260
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
not. Yeah.

261
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So yeah, these new scenes

262
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
have been added. I'm saying

263
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
the word scene, but in

264
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
the preparation for this, and I don't think we

265
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
know what we're calling this episode yet,

266
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
but in my head,

267
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I've been saying levels.

268
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I've been saying levels for a while.

269
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I was going to ask you guys, is that silly

270
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
to call these Star Tours

271
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
scenes levels?

272
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But then, dinner the other night,

273
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Mike, you said the exact same thing.

274
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You called them levels. I like

275
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
levels. Let's go with levels.

276
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah, I think level. I mean, I

277
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
bet it's not technically called levels.

278
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Don't think so. Don't internally, but

279
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
it feels like levels to me.

280
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's an active term

281
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
when we're in video game territory.

282
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And it especially feels like levels to me

283
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
because they change.

284
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
They can be altered as far as your

285
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
lineup and what you get.

286
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So I think that's partly why.

287
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Well, hang on.

288
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The spy notion in general

289
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
is that if that is a change,

290
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
it's custom to every

291
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
single Star Tours voyage.

292
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yes, so levels. I mean, Millennium Falcon

293
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
for sure you call those levels

294
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
because you are actively playing a game.

295
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I think. Yes.

296
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Those don't change.

297
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
No, never change. Never change.

298
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
OK, when Galaxy's Edge

299
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
opened, there was some talk of

300
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
do they retire

301
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Star Tours, which I'm like,

302
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I still feel the vomit

303
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
gurgling in my throat when I even

304
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
think about this notion.

305
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But you get it. Well, isn't it weird to have

306
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
some straight Star Wars over

307
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
here? No, no, it's not. Why would you

308
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
get rid of this? Right.

309
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Anything that's like this, like

310
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
that in Hong Kong, the

311
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Star Tours simulators became this Iron

312
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Man thing that looks awful.

313
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Thank God they did not start putting that

314
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
into

315
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
replacement of Star Tours.

316
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But if there was any question

317
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
back in 2019 or in the lead

318
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
up, what is the use of Star

319
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Tours now that there's a Galaxy's Edge?

320
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Well, look at this. The proof

321
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
is right in what we're talking about today.

322
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
They're still changing these things out.

323
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And Millennium Falcon, we've been

324
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
dealing with Coaxium. We're at the

325
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
fifth anniversary of Coaxium.

326
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Coaxium turned five. Wow.

327
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Happy five. Going to

328
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Kindergarten or out of Kindergarten already?

329
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Maybe, it depends.

330
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Coaxium's making friends.

331
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Developing interests.

332
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's a whole internal life of Coaxium now.

333
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I just saw, when they

334
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
were teasing the ride, when

335
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
they were previewing it, they

336
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
showed some footage of like, here's

337
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
sample footage. And

338
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
it's all like stuff, it's like

339
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
AT-ATs, like you knock over AT-ATs

340
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
and they're, I think they're restoring

341
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
troopers.

342
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And that is,

343
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
it looked cool. Like it looks

344
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
cooler than Coaxium.

345
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
We probably talked about this before. The idea that

346
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
the Falcon could knock over

347
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
like dominoes a

348
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
ton of AT-ATs. Which is

349
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
very fun. It's very funny.

350
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yes. And

351
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
ultimately nothing that

352
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
silly happens, I don't think.

353
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
There's kind of a silly like thud on the ground.

354
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The thud is the most memorable part of it.

355
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah. Yeah. I think.

356
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm also thrown by the, because I

357
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
was like, this is gonna come up at some point.

358
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And I did, I was watching a video

359
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
discussing, is it AT-ATs or

360
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
AT-ATs? Oh yeah, yeah. And I think

361
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
that before, because listeners have

362
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
been fucking jumping on us

363
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
left and right about pronunciations.

364
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
There's been a lot of that lately.

365
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Let's cut that off.

366
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Maybe this is my comeuppance for

367
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
bringing up any time Jason says

368
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
anything slightly weird. As you did five

369
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
minutes ago. Oh yeah.

370
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Look, I don't know.

371
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I can't be as natural as

372
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Scott talking about the delish fan

373
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
cams, which sounded very

374
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
good, authentic.

375
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah, you have to have watched as many

376
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
fan cams as they have. You said it right before we were recording.

377
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And I'm like, oh, here it goes again about the delish

378
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
fan cams. You guys see anyone?

379
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
This one's like, this one's not as delish.

380
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I mean it is delish. Less delish.

381
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Guys, there's a new Glen Powell.

382
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
There's a new Glen Powell

383
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
fan cam.

384
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Look,

385
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
here and there, but that'll always be the minor

386
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
to the major that is Pedro.

387
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
No, but I think

388
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
what I was finding is that

389
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
AT-ATs or AT-ATs is acceptable.

390
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So let's not...

391
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'll say this. I know

392
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
that you can do both, but

393
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
calling them AT-ATs has always annoyed

394
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
me. But a lot of Star Trek

395
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Jesus, I did this the other day too. Star Wars

396
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
people do that.

397
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So I can't be that mad, because it seems

398
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
like it's pretty, like

399
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
either way. Yeah, yeah.

400
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm looking at the percentages of who...

401
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
how many says, at AT-ATs,

402
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
AT-ATs, and I don't know.

403
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
This is interesting data. It's definitely interesting

404
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
data that I'm looking at. Thank you.

405
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Wait, that's the right one? You said it right.

406
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Hey!

407
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I've made progress. I knew we were headed

408
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
somewhere and then you did it right. Thank you

409
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
so much. That makes me happy.

410
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, wow. Okay, okay. I guess I

411
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
absorbed this lesson then. Yeah, you learned.

412
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Oh, good. Well, I'm happy to have given you a nice

413
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
little... Yeah, that must have been

414
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
a little... I think data has been

415
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
peppoed in your mind.

416
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah, except I... Yeah,

417
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
except corrected. Right, but you really want

418
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
to needle me with the wrong one.

419
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So you're saying the wrong one. So you've

420
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
peppoed data right now.

421
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That's what happened. What I want is the

422
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
other. Exactly. I think

423
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
when you're talking about actual

424
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
data, you can say data

425
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
or data.

426
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I said this. People were like, no. No,

427
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
you can't. No. No, actually

428
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
it's only data, actually.

429
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
This is like a particular...

430
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Have you noticed this? This is like a particular...

431
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I feel like... Bug up the audience's

432
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
butt lately. I would not bring this up otherwise

433
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
that you bring it up, but I've seen you get

434
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
hit a lot lately. I think, yes. That's what I've

435
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
seen. Uh-huh. Yeah. I believe

436
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
there was confusion about entomology

437
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
versus... Oh, oh,

438
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
yeah. Yeah, well, I already don't

439
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
remember. I don't even want to try.

440
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Come on. For God's sake.

441
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
We say... How many thousands of

442
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
words do we... How many millions of words

443
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
do we say a year? Millions, yeah. Some of

444
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
them are wrong. Again, as I say this, I realize

445
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
this is my karmic come up

446
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
for all the years of Jason. I did say...

447
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Oh, well, well, well.

448
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I know why it's happening now. I think

449
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
also you mispronounced

450
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
YouTube rock and roll guys last name

451
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Rick Beato. I think you called him Beato or

452
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
something. You know, how

453
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
in the goddamn world am I supposed

454
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
to know that? Someone please tell

455
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
me why... He says his name. Why

456
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
on earth... You think I watch the

457
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
beginnings? I go straight to

458
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
this is a Mark Maron situation. I skip

459
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
10 minutes in when the interview is

460
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
already in progress. I literally have

461
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
never heard him say his name. Rick...

462
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And also this is the most obscure

463
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
thing. He's very popular.

464
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yes. Yeah, but how

465
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
many of our listeners, how much

466
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
overlap is there with Beato?

467
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And he's a music guy.

468
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Rick Beato. Makes sense to me.

469
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Hey, Beato on the beat.

470
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Maybe people are watching these 90 minute

471
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Butch Vig interviews with

472
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Rick Beato. I do. I

473
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
watch things like this, but I skip

474
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
past the part where he tells me to subscribe

475
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and I don't need to know any

476
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
of that. He does videos where he counts down

477
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
like the 50 best 90s rock and

478
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
roll songs and he just kind of plays like five

479
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
seconds of them and he kind of nods his head like this

480
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
and he goes great song and then he goes like

481
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
great riff and then goes to the next one.

482
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Content. Great. Yeah.

483
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
That's not in

484
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
debate.

485
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Great content.

486
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What's in debate is my right to call him

487
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
the wrong name or to call anyone the wrong

488
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
name. Okay, well going forward we'll see.

489
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Focus on the amount of words that

490
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
we get right. Praise

491
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
God for the right pronunciations.

492
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Not insult him for the wrong.

493
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Oh, they will.

494
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Clearly they will. Love that

495
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
you pronounce the whales or the space

496
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
whale. Pergil.

497
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Well, what do we think?

498
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I've been

499
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
thinking about this. I'm all on

500
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
edge about it now. I think

501
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
it maybe is Pergil. I think it's Pergil.

502
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yeah. Yeah. In my head

503
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
it was like Perjil, but I

504
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
checked to make sure. Yeah.

505
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I watched the episode, but I don't remember

506
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
what they called them. I did

507
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
watch this episode of Ahsoka. And even if we were

508
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
saying it wrong, guess what? This is

509
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
made up. This is pretend.

510
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Somebody made this word up.

511
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Well, you know what? Everybody has their

512
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
own data though. You know what I mean?

513
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Like the data thing that needles me.

514
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's going off a different data set. Some people

515
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
are Pergil. They're upset

516
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
if we're saying it a little bit wrong.

517
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
So I understand.

518
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's also the type, like no offense

519
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
to who's listening here, but the type of audience

520
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
we have.

521
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
There's definitely people that are going to be upset

522
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
about having the wrong word

523
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
or pronunciation.

524
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Yes, in the nerdiest avenues. That's what I mean.

525
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Because obviously it gets my

526
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
dander up when data.

527
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So there's got to be a lot of listeners like me out there

528
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
who are like, Mike, it's Donder.

529
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I think we all know it's Donder.

530
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Cut to genuine comments. I thought it

531
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
was Donder.

532
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Anyway, let's get into it. I do think that Star Tours

533
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
is better than the Millennium Falcone.

534
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You could

535
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
say it like Harrison says in the movies,

536
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Falcon.

537
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
He says Millennium Falcon in the movies,

538
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
and I always say Falcon, but he says Falcon.

539
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
He says it in like it's well, it's because he's

540
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
so cocksure.

541
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I think it's cool that he says

542
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think if I said Falcon,

543
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
it would be a problem forever.

544
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Again, I recognize the hypocrisy.

545
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Jason, I feel like

546
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I owe you an apology, but of course the next time you say

547
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
something like Mama, I'm still going to say

548
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
it. I'm going to jump all over you.

549
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I had to look

550
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
up

551
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
the actor who was Andor

552
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
just now, because

553
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I, you know,

554
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You were at a brain

555
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
fart, perhaps?

556
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Well, I was like, wait, the

557
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
two actors from Ito Mama

558
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Tambien, Diego Luna, and

559
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Jason just sticks with it

560
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
and doesn't adjust. I love it.

561
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Gail Garcia-Vernal.

562
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
They are forever tied in my

563
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
that movie made

564
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
such an impression on me.

565
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
That you'll confuse the two actors sometimes.

566
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I will confuse the two actors careers.

567
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And they are both in the very underrated

568
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Will Ferrell Spanish language

569
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
vehicle Casa de Mi Padre.

570
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Oh, I didn't know that.

571
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I haven't seen it.

572
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That's fun. Check that out.

573
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
His pronunciations of things

574
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I don't know. He studied very hard.

575
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
We don't got coaches

576
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
on this thing. No, we don't have coaches.

577
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Anyway, I love

578
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
both of the wonderful

579
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
actors. Sure.

580
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Terrific stuff. I have not watched Andor

581
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
yet, but it's the Michael

582
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Clayton guy doing a prison break

583
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
TV show. So, like,

584
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I got to get around to that. Like many things,

585
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I've watched half of it.

586
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Watched half the episodes. You know,

587
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
here's the, yeah, here's where

588
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
we're in trouble here because, like,

589
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
okay, everybody

590
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
let's not make a big, just really quickly say how much

591
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm going to go through the rundown of the three shows

592
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
that are represented in this.

593
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Everybody just say how much you've seen.

594
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Mandalorian, almost made it

595
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
to the end of season one. I've done two

596
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
full seasons. There's three seasons

597
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
of Mandalorian, I believe. I've done two

598
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
full seasons of Mandalorian. I did a whole book of

599
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Boba Fett. Forgot that one, yeah.

600
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I did

601
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
half of Andor. Not that it's bad, it's good.

602
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's a much, it's a real

603
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
show. And then

604
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I've done spots, like little spots

605
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
of Ahsoka, including the whale episode.

606
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Nothing on the last two for me, Jason.

607
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
We already said no Andor.

608
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I haven't watched Andor, I haven't watched Ahsoka,

609
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
watched three quarters of the first season of

610
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Andor. That's exactly where I,

611
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
were you in the same boat as me where episode

612
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
one, you were like,

613
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
oh my god, it's everything

614
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
that the movies haven't been

615
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
satisfied, we're back, this

616
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
is pulpy, this is, like,

617
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
it's reinventing, and then like

618
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
four episodes later, you're like, oh no, maybe I'm

619
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
good, I might be fine. Maybe I'm good to go.

620
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm more just like lost

621
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
track, I just kept forgetting about it.

622
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I was just watching other things. I'm

623
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
all caught up on X-Men 97.

624
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm halfway, I'm like three episodes in.

625
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Not halfway, I'm like three.

626
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm shocked by it. I love it, I love that.

627
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Those three episodes are great.

628
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And you know, I was thinking about it a lot,

629
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
like watching these new scenes

630
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
and like this new

631
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
levels, these new Star Tours

632
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
levels, cause I'm like,

633
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I think, I think

634
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
they were expecting,

635
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I would say X-Men 97 is near

636
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
a universal claim, but it's very

637
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
popular, it's very well reviewed.

638
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I think they just thought, like,

639
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
oh, every time we put out a Star

640
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Wars, we will get this organic

641
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
response.

642
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
We will get this, like, praise.

643
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Well, I think there's been

644
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
a hubris, you might call it,

645
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
and a number of these

646
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
giant franchises, when it's like, all of a sudden.

647
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Do they not know the parable

648
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

649
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You would, first of all, they don't know that,

650
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I think. A lot of the people in charge do not

651
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
know that. But yes, that's very important.

652
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So no, I think you're correct.

653
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Oftentimes, you can see where everything,

654
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
all of a sudden there's a break from, like, just,

655
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
oh, I thought everyone just liked the, like,

656
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
if it was called Star Wars, I thought everyone was going to love it.

657
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Like, what happened?

658
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I don't know. Marvel, DC,

659
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
it happened with everything. Yeah.

660
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And I think that everybody was shocked, like,

661
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
oh my god, the gravy train's not going to run forever?

662
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What the fuck?

663
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yeah. And then, of course, they all

664
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
learned their lesson and realized,

665
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
well, perhaps, instead of trying to

666
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
prop up an ailing franchise,

667
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
we should try to find the next

668
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
new Star Wars. No, no, no, no, no.

669
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Shut up. Original voices. Shut up.

670
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Original ideas. Shut up. No.

671
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
No, no, no. Never that.

672
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
No, no, no, never that. Never that. Even though.

673
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You're not wrong, but I'm also

674
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
like, I have not seen any of the

675
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Deadpool movies and I keep seeing the

676
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
new trailers for Deadpool and Wolverine

677
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
and I'm like, I might have to get

678
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
caught up on Deadpool. Like,

679
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I kind of like these trailers. I'm in on

680
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Deadpool, Wolverine. Jack, I'm in on

681
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Jackman. He's back. I like

682
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Jackman that much. You know,

683
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
he's in the yellow outfit. If he's in the right outfit,

684
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm on board. You could

685
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
win me back with the right outfit

686
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
for a character. That is

687
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
how shallow I am. The outfit looks good.

688
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I think it looks good at first. You put down the outfit.

689
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I put down the outfit. There were screenshots

690
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
leaked of him. I didn't like the screenshots.

691
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
We got mic points happening.

692
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
He said, I don't think the yellow outfit

693
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
looks good. I said, I think it does look good.

694
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I think Jackman in the yellow looks good.

695
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I think it looks better. I appreciate that you're

696
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
admitting this. Filmed. Yeah, I think it looks

697
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
better in the trailers. Okay, this is good.

698
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Than the screenshots. I do think

699
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
it looks better. Hey, Jane

700
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
mentioned, speaking of Jackman,

701
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Jackman did Gaston

702
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
in Beauty and the Beast on

703
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Broadway. Oh, he did? Oh, wow, I actually

704
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
didn't know that. Yeah, yeah. He was speaking of yellow

705
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
outfits, or partially. There's some yellow in there.

706
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Yeah, red and yellow.

707
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Scott thinks there's yellow

708
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
in Gaston. Found a

709
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
problem. He thinks he's

710
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Gaston with Lumiere.

711
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Lumiere is a golden

712
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
yellow. That's not

713
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Gaston, it's Lumiere.

714
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Let's make sure we

715
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
talk about these things.

716
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Thank God they do this, though.

717
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
We complain about this all the time.

718
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Toy Story, they did one update.

719
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
They never did an update on Toy Story

720
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
4. The screen rides,

721
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
it just doesn't happen.

722
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
They pump us full of

723
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
promises and leave us on the side

724
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
of the road without water

725
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
or shelter. With Star Tours, they're pretty

726
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
good about it. I would say really good

727
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
in the scheme of things. Maybe

728
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
the best at updating

729
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
rides and giving you a fun little thing.

730
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Not only that, but the

731
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
star power rises.

732
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I don't think that

733
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
they aren't in it

734
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
because they're celebrities, they're in it because they're

735
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
the stars of the franchise. But that was

736
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
never too much of a runner

737
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
of any previous

738
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Star Tours, other than like

739
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Anthony Daniels being part of all of it from the

740
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
beginning. But now

741
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
it's like this Star Wars

742
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
franchise rite of passage that at

743
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
some point the major actors and characters

744
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
end up appearing in the Star

745
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Spear at some point.

746
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
They have such a library now.

747
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
They did Billy D. Williams,

748
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
which is great.

749
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
They should have gotten Harrison

750
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
for a second

751
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
to do it. But if they didn't get him

752
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
for Indiana Jones,

753
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
how are they going to get him? That was a whole controversy.

754
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
When he was doing episode 9, they should have

755
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
tricked him or something. Hey, look over

756
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
here and then read, here's the teleprompter

757
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
and it doesn't matter. As long as you

758
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
got him.

759
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You sure you want that?

760
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Of course I want that.

761
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Yeah, what am I saying?

762
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
The more pissed off.

763
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Yeah, Star Tours.

764
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
You got to get out of here.

765
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
There's purgels coming

766
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
at you.

767
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
What is it called? Watch out for the

768
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
purgels.

769
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
We're hauling raptors or

770
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
whatever. And then they can't, they have to

771
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
cut out and sing. I didn't agree

772
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
to this and then cut out. Yeah, yeah. Just leave it in

773
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
because it needs to be a certain amount for the ride

774
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
to work.

775
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I think they should leave any of that in.

776
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
We're like reading, what is that?

777
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Or you could just say line. Line.

778
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And he does it

779
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
and the only way, like

780
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
the only time they could get with him to do it

781
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
he was on his way to a

782
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Halloween party with Calista. With the bottle

783
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
of wine, yeah. He's dressed like

784
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
the mask.

785
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You think it'll be distracting that Oncelos

786
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
dressed like the mask?

787
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
That's fine.

788
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Look, it's her.

789
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
They got him dressed as Oncelo

790
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
because Calista wanted to do a

791
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
couple's costume.

792
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And we tell people, she's Oncelo

793
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
too. We tell people we're a Han duo.

794
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
That is somewhat one of their costumes.

795
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah. I enjoyed that.

796
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
He likes the costumes. We know. We cracked it on that

797
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
episode, I think.

798
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
He has the nun with the funny

799
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
glasses, like the

800
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
gag store glasses.

801
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Everyone remembers.

802
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Everyone remembers.

803
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Yes, so

804
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I didn't know the degree

805
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
of new stuff

806
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
that was done, even before when I proposed

807
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
doing this.

808
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And in digging in

809
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
if we're being a little

810
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
loose with the tangents, maybe

811
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
it's because

812
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
really it's the

813
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
missions. Really it's the hologram

814
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
transitions in the middle. Because I started

815
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
doing it, I did like a watch through,

816
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
realized that the beginning scenes are essentially

817
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
the same. The one that collected all of

818
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
them still had the

819
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Wookie centric

820
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
first scene, which I love. I love

821
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
the Wookie kind of shaking

822
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
his fist, like, hey, come back

823
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
here. There's minor adjustments

824
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
to those first scenes.

825
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I mean the take off, looking for the spy

826
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
kind of scene. By the way,

827
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
you know what I meant to say?

828
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
As we cover

829
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
the newest of the new Star Tours

830
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
stuff, something that we have not done on the show

831
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
is Star Tours Adventures Continue.

832
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I know. Did part one

833
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
with Kyle forever ago.

834
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Part two we have not done. It seems like something

835
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
we should try to do in the

836
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
calendar year. I agree with that.

837
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Here we can piece

838
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
three of these levels now. No, not three.

839
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Three transmissions. Three transmissions and

840
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
one level. Are off the

841
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
table. Thus making it so that

842
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
that one will be only three and a half

843
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
hours. And one wreath side vertical

844
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
screened. And one vertical.

845
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And we've knocked out a vertical. Because Ahsoka

846
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
shows up. Yeah, yeah.

847
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yeah. Call those Snapchats.

848
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I call those Snapchats on the side.

849
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Again, it sounds so natural.

850
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Yeah, yeah. The current

851
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
stuff. Are you the young one now?

852
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
We're all trading hats.

853
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Well, I don't know. After

854
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
sweatshirts or a young person's term,

855
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I think I'm forever the young one. I think that's

856
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
right. Yeah. I remain

857
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
baffled. I still

858
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
don't know. I came back from

859
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
the recording in a fog. I heard

860
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
that. I don't know. They were saying that sweatshirts

861
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
are a young person's term. And that

862
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
you're not supposed to say blue jeans after

863
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
college. I don't know. Maybe

864
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Mike was fucking with me, but Jason seems

865
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
sincere. I honestly,

866
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
maybe there's gaslighting involved. I don't

867
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
know. I don't even, honest to God,

868
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I listen back to it. I don't

869
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
remember that chunk much. I don't know how

870
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
we got to any of it. I'll never forget it.

871
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Yeah. I don't really remember it.

872
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I know kind of where we started,

873
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
but I don't know. I don't know. I think

874
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I blacked out. I don't know. Jason was

875
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
serious, though. That's how it

876
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
seemed. And let's get it through all of our heads.

877
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
None of us are the young person on this

878
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
show. No, no. There's no such thing.

879
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Nope. Unless we have a guest

880
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
under 30. We should try

881
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
to find one of those someday.

882
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I disagree. Hey, we had that

883
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
guy who was, you know, from

884
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
oh, yeah, from

885
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
there we go.

886
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
See, he was a nice young man.

887
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
A nice young man. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

888
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
You know what? And now that I think about it

889
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
on the Zoom, he looked pretty, he looked

890
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
pretty sharp in a sweatshirt. But I didn't want

891
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
to say that because that's not my term to say.

892
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Yeah, don't say it. It sounds weird

893
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
when you say it.

894
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Everybody got the creeps when I said it.

895
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Old man Scott saying sweatshirt, a

896
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
clear young person's term. We're getting up there.

897
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
We've got to get some quarter zips.

898
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Some what? Quarter zip sweaters?

899
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Oh, quarter zips.

900
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I've never heard them called

901
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
quarter zips before. That's what they're called on

902
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
store websites. Wow.

903
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Quarter zips. Store websites.

904
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Do you know quarter zips?

905
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Mike, you're

906
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
trying to get me to say no so that

907
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
the new flood of comments

908
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Jason knows quarter zips.

909
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I know quarter zips.

910
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I know how these fucking comments work.

911
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Quarter zip, the quarter zip page

912
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
at Macy's shows right up.

913
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
No, I don't think you're making something up.

914
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I just didn't know what it, I just never heard

915
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
that. I never heard it called that before

916
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and now that's one of my new favorite things

917
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
to say. Maybe Jason is the young person.

918
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Quarter zips.

919
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Oh, you're going to be a quarter zip boy.

920
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Quarter zip man.

921
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
He has a lot of quarter zips.

922
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Oh, if it's a your father thing then it's not a young

923
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
person. Okay.

924
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Quarter zips are not for young people.

925
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Quarter zips. I don't.

926
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
That's why the defiance of young people,

927
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
that's why they wear sweatshirts, to spit

928
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
in the face of the quarter zips of their fathers.

929
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
That seems practical.

930
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
If you're a little hot you just unzip it a little

931
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
but it still keeps you warm.

932
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I don't really understand the quarter zip

933
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
to be honest with you. I don't understand the design

934
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
other than like, oh, a little stuffy in here.

935
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
It just feels like, I don't know,

936
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
it feels frustrating. You should be able to unzip the whole thing.

937
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
After the first level

938
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
you get a transmission from

939
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Asoka Tano. Yeah, I know her.

940
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
She's from the show Asoka.

941
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
She's cool. I like her. Jason wants to yell names

942
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
of old movies she was in.

943
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Here's

944
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
some of the issues. Ultimately,

945
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
you know, what are these?

946
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Like, hey, you're traveling with a friend

947
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
of mine, the spy.

948
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Head to the rendezvous point.

949
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Good luck.

950
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I'm looking at these ultimately like, what I wrote

951
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
down was, they sure did film these.

952
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
There are not a lot

953
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
of exciting things or sentences

954
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
given to you

955
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
as a viewer of

956
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
a writer, I should say.

957
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
We didn't know when we started.

958
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Grogu does a funny

959
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
little thing that he does on the show.

960
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Eating the frog, which is still funny.

961
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Yes, Mandalorian.

962
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm not going to say the name

963
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
of the, I know he's not called

964
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
that. I know the character's name.

965
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I know what his name is, but

966
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
now I'm scared to say it.

967
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
His name, first name is Din.

968
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I know that.

969
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I'm not going to say his last name.

970
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
They don't come for you, they're going to come for me.

971
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I know, I know I'm not saying it.

972
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
His name is Din.

973
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
He kind of

974
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
just gives you a very dry

975
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
explanation

976
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
or instruction.

977
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I don't think so.

978
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I don't know if we have confirmation on that.

979
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I don't think so, though.

980
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
The video I watched, obviously I was confused

981
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
by the video I watched, but the video I watched,

982
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I couldn't, it was sort of in the back row

983
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
and I couldn't fully get it.

984
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It wasn't as glaring as

985
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
No Bradley Cooper on Guardians Coaster,

986
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
but yeah, probably not him.

987
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yeah, yeah.

988
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
But you've got a frog

989
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
or something

990
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
floating in front of

991
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Grogu, and then he

992
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
laps it with his tongue.

993
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
He eats it.

994
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And Mandalorian says

995
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
what? I have it.

996
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Spit that out,

997
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
he says. There we go.

998
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I could do V.O. for it. Spit that out.

999
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It's not fully Harrison, but

1000
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
he's like kind of gross. Spit that out.

1001
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Wow, this is a new debuting

1002
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
impression. Mike's Din.

1003
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
It's my Din. Wow.

1004
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Hey, be careful out there,

1005
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
star doors. You don't want to get hurt.

1006
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Pitch perfect. Spit that out.

1007
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Definitely, if you just started

1008
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
that without, not in context.

1009
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You know. Yeah, if you cold open an episode.

1010
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Welcome to Podcasts, alright.

1011
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Whoa, Din, just a beer in the room?

1012
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Hey, it's Din. Hey, it's me, Din.

1013
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Be careful. I can't take off the helmet.

1014
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
They made a character where I can't

1015
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
take off the helmet, but the actor has

1016
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
just gotten more and more famous.

1017
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
He's never on set.

1018
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Except for the one,

1019
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
two episodes of, I don't know, maybe there's more

1020
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
now where I take off the helmet.

1021
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
He takes off the helmet on the Bill Burr

1022
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
episode in like the first or second season.

1023
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I think second season. But is it the back of his

1024
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
head? You can see his face.

1025
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Yeah, yeah, it's him. Oh, okay.

1026
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
It's Pedro, yeah. And then he shows his face

1027
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
to Grogu, spoiler alert,

1028
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
before Grogu goes off with Luke

1029
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Skywalker to be trained.

1030
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Because I don't mean taking the helmet

1031
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
off practice, I mean like it's a religious

1032
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
thing for the Mandalorian. You're not supposed

1033
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
to do it. They keep their battle helmets on.

1034
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So that's a massive thing.

1035
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
But he took it off

1036
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
an episode prior, so it's baffling

1037
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
to me why they didn't save that

1038
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
for the moment when Grogu leaves him.

1039
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Truly, I don't know.

1040
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
So maybe somebody can explain it to me. But I was like,

1041
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
wait, what? The moment where he

1042
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
takes it off for Grogu is the moment he should have taken it off

1043
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
the first time. It's important once, it's extra

1044
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
important twice. Yeah, and then he goes off with Deep Fake

1045
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Luke.

1046
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I'm really happy Deep Fake Luke

1047
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
is not anywhere to be found in these.

1048
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Can I say, I don't

1049
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
want to open a can of worms.

1050
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And now I know, okay,

1051
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
there's this thing that's said all the time.

1052
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It was said to me last night

1053
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
by a fellow podcaster whose

1054
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
name I think you could guess.

1055
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
They gotta redo Rise of Resistance

1056
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
and they gotta put in the characters and our

1057
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
friends and the people. If they did that,

1058
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
are we looking at Deep Fake

1059
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Luke? We all think we want Luke.

1060
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Actually, I don't know if I think that.

1061
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
There's that notion of like, they're gonna redo

1062
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
this someday and put the old

1063
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
characters in it. But do we really

1064
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
want that creepy

1065
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
ass video? I have watched Deep Fake

1066
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Luke at the end of that

1067
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
episode. Is it a season finale

1068
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
he shows up, Deep Fake Luke?

1069
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It's a season finale and then he's on a full Book of Boba

1070
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Fett as Deep Fake Luke. Oh, okay.

1071
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I like the season finale.

1072
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It's real wonky in there, I would say.

1073
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
There's a lot more Deep Fake Luke in the

1074
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
middle of the day. They should maybe be.

1075
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
They should be a little more sparing, I'd say.

1076
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
What's funny is the guy they had

1077
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
playing Deep Fake Luke looks

1078
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
just like Young Mark Hamill also.

1079
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yeah, I'm always

1080
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
in favor of practical effects

1081
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
and it's crazy what they can do with

1082
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
makeup. Well, the robots can be fine.

1083
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
You can make the robot look like Young Luke,

1084
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
no problem. He doesn't have to look like Deep Fake Luke.

1085
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
That would be really weird

1086
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
if they made him look a little fucked up.

1087
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeah, robots they could do, but if we're

1088
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
doing any video screening content,

1089
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I think now we're in Deep Fake

1090
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Luke territory. Is that gonna

1091
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
fix the ride? Put the hood

1092
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
over his head if he's giving you some instruction.

1093
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You don't have to see him necessarily

1094
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
or it's just in a lot of darkness.

1095
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
This ride sucks. I want my

1096
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
friends in it. Yeah, you could put a hood over him.

1097
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
As long as I see 10% of their face.

1098
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
That's only on the pre-show. The robots

1099
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
can look like any age. You can have

1100
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Young Harrison, you can have anything.

1101
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
What are you saying?

1102
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
What do you mean by robots?

1103
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm saying if

1104
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
they put more animatronics on Rise of the Resistance,

1105
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
this is never happening. No, no, I thought

1106
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
you were talking about like robots

1107
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
in film, TV shows or something.

1108
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And I'm like, did I miss robots? No, no, no.

1109
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
We mean on Rise of the Resistance because

1110
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
it's not my friends.

1111
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
That has to get done someday.

1112
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Which will not happen, you're right.

1113
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
No, the bigger issue with Rise of the Resistance

1114
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
is making it so you get fucked up

1115
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
when you're riding it. That's my number one.

1116
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
That'd be number one on the fix.

1117
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
New ride vehicles where you get fucked like

1118
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
jostle your body. Hardcore.

1119
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Maybe take the seat belts off

1120
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
it too. And you see your version of what might

1121
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
be called Rise of the Resistance hardcore.

1122
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
There's a big red stamp

1123
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
on it. Right. Yeah.

1124
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
My version of that is much different.

1125
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I said my version of

1126
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Rise of the Resistance hardcore

1127
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
is much different. Yeah.

1128
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Yours is more

1129
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
snuff filmy. You're hanging with like

1130
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Jabba's dancers.

1131
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Oh yeah.

1132
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
The big lip, the big mouth.

1133
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Oh, well that's nice noodles.

1134
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Sice noodles, excuse me.

1135
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

1136
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Jason and Sice Noodles.

1137
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I like this parents. I like this for you.

1138
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
My whole past. Sice

1139
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Noodles.

1140
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Or Max Rebo.

1141
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Max Rebo's cool. He did not die

1142
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
in Book of Boba Fett. He got out. He was not

1143
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
playing the night that the bar was bombed. Don't worry.

1144
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Well, for anyone who knows what that meant,

1145
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I hope that cleared things up. Max Rebo was in Book of

1146
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Boba Fett, but playing at a different

1147
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
bar and then that place gets blown up.

1148
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
But they like made a point somewhere

1149
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
maybe online to be like Max was

1150
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
not in the room. I love that Max is

1151
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
gigging. Yeah, of course.

1152
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
He's got to. Yeah, yeah.

1153
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
One club is not going to. Jason and Sice

1154
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Noodles. Yeah, those big, I like the

1155
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
who's the lips? Who are the big lips?

1156
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I really like that parents. She's got a

1157
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
trunk and lips.

1158
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
She's got a long trunk, long skinny trunk.

1159
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Give me a trunk and then the

1160
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
lips are on the end of it, right?

1161
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Yeah, yeah. So that's Jason.

1162
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
That's what your Rise of the Resistance.

1163
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
You've been mad about just no Sice

1164
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Noodles sitting next to you in the car

1165
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
while you ride. No opportunity to

1166
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
smooch Sice Noodles.

1167
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I don't know what Star Wars language

1168
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
she speaks, so I don't know how to translate

1169
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
come up and see me sometime, big boy.

1170
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I'm sure she's saying that, though.

1171
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I have to assume.

1172
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Come up and see me sometime is becoming a

1173
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
clear occurrence. Yeah, you say that a lot.

1174
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
You're like, OK, Mae West can't use

1175
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
it anymore. She's long gone.

1176
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It's my catchphrase now.

1177
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
That is funny.

1178
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Yeah, calling in the Star Wars

1179
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
episode.

1180
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I'm saying this is my catchphrase now.

1181
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Why not?

1182
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
You can't copyright a term like that.

1183
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I don't know. Maybe you can. I was wondering

1184
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
like, do people like everything is being like

1185
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
bought up by company? Could somebody

1186
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
try to buy Mae West's come up

1187
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
and see me sometime?

1188
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
When do we get the deep fake Mae West?

1189
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
We're all asking for it.

1190
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Oh, I think that will happen.

1191
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Oh, Mae West could meet Ricky Stinnicky.

1192
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
You know? Wow.

1193
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
OK, that's interesting.

1194
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Look, it's an old

1195
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
thing and a current thing.

1196
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
No, you're right.

1197
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
How do we take

1198
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Stinnicky to the next level

1199
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
with a time traveling Mae West

1200
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
done post demise?

1201
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Maybe Ricky

1202
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
and size noodles

1203
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
and Jason Sherwood.

1204
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
It's a trio thing.

1205
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
It's a throuple.

1206
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Three tickets for challengers.

1207
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I noted this, that you seem

1208
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
a little interested in challengers.

1209
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I was warned about you

1210
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
long ago that you were interested

1211
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
in being a third.

1212
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
What is it about this

1213
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
film?

1214
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
What is doing it?

1215
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I don't know.

1216
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Man, rise to the resistance.

1217
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It doesn't have my friends in it.

1218
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Why don't they redo it with Mae West

1219
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
and Ricky Stinnicky?

1220
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
It's an easy change out.

1221
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Just take Finn and put Ricky Stinnicky's head on him.

1222
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
The best friend they never

1223
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
had who became real and became

1224
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
their real best friend, I assume.

1225
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I bailed pretty fast on that.

1226
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Ricky

1227
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Stinnicky, I saw a couple of people

1228
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
talking about this and even I had heard

1229
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
it talked about a specter

1230
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
that haunted Hollywood

1231
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
comedy.

1232
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
This script was bouncing

1233
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
around.

1234
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I remember hearing about it years ago.

1235
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It's like, oh, this new

1236
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Ricky Stinnicky is going to be

1237
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
a fig.

1238
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
There's a ton of those.

1239
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to say it.

1240
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It got made 28 years later.

1241
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Okay.

1242
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
You know what?

1243
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Thank God we found some other stuff to talk about.

1244
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
If I'm being honest, that Andor

1245
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
one is pretty.

1246
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
He did the

1247
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
intro for

1248
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
The Void.

1249
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I almost think that one was better.

1250
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
This one is dry

1251
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
and nothing.

1252
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,900
I was getting excited about, I think that the new,

1253
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,140
like the episodes seven, eight, nine actors

1254
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,680
had fun with it, I think.

1255
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,180
Like Finn and Poe in their little side screen

1256
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,580
Snapchat appearances, I think they gave it their all.

1257
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:45,060
I think Billy Dee, oddly, for somebody who you might think

1258
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,420
could be kind of, what is this, what am I doing?

1259
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,100
I think he was fantastic.

1260
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:53,620
These are not the most spirited hologram cameos

1261
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,560
I've ever seen in Star Tours.

1262
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,760
Yeah, I agree.

1263
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,460
I mean, you're like, the star power is good.

1264
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:03,600
I think the Mandalorian one is really good

1265
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,600
and maybe the first funny one of these

1266
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,540
mid-rides transmissions.

1267
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,340
And I would be excited if I got it.

1268
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:14,680
I think as these, because apparently the plan is

1269
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,640
these are gonna run through June,

1270
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,980
through season of The Force,

1271
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:22,760
and then they will get put into the randomizer

1272
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,160
and they will be possible options forever.

1273
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,360
And I think in general, when I get on that ride,

1274
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,500
what do I want?

1275
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,700
Next time I go on it, I think the ones I want the most

1276
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,800
are Lando or Mandalore.

1277
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,480
Lando or Mando.

1278
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,980
Yeah, I think that's, yeah, I think so.

1279
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,740
Not to say, there could be better ones.

1280
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,080
I like Yoda, but I've seen Yoda plenty of times.

1281
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,640
I like Leia, but I've seen Leia many times.

1282
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,880
My ideal, yeah, that's what I'd be gunning for, maybe.

1283
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,480
Yeah, just a little bit anew,

1284
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,680
but also I didn't see Lando too many times.

1285
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,540
So I'd welcome him.

1286
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,380
I agree.

1287
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,220
Where do you want the last scene to end up?

1288
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,520
Where do you wanna be dropped off?

1289
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,360
That's a good question.

1290
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,560
Well, I need to, admittedly,

1291
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,560
I only did this by watching videos.

1292
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,160
I didn't see, I have not seen Pergill's in person,

1293
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,860
so I'd kind of like to.

1294
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:20,860
I was thinking how, I think there's more good first,

1295
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,340
scenes than last scenes.

1296
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:27,080
I think some last scenes become just sort of like

1297
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,440
muddy action, a little bit hard to follow.

1298
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,280
Yes, I agree.

1299
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,820
But I actually think Crait is pretty good.

1300
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,720
I think getting to explore what all those

1301
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,920
red stalagmites, stalagmites,

1302
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,920
when you go like into the ground in Crait,

1303
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,600
I think it's good.

1304
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,060
And I like the Jar Jar.

1305
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,160
Naboo is the answer.

1306
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,300
Yeah, Naboo is really fun.

1307
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,140
Naboo is the best.

1308
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,160
Is the definitive answer, you're saying.

1309
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,000
I believe so.

1310
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,100
You were getting tense when I was talking about Crait there.

1311
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,960
Like Scott's fucking up, he's over there,

1312
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,800
spinning his wheels.

1313
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,620
What is this guy doing?

1314
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,460
Very visually straight.

1315
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,300
He's ruining it.

1316
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,900
End of the podcast.

1317
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,100
He's acting like an amateur here,

1318
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,300
doesn't know what the actual answer is.

1319
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,180
I knew with Crait, I knew that I was in dicey territory

1320
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,120
by everybody take a deep breath,

1321
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,240
complimenting something related to The Last Jedi.

1322
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,120
I know that that's, but I knew we could all

1323
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,620
get through it together as adults,

1324
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:16,180
as people in this world trying to help each other.

1325
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,220
Right, yes.

1326
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,780
But no, I think I like Naboo.

1327
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,800
And then you get the little fun thing usually at the end

1328
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,440
with the break through the glass.

1329
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,480
Yes, that's one of the best pieces.

1330
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,800
The glass is really good.

1331
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1332
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,520
But some of this can be in.

1333
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,760
But let's go through you guys.

1334
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,640
Your preference, Naboo, Jason, next start to his visit,

1335
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,480
what are you hoping to see?

1336
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,960
I think Naboo, I think Crait is very visually striking,

1337
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,880
but I definitely saw,

1338
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,520
how many times did I see episode one in theaters

1339
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,560
when I was like 13?

1340
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,400
Is it over five?

1341
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,820
I think three times, at least, I think.

1342
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:55,180
Okay, so you mean that's why you like Naboo?

1343
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:59,060
No, well, I was 13, I obviously have more affection

1344
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,220
for the movie I saw when I was 13

1345
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,460
than the one that I saw when I was like,

1346
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,060
you know, when was I?

1347
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:06,900
What do you mean?

1348
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,560
Ages can't be coloring opinions on any of this.

1349
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,400
No.

1350
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,680
Jason, this is an insane thing that you've said

1351
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,020
about everyone's Star Wars opinions.

1352
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,720
Uh-huh.

1353
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,580
The idea that the age that you were

1354
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,280
when you saw them might possibly have.

1355
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,120
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1356
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,200
You liked the one you saw in high school.

1357
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,800
I remember being at Sears once,

1358
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,160
they had a big display before we saw the movie,

1359
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,800
and I bought a shirt with the characters,

1360
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,240
and my mom bought the soundtrack to play in the car.

1361
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,500
It was so exciting.

1362
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,480
It was so exciting hearing the episode one soundtrack

1363
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,920
before seeing the movie, and you're like,

1364
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,520
what is happening?

1365
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,680
What is Duel of the Fates about?

1366
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,520
Oh, boy, yes.

1367
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,160
Maybe one of the best Star Wars music stings.

1368
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,640
Sure, of course.

1369
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,900
Let's make sure that we talk Pergil.

1370
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:52,420
I mean, this is very exciting.

1371
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:56,220
Mainly, these new sequences are about the transmissions

1372
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,940
and getting the actor cameos in there.

1373
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,500
That's what they can easily slot in and out, especially.

1374
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,340
But I think if you're going on Star Tours

1375
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,900
for the next couple months, what you are guaranteed to see

1376
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,980
is this Pergil sequence.

1377
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,220
What are Pergil?

1378
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,100
Pergil are space whales.

1379
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:11,940
Space whales.

1380
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:15,460
You suddenly land in a very cloudy atmosphere

1381
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,920
full of space whales.

1382
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,440
It's pretty striking.

1383
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,800
It's pretty cool.

1384
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,840
I was not previously familiar with this.

1385
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,040
I think they've been part of Star Wars mythology

1386
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,640
since Rebels, possibly.

1387
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,440
Yeah, they should have been Rebels, from what I saw.

1388
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,880
And then they started showing up in live action

1389
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,200
with Mandalorian and Ahsoka.

1390
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,840
Yeah, Ahsoka's the big tie.

1391
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,680
They're in it a lot.

1392
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,840
I think they're a little bit in the primary sequence.

1393
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,280
And then she's also in the, she pops up

1394
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,380
in this third act sequence as well.

1395
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,500
They also, you have to note, they

1396
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,940
are whales in space who can jump into hyperspace.

1397
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,260
And I'm like, back on board.

1398
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,660
So that got you jacked up.

1399
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,900
Yeah, this got me in.

1400
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:57,900
You got fired up.

1401
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,060
Silly inventive idea.

1402
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,460
No, this does seem cool.

1403
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,020
It seems like a cool sequence in the ride.

1404
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:07,020
Now, I have to bring up, and when I say have to,

1405
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,900
don't really have to do this, especially

1406
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,020
this late in the episode.

1407
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,500
There's a character that I've loved

1408
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,940
that I brought up before from the Archie Ninja Turtle

1409
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,320
comics called Cuddly the Cowlick,

1410
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,840
which is a giant cow's head that was

1411
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,320
an interdimensional traveler.

1412
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,680
You're saying there was a way to not bring up

1413
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,600
Cuddly the Cowlick?

1414
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,600
I believe, yes.

1415
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,640
I think there was, but I didn't.

1416
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,440
I don't see that.

1417
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,200
I took the wrong, I took the other road.

1418
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,240
I did bring it up.

1419
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,080
Wait, stop.

1420
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,200
You're going the wrong way.

1421
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:28,960
So I feel like these.

1422
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,800
Stop immediately.

1423
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,240
No, no, shut up, officer.

1424
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,280
I was like, well, these whales are cool.

1425
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,080
I like them, but there's a cow's head,

1426
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,360
disembodied giant cow's head that

1427
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,280
traveled through the universe like this before, I feel.

1428
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,220
So I was a little bit like, a bit of a rip-off here, huh?

1429
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:46,720
Wait, what?

1430
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,820
Why is one the other?

1431
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,060
There's one that's a cow's head.

1432
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,740
Because the whales travel through,

1433
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,100
like they go through hyperspace.

1434
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,220
They travel through hyperspace.

1435
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,540
But one's a cow's head.

1436
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,500
I know, but they're animals in space

1437
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,620
that don't have to breathe.

1438
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:58,820
I'm just saying.

1439
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:01,620
How can a space whale be a rip-off of a cow head?

1440
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:03,380
Because they would do the same things.

1441
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,860
They were both sort of floating in space, and they're animal.

1442
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,300
We see them as if they're from our.

1443
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:08,900
But aren't they both rip-offs, the theory

1444
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:12,820
that the Earth is floating on the back of a giant turtle

1445
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,320
shell?

1446
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,000
That the Earth is on the back of a giant turtle?

1447
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Well, now you've introduced another episode.

1448
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,040
It's some mythology.

1449
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,320
I forget where that came from.

1450
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,040
Ultimately, yes.

1451
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,080
Well, I guess that's right.

1452
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,760
I guess Jason's ruined this whole argument here.

1453
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,160
I guess he's right about that.

1454
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,640
I don't know.

1455
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,140
I'm surprised that that's where you're going with it.

1456
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,240
Only because of the existence in Rebels

1457
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,120
can I not be upset about space whales being portrayed who

1458
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,440
are not from Avatar Way of Water.

1459
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,320
Right.

1460
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,080
Do I like these purgles?

1461
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,120
I guess I do.

1462
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:42,620
Yeah.

1463
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,280
It's interesting motion.

1464
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,920
I like that they kind of undulate in this jellyfish way.

1465
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,600
Yeah.

1466
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,640
I think that they're neat.

1467
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,040
However, space whales, you're going

1468
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,320
to give me space whales post-Tulcune, post-Piacon.

1469
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,200
So we're all upset with these.

1470
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,680
Yeah, maybe we are.

1471
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,240
Maybe we're, this whole thing is stuff that we don't like.

1472
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:04,720
I don't know.

1473
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,680
I do like them.

1474
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,160
I'm just saying, after I have been

1475
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:15,540
moved by the journey of a space whale with a lot of depth,

1476
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,340
how are you going to give me just a bunch of cattle

1477
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,100
going by?

1478
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:19,600
Right.

1479
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,100
Right.

1480
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,300
But while the Tulcune can't travel in space,

1481
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:24,220
that we know of, yeah.

1482
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:24,540
No.

1483
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:25,460
And you know what?

1484
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:28,180
And that's where, though I've used the term space whale,

1485
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,940
it is not technically correct.

1486
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:33,140
They are in space in that Pandora is in space,

1487
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:35,940
but also Earth is in space, which would then

1488
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:39,440
lead to that whales are also space whales.

1489
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,480
We're space people.

1490
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,800
You're space Mike.

1491
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:42,840
I'm space Scott.

1492
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,920
That's true.

1493
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,000
If that's the definition.

1494
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,360
So really, we should have never been calling Tulcune space

1495
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,720
whales, and I apologize.

1496
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,480
I'll get ahead of that one.

1497
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,440
These completely, and I think within,

1498
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,680
it doesn't see 3PO call them space whales.

1499
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,240
I believe so.

1500
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,080
So it is finally an appropriate term.

1501
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,260
So I'll give it to them for that.

1502
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:05,040
But I'm just saying, look, I'm still

1503
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,500
going to use the broader term.

1504
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,340
Whales, I mean, whales not on Earth

1505
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,940
is what I'm getting at, ultimately.

1506
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:17,020
So non-Earth whale power rankings, number one, Tulcune.

1507
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:19,020
Number two, Star Trek IV.

1508
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,600
Sorry, Per Gill, you are at a distant third.

1509
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,580
Yes.

1510
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:23,420
Very, very true.

1511
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,260
Sorry, Jason, we're really, Jason was hyped up for now.

1512
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:26,660
We're like, trashing these whales.

1513
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,220
I mean, I didn't say they were the number one space

1514
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:34,500
creature, because it also made me think about the dolphins

1515
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,960
in Each Acre's Guide to the Galaxy.

1516
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,280
The dolphins flee Earth.

1517
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,160
So long, and thanks for all the fish, you know?

1518
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,680
You know what I'll say, the episode

1519
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,000
that I watched of Ahsoka with the space whales,

1520
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,840
it's a very, the scene where you really get to enjoy the whales.

1521
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,360
It's a very peaceful, beautiful scene.

1522
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,100
And I think they felt like they had to have some shooting

1523
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:58,040
at other spaceship antics in this scene.

1524
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:03,080
So I almost think maybe we would enjoy the whales more if,

1525
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,940
I mean, I guess if they just, we just chilled out in this level.

1526
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:09,940
You know, I like the idea of, because they made,

1527
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,740
finally one of the transitions was a little,

1528
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:13,500
the transmissions was a little funny.

1529
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,660
So why not?

1530
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:17,460
How shocking would it be to follow that up with a tranquil

1531
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,900
sequence where there's no conflicts

1532
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:23,180
and you just swim with space whales?

1533
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,260
I think they got scared that people would be like,

1534
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,420
well, that was a letdown.

1535
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,940
But I don't think it was, I don't think

1536
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,580
it would be if they did it right.

1537
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,420
It could be like, wow, I don't want

1538
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,640
to ruin this for Mike, but there is a scene in X-Men 97

1539
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,800
with a very prominent music cue.

1540
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,240
Oh, I think I've seen this, but yeah.

1541
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,640
And characters dancing in the air.

1542
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,880
That is very peaceful.

1543
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,320
And then total chaos.

1544
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,280
Is it the Goo Goo Dolls Black Balloon?

1545
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,240
It is not Black Balloon, I'm so sorry.

1546
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,200
It's actually a few years older than that.

1547
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,040
I was gonna say, well, it can't, oh, is it really?

1548
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,480
It's from the 2000s.

1549
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,800
Cause it's X-Men 97.

1550
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,760
No, it's from 92.

1551
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,600
Oh, okay.

1552
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,960
So it makes sense it would take place.

1553
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,540
Maybe it would be in a 97.

1554
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:03,580
Got it.

1555
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,420
Okay.

1556
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,860
So yeah, so that scene is very,

1557
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:09,820
that scene in the show is very calm.

1558
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:12,180
So you're saying they didn't capture maybe.

1559
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,900
So perhaps, yes, if they were like,

1560
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,220
they took a little bit of a risk

1561
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,680
and they felt like, you know, dad,

1562
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,520
the average dad, not the dad's here.

1563
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,500
Dad's here would hoot and holler

1564
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,580
at a tranquil scene on Star Tours.

1565
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,280
We would get so excited, like, oh my God,

1566
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,660
there was no action on the scene?

1567
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:27,500
Wow.

1568
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,320
Yeah.

1569
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,160
Holy crap.

1570
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,000
This is what I needed.

1571
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,540
A nice, peaceful trip to the skies of Citos.

1572
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,380
Yes.

1573
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,940
Wait, is this, hang on, is this a,

1574
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:38,660
is this a Beato situation?

1575
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:39,500
It might be.

1576
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,320
Is it Seattle?

1577
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,160
It might be Seattle.

1578
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,160
Guy walked right into it.

1579
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:47,580
I feel like 3PO is, you know, actively impressed

1580
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:52,500
and peaceful in his delivery of seeing the giant whales.

1581
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,340
Yeah.

1582
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:54,160
Yes.

1583
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,000
Yeah, it's true.

1584
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:55,820
I mean, they give you the little beat of like,

1585
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:58,660
oh, the whales, like it's a beautiful thing or whatever.

1586
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,960
But I'm just saying they still had to end,

1587
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,800
like, oh, we're following and shooting

1588
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,360
and there's still some antics.

1589
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,640
Which I mean, yeah, both of our dad lives,

1590
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,440
you know, stressful for different reasons.

1591
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,600
I know, just like getting to go space whale watching.

1592
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,920
Yeah, why do they have to,

1593
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,760
why do they have to be weapons involved?

1594
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,040
Why do they have to have weapons?

1595
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,960
Can't dads just have a nice little trip?

1596
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,480
Yes, dads should be able to have a nice little trip.

1597
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,480
I will get you guys tickets to whale watching

1598
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,400
if you want to go and do it.

1599
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,960
Nah, boring.

1600
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,540
Earth whale.

1601
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:31,620
Ah, snooze.

1602
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,740
Plus you got to get up so early for that.

1603
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,660
I want a break from getting up early.

1604
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:36,500
That's what I want.

1605
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,320
I want to wake up.

1606
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,900
I want to sleep in, you know, 7.30 a.m.

1607
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:44,380
and then choose my own time to go to Disneyland

1608
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,060
and watch fake whales.

1609
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:46,900
Yes.

1610
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:47,720
That's true.

1611
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,540
Yeah, so it is interesting.

1612
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:50,580
I like that they put the,

1613
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:52,660
the whales make sense of all the different stuff

1614
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,240
I've seen on the new Disney Star Wars,

1615
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:59,900
but yeah, like you're missing the essence of the whales.

1616
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:00,740
Okay, yeah.

1617
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:01,580
Well, I agree.

1618
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:02,820
You know, I think if Star Tours

1619
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:05,500
is getting experimental with tone,

1620
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,340
I really think it would,

1621
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:10,260
genuinely it would stand out a lot if like.

1622
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,100
Yeah.

1623
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,380
Now, we're, this is a history going back to what, 87?

1624
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:18,820
The, like, there's a tone that Star Tours has.

1625
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:21,100
What, if there was like a real break

1626
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:22,740
and suddenly there was a,

1627
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,320
like, what a surprise it would be for C-3PO.

1628
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,960
I don't think he would know what to do.

1629
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,080
Yeah.

1630
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,680
I think C-3PO, like yourself, Mike, thrives on conflict.

1631
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,180
Can C-3PO, and stress, I'm saying,

1632
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,600
I can't even imagine C-3PO just being like,

1633
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,920
ah, wonderful.

1634
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,360
I'm relaxed for the first time in centuries.

1635
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,680
I've said this on the show before

1636
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,520
that one of my favorite parts of the new Star Tours

1637
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,720
is when they give you that heavy beat

1638
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,080
and he goes, it looks like we've just joined

1639
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,080
the Rebel Alliance.

1640
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:54,820
Like, you get to sit there for like a second or something.

1641
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,820
That's kind of like, calm C-3PO.

1642
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,220
So I guess, yeah, that's close, yeah, close.

1643
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:02,980
Just hear him kind of, ah, ooh, oh.

1644
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,460
Oh, I drifted asleep there, I'm so calm.

1645
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,860
And that one over there, and that one over there.

1646
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:12,180
You know what, fuck the resistance, I'm not going back.

1647
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,580
I'm part of all of these conflicts

1648
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,900
and I seem to not make any difference whatsoever.

1649
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,780
In fact, I only get in the way.

1650
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:21,080
Deadline announces C-3PO has joined the cast

1651
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,200
of White Lotus, season three.

1652
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:28,400
He gets a little relaxing, but then he quickly finds out

1653
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,120
there is conflict under the surface.

1654
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,880
Nothing is what it seems at the White Lotus.

1655
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,080
She was a prostitute.

1656
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,800
What do you mean he's dead now?

1657
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,560
If you could somehow, like, C-3PO is like,

1658
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,000
R2, land this thing right now at the White Lotus.

1659
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,280
And then you land at the White Lotus

1660
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,560
and then you somehow can get him out

1661
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,040
and then you just watch him on the video screen,

1662
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,580
and then go over and get in a beach chair or something.

1663
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,940
Yeah, yeah, well, and be tranquil for a minute

1664
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,460
and like, ah, welcome, champagne, wonderful.

1665
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:58,460
I've lost my bag of pills and I wonder if you can help me.

1666
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,300
It is a lot like the Naboo ending,

1667
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:03,940
like you land in the water, but you're at the White Lotus.

1668
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,540
It's a little bit, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1669
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,540
Yeah, love this.

1670
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,820
And then, yeah, where he falls in love

1671
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,540
with another droid on vacation,

1672
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:14,700
but then gets insanely jealous of who else

1673
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,360
that droid might be fucking.

1674
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,200
Oh, yeah.

1675
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,040
So is it just in his head?

1676
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,900
Are you fucking Steve Zahn?

1677
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,440
Tell me.

1678
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,400
Steve Zahn is back as a new character.

1679
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,760
He's actually playing himself.

1680
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,120
Oh, thank you, okay.

1681
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,480
Thanks for clarifying that.

1682
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,400
Sure.

1683
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,560
Visions of Steve Zahn each and every night.

1684
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,000
I can't have sex with you anymore, normally.

1685
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,420
I cannot compete with Steve Zahn.

1686
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,680
I love Steve Zahn.

1687
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,280
Is there any, is there any, okay.

1688
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,960
I'm trying to think if there's any Star Wars name

1689
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,840
that sounds like Zahn that you could, like,

1690
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,620
piece together Anthony Daniels saying Steve Zahn.

1691
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:51,220
I guess Grand Admiral Thrawn is close to Zahn.

1692
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,060
Sure.

1693
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:53,060
So you got the on there.

1694
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:53,900
Yeah.

1695
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:54,720
If you could just get a Z.

1696
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,900
Well, if you don't think they've already AI scanned

1697
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:00,420
Anthony Daniels' voice to use for centuries after he's gone.

1698
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,260
For sure.

1699
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:02,100
You've got a new thing coming.

1700
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,500
Grand, Thrawn, you know, the Purgill,

1701
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,780
I think, helped fight Thrawn.

1702
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:09,860
Yes, Thrawn related to the Purgills, I believe.

1703
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:10,700
Yes.

1704
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:11,540
Yes.

1705
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:15,160
It's like, we're about, what, 16 years out from, like,

1706
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,640
wow, Deadpool.

1707
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,200
You've made it to Endor.

1708
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,480
I think there's, yeah, so there's an emergency valve

1709
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,080
that they just, like, they all look at it every day

1710
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,920
as if the money isn't good at Disney and they go,

1711
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,080
it's today the day.

1712
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,800
All, all characters.

1713
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:34,880
Wow, Deadpool, Mickey Mouse, May West, you're all here.

1714
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:39,020
R2, we've landed on Abbott Elementary.

1715
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:44,240
If the current billboards are any indication,

1716
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,080
this is where it's all going.

1717
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,880
Every day, everyone walks by there.

1718
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,240
Kevin Feige looks at it.

1719
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:51,920
Kathleen Kennedy looks at the valve.

1720
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,760
It's today the day.

1721
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,920
Look, R2, a help wanted sign

1722
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,960
in this Chicago sandwich restaurant.

1723
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,400
Perhaps this will be less stressful

1724
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,880
than our typical endeavors.

1725
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:07,160
So the billboards, so then the Disney plus Hulu billboards.

1726
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,560
Yeah, yeah, oh, this is a pretty, yeah.

1727
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:10,380
I think they're actually pretty cute.

1728
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,460
It's gonna be looked at as like,

1729
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:15,620
this was the nice time when it was mere billboards

1730
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,980
and not full franchises.

1731
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,780
Yeah, they're like, wait, what if,

1732
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:24,820
the Griffins do meet Lilo at the stage?

1733
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:30,380
Yeah, well, yeah, for the first, well, yeah,

1734
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:33,380
Peter will have a, remember the time,

1735
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:36,060
and then C-3 Bill will be in it, and then he'll stay.

1736
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:39,120
He'll transition from the remember-when-a-verts

1737
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,840
to and become a regular character.

1738
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:44,120
I mean, I would love to see Lilo Pern make,

1739
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:48,480
like some, Lilo urges Stitch, like, you know,

1740
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,080
coughing out a, like, fuck you to make.

1741
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:53,880
Can you give us just a quick,

1742
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:57,160
Well, I walked right in, I've walked right into this.

1743
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,000
Yet again, I've walked right into it.

1744
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,880
What a mess I'm in.

1745
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:03,600
If Stitch suddenly started using

1746
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,860
Quagmire's famous catchphrase,

1747
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:07,440
what might that sound like?

1748
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,280
Oh, smart, yeah.

1749
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,120
J-J-J-J-J.

1750
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,220
Very good.

1751
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,020
Well, there's nowhere to go from there.

1752
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:19,980
I think that's the end of our mission.

1753
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:20,820
Yeah.

1754
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:25,600
Well, we did some talking about the new levels

1755
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,140
of Star Tours, but what we can now do is,

1756
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:29,560
we've cleared those out.

1757
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:33,180
So at that pace, yes, a Star Tours

1758
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,800
Adventures Continue episode will be,

1759
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,480
well, it might just, maybe we have to do it,

1760
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,480
could we, look, now we've done some experimenting

1761
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,520
with formats with our time travel,

1762
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,520
reshaping the past episode.

1763
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,800
Is there any way that we can do episodes

1764
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,140
that are interactive adventures,

1765
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:51,600
where you don't know which Star Tours level

1766
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:52,880
we're going to talk about?

1767
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,640
Good question.

1768
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,160
That sounds like a job for Mike and only Mike,

1769
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,800
and Jason and I to not think about ever again.

1770
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,640
Maybe I could figure that out too.

1771
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,440
I threw the idea to have me figure out the mechanics,

1772
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:03,380
but that should be fine.

1773
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:04,620
Okay.

1774
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:07,940
There is a way, there is a way to do it, I think.

1775
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,660
There is a way to do it.

1776
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:11,500
Because I saw-

1777
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,540
But are we crazy enough?

1778
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:13,540
Are we crazy enough to do it?

1779
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:14,540
But there is a way to do it.

1780
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:15,700
Okay, wow.

1781
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,260
All right, well, let's commit to it.

1782
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:20,820
Fully interactive Star Tours episodes

1783
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,780
where you don't know where you're going to go.

1784
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,420
But isn't that all episodes?

1785
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:26,620
You don't know when we'll be talking about May West

1786
