00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,160
Welcome to podcast the ride, the second gate, a podcast where we are afraid of most ghosts.

2
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,760
My name is Mike Carlson joining me as always Jason Sheridan.

3
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,840
Are you afraid of most ghosts?

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,640
Am I right about that?

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,920
Yeah, I would say I'm very superstitious.

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,840
Okay, so that is accurate. Scott Gardner here also.

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,520
Yeah.

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:44,600
Well, I'm afraid of the curse that happens if you say the name of the podcast wrong, which is haunt cast the freight.

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,280
You're right.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,440
Cemetery gate.

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,520
Oh, shit.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,360
I did this last year too.

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,600
How could you forget?

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,320
I did it last year.

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,520
How could the haunt cast the freight season not be the foremost thing on your mind at this time?

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,840
I keep reminding myself it's October.

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,280
Like I can't, I keep going, oh, it's October because I like a little Halloween decorations.

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,160
I don't have any right now, but I keep having to remind myself that it's October.

19
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,640
I'm so sorry.

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,920
There's not a lot of tells.

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,400
That's why I just bought some webs in the mail.

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,720
Those are coming soon and then I'll know.

23
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,720
So what you should do the same thing.

24
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,720
Get some cobwebs and put them all over your calendar, which can be set to any month.

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,680
It could be set to February, but it's cobwebbed over because it hasn't been touched in so long.

26
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,720
Yeah, no, I because people died in your apartment or something.

27
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,880
Yeah, that's the idea.

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,680
It doesn't help matters that like today as we record this, it's like going up to 95.

29
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:48,280
And this is day one of like five or six days of like mid to high 90s at the start of October,

30
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,600
where like in the past, you know, my birthday just passed a few days ago.

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,720
And in the past, I remember like, oh, it's 50 outside.

32
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,280
Like, yeah, it's fall.

33
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,560
My birthday's here. It's fall.

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,640
And now it's just like, oh, God, these heat waves just don't end.

35
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,800
Yeah, that's true.

36
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,360
All right. Well, that's all I blame it all on that.

37
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,240
I'm sorry. There's a lot going on audience.

38
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,600
So listen, we know it's haunt cast the freight cemetery gate.

39
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,840
We're well aware. And as for the other question,

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,120
I don't engage with the with the ghosts thing.

41
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,200
I've never had a haunted experience.

42
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,920
I'm such a bad person to answer that.

43
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,600
And I feel like that's like a good podcast topic is a ghost experience.

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,960
And but I maybe I don't believe in them and don't have it.

45
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,080
And therefore, maybe I ain't afraid of no ghosts.

46
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,480
So you. Yeah. So let's actually ask that of all three of us.

47
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,360
You don't believe in ghosts.

48
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,280
Do you, Scott, Aaron or believe in ghosts?

49
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,960
I think I don't. I think I'll call that out here.

50
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,640
That's kind of a dull opinion to have.

51
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,840
It'd be more exciting if I if I had some story, but I believe that I do not.

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,920
Jason Sheridan, let me ask you this.

53
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,720
Yeah, I do believe in ghosts.

54
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,120
Do you think you don't believe in ghosts, Scott,

55
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,400
because your house was properly exercised, the house you grew up in?

56
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,160
As you know, because yes, we discussed a long time ago

57
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,640
that my parents prayed in front of the house, which made it so that a fire

58
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,320
would not burn the house down.

59
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,240
So presumably that same blessing that essentially is an exorcism,

60
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,840
although it seemed to be pretty fire specific.

61
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,120
So maybe ghosts weren't addressed so much.

62
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,120
But I don't know why it's got to be.

63
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,440
It's probably a one stop shop, right?

64
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,960
You have a priest come over, bless your house.

65
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,000
Then also that covers ghosts.

66
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,240
Yeah, it takes care. It's like the MMR vaccine.

67
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,200
You get the measles and you get the months.

68
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,880
You get the rubel.

69
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,440
They all get knocked out with that one.

70
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,080
Some all in. Very quick and easy.

71
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,160
So that's why I had that blessed house and you guys weren't equally blessed.

72
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,040
Right. So, Jason, do you have a ghost story, Jason, or you just believe in ghosts?

73
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,200
I think I just I feel like growing up on the northeast,

74
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,520
growing up in the northeast of the United States,

75
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,800
everything is just built on top of battlefields and graveyards

76
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,880
and like all the the French and Indian War, the Revolutionary War.

77
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,080
It's just it just feels like there's so much old stuff.

78
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,240
And I've taken like so many all that all the tours in Philadelphia

79
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,680
that we would do for school trips or like day trips with a family.

80
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,280
Like you tour Betsy Ross's house, Ben Franklin's house.

81
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,040
And then sometimes you'd go tour them at night for the ghost tour version,

82
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,200
because like everything's just there's just sections of Philadelphia

83
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,840
that just are haunted as shit to the point where they they just turn

84
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,240
the Eastern State Penitentiary, which is still standing

85
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,880
in the middle of Philadelphia for like a month every year.

86
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,160
I don't know if they're doing it this year.

87
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,000
They just turn it into a big haunt, you know.

88
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,400
So did you like see the ghost of Betsy Ross or?

89
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,440
No, I have not. I have not.

90
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,760
So you don't have this person.

91
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,880
You don't have a specific ghost story.

92
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,520
You just sort of feel like they exist.

93
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,000
I think so. And I mean, L.A. has very like haunted vibes.

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,160
Like there's a lot of grim, dark shit that's gone down.

95
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,680
In the Southland.

96
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,800
I more recently to not centuries ago, but like, yeah, Manson

97
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,800
and everything, Manson, Black Dahlia, it's all like there.

98
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,240
You know, it happens once every couple of years.

99
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,640
I feel like I'm more of a believer in like energy

100
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,600
than I am of like traditional ghosts.

101
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,440
I do believe in UFOs. I do believe in aliens.

102
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,880
I've seen weird stuff in the sky

103
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,960
that I don't that's not explainable to me.

104
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,840
I don't think ghosts exist in the simple way we think they do.

105
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,000
But I'm kind of a believer in like a like energy that like

106
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,520
lingers around.

107
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,360
I don't know if that's that's not that specific,

108
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,040
but I don't think I believe in a traditional ghost.

109
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,920
I definitely go in on the like the haunting of Hill House

110
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,880
Bly Man or like sort of like ghosts being residual energy,

111
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,480
memories, trauma associated with a place or items like, yeah,

112
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,960
for sure, I believe that sort of thing.

113
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,200
I feel like was it maybe was it a Mark Maron, Paul Thomas Anderson

114
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,120
interview where they were talking about how the comedy store is haunted?

115
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,960
And I never and I never went more like, oh, I know what that like

116
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,200
I know what that energy like it is an evil energy at the comedy store for sure.

117
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,160
If you've ever been there on Sunset Boulevard,

118
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,520
you walk in there and you're just like this.

119
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,840
I don't feel comfortable here.

120
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,960
But I don't know why are they why are all the comedians

121
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,200
so obsessed with it and making it there?

122
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,960
I'd just be like, no, thanks.

123
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,320
Yeah.

124
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,440
Somewhere else, please.

125
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,040
It's a good question.

126
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,960
But as soon as they said that, I was like, oh, yeah, yeah.

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,080
Well, because when you become a regular, they give you the proton pack.

128
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,160
They give you the the trap.

129
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,800
You know, they give you the tan jumpsuit.

130
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,440
Like that's what they don't tell you.

131
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,680
Mm hmm. Yeah.

132
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,160
That's a secret of the Brickwall Brotherhood that like, well, if you're a regular

133
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,720
at the comics comedy store, you are outfitted like Venkman and Spengler

134
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,720
and Chance.

135
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,960
You are like you are operating a satellite

136
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:20,480
Ghostbusters wing yourself, all of the premise of this ride.

137
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,360
Yes. Like, totally.

138
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,200
It's a show.

139
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,160
This is a show we should say.

140
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,000
And if you don't know the show, this was an opening day

141
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,720
Universal Florida attraction

142
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,120
that was like on an in in an inside area

143
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,600
that would basically made like Pepper's Ghost effects possible.

144
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,880
And I realize one thing in talking about this attraction.

145
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,880
This is a this is a rare example of now we've closed out a space

146
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,880
like a multi attraction space because we've done Twister, write it out,

147
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,320
which is what replaced it.

148
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,240
We've done Race Through New York starring starring Jimmy Fallon

149
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,720
and Ghostbusters, Sputacular.

150
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,320
So so this this which I will call the convoluted name theater.

151
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,840
We've pretty much addressed.

152
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,600
Yeah. Wow. That's that is interesting.

153
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,520
Then. Well, there's an asterisk, though.

154
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,960
There is an asterisk because I wondered to myself, like I was like,

155
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,600
I can't picture it like I had to go back to some of the videos

156
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,320
about Ghostbusters, Sputacular and look at some maps.

157
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,520
And they confirmed the facade of the firehouse is still there

158
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,880
in a certain extent.

159
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,000
And on the second level, the track for Hollywood

160
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,640
Rip Ride and Rocket goes through the top of the firehouse.

161
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,120
That that dreadful roller coaster.

162
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,240
So that counts as part of the space. Yes.

163
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,160
Like like a ghost that won't leave the place at Hauntz.

164
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,360
And that I'm not dying to get out of this area.

165
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,200
I like it. I love I love that main universal drag.

166
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,240
Every time I'm there, I need to like before I leave,

167
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,600
just like take a step back and take it in and look down that line

168
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,800
that leads all the way to wait.

169
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,400
Do you know you don't see Mummy and King Kong from there?

170
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,960
No, you see the right.

171
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:22,120
Yeah. The like you can see Central Park, I believe, is that little grassy area.

172
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,760
Now they have the fake Hollywood Bowl sort of like outdoor space.

173
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,080
That's right. But just that big street

174
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,040
that opens up to opportunity and at various times, different

175
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,720
favorites have been poking out like Shrek and Jimmy Neutron

176
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,960
and the Hanna Barbera gang.

177
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,640
And in this case, like it really did like warm my heart to see just a home video

178
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,640
of somebody like walking up to the show

179
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,480
and seeing the Ghostbusters sign sticking out on the ledge.

180
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,080
Exactly like in the movie.

181
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,160
Mm hmm. Yes. This I did not do this thing when I was a kid.

182
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,480
We didn't go to Universal until I was older, but that is

183
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,320
it's fun to see the thing I know now as an adult, as I would have seen it

184
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,320
if I was I had the pleasure of enjoying Universal as a kid.

185
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
I didn't go either. I didn't see it either.

186
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,120
I don't know if I just didn't make it a priority or if I was scared.

187
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,080
Is it another one of those?

188
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,480
And if so, I needn't have been.

189
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,320
That is stupid. This is silly and fun.

190
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,240
It is stupid.

191
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,640
But I would have been, I think because I was upset.

192
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,840
Look, I was obsessed with Ghostbusters as a little kid.

193
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,240
Ghostbusters was the first thing I was obsessed with, I think.

194
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,720
It was it was before Ninja Turtles.

195
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,200
It didn't last as long as Ninja Turtles did.

196
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,280
And I didn't go.

197
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,080
I don't still have this horrible nostalgia that I can't shake

198
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,080
like Ninja Turtles with Ghostbusters.

199
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,640
But I would have I would have been so obsessed with going to see it.

200
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,600
But I would absolutely have been freaked out because I was freaked out

201
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,840
at live theater. I was freaked out seeing Peter Pan.

202
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,360
Because the pirates walked up and down the like stairs

203
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,200
by where we were sitting and they poked their head out of the dressing room.

204
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,320
And I fucking shit in my pants.

205
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,800
Like I was so scared.

206
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,280
I thought it was real.

207
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,440
So this would have freaked me out, especially if when I was really

208
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,800
into Ghostbusters, which was three, four or five years old,

209
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,760
there would be no way I would have probably had to be taken out,

210
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,160
like crying like I was a Captain EO.

211
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
I saw it.

212
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh, of course.

213
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,480
I saw it. We know.

214
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,040
Of course, I think what a what a brave boy.

215
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,320
I think I was and I was racking my brain to try and think what version I would.

216
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,160
I may have seen both versions, but I think my family,

217
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,280
we went down with my grandparents in like 91 when I was like in first grade.

218
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,360
And we universal still pretty new at that point.

219
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,320
And it was cool.

220
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,280
We all liked it.

221
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,760
But like my brother was three years younger than me.

222
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,440
So like there wasn't a ton of there was there was not that many things

223
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,040
to do for kids that little.

224
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,280
I definitely remember writing E.T.

225
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,240
BT Back to the Future and Ghostbusters were the highlights for me.

226
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,080
Maybe King Kong, we skipped Jaws.

227
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,640
Lord knows what state Jaws would have been in in 91.

228
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,920
But I remember being very excited to hear there was both Ghostbusters

229
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,280
stuff and Back to the Future stuff.

230
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,960
And I was a weird kid.

231
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,280
And my parents had introduced me to Alfred Hitchcock, like

232
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,560
Alfred Hitchcock presents when it was like in syndication

233
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,640
by that point.

234
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,800
So that and the Nickelodeon studio.

235
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,040
So I was very excited for all of this and the Ghostbusters show.

236
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,360
I liked a lot. I did not like ghosts.

237
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,960
These ghosts were specifically very ghoulish looking.

238
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,120
But I knew my friends, the Ghostbusters would come out

239
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:52,040
to help, just like I knew my friend Doc Brown would save the day

240
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,400
and back to the future. I had to say, though, as a kid.

241
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,320
Yeah, I was all in on the Ghostbusters cartoon, both the original Ghostbusters

242
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,720
oddity and the real Ghostbusters.

243
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,320
I had all that stuff.

244
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,680
But as a kid, it drove me crazy that there was like no Back to the Future

245
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,360
merchandise to buy.

246
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,040
And now there is so much Back to the Future merchandise.

247
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,440
I could not care less.

248
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,200
There's plenty of Ghostbusters.

249
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,920
I saved my childhood obsessions for like X-Men 92 kind of shit.

250
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,480
That is what I've been kind of all in on for quarantine.

251
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,680
That expired theme park attraction.

252
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,320
So you were both you both obsessed with Ghostbusters or loved Ghostbusters,

253
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,120
the cartoon, because I was first cartoon.

254
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,960
I was that's the thing I saw the first.

255
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,520
And then I did see Ghostbusters two in the theater.

256
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,720
And I was just tense.

257
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,960
I just was scared the whole time.

258
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,440
The pink slime scared me.

259
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,440
I was upset that Venkman got arrested with them when they came into the restaurant

260
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,640
to tell them when they were in their long underwear, like soaking wet with the goo.

261
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,600
I was like, well, Venkman didn't do anything.

262
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,280
He wasn't with them.

263
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,840
I was like, I thought that for some reason.

264
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,600
I thought it was foolish for not taking a proton pack.

265
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,120
Like, why didn't you? Why did you just take the meters?

266
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,160
Like we we definitely had like used copies, used VHS's of Ghostbusters

267
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,960
and Ghostbusters to purchase from West Coast Video.

268
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,720
I did not like the first.

269
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,760
I liked Ghostbusters to more in the same reason I liked Return of the Jedi more.

270
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,640
There was more Jedi stuff.

271
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,200
There was the Ewoks.

272
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,040
There was Luke Skywalker at the height of his powers.

273
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,840
The the speeder bike chase and Ghostbusters to is just a little sillier.

274
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,080
They got the slime cannons like.

275
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,200
Yeah, I guess Jupiter.

276
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,360
It's more about like introducing.

277
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,280
All right. Well, now there's this thing or that thing.

278
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,960
It's like why you like a Batman forever, maybe more than an original.

279
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,800
Yeah, for sure.

280
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,200
I could not appreciate the Barb's thrown at EPA representative Walter Peck

281
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,440
that in the way that I appreciate those as I'm older.

282
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,520
But yeah, I was so excited for this show.

283
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,800
I'm surprised I didn't drag my family through the show multiple times. But

284
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,400
yeah, I like I said, I can't remember

285
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:13,160
which versions I would have seen because this only ran 1990 to 1996,

286
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,760
although they held on to the right for a while because there were three

287
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,640
different Ghostbusters street shows, three different variations

288
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,240
that involve the Ghostbusters going in and out of facades, trying to stop

289
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,480
Beetlejuice and then they would like menacing them.

290
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,560
But they would dance a lot.

291
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,040
It would be like a show, like a fun dance show.

292
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,560
Yeah, and I remember our world has now paired off like

293
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,560
Alf, no, wait, Alf fought the Gremlins and the Gremlins.

294
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,480
OK, the Gremlins were paired against

295
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,400
Beetlejuice and now the Ghostbusters are against Beetlejuice.

296
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,520
Why are theme parks trying to tear all of our favorite characters apart?

297
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,160
That's a good point.

298
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,720
I was I thought you were going to say that theme parks were forecasting

299
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,520
like what would probably happen with like movies eventually.

300
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,880
Like eventually there will just be Alf versus Gremlins movie or Beetlejuice.

301
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,680
I wish if only there was a movie as interesting as that ever.

302
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,400
That would be the best movie.

303
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,160
That's why I cherish the ride.

304
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,440
So you mean you'd rather imagine they do Ghostbusters versus Beetlejuice.

305
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,480
I mean, that would be the entire film.

306
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,680
You mean as opposed to like a magic movie full of wonder?

307
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,800
I I don't want to.

308
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,840
That's all I'll say.

309
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,400
I and it's you think that the trailer is just about a kid in a small town

310
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,640
hanging out at oil well, but then a magic, a sheet is lifted up

311
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,840
and it's the original car from the original one.

312
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,560
And then they drive around and Paul Rudd, it turns out, knows about all of it.

313
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,600
I don't know. I don't understand why.

314
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,000
I whatever it's it's here's what I think is why would you like that trailer?

315
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,120
Why would you think it's strange?

316
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,640
When it comes out in 2025, we'll know.

317
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,160
We'll know if it's good or bad.

318
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,640
Then I just think it's great that Ghostbusters are finally taking off

319
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,080
Madison Avenue and put on Main Street.

320
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,960
I'll say that. You know, me, I'm in the people there.

321
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,440
They're they're they're not blue state anymore.

322
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,240
They're red state.

323
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,560
The Ghostbusters are taking care of the red states.

324
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,920
Finally, this isn't I don't think this is a crazy thing.

325
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,680
Like there does seem to be a lot of movies in a franchise now.

326
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,920
Star Wars, Jurassic Park and this where the movie is about the original movies.

327
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,480
It's like it's a real about the myth of the original movies, which is like legend.

328
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,720
What if the legend was true?

329
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,600
Is the legend true?

330
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,520
And we got to grow up with all these movies that was the legend. Right. So

331
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,000
it wasn't isn't that better?

332
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,040
Like a new legend you get to see?

333
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,520
Not like, oh, my God, the suit.

334
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,160
Look, the logo is on the suit.

335
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,080
The logo is on the car.

336
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,080
The item still makes the sound if every it used to make.

337
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,280
And every yeah, like every single piece of the movie has to be like

338
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,440
doled out like a treat for you.

339
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,960
Like that's how this like a lot of this stuff is structured, where it's like.

340
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,560
And here you get a little now we get a little ghost trap for the audience.

341
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,960
And it's become like one per scene.

342
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,240
Well, we can't show them

343
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,640
the original Ghostbusters in the trailer are going to come in

344
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,320
in the later part of the movie, because everyone would be like,

345
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,720
you know, they would be so distracted with the original Ghostbusters.

346
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,080
They'd never accept the new characters.

347
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,960
We used to get it all at once.

348
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,200
All of it at one time.

349
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,080
This even happens within newer franchises.

350
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,920
I'm stealing this observation from from Bugman on Doughboys.

351
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,800
But he was talking about Pirates of the Caribbean.

352
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,080
And now there was one of them where like Orlando Bloom shows up for a second.

353
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,560
You're like, whoa, they got him.

354
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,240
Oh, my God, Orlando.

355
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,440
And then you're like, in 2003, he was they had him the whole time.

356
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,000
He was always in it.

357
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,840
Why are we excited?

358
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,960
He showed up to smoke a cigarette and leave.

359
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,360
Yeah, I don't.

360
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,720
Look, this is this is another podcast.

361
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,240
Yeah, this is another.

362
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,320
I know some people hate this perspective.

363
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,760
We're getting a lot. I understand why you do.

364
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,080
But well, you know, like and I have a more nuanced opinion of Star Wars

365
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,000
than I think people might think I do of the new ones.

366
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,720
But I was reading like Michael aren't talking about like writing Force Awakens.

367
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,440
And he's like, well, the problem was Luke.

368
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,240
Luke would come into the movie and he would just like kind of steal the focus.

369
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,400
And I was like, of course he would.

370
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,880
Yeah, he's the star of Star Wars.

371
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,400
He's what?

372
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,520
He's the star of the movies. Huh?

373
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,800
Frasier might steal focus from Frasier.

374
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,280
We will like other characters.

375
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,320
They're talking to Luke.

376
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,240
It's not like Luke's going to.

377
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,480
It's like if you see the movie and you go, I know who that is,

378
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,160
but I don't like anyone new.

379
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,920
It's like that's not you'll go.

380
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,120
Oh, I like these new characters, too.

381
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,160
And I like Luke. He's the star of these movies.

382
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,480
Anyway, we can we can not get Bill Murray in this Ghostbusters

383
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,280
making his little jokes and upstaging rock star Finn Wolfhard.

384
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,680
OK, we got Bill Murray in his little jokes.

385
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,480
He thinks he's so funny.

386
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,160
Thinks he owns this movie.

387
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,000
Come on, Bill Murray, take your 10 minutes of this movie and be happy about it.

388
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,600
Yeah. Green screen, Bill Murray in from some pub in Chicago.

389
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,280
They got him for an hour and they.

390
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,800
It's terrible.

391
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,960
He was like Bill Murray two years ago was like, I'll do it if you tell you what.

392
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,320
There's this thing called Zoom.

393
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,440
I don't know if you've heard of it.

394
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,520
He was the only person zooming back then.

395
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,040
An early investor making out like a bandit now.

396
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,000
No, it's great. It's this way that cast can reunite without having to get on a plane.

397
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,600
That's the best invention ever.

398
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,040
All right. OK, old man opinions.

399
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,440
Put him down for now. Let's let's be excited.

400
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,360
Let's talk about this show, which is a lot of fun.

401
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,360
I should have I should have seen it.

402
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,520
And there's this basic breakdown with it

403
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,800
that there were two versions of the show.

404
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,960
And it really is the the the tale of Universal Studios

405
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,320
in two shows, because one of them is about you are on the set.

406
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,400
Look, this is a recreation of the set where Ghostbusters happened

407
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,520
and then Ghostbusters things happen.

408
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,120
And then they redid it to be the characters.

409
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,680
And it is Rick Moranis, Lewis Tully and Walter Peck.

410
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,640
And and then the Ghostbusters.

411
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,960
Like, I think it's an excellent rewrite.

412
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,960
I think this is a really good study in

413
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,120
how, you know, the power of the rewrite.

414
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,880
And if you are, what if we save the reveal of the Gozer set?

415
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,960
Like we have it, but let's kind of build to it and don't show all our cards right away.

416
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,240
Yeah. And it's it's just also changing around from

417
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,240
they were trying to do the thing of universal.

418
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,440
Like, this is sort of how you how things are made.

419
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,360
And it's like, we don't care as much about that.

420
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,440
We'd rather see a guy playing Rick Moranis' character.

421
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,640
Like, we'd rather just be more in the world.

422
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,640
And, you know, not an obvious rewrite to do also.

423
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,720
Like, that's pretty cool that it ran for a little bit one way.

424
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,840
And then they found a way to get pretty great other characters that were missing.

425
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,800
They kind of like they kind of rounded it out and then packed a lot in.

426
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,280
It seems like they were answered like solving a practical issue, too,

427
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,800
because the show was short initially.

428
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,200
Yeah, it still is.

429
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,120
Even the second one. Yes, really.

430
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,480
But they I mean, what does they add five minutes to it?

431
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,320
It was like, no, they they practically doubled it.

432
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,520
The first show was like 11 and they they upped it to 20 in the second one.

433
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,480
That's that's a good capacity. That can hold more folks.

434
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,040
Yeah, I found some answers to this in the Sam Getaway

435
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,920
Universal versus Disney book.

436
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,840
The pre show was on the board.

437
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,440
The Louis Tully, the big pre show.

438
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,400
But they were cutting costs as they were racing to get it open.

439
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,160
And by cutting the pre show, the approximate cost of the pre show was

440
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,480
four hundred and thousand four hundred thousand dollars.

441
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,480
To do the rewrites, build the set, incorporate all this other stuff.

442
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,280
If you notice the like first version with the tour guide

443
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,400
explaining the ghost, very simple.

444
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,880
But then they they, you know, because it was a, you know,

445
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,320
pretty popular, it was a big hit.

446
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,920
They went back in and and added it back in.

447
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,000
So and then the second version, I thought was interesting,

448
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,480
kind of relinquishes the Ghostbusters to like the last few minutes of the show.

449
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,880
But it is more dynamic, like it is more dynamic.

450
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,840
They come in and it's a lot more actiony and save the day.

451
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,160
In a funny move, there were only three Ghostbusters who were in the show.

452
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,640
Three Ghostbusters who show up at the end.

453
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:52,560
I think because what happens is that is the same number of actors

454
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,360
you have to pay as the original version.

455
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:03,320
So in the original version, you have a tour guide, four Ghostbusters and and Zool.

456
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,360
So that's six.

457
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,640
And then the new version, you have three Ghostbusters,

458
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,920
Louis Tully, Walter Peck and Zool. That's six again.

459
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,240
So they replacing the tour guide.

460
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,280
Huh. So that kept the budget down.

461
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Yeah. Theme parks, famously, as we've especially recently,

462
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,840
cutting entertainment costs, cutting actors, but especially Universal

463
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,200
and especially back then as they were kind of finding this on their feet.

464
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,800
The other discoveries I made, some of the murderers row of potentially

465
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,280
actual murderers involved in this.

466
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,600
Gary Goddard, of course, had a hand in it.

467
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,720
And then always, why always a character I forgot about,

468
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,280
Peter Alexander, the Universal executive that went on to become,

469
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,040
I believe we talked about him before he became the high ranking Scientology member.

470
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,440
Oh, who made the movie.

471
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,240
We still got to watch that movie.

472
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,640
The anti he left the church and made that movie.

473
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,960
Yeah. Wow.

474
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,040
Why? When did that come up?

475
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,840
That came up in King Kong.

476
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,960
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

477
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,560
I guess so. Yeah.

478
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,160
Oh, man.

479
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,000
Was it called like it was called like the Church of Scientific Discovery

480
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,520
or something? Something like that.

481
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,000
Because he went all the way through.

482
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,880
He went OT, however many.

483
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,360
OT five or T7.

484
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,720
He got all the way to the top and then he went, oh, I don't.

485
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,760
Maybe not. No. Yeah.

486
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,760
The most prominent defectors.

487
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,480
Yeah, indeed. Wow.

488
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,800
I love all these guys.

489
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,720
Well, I don't love all of them.

490
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,880
I don't like Goddard, but I like this.

491
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,680
Obviously, I found it.

492
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:43,000
The Church of Scientific Spiritualism as run by El Conrad Powers.

493
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,080
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

494
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,320
Man, I got to watch that whole thing.

495
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,240
We were dissing Paul Thomas Anderson for not going that hard, I think.

496
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,680
Weren't we? Oh, that's right.

497
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,080
Yeah. Yeah. Well, he veered too far from the name, first of all,

498
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,200
so you don't know who he's making fun of.

499
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,120
Your parodies have to be why you got to do like Ronald Grump.

500
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,520
How else will we know that you're satirizing the times?

501
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,560
Yeah, you would never know.

502
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,680
Wow. Yeah.

503
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,480
So the pub.

504
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,160
Oh, you know, another thing I thought was interesting

505
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,000
were the guys that made and I don't know their names,

506
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,640
made the killer clowns from outer space, made the you got their names.

507
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,440
I think so. The the Chiodo brothers.

508
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,040
I'm saying the judge and Ghostbusters, too. Yeah.

509
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,320
Yeah. And they did the Team American.

510
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,880
Oh, right. Right, right, right, right.

511
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,600
And there are like very killer clowns ask like ghosts,

512
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,640
like clown ghosts, essentially that pop up during this thing, too.

513
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,200
Yeah, that's a lot like killer clowns from outer space.

514
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,760
That's a very that's an extremely scary clown.

515
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,760
I don't want to say I don't want to talk about a scary clown

516
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,400
and then end up talking about another scary clown.

517
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

518
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,000
We just focus on this one. Yeah, I don't know who you're talking about.

519
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,960
Then, of course, then I started thinking about last year at Halloween Horror Nights.

520
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,880
Of course, Universal had both a Ghostbusters maze and a killer clowns maze.

521
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,360
And then I started getting sad that I won't get to go to haunts this year.

522
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,000
Yeah, that's right. Well, you like them.

523
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,440
I do. We're trying to figure out workarounds, right?

524
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,720
Like, that's the plan to give away what are the rest of our months.

525
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,320
But we I think we're trying to solve how to do things in person,

526
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,160
even in this hobbled way.

527
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,920
So stay tuned to either feed and we'll figure that out.

528
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,120
We'll figure some interesting creative solutions.

529
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,520
People haunt businesses across the country have come up with.

530
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,480
So it'll be exciting to talk about those.

531
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,720
But I just I did find it interesting that like Ghostbusters and killer clowns

532
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,200
have hung around in the universal family now.

533
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,240
And Ghostbusters wasn't represented in the park so strongly for many years.

534
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,400
But now they're back.

535
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,920
Dan Aykroyd was on the red carpet last year.

536
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,760
Very exciting.

537
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,080
Crystals Crystal Head Vodka was sold at all the different kiosks

538
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,560
to buy drinks at Horror Nights as well.

539
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,320
Very exciting.

540
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,120
Now, this is a whole you know, we had our little tiff about

541
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:19,080
Casamigos, but what was never in question for me is that Casamigos is good.

542
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,960
I now have a bottle purchased for thirty nine ninety nine.

543
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,000
You can believe it.

544
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,240
Pretty good. The insane price.

545
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:33,080
But I like I've never thought like this is a novelty, like Clooney thought of doing

546
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,720
like it is obviously the representations always been very good.

547
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,520
I've Crystal Head is not good.

548
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,480
I don't know if we've gotten into this before.

549
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,800
It's it's a I in from my experience.

550
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,760
I think it is a not good vodka, but I would maybe have to try it again.

551
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,400
I actually have not had it alone.

552
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,560
It was all mixed drinks mixed with a bunch of sugar crap when I was drinking it

553
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,560
Universal. So I actually don't know how good it is, but I'm pretty sure in all of

554
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,360
the in the many different videos I've watched of Dan Aykroyd hawking this stuff,

555
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,160
he's like, well, it's a small as vodka.

556
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,320
It's very smooth.

557
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,640
Like he's he also makes sort of the claim that Clooney does.

558
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,960
I'm a little congested. That wasn't my best act, right.

559
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
But I don't know.

560
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,600
That's probably what he would zone.

561
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,280
But he maintains, I think that it's also like you can sip it and it's not

562
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,360
something that would burn like a like a regular cheap alcohol.

563
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,160
I think I'm willing to try it again.

564
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,320
Obviously, it is a cool bottle, and I appreciate the theming on the bottle

565
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,640
because Casamigos and Terra Mana are both very generic looking

566
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,000
bottles. They don't have any sort of gimmick to them.

567
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,880
That's very true. Have we discussed on the show?

568
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,160
I'm sure we texted about it.

569
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,640
But when I was I went to when I was in Canada

570
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,080
a little while ago that I was getting targeted ads

571
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:53,000
that I only saw there for Dan Aykroyd celebrating National Caesar Day.

572
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,480
Yes. Which Caesar is a drink involving

573
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,800
it's like it's like a Bloody Mary.

574
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,840
It's it is Clamado. Right.

575
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,560
It's like a tomato vodka drink, right?

576
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,520
I think. Yeah.

577
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,160
And it's got like a big piece. Sorry.

578
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,440
I will tell you, I don't know if I said this at the time.

579
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,280
Maybe I did.

580
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,160
I I shot a commercial for that drink

581
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,680
with the Russo brothers right before Captain America 2 came out.

582
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,000
You got directed by them in that right before.

583
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,760
Yes. This is one of this is one of those.

584
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,360
This is one of those times in my career.

585
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,520
And it's happened a couple of times where I did really well

586
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,240
in front of like very important people.

587
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,800
And I thought maybe something would happen.

588
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,440
And then it didn't.

589
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,600
But I thought I booked two spots with the Russo brothers

590
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,520
right before Captain America 2.

591
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,000
And I was going to be in an American spot and a Canadian spot.

592
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,440
And there was some like sag rule that said I couldn't do both.

593
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,240
So they wanted me for the second one, the Canada spot,

594
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,320
because it would be there was more lines and they liked me.

595
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,280
That's what I was told, at least, because it was a smaller cast.

596
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,320
Because these were you saw these commercials.

597
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,680
It was Alison Brie and and somebody maybe was Adam Scott, I think.

598
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,880
And it was like vodka commercial for like Sky vodka.

599
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,520
And like there were all these celebrities at this party.

600
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,960
And then there was a Canada version that was me and two other people

601
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,680
that weren't any Canadian celebrities, I guess.

602
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,840
And it was all about the Caesar.

603
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,760
And I didn't know what the hell this was.

604
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,360
And they were like, yeah, all the like the people on set making the food

605
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,560
like we're making Caesars.

606
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,960
And that's the first I had ever heard of that.

607
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,480
And then the commercial never aired.

608
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,640
It never aired. Yeah.

609
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,480
And I. Oh, man, I can't watch you in a Caesar ad.

610
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,240
You cannot watch me in a Canadian Caesar ad directed by the Russo brothers.

611
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,560
Also, all my lines had been cut that morning, too.

612
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,560
You just went, hmm.

613
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,840
Just like just nod that you think it's a delicious Caesar.

614
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,320
The most pathetic moment of the shoot is that I ad libbed the word cool

615
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,680
and made Joe Russo laugh and I went, OK, well, at least we said to that.

616
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,200
You'll probably want me to suit up in the nail.

617
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,720
Yeah, no, I'll be I'll be at least like a sidekick.

618
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,160
Yes, that is that is honestly I was like, well, you know what?

619
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,840
Maybe it's not like the main sidekick, but maybe it's like

620
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,760
Kat Dennings role in Thor, where she's like Natalie Portman sidekick.

621
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,640
Like I could do that.

622
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,560
I mean, it's still possible.

623
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,160
If I run into these guys, I I booked it, so we'll see.

624
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,920
Sorry, they already got a DC Pearson.

625
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,680
You know, well, that made me feel good, too, because DC Pearson's in

626
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,800
Captain America 2, Captain America, which I saw like weeks after this.

627
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,240
And I go, DC Pearson's in this movie.

628
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,280
I could be in this movie.

629
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,320
If they could put a Shaggy Improv guy in.

630
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,920
Anyway, well, really, all of the.

631
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,520
What I'm all about are broken dreams.

632
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,440
Let me bring it back to what's important.

633
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,720
We're forgetting the some of the big ingredients in Clamado

634
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,320
sugar, MSG and dried clam broth.

635
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,960
The name comes from a portmanteau of clam and tomato.

636
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,440
So you can't forget the clams at Clamado.

637
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,560
And I just as a kid, remember my grandmother having cans of Clamado

638
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,680
in the house and I'd be going like, what is that?

639
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,760
And then explaining it.

640
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,000
And I was like, that's disgusting.

641
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,960
Does our tequila mix well with clam?

642
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,200
I think it does. Oh, gosh.

643
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,440
I believe it does. You know, we'll make sure to pair it to be able to. Yeah.

644
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,320
I hope. Yeah, it has to.

645
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,600
Everything we'd make has to pair well with clam.

646
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,640
The podcast, even listening to it, you can eat a clam and have a nice experience.

647
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,440
Oh, I love a clam. Oh, so it's I ate a big plate of clams.

648
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,720
We were at the boathouse on our trip to Florida.

649
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,280
Delicious. Remember that.

650
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,000
We're nice there. So, yeah.

651
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,840
So well, that's all right.

652
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,040
So that's that's our pairing recommendation, right?

653
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,280
Is especially with the second gates there, they're

654
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,000
especially constructed to be good with clams.

655
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,800
And so what are more factoids that that clams would be?

656
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,480
Oh, so tasty. Let's see.

657
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,160
Next hearing, I am always impressed when any sort of cool illusion happens

658
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,360
that it's a pepper's ghost.

659
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,320
It's always pepper's ghost.

660
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,480
Anytime there's something cool and you go, well, how do they do that?

661
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,960
They go, it's a pepper's ghost.

662
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,200
They've been doing it for forever because like in this show,

663
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,400
there's like Slimer appears in the first version.

664
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,280
Now he appears in both.

665
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,120
He there's sort of like glass in front of the stage.

666
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,360
And they've got like giant animatronics.

667
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,720
And then they just like the Haunted Mansion, like every other theme park thing

668
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,880
that makes a ghost appear.

669
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,840
It's a pepper's ghost.

670
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,440
And there's an animatronic and it's sort of being reflected onto the glass

671
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,000
to make it look like you can see through it.

672
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,320
And they do the same thing here.

673
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:41,400
Just as effective, very cool looking that it'll never go away.

674
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,560
I don't think pepper's ghost will ever go away.

675
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,240
Well, think about how everybody came back from Coachella 2012

676
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:53,640
and they're all freaking out because they saw Tupac in front of their eyes,

677
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,360
reunited with Dr.

678
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,560
Dre. And how was this done with a pepper's ghost?

679
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,760
People are as exactly as excited like people coming back

680
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,120
and, you know, their Coachella feathers and whatnot.

681
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,440
And they're they're as psyched as, you know, people

682
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,040
like twirling mustaches in 1845

683
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,400
or whenever they started doing this effect from vaudeville to Coachella.

684
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,240
It'll never not be a hit.

685
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,000
Pepper's good. Like, yeah, in the far, far future, when we're fighting over water,

686
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,800
they'll be like a little like kind of roadside attraction.

687
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,400
And it'll be like they'll show a picture of what like a city used to look like,

688
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,920
what like what land with grass used to look like.

689
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,320
And people go, well, how does that how does that look like kind of a ghostly thing?

690
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,480
It'd be like, oh, pepper's ghost.

691
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,600
It's like we're still using this great illusion.

692
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,280
And they use it really effectively in this one

693
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,760
to make you think like killer clowns are on the stage or this weird,

694
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:59,640
like like jailbird ghost that like turns his head around.

695
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,040
Yeah. Yeah.

696
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,080
Maybe there's not quite the Scaleri brothers, but like kind of like the

697
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,560
the bad the the the villains in the courtroom scene and Ghostbusters two.

698
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,200
Hmm.

699
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,000
I don't want to distract, but there may be a full episode that is just like

700
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,000
Pepper's ghost in general so that we can learn about the life of the man,

701
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,320
John Henry Pepper, and also

702
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,800
learn about I'm just like skimming through various uses of it.

703
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,840
And there's somewhere there's a there's a tennis museum

704
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,800
where they pepper's ghost in the ghost of John McEnroe.

705
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,720
He's still alive, isn't he? Yes, he is.

706
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,960
It's weird to do a well, it's you know, that's like Ray in

707
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,320
in Star Wars, you know, Daisy Ridley is alive,

708
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,520
but we can pepper's ghost her into this ride.

709
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,800
Oh, that's true.

710
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,560
I want to be there every day in seven different rooms across the world.

711
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,840
So, yeah, John McEnroe doesn't want to hang out at this.

712
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,760
He's he's grumpy.

713
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,320
Yeah, I want to learn more about this pepper's ghost.

714
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,840
John McEnroe. That's great.

715
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,040
Yeah, they hit honestly a big pepper's ghost episode feels like it would be

716
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,360
three hours or more like it could go that long.

717
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,280
Well, I called the audible of like,

718
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,520
I need a I need a second gate episode on Ghostbusters, the great fright way,

719
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,080
because I don't think I've ever been as upset as I was like an 18.

720
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,640
And I was like, wow, there's a Ghostbusters thing back at Universal.

721
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,640
And it was a little street show again, Ghostbusters fight Beetlejuice.

722
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,600
And what it was, it was just like, oh, no, that's what this is.

723
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,000
Like, it was just so heartbreaking.

724
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,360
And they give us it. Give us one detail.

725
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,560
Well, we'll hold on to it.

726
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,920
But like what I mean, I assume they dance or whatever.

727
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,280
But like, to what?

728
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,160
Um, uh, the hits of the day,

729
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,800
like in sync and Britney Spears.

730
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,920
Don't they sing like bye bye bye?

731
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,560
They sing bye bye bye.

732
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,920
And it's played like, ew, isn't this disgusting?

733
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,720
These men dancing to this music, which, by the way,

734
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,480
we're playing in all corners of this theme park.

735
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,520
And then graduates,

736
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,800
several of them graduates of Universal Studios, as we'll discuss.

737
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,600
That's true.

738
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,960
And then in that show, they were wearing more like the newer

739
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,320
Ghostbuster outfits, like the cartoon Ghostbusters.

740
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,480
Or was it the extreme Ghostbusters outfits?

741
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,360
Yes, I that I think is worth tying into.

742
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,360
It was extreme Ghostbusters, colon the great fright way.

743
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,920
OK, the weird kind of syndicate.

744
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,320
Like, I think it was just in syndication, like reboot of the Ghostbusters

745
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:53,280
for the mid to late 90s, where they were a little more extreme and cool.

746
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,720
When you say extreme, what are we talking about here?

747
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,760
Like 90s version of extreme.

748
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,840
They had spiky hair. That's what we're talking about.

749
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,040
Like spiky hair, purple spiky hair.

750
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,600
And Egon is a mentor.

751
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,680
And yeah, I think there were some cool people working on that behind the scenes,

752
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,920
like people who would go on to do concept art for like the Matrix.

753
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,520
We're doing concept art for extreme Ghostbusters.

754
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,160
But that did not translate to the extreme Ghostbusters great fright way.

755
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,040
Also, great fright way and a nod to great white way

756
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,360
name of Broadway in the theater district in New York.

757
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,400
Again, they were mostly dancing to like pop hits of the

758
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,400
five years before the show went on.

759
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,400
So right. So you want Broadway?

760
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,000
You want like some Starlight Express or something?

761
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,280
Yes. If it did bring Broadway show to it, I would have watched it all day. Yeah.

762
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,280
Ghostbusters music from chess.

763
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,320
Ghostbusters is interesting because Ghostbusters, I sort of

764
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,960
I didn't I haven't kept up with it like Ninja Turtles.

765
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,520
And it's just like I think it's I don't know.

766
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,160
It's interesting because I never really watched extreme Ghostbusters.

767
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,400
I have not seen Answer the Call.

768
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,200
Isn't there another thing I'm missing, too?

769
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,160
There's there's like comics.

770
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,000
There was a video game.

771
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,800
Yeah, I didn't even play that they they did the voices and it's right.

772
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,920
Considered an unofficial sequel, which I heard people were people liked.

773
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,680
But I don't know if it really did.

774
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,400
You know, yeah, I don't know that you can actually call it a sequel in the web.

775
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,880
But that's a high bar for a video game.

776
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,840
Seems like people.

777
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,840
I think people did like it.

778
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,480
I would be interested in playing that. But yeah, it's interesting.

779
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,880
So I don't know too much about what kind of spiky hair the extreme Ghostbusters had.

780
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,720
Yeah. But I do know about Ninja Turtles, Venus de Milo.

781
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,000
And I do know I know I know that.

782
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,760
Can you unknow about Venus de Milo?

783
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,000
I would like to see Venus come back also.

784
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,960
That's a pitch I have.

785
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,160
Well, they'll have a chance.

786
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,320
I would like to see her come back in my arms.

787
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,240
No. What?

788
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,200
No, she's weird.

789
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,840
I don't approve of the first time I've ever expressed being attracted to a woman,

790
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,680
I guess, other than many is the Venus de Milo, the female

791
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,360
Ninja Turtle from the late 90s.

792
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,000
Terrible taste.

793
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,480
She looks she's it's so creepy.

794
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,560
Well, they're all creepy in that show.

795
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,440
They all look terrifying.

796
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,800
They all look just like, like just like night.

797
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,320
Like we just had like years prior seen movies where the turtles

798
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,720
look pretty good in all the movies.

799
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,720
And then they just found like much shittier costumes

800
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,400
and decided to show them to us every week.

801
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,520
Yeah, yeah.

802
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,880
This is a way that they all like stuck their teeth out.

803
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,720
They just all looked like horses or something.

804
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,960
Oh, yeah, yeah.

805
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,440
They were ninja horses.

806
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,480
Yeah, that that 90 that late 90s.

807
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,920
That is a creepy. We'll do it.

808
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,880
We'll do something with it.

809
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,280
We'll get to it. We'll cover it.

810
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,800
I do you want to talk about, you know, it's a fun little thing to get us off track.

811
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,640
The the first attempt at a Ghostbusters attraction,

812
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,040
which we talked a little about before we started recording,

813
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:06,880
that there was an attempt made to do a shooter ride at Six Flags

814
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,120
in the the mid to late 80s, which would have been if they pulled it off,

815
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,960
the first of its kind and sort of with a similar premise to what the show,

816
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,040
what the Universal show becomes, which is like recruiting you.

817
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,040
And this is the recruitment exercise.

818
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,120
I mean, it's men in black, really.

819
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,160
But the I don't know if the bride was going to be called this

820
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,880
or if this was just the setting, but the but the ride at least takes place

821
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,800
in a place called the Hauntington Hotel.

822
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,720
That's good. Yeah.

823
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,680
And it seems cool.

824
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,440
I don't know.

825
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,680
I don't know if you saw any concept art.

826
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,160
It's really like angular, boxy little cars and.

827
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,280
Yes, Slashfilm had a nice roundup about it with the concept art.

828
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,040
Yeah, that would have been cool.

829
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,960
It's crazy that like it took so long for like Buzz,

830
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,000
like your astro blasters and men in black, like I think smaller parks

831
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,840
were experimenting with a lot of places that like infrared shooting galleries.

832
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,960
But it's interesting to me that like Hauntington Hotel

833
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:14,080
and Dick Tracy's Crime Stoppers could have like broken

834
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,200
both broken very big for this format.

835
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,840
And then it took another couple of decades for it to sort of catch on.

836
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,960
Yeah, I have seen these are cool.

837
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,560
These are cool, weird, like like urinal style vehicles.

838
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,560
They're kind of like troughs with the Ghostbuster logo on the side.

839
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,400
But I like I think in the Intamin was going to be the like

840
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,920
manufacturer of the ride system.

841
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,720
And you said like, yeah, Bally's, the gaming and casino concern

842
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,480
was was owned Six Flags at that point and then sold it off.

843
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,000
I mean, yeah, this is I wouldn't be surprised if we get something

844
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,840
like this somewhere.

845
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,560
I mean, I guess it probably depends on the success of the new movie.

846
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,880
But I think people went nuts for that Ghostbuster maze last year.

847
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,280
And it was very well done.

848
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,720
And it was really fun to just be up close to all that stuff.

849
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,360
So I wouldn't be surprised if they do something like this eventually.

850
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,480
Obviously, it's in ten years primed for more permanent attractions at places.

851
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,840
And, you know, there was like it was the first void

852
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,040
property, it feels like.

853
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,840
And we didn't get to do it, but it sounds like it was cool.

854
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,000
We'll never get to. Yeah, I don't know.

855
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,520
It's yeah, I don't know that.

856
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,480
I feel like the most what you don't do post this.

857
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,520
Well, I mean, because it's because it's like it might go bankrupt.

858
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,080
It might just be gone entirely regardless.

859
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:49,120
Yeah, but like picking up picking up items and not being able to see

860
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,480
where you are.

861
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,920
Can you imagine?

862
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,120
All right, so we're going to put the four of you in a room

863
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,160
and the room is, you know, it's like 10 by 10 feet.

864
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,080
And you got to go down this small hallway.

865
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,440
So you might bump into each other or cough on each other.

866
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,680
Don't worry about it.

867
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,440
Well, you'll have a mask on blindly at items in front of you.

868
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,320
You won't be able to see and you have a mask also.

869
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,880
So you can't breathe freely.

870
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,400
It's the only part of your body that isn't covered in the void.

871
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,480
Unless they make a full mask, just cover your whole head.

872
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,160
And then they like decontaminate it in between.

873
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,280
Like a daft punk sort of set up.

874
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,840
And they all and they just in the in the when you put the backpack on it,

875
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,960
it shoots Regeneron into your body.

876
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,720
Like that also could help.

877
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,680
Yeah. And then the powers aren't just in the game.

878
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,880
The power is in you.

879
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,440
You can get out of there and start like jumping higher than you ever have,

880
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,360
running faster than you ever have.

881
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,480
And I think that folks were now sponsored by Regeneron.

882
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,280
We're going to we're debuting the sponsor here on the second gate,

883
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,000
but you'll be hearing mostly ads where there's actually going to be a lot less

884
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,800
theme park content and like there's going to be like 60 percent

885
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,680
Regeneron discussion. Yeah. Yeah.

886
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,320
So prepare for that.

887
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:11,200
Um, yeah, so I like I I would think, especially because we're in such

888
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:16,680
a nostalgia culture at the moment, that this and even I know we've

889
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,400
talked about it a lot, like it feels like you got to put back to the future

890
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,120
back in some way eventually.

891
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,000
It really does. I could like that.

892
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Maybe that's too crazy because they're not making they haven't made a new one yet

893
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,560
because Zemeckis is alive.

894
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,400
But as soon as he's in the ground, that ride,

895
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:39,080
that new movie and that ride is coming in a Ruth Bader Ginsburg fashion.

896
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,320
All of the vultures will be waiting right there.

897
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:47,360
Two weeks later, like they just they demolish another ride.

898
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,960
I guess. What's this shit?

899
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,200
It's a note about a dying wish.

900
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,040
Throw it away.

901
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,040
Disney owned Simpson.

902
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,080
So they just demolish Simpsons and back to the future starts being built.

903
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,720
Oh, Hill Valley.

904
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:03,400
Yeah. You build the Hill Valley, like Main Street, half 55, half 85.

905
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,320
And it's just built on the old Institute of Future Technology.

906
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,840
It's based on it's based on the new Back to the Future with Finn Wolfhard.

907
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,040
It's it's yeah.

908
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,880
With Finn Wolfhard, a tick tock, a tick tock star we don't know yet.

909
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,400
Rebel Wilson is Doc Brown.

910
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,000
Mm hmm. Sure. Yeah.

911
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,680
And then or it could go, you know,

912
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,840
Epic Universe is pretty much dead still at this point.

913
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,480
So that could end up being we never see the original

914
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,000
ideas for Universal's Epic Universe.

915
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,160
And it's like Universal's cartoon world where it's like, well,

916
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,440
this is where it started.

917
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:43,440
And then like 2.0 has Hill Valley.

918
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,640
I mean, that would be great.

919
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,680
Wouldn't it be a good idea for Epic Universe to just have kind of the

920
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,400
this is going to sound gross, but like a throwback zone or an 80s

921
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,280
zone, like, don't you think there would be an appeal and like, well, this is where

922
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:03,320
back to the future and Ghostbusters and yes, whatever else you want.

923
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:07,800
It would be the most popular part of that park, probably.

924
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,560
Yeah. Just like like let them weed through what has

925
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,280
been determined to be a perennial.

926
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,440
Like, what do people always want to go to from that era and just they

927
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,320
lives here forever? Yeah.

928
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,640
It'd be gigantic.

929
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:23,240
Well, and Disney's got that play pavilion and there's all this talk about

930
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:27,200
like there's a black box ride that can be switched in and out every now and then.

931
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,920
Will they use that for like a newer new properties

932
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,000
and then switch it to something vintage?

933
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,360
And the way these companies always copy each other, it's like Samsung

934
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,840
or Android and iPhone just going back and forth, taking the same

935
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:45,800
designs like will Universal just do their own like black box kind of thing?

936
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,240
No, I'm skeptical of that black box.

937
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,760
That black box feels like if they do build it, it's like

938
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,600
they say it'll be changed out every year and it'll it'll not be.

939
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,400
It'll be the same thing for 30 years and then it'll go away.

940
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,240
I mean, yeah, that's certainly been the history.

941
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,280
Yeah, that's always what happened.

942
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,040
Yeah. Remember how like at the DreamWorks Theater for now, featuring this

943
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,560
Kung Fu Panda thing, and certainly this won't just be sitting here still

944
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,080
in 11 years.

945
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,520
You know, I will give them credit.

946
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:18,720
I will give Star Tours credit because they put a new thing in every movie.

947
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,280
I wasn't like they actually did it.

948
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,240
They did. And, you know, we've been mean about Star Wars

949
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,320
and this podcast and other podcasts.

950
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,960
I think the episode nine scene is great.

951
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,840
I think that was a blast.

952
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,040
The exit because there's two.

953
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:38,120
Yeah, you're splashing around and oh, that was your first part

954
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,840
when you're not on Exegol, when you're on.

955
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,760
End or when is the because that the ruins of the Death Star

956
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,920
is the ruins of the Death Star, but they're on are they on Endor?

957
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,800
No, it's on a different.

958
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:54,120
It's on a different moon of Endor, I think, because Endor is always confusing

959
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:58,160
because Endor Ewok planet is a moon of Endor.

960
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,440
Yes, there's like they're all moons of Endor, but they also just call it Endor.

961
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,480
So it's hard and like Dago buys a system,

962
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,080
but he is on Lucas on Dago on the second one.

963
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,440
It's confusing. Right, right.

964
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,720
So they're on a different planet that's nearby the Ewok planet

965
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,000
in an episode nine.

966
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,160
And that one. Yes, you're on the splashy one.

967
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,720
That's all I know. Yeah, it's a splash planet.

968
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,240
I wanted a little. That's all I need to know.

969
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,760
I wanted a little more lightning

970
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,840
in the second part, I will say, of the Exegol part of that.

971
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,440
That's not it. That's not a bad note.

972
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,040
I will also say Billy D.

973
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:39,000
Williams appearance in the ride is far more satisfying than in the movie.

974
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,600
It's like, great.

975
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,760
You're so happy to see him in the ride.

976
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,080
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

977
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,560
Not that you're not in the movie, but like you're the expect.

978
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,040
All he's got to do in the ride is say, hey, what's going on?

979
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,360
And you're like, oh, yeah, and it's you.

980
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,400
It's so exciting. Yeah.

981
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,640
In there might be the best.

982
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,880
I might vote for that as best hologram.

983
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Although I was also there when I was with you, Mike,

984
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,680
when there was like a Star Wars preview.

985
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,320
That when the first time that it was BB eight,

986
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,680
people flipped the fuck out.

987
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,600
It was so excited. I did, too.

988
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,840
Wow. Like we haven't even met him in the movie yet.

989
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,920
And people are just so psyched.

990
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,880
It was it was might have been like a special night.

991
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,720
We were there. I believe so.

992
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,120
Everybody was like excited to see the new scene.

993
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,120
Yeah, that was very fun.

994
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,240
Mm hmm. We're so far off.

995
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:32,240
This is like it's not a ton with these shows.

996
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,360
I can see why we're getting off.

997
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,520
I'm also just in a mood.

998
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,920
I'm in a mood of well, sure today.

999
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,320
So I apologize.

1000
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:43,920
But the I you know, I'll say about the second version,

1001
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,280
which is it's funny, the second version is very much what you associate

1002
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,520
what I associate, at least with Universal, the kind of like

1003
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,680
it's a little more like sarcastic than like Disney stuff.

1004
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,520
It's a little more self aware.

1005
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:03,560
It is like essentially like a timeshare or MLM presentation to,

1006
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,320
as we said, open a Ghostbusters franchise.

1007
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:11,880
I think the videos, the like infomercial kind of videos of like

1008
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,480
all the people who started Ghostbusters franchise is like

1009
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,880
there's an old lady with a walker.

1010
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:21,200
There's a man who is very clearly supposed to be like,

1011
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,880
is it a Boris Yeltsin?

1012
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,720
Yes, yes, yes. Yes, it's.

1013
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,080
He has the birthmark.

1014
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,080
Oh, it's Gorbachev.

1015
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,200
Gorbachev. Yeah.

1016
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,000
With the birthmark.

1017
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,440
And he says, I was once the head of a great socialist republic.

1018
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,840
And that got a big response from the audience

1019
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,600
when in the the clip I watched of it.

1020
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,040
And then, yeah, Lewis does some gross out like goo slime stuff

1021
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,800
with the the kid and like the other audience members.

1022
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,360
They pull on stage like I thought that was all fun.

1023
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:56,280
The Universal tapes to advertise the park had more jokes in it

1024
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,840
than the new Ghostbusters trailer.

1025
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,840
They remembered that the tone is supposed to be comedic.

1026
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,880
Yeah.

1027
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,120
So yeah, absolutely.

1028
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,120
Yeah. And you know what?

1029
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,880
I mean, granted, I'm just watching random samplings like, you know,

1030
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,560
there's not like a great version of this to watch on YouTube, either version.

1031
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:22,520
But if you YouTube Ghostbusters spectacular, you know, probably the one

1032
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:26,200
with the most views from 1990 versus the one with the most views

1033
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,280
from several years later,

1034
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,880
that, you know, there's sort of not much going on with the audience

1035
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,720
in the original one.

1036
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,920
They're just watching and it's fun and whatever.

1037
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,080
The the rewrote the rewritten version kills.

1038
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,160
People are like not only laughing, but screaming and applauding.

1039
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:46,520
And like they really get the crowd so much more juiced up.

1040
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,720
I think it shows you that video is great.

1041
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,480
The the particular Tully performer was fantastic.

1042
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,640
And I imagine a lot of them were.

1043
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:59,320
That's a pretty great theme park character to have figured out.

1044
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:04,120
Yeah, it's it's fun to see how the changes just really,

1045
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,600
really sailed with the crowd. Yeah.

1046
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:12,680
I I feel like the horror nights, Mike, I don't know if you you probably like Janine.

1047
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,040
There was an actor doing Janine in the Horror Nights house.

1048
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,680
Was there a Louis Tully in the Horror Nights house, too?

1049
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,400
I don't think Janine last year was very good.

1050
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,000
She was very good, Janine.

1051
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,520
And I think this guy does a pretty good Louis Tully

1052
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,520
in the in the you would spooktacular show.

1053
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,240
Try to hang around in there because she had like different lines,

1054
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,880
but she would like to wait for a while.

1055
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,560
Like she would like she would say, we got one.

1056
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:42,120
She would do the whole and it was very yeah, that was I really can't.

1057
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,480
You guys, both of you would have loved that.

1058
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,600
I mean, there's certainly like jumps like little jump scares.

1059
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,440
And it's loud and stuff.

1060
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,160
But like that was so much fun to walk through.

1061
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,920
Yeah, sounds like it sounds really well done.

1062
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:59,200
And this is stuff you want to see physicalized,

1063
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:03,360
you know, like how like it's it's that thing where, you know,

1064
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:07,680
seeing Muppets and Muppet attractions and it's the medium they were made in.

1065
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:12,680
So when you see Sweetums, that's just that is how Sweetums is in the movies, too.

1066
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,520
And so seeing something that was done as a puppet.

1067
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,600
And now it's in front of you as a puppet done the same way,

1068
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:25,080
like just seeing Slimer physical is so cool.

1069
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,280
And I don't I don't have it. I think it's on my laptop.

1070
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,240
But I found like a screenshot from a universal like brochure

1071
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,320
at the time where Dan Aykroyd is hanging out in the park

1072
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,480
next to the car and Slimer is poking out of it.

1073
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,000
And there's a bizarre caption about,

1074
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,640
you know, he he he villainized to the Ghostbusters in the first film.

1075
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,120
But now he and Dan Aykroyd are best of friends.

1076
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:55,280
Yes, because in the one street show Street Busters, he would pop out of the Ecto.

1077
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,080
I guess the Ecto one was it?

1078
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,800
It didn't seem as detailed as the Ecto two was Ecto one.

1079
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,360
The the con I like how like ghoulish they made, like a lot of the promotional art,

1080
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,160
this giant billboard. Oh, yeah. Ugly Slimer.

1081
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,560
It's so textured.

1082
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,600
All those original universal billboards are so cool.

1083
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,440
Imagine living there at that time, the excitement you'd have.

1084
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:23,720
But for the redo, they put the one complaint I had in the second show

1085
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:31,080
is I loved in the movie, like as a kid, I wanted to be the funny one, like Venkman.

1086
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,440
And but I knew I was probably more of a Louis Tully.

1087
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,920
And in the second Ghostbusters,

1088
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,600
when Louis Tully gets in the jumpsuit and the proton pack

1089
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:46,520
and like Janine kisses him on the cheek, like it's so great.

1090
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:50,200
So like I wish they had like taken a moment to put him in the jumpsuit

1091
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,720
because he's just in like khakis at a baby blue blazer in this promotional image

1092
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,000
and in the second version of the show.

1093
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,280
I like that. And that was it's kind of fun.

1094
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:05,400
But he's also like in the way, like when he gets the proton back on,

1095
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:09,120
the Ghostbusters like yell at him in this show of like, get out of the way,

1096
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,040
you're not helping.

1097
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,600
When you were a kid, were you like, I'm like Louis?

1098
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:20,480
I I I felt like I was like a little dwee.

1099
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,240
Like, you know, I knew I was a little bit of a dweeby kid.

1100
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:27,960
Like, you were young and like, did you really kind of think of yourself like that?

1101
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:31,880
I don't think I sort of put anything like that on myself until I was a little older.

1102
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:36,120
At least like Spangler, at least like Egon, you know,

1103
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,320
especially, yeah, when I got the glasses.

1104
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:45,600
I mean, everyone, I think I like that Bill Murray was the funny one,

1105
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:51,800
but that Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis were very serious about the rules of Ghostbusting.

1106
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,120
I liked that as a kid.

1107
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,960
That's interesting. I'm just I'm just interested, like if you were sort of watching

1108
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,240
Louis Tully and thinking like he was your avatar as a kid.

1109
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,400
Well, I think I just like that.

1110
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,600
Like, he's kind of like bumbling and then he gets to be the hero

1111
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:10,000
when he's like blasting the slime on the is it the art museum?

1112
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,440
They end up in at the end.

1113
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,720
They end up at the Met.

1114
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,280
Why can't I think of the character's name?

1115
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,280
The the takes over Peter McNichol.

1116
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,000
Why can't I think of the painting?

1117
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,960
Vigo Vigo. Thank you. Vigo Vigo.

1118
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,640
The Master of Evil. Yeah.

1119
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,320
Want to battle my boys. It's not legal.

1120
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,000
The main reason I prefer to.

1121
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,600
Oh, do you really you prefer to?

1122
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,000
I don't know. I know that that's maybe not.

1123
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,880
I like that's one of those people trash to for some reason.

1124
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,000
I don't think it's warrants. Yeah, that's what I'm that I would never trash to.

1125
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,280
And it'd be like it makes me pappy.

1126
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,320
I see like similar to Back to the Future.

1127
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,800
I see how it's not like as classic and clean as the original.

1128
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,640
But I like the I like the silliness.

1129
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,880
I like the getting I like the 1989 nests of it.

1130
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,720
I'm getting off on too many tangents, but I just had this

1131
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,160
discussion with Andrew Grissom, our friend, the show.

1132
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,800
Do do they because we want more future in Back to the Future 2.

1133
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,880
It's only what, 30 minutes of it?

1134
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,480
Yes. Mm hmm.

1135
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:15,320
It do they go back to the past so they can say officially

1136
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,720
they have to go back to the future?

1137
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,160
Because if most of the movie was in the future, it would be back to the past.

1138
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:23,320
So was there some sort of like, well, we need all of the movies

1139
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,720
to have the characters want to get back to the future.

1140
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:29,760
Was that any consideration?

1141
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,800
I don't think that was a concern in the way that Dana Barrett is like a cellist

1142
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,520
or a violinist in the first Ghostbusters.

1143
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,600
And in the second Ghostbusters is repairing ancient paintings.

1144
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,280
She's like a she's like a Renaissance woman.

1145
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,320
She can do without. She is.

1146
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,520
I mean, she's great.

1147
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,080
She's so she's so good.

1148
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,600
Everyone's so good in those movies.

1149
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,440
But yeah, I think obviously with Back to the Future,

1150
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,640
they need to think about the rules of time travel and the timelines and stuff.

1151
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:01,400
But I think it was less of a concern about the naming.

1152
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,480
I think. Well, plus you end up at

1153
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:10,640
I'm back from the future closing out to so that that reverses the whole thing anyway.

1154
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,280
Hmm. Right. That's right.

1155
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,560
OK, I guess that's true.

1156
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,560
So I guess that's probably not a consideration.

1157
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:19,960
I just think we all want more future.

1158
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:24,080
I yeah, well, as a kid, I was yeah, I would have just been happy to just like,

1159
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:27,640
what if there's no story, what if we just kind of walk around here for a while?

1160
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,560
Yes. Now I'm I am more willing to say as an adult,

1161
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:36,200
I understand what might be stupid about the future parts.

1162
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,520
That being said, it's still no, it's perfect.

1163
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:45,200
And I love it. I just like maybe I can finally kind of see into the like.

1164
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,960
If you really loved the first movie and now you have to get through a bunch of like

1165
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:53,640
holograms and you must have the special and all that weird.

1166
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,920
But I mean, I'm going to watch it.

1167
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,560
There's a way to crack it.

1168
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,720
I want to get the script and I want to rewrite it so it goes future.

1169
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,640
Evil Biff Trump presence and then back to the future.

1170
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,400
Wait a minute. Get rid of the 50s.

1171
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,000
Get rid of the 50s again. Yeah.

1172
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,240
In the 50s, because we did the 50s. I know.

1173
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,800
But it does work. It does work because at the end of

1174
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,760
because Doc has been to the future. Right. Right.

1175
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:25,680
And he comes back to 1985 and gets Marty and and they go back to the future

1176
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,680
because Doc is returning to Hill Valley of the future. Yes.

1177
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,040
Yes. OK. You're right. OK.

1178
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,320
So that they weren't thinking that they just.

1179
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:39,880
And it all culminates in like now he's in the old Western

1180
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:42,680
has to get back to the future, which is his right.

1181
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,640
That time, it's not his future.

1182
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:48,440
So people are always going back to the future throughout the effects.

1183
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,440
Future trilogy. OK, that's fair.

1184
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,200
I just the rest of the rest of these.

1185
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,840
All I want is more future.

1186
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,640
I do want I didn't I pitch I didn't I pitch you on the idea of you

1187
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:01,720
making like a just a future like a show about the future and back to the.

1188
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:05,080
Well, no, I was going to wash out all of hologram.

1189
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,760
Yeah, all of that.

1190
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,240
That's the IP you're interested in is the state.

1191
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,120
Sorry, I've let everybody down.

1192
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,600
I'm trying to get pages out.

1193
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,080
There's just there's a lot going on.

1194
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,520
Wouldn't it be so funny?

1195
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,680
It's just really.

1196
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:19,040
Would it be so funny if you like forced your way into a meeting

1197
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,640
with Robert Zemeckis and you're like, listen, here's what I'm interested in.

1198
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:27,840
I mean, I know this has been your dream for a very long time.

1199
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,760
You're a technology guy.

1200
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,480
You surely would want to.

1201
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:37,240
Well, what if we may you make all your Beowulfs and Polaris,

1202
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:42,400
but what if we made a movie with, you know, a hundred hexagons?

1203
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,920
And that would be stepping on that wouldn't be stepping on the toes

1204
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,720
of a new trilogy, that would just be a complete spin off.

1205
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,240
It's a tangent.

1206
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:56,400
It's a sidetrack, much like we've been doing for this entire episode.

1207
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,920
Yeah, it's all.

1208
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,240
Sure. It's all fun stuff.

1209
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,080
Back to the future.

1210
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,120
I mean, look, they're shiny objects.

1211
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,280
You just say the name back to the future.

1212
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,080
Any other stuff we've been talking about?

1213
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:11,040
Yeah, because because I've been talking about it for the last two days

1214
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,880
on a text message.

1215
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,320
So it's fresh in my mind.

1216
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:18,880
Getting the biggest thing, the literal biggest thing, the 22 foot high

1217
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,000
state, Puff Marshmallow head.

1218
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,920
He's got a head bigger than King Kong's head from the original King Kong ride.

1219
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,120
Whoa, it's so great.

1220
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,320
It was the biggest head.

1221
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,480
It was the biggest.

1222
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,200
Yes, they puffs head was the biggest head at Universal Florida.

1223
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,960
Very impressive.

1224
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:40,720
Stay puffed man had the biggest head, which I'll do in a Beastie Boys.

1225
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,800
That was it's the new style reference anyway.

1226
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,360
I got that.

1227
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,200
Yeah, you got right.

1228
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,520
Yeah, that's only worth it.

1229
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,280
Like, oh, I see.

1230
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,480
Oh, yeah, good work.

1231
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:57,880
They really put their eggs in the giant robot basket,

1232
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,640
which is a wonderful basket to put eggs into.

1233
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:06,200
But I like that that was the point of Universal Florida upon opening.

1234
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,000
Come see some very big robots.

1235
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:12,240
You got an ape, you got a shark and you got a marshmallow.

1236
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,160
Often overlooked, I would say.

1237
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:14,720
Yeah, I did.

1238
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,720
Overlooked and Ghostbusters doesn't get as much shine

1239
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:25,120
because it has less operational antics like Ghostbusters worked from day one.

1240
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:28,640
Like they didn't have troubles with it compared to like other things.

1241
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:29,520
I'm sure it went down.

1242
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:34,840
Sometimes you've got like three massive animatronics under the stage,

1243
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:38,520
like the American adventure, American adventure.

1244
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,760
Right. I've got that right.

1245
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,760
Not experience, not an experience.

1246
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,960
OK, it is an experience, but it wasn't.

1247
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,480
It is an experience.

1248
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,400
But these are all under the stage.

1249
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,200
And for the most part, most of them stay under the stage.

1250
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:54,160
But like that big stay puff, like you can see the stuff that people

1251
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,440
really liked in the first version, like just moved on to the second.

1252
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,760
You got to have the gozer

1253
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,520
Zool temple and you got to have the stay puff.

1254
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,800
You got to get the Ghostbusters in there.

1255
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:08,440
I think in the first version, though, the actor doing Venkman is

1256
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,320
doing a little bit of a Bill Murray impression.

1257
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,360
And the yeah, sorry, go ahead.

1258
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:14,960
They're all kind of doing an impression.

1259
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,240
But I was going to say the other thing that stays is at the end,

1260
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,440
they kind of half heartedly sing the theme and dance

1261
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,560
just a little to rattle up the show.

1262
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:30,000
The guy playing ackroyd, I think definitely inspired his like moves.

1263
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:34,200
Like ackroyd inspired this man's moves to I think they all were sort of trying

1264
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,200
to do a little bit of the character.

1265
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,840
One of my favorite things is the way ackroyd runs in the first movie.

1266
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:43,280
I forget if he does in the second movie, when he tries to like make a turn

1267
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:48,320
like a cartoon, he puts his arms in the air and like on one foot like pivots.

1268
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,200
Yeah, such a funny cartoon.

1269
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,280
Or something. Yes.

1270
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,880
Like a three stooge, three stooges thing.

1271
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,640
I would love to see him run more like that.

1272
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:00,360
And I mean, maybe not now. Maybe he's too old.

1273
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,560
But yeah, he didn't do that.

1274
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:05,400
The James Brown movie would have liked to see.

1275
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,360
Never. Well, we don't.

1276
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,440
We never got to see that how that character turned a corner.

1277
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:13,160
Yeah. We go over ackroyd a lot.

1278
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:16,680
Ackroyd, at least when he was younger, very funny.

1279
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,720
Yeah, that's the yeah.

1280
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:20,920
We were watching those.

1281
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:23,600
There was a thing that just came out Ghostbusters.

1282
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:27,360
It was it was Dan Ackroyd and Bill Murray talking to like distribute

1283
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,760
like theaters, essentially to show the movies.

1284
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,560
And they're both like goofing around.

1285
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:35,200
And I'm watching this and I go, oh, yeah, Dan Ackroyd is funny.

1286
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:36,960
I was so funny.

1287
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,280
Yeah, it was just this little like marketing internal thing.

1288
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:43,440
Yeah, that they sent to movie theaters and it it works.

1289
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,400
It's really good.

1290
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,120
And I want that. No, all this.

1291
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:50,120
No, it's just I think we think it's funny what he's turned into.

1292
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,800
Yeah. Oh, my God. Original lesson now.

1293
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:56,200
And I always forget the name of the hat with like he's got the it's not.

1294
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,160
It's like the George Wallace hat.

1295
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,840
What do you call that?

1296
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:02,720
That like kind of backwards, the Kangol, the Kangol.

1297
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,240
That's one. And it looks like Crystal Head on it.

1298
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:09,080
And he's got like his pocket protector with like pens in it.

1299
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:11,520
And it's his crystal head on the pens.

1300
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,360
Like, and you're just like, what?

1301
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,680
Weren't you like a funny guy?

1302
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,240
Like, what is this business like?

1303
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:18,400
It's all like with him now.

1304
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,240
It all just seems like it's like, well, my products.

1305
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:25,680
And the four quadrants that we're trying to approach with crystal had these

1306
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,000
like always is like business speak.

1307
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,240
It's like it's like a NASCAR driver with logos.

1308
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,040
Yeah. Person.

1309
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:35,200
It's like, oh, yeah, he was like a really funny guy.

1310
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:39,000
Yeah, I've never seen the like

1311
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,760
the big like blank check, if you will, kind of movies that like

1312
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:48,480
I haven't seen Dr. Detroit or 1941, but I am curious about like, what are those?

1313
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,920
That's not I wouldn't put a lot of those on.

1314
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:55,120
No, I think the trouble it's all over.

1315
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:59,040
I you know, I like your give me some drag net.

1316
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,240
I like drag net.

1317
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,840
Yeah, I watched that on Comedy Central, like repeats a lot.

1318
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:07,760
Yeah, I coneheads actually is has some good stuff.

1319
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,080
It's like it's a little weird.

1320
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:11,600
I have affection for coneheads.

1321
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,840
How about exit to Eden?

1322
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,920
Mm hmm. I don't remember that one.

1323
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:21,520
I think that was the most unpleasant VHS when browsing.

1324
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,480
Yeah, as a kid.

1325
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:27,120
Yeah. Well, I like Dan Aykroyd, but I don't want to see this one.

1326
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,280
Yeah, I feel like I'm.

1327
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,320
He well, he look he looks great smiling with Slimer

1328
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:38,080
hanging out in the park.

1329
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,640
I you know what else?

1330
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:42,040
Here's another original cast member.

1331
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,200
I'd never seen this photo.

1332
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:48,240
I will share the screen to show you this one's pretty famous

1333
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:52,520
that in that street mystery show that Wayne Brady was a ghost.

1334
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,480
I guess a singing and dancing

1335
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,720
Ghostbuster as would make sense.

1336
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:02,160
But here's a photo of a backstage visit from Ernie Hudson.

1337
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,360
Oh, great. Yeah.

1338
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:07,160
Wayne Wayne's hanging out with him in the video.

1339
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:10,480
In the video I was watching and I'm trying to think which video

1340
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,120
I should give them a plug is a lot of information in there.

1341
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:17,440
They mentioned that like the last showing of the Ghostbuster show was attended

1342
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:21,920
by some of the cast, but they don't say who.

1343
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:24,760
But maybe it was just Ernie Hudson.

1344
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,640
Good videos about this attraction from

1345
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:31,560
defunct land theme park history and expedition theme park.

1346
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,880
Yes, expedition theme park is the specific one I want.

1347
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,520
Shout out to those. Yeah.

1348
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:39,240
Yeah. I like the the effect

1349
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,680
when they're shooting the proton packs, they like kind of energy effect,

1350
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:47,080
which is a simple like I don't know how to describe it.

1351
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:51,440
It's basically like they just have like light tubes,

1352
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,600
I think, along the wall and they light them up to make it look like.

1353
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,280
Proton packs, am I wrong how that's done?

1354
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:00,000
Yeah, I guess. Yeah. Also, Pepper's ghosted in there.

1355
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:03,680
Yeah, I think attached to the ghosts underneath, right?

1356
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:06,800
Where is it? You have to stand in an exact spot.

1357
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,480
When the host in the original version is getting shot up on the stairs,

1358
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:13,280
I think there's actually something on the stairs that's illuminating.

1359
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,560
Oh, OK. Yeah.

1360
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,360
To make it look like she's getting sucked over.

1361
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,200
But yeah, I think the big, big, big

1362
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,440
shots of the proton pack streams.

1363
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,320
Yeah, Pepper's ghost.

1364
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,400
That's really cool.

1365
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:31,480
The a Twinkie is put in Slimer's mouth, and I don't know how they did that.

1366
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:35,800
I don't know how they did like a transfer from a person to a ghost.

1367
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,600
I am not sure. Yeah, that's cool.

1368
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,240
I think of what else is in here.

1369
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:45,440
Well, I think one element that you were talking about,

1370
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,920
somebody doing essentially a Bill Murray impression.

1371
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,040
I started to realize as I watched a couple of videos,

1372
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:54,160
I think this is one of those theme park shows that is dubbed.

1373
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:59,480
I think this is a pre-recorded voices, so the actors can just kind of hit

1374
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,680
their marks and they just mouth along.

1375
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:05,160
I could be wrong, but I kept feeling some similar

1376
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:11,280
intonations like there is a oh, yeah, yeah, I think in a couple of it is like a really

1377
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:15,320
it's like the multiplicity copy of a copy of a copy.

1378
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:20,200
You get into like a very bizarre abstract Bill Murray with the with the line.

1379
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:25,400
Well, this is going to cost you, you know, like it's this weird like,

1380
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:30,280
oh, yeah, kept losing Bill Murray Ness for many generations.

1381
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,920
Well, it's going to cost you.

1382
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:34,960
So not like the same every time.

1383
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,040
And I think it's pre-recorded.

1384
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:41,200
Not a good impression, like just a car, a cart,

1385
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,520
like auto playing, like at the exact moments.

1386
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:48,800
I think the Lewis Tully and Walter Peck's because they interact with the audience.

1387
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,640
I think they are talking by the time it gets to the second version.

1388
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,880
Yeah. It's just a funny syndrome.

1389
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,680
You definitely see it.

1390
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:59,640
And sometimes these videos, you know, you're trying to remember

1391
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,520
what these things were like, and you're going off of footage

1392
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,200
is shot from the back of the room and you can't really tell.

1393
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,160
But now I can't recall.

1394
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:11,840
What have we talked about before where it is all dubbed over?

1395
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,080
I feel like because we've done these stunt show episodes and for sure,

1396
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,320
some of those, but not all.

1397
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:22,280
It's just such a funny, like, when do they, how do they make that decision?

1398
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:23,080
When do they go?

1399
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,320
I don't think we can trust these damn actors.

1400
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,960
I think we I think this has to be locked down.

1401
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:31,280
We got to put them in a box and get this thing done.

1402
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:34,120
Terminator is dubbed, right?

1403
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,800
Well, some, some of it.

1404
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:39,440
I think it's it's if it's a safety concern,

1405
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:44,160
if it's like we need this line said and then we need this thing to explode,

1406
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:49,320
like that helps like this with like stunt concerns.

1407
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:52,320
But like, you know, the the

1408
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:58,720
when the the deacon like, you know, he's got to rib people in the audience.

1409
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:02,080
He's got to have a mic, you know, he's got to be able.

1410
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:06,360
Oh, if people, especially with Waterworld, if people have to jump into the water,

1411
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:09,120
like, yeah, you might not be able to mic them properly.

1412
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:13,160
Somebody just want to fire, fire off those lines from a speaker, you know.

1413
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,520
Yeah, yeah.

1414
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,840
I just I just like it.

1415
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,960
It's like it's definitely worse

1416
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:25,520
than people improvising, but I just enjoy it.

1417
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,280
Like watching lip sync dialogue.

1418
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:31,120
I mean, this is this is tick tock before tick tock.

1419
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,680
Really? Oh, sure.

1420
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:33,480
It is. Yeah.

1421
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:36,080
The theme park stunt shows are tick tock before tick tock.

1422
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,840
They pretty much invented it.

1423
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,440
Yeah, there is something about it.

1424
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:42,840
I think it's just because.

1425
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:46,040
It's so I mean, it is like it's worse,

1426
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:50,560
but like you're not seeing like a Broadway show.

1427
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:55,520
So it like kind of fits better at these like very abbreviated theme

1428
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,320
park type shows to see something like that.

1429
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,240
It kind of adds to it in a way.

1430
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:04,320
And I don't even know if I can describe what I'm thinking, how it does that.

1431
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,000
Yeah, yeah.

1432
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,720
I'm just trying to think of like an application of it.

1433
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:16,800
Like if we gave people a like a track, like a track to lip sync to

1434
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,520
like, could we give people clean audio to perform

1435
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:25,560
a podcast, the ride stunt show from their home?

1436
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,360
Oh, that's good.

1437
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,880
So like we should do it.

1438
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,920
We should do it when live shows return.

1439
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,240
We should do it.

1440
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:34,160
Oh, we'll just do it in advance. Yeah.

1441
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:35,600
Yeah, yeah.

1442
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:39,200
Like, do we do it for a full 90 minutes?

1443
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,080
And like, it would be like what we just have done.

1444
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,360
We just did this episode right now, right?

1445
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:47,240
But we're worried we're going to get off track in front of the audience

1446
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,040
and get distracted by stuff.

1447
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:52,280
So in order to hit it all,

1448
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:56,800
we just do an episode earlier in the day and then just lip sync it

1449
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,480
on stage at night.

1450
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:02,920
We could we could do that.

1451
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:06,240
Maybe just a part, I would say maybe just a piece of the show.

1452
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:09,680
I think it's got to be the I think it's got to be the full thing.

1453
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:13,000
It's the only way that will actually

1454
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,440
and it'll make sure that the timing is is right.

1455
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,360
We don't go over.

1456
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,880
We don't bump some show that's coming up after us.

1457
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,720
Yes, that's good. No, you're right.

1458
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:25,080
It will keep us on track and there won't be any late shows happening.

1459
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:26,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1460
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:31,320
I'm just concerned about the show after us, which is something that's way in advance.

1461
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,440
But we could do this very one.

1462
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:37,400
Imagine performing this classic episode right now.

1463
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,320
Now, that's interesting because we have a lot of bands go on tour

1464
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:43,120
and they play the complete album.

1465
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,720
They play an album front to back in the exact same order,

1466
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,480
usually in the same way that it was performed on the album.

1467
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,120
So that would be what we would do.

1468
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:54,080
We would perform our famous episodes on tour.

1469
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,440
And then we'll do a whole tour.

1470
01:15:56,440 --> 01:16:01,360
We'll do a whole cross-country tour of, let's say, just one of the episodes,

1471
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,360
one of our famous episodes.

1472
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:08,320
Yeah, we're just doing no, this tour, they're not really going to be, you know,

1473
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,120
they they want to hit the classics.

1474
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:12,520
They're just doing Sword in the Stone.

1475
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:14,280
They're going to remember that we all remember this.

1476
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:18,280
What we said about Sword in the Stone and we're going to do that city to city.

1477
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,400
Yes. And it's and there's that polite applause.

1478
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:24,560
You know, there's a concert applause where you're surprised by the song.

1479
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:28,600
But then there's the when you see the full album and like, oh, here it is.

1480
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:29,960
They've made it to tracks.

1481
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:33,720
And that's how it would be with, you know, riff number seven

1482
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:37,280
from the now classic Sword in the Stone.

1483
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:40,200
We have those famous riffs, you know, where we're thinking about,

1484
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:41,800
like, what kind of stone is it?

1485
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,480
What if it was quartz?

1486
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:46,000
What if it was a sword in the quartz?

1487
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,840
And there's all these laughs coming from that big riff we had.

1488
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:51,440
And you'll get to see that performed live every night.

1489
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,080
Exactly like you remember it.

1490
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:57,800
Yeah, people, people want because you already in the, you know,

1491
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,360
my memory is hazy.

1492
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:02,960
But from what I recall about doing live shows, people are usually wearing stone

1493
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:06,400
in the sword in the quartz shirts. Right.

1494
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,320
Yeah, yeah. Typically.

1495
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,640
So I know they want it's our biggest selling shirt.

1496
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:12,080
Sword in the Quartz. Yeah. Yeah.

1497
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,880
And it sounds like sword in the quartz, but it's not quartz.

1498
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:18,800
Sword in the quartz. Sword in the quartz. Right.

1499
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,840
We kept saying we had fun with that, as I recall, in the original episode.

1500
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,480
You can go back and listen. Right.

1501
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,240
So yeah, sword in the quartz.

1502
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:30,440
Sword in the quartz episode front to back.

1503
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,800
I really we should after this is done, record a riff

1504
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:37,160
and I'll just plug it into the episode to make it seem like.

1505
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,800
Oh, what's that word memory hole?

1506
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,680
Yes. Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1507
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,400
Then they'll never know.

1508
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,720
Never know this was a joke.

1509
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:51,000
Those suckers.

1510
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,520
Anyway, well, also just, you know,

1511
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,280
that we were getting towards the end of the episode.

1512
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,560
Feel free to just to lip sync all of it and send it to us.

1513
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:02,120
If you post it to our Twitter, imagine that.

1514
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:03,960
What a reward. What a reward.

1515
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:07,840
If you have 90 minutes, if you live with like two people

1516
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:11,440
and you can somehow like clip a piece of audio from the show

1517
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,440
and you want to perform it like you're us.

1518
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:17,360
Yeah. Go for it.

1519
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,320
And do that and send it to us.

1520
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:23,080
And that way we can definitively put you on a little list.

1521
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,000
What?

1522
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,440
I think we can just.

1523
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:31,160
What? That way we can keep track of everyone who did that.

1524
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,480
And we. Oh, you're saying that they're crazy.

1525
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:36,160
Yeah, we just be concerned about it.

1526
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:38,440
You're saying if they like us and want to do a fun thing,

1527
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,720
that there's something wrong with them. I see.

1528
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:45,400
Yes. And much like the Ghostbusters being put in the cells.

1529
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:48,240
And I forget whether it's Ghostbusters one or two.

1530
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,120
We will. We'll take you away.

1531
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:52,960
Huh? All right.

1532
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,760
Well, Jason's on record here. He does not want fun.

1533
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:00,480
I think that's been on record since like episode two.

1534
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,000
He hates he loves thrills. He loves heights.

1535
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,360
He loves thrills. I love heights.

1536
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,680
I love that fun nonsense.

1537
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,920
I love proficient Ghostbusters.

1538
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,320
Yeah, we have to.

1539
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,920
We're all stuck in our places.

1540
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,360
People are getting really excited about the notion of doing a full 90 minute

1541
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,640
version of this episode, which may be over 90 minutes by now.

1542
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:23,920
They were going to add stunts to it.

1543
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:25,440
They were going to.

1544
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:29,080
When we talked about the proton back, they were going to pantomime

1545
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,720
blasting at the cells.

1546
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:33,080
If they make it the road, if they make it, that's more OK.

1547
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:36,560
That's more like postmodernist interpretation of classic art pieces.

1548
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:37,440
I'm a little more on board.

1549
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,040
All right. I'd like to call for something different now.

1550
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:42,680
I'd like to just call for lip syncs of you talking about Scrapple.

1551
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,960
I would just like that's a good run to do it for.

1552
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:47,400
Yes, sure.

1553
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,040
Just any of them.

1554
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:52,240
But I think you got to you got to stunt show it in our reactions

1555
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:56,880
is if we're going what Scrapple that has to be us like almost falling over,

1556
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,880
maybe literally falling like Dan Aykroyd.

1557
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:03,160
Like Dan Aykroyd running, you're on one leg and you're like almost going to fall over.

1558
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,760
You're wobbly.

1559
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,760
Yeah, yeah, that sounds great.

1560
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:07,440
Yeah. Yeah.

1561
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:10,040
Set up just put some mattresses around where you live.

1562
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:15,400
And then like I'm so shocked about Jason Scrapple use that I fall out the window.

1563
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:18,120
Don't fall out the window.

1564
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,320
We don't fall out the window.

1565
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:22,760
We don't want that on our heads if somebody falls out of a five storey building.

1566
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,760
Don't try this at home.

1567
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:29,400
But just put like a patio furniture cushion on the ground and try to jump on it

1568
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:32,960
like you were auditioning for like a Tropicana Orange Juice commercial.

1569
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,680
And they go, it's fine. Just land on that.

1570
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:37,520
Well, that's if we want to do more commercial talk.

1571
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,440
That happens a lot.

1572
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:39,720
Where they go, we got that.

1573
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:42,240
We got a crash pad for you and you go, oh, you got it.

1574
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,440
And you like fall on it and you go, this hurts.

1575
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,200
This really hurts.

1576
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,680
This is not I wasn't trained for this.

1577
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,000
Yeah, I have no center of balance.

1578
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,800
So this will be interesting.

1579
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,560
How do you pan on my does Jay?

1580
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:58,400
I mean, Jason then has to like consume some Scrapple.

1581
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:01,360
You know what might be missing from that?

1582
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:02,200
Just one element.

1583
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:06,560
Can you just add in like the sound of you eating Scrapple and them saying like,

1584
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:09,840
I don't know, numb, numb, good Scrapple?

1585
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:17,520
Numb, numb, good Scrapple, Pennsylvania, fresh.

1586
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:19,800
Oh, good addition.

1587
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,480
I mean, maybe even just do that.

1588
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:25,080
That might be plenty if you don't want to find whatever episode we talked about.

1589
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,360
Scrapple. Yeah, that's good.

1590
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,400
Yeah. Well, that's a good tick tock challenge.

1591
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:31,560
The numb, numb, Pennsylvania, fresh tick tock challenge.

1592
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,920
I really like that. Wow. Yeah.

1593
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,760
Well, let's let's see.

1594
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:39,680
We issue to you the numb, numb, Pennsylvania, tick tock challenge.

1595
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,840
And with that, you've survived the Ghostbusters

1596
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,520
spectacular episode.

1597
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,040
I really do.

1598
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:52,480
In this case, do go watch those videos about it,

1599
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,560
because that'll tell you, you know, real thing.

1600
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,080
It's great. I mean, I really watch it.

1601
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,800
I was like, this is looks really great.

1602
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,160
This would be really great.

1603
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:01,680
Now there's like it doesn't even feel that dated.

1604
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,280
Like the very fun show.

1605
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:05,840
That's it's a good show.

1606
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:11,240
Such a short sighted 1996 ass decision to replace it with Twister, right?

1607
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:13,920
It out. Yeah, like that feels like they would have had.

1608
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:17,160
I mean, I guess they probably replaced it because it wasn't drawing as much.

1609
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:20,480
But it feels like obviously that was going to have more legs than Twister.

1610
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:22,800
I think it was just cheaper.

1611
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,360
I think it's just cheaper to run a little fog tunnel as opposed to like three

1612
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:30,040
massive animatronics, six actors effects.

1613
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,800
Yeah. Oh, well, yeah.

1614
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,120
But hopefully it'll come back.

1615
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,320
Hopefully something will come back at least.

1616
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:38,960
They made some odd choices in the generational shift.

1617
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:42,080
The idea that like kids don't like Ghostbusters anymore.

1618
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:44,200
They like Twister.

1619
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,920
Yeah. And then look, they're making a new Twister, I think.

1620
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:50,640
And maybe they'll prove us wrong.

1621
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:55,040
Do you think the new Twister will be about the magic of the first Twister movie?

1622
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,600
That's yes. Whoa.

1623
01:22:58,600 --> 01:22:59,920
It's the original.

1624
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:03,080
This is one of the real original ping pong balls

1625
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,760
from back in the way that they used to do it.

1626
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,440
Do you think the legend of the Twister is real?

1627
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:12,040
No, man, that's just made up a hoax fantasy.

1628
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:16,720
No way. I went on eBay and bought this finger of God shirt.

1629
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:19,400
OK, well, what's that in your closet?

1630
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,400
It's Dusty's vest.

1631
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:25,760
Wow.

1632
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,040
Whoa, wait a minute, you're related to Dusty.

1633
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:32,840
Yeah, I'm just a junior.

1634
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,120
Wait, when you were a kid, you met Belzer Lewis.

1635
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:41,720
Yeah, I did.

1636
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:43,600
He came to all my family functions.

1637
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:47,160
Scott was not reading.

1638
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:48,680
He knew that off the top of his head.

1639
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:50,200
He knew it off the dome.

1640
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,960
I knew it. And then there's the like

1641
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:55,960
and then there's the like chopped up cool version of the Twister theme.

1642
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:57,400
Oh, yeah.

1643
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:58,440
Do you know what?

1644
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:00,400
What? What? What? What? What? What?

1645
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,520
Twister, get twisted.

1646
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:08,360
Hans Zimmer and the baby.

1647
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:15,760
Man, so man, can't wait to 2020.

1648
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:16,960
What a garbage fire.

1649
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:22,800
I can't wait till 2025 when the Hans Zimmer, the baby and Dusty's nephew

1650
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,840
Twister, Twister generations.

1651
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:30,800
Yeah, OK.

1652
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:38,320
Yeah, the magic of Twister.

1653
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,560
Second storm.

1654
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:43,240
That's a better name.

1655
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:45,000
But yeah, I don't know.

1656
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,320
Generations is that was good.

1657
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:49,480
So all right.

1658
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:54,360
Hey, for more HOTCAST the Fright, this is just the first of two for the month.

1659
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,440
So HOTCAST the Fright will keep coming at you.

1660
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,560
Keep it tuned here to the cemetery gate.

1661
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:02,720
More fun coming to the the main feed.

1662
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:04,040
I think, well, we aren't.

1663
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:08,200
Yeah, on Friday, we aren't moving too far from this neck of the park.

1664
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:10,680
I think that's what we can say.

1665
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,400
And that'll be a blast.
