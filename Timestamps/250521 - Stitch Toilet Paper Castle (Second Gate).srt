1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, we know who needs to start this one.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yep, you got it.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
How can the fuck guess the round is 78?

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
On this episode I threw toilet paper everywhere, yay!

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
There he is.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
See, we couldn't just be done, maybe.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This might be the first done in 20 seconds.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
30 seconds.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Wow, they could do that.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, that's an option.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Boy, that'd be interesting, but also then the anger would start too.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah, it would be interesting.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeah, but some people would think it was a pretty rebellious cool rogue move.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
There would be think pieces about it for sure, about how brave it was and bold.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But then some people, some more traditional listeners might say, well, I would have liked a full episode.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'd pay money for this.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
They might say that.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But sometimes it's the notes they're not playing.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Sometimes it's them getting in their cars and going home as soon as the intros happen.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's the mischievous thing you could expect from a character like Stitch.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh, you're right.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's true too.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The scampishness.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's true too.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah, I mean, you truly did say it all right there.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But I guess to stretch it out a little bit, this week Lilo and Stitch returns to the big screen.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The live action Lilo and Stitch is out at the end of this week.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And as we know, when one of these Disney live action movies comes out, it's pandemonium in the streets.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You feel the excitement more and more with each passing one that comes out.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It is funny you say that, but because of obviously many not well-received live action remakes.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's like, actually, Mephisto is doing very well.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Actually, that is the first week we're not right.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And it's actually stuck around.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So what you said was lies.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But it will be interesting because I feel like the trailer for this one came out.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And a bunch of people were like, you know what?

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This one looks good.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
For whatever reason, I saw a lot of people say that.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I've not seen the film.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's funny because this one felt different in reception.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Well, and maybe, and I'm rooting for it.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't know this.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I don't think any of us know the director, Dean Fleischer Kemp.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But I think we've got friends of friends.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So that's a comedy.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's a cool comedy person.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So you've got to be rooting for someone of that nature.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Sure.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So then this comedy person has a hit with a Disney live action,

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and then it starts to trickle down to the lowest rung of comedy director out there

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
to get the call from the Mouse House.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
All I know is trickle down always works.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It always works in America.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
My hurts morning in America.

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You want to talk about the same time period?

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's breakfast time in America.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Down below him, the dog below the table waiting for his scripts.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Could you have a little?

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What's the Fox and the Hound debut?

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What's left?

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Great Mouse Detective Streaming Service?

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
At least let me do a cold read for this sidekick.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I think I'm getting the...

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Well, you know what I think I could do?

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hunchback 2.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's the one I'm passionate about.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Right, right, right.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Hunchback 2 much more than Hunchback 1,

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
mainly just for this one shot of him ringing a bell that I like,

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
this looped animation.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So I would build the whole pitch around that,

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and I'm sure that'll be fine.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I think making Hunchback of Notre Dame for release in 2030

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
should be fine and not problematic,

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
not loaded with landmine after landmine.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I choked a little bit, and not for real.

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I shoot choked, as wrestlers would say.

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I did hear...

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't think you...

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I think the title, The Guy of Notre Dame, new title.

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah.

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Notre Dame's finest.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Interesting guy.

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Nice man who lives at Notre Dame.

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I did hear Barry Jenkins was using his Oscar win and Mufasa money

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
or credibility to elevate a lot of smaller filmmakers

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
that he produced movies and stuff.

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So I like that.

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I respect that, getting your bag and rising tide lifts all ships.

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So Scott's going to get his bag, and then all the other tides will rise.

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The smaller tides will even rise now because he gets his bag.

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Sure.

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But again, there is trickle down in size of bags.

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah.

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The bags do get smaller and smaller, but it is still a bag.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's Disney's...

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Can you deny that it is a bag?

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Because you're looking at it?

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
How do you define a bag?

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
How do you define a bag?

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That is one.

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You'll get Dean's scraps, and then your scraps from this streaming deal

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
is that you'll give Jason a gift card for one month of free Disney Plus.

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So that's how it'll trickle down to Jason.

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
They keep going up and up, and if you don't want ads, you're in trouble.

109
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Right.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's free, but it's not ad-free.

111
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay, that's fine.

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Sorry.

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I know there's new foot-breeze animations.

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
My movie, Guy of Notre Dame, lost so much money.

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Maybe that's the commercial that finally convinced me to try Fabric Softener.

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So anyways, it being Stitch Mania, as the listeners are aware of,

117
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Stitch Mania seems like a good time to talk about this,

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
which has come up here and there through the year.

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I think it must have been touched on when we talked about the Castle cake

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
a long time ago when the cake was turned into a castle.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Well, that's what happened at the end when it went back to Castle.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The cake was turned into a castle.

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I was right, and that was right to say that.

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
A bag is a bag.

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
No, but if you look at the history of unusual things

126
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
that have happened to Cinderella Castle in Walt Disney World,

127
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
the history is two things, and this is the second.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Here we are.

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What happened was, on November 16, 2004,

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
to celebrate the opening of what would soon be heralded

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
as the new worst ride in Disney World,

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Stitch's Great Escape was opening.

133
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Stitch has a new, sure-to-be permanent home

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
that won't become fodder for the Disney excavator vloggers out there

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
to run around in in ten years' time.

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Look, there was a new Stitch ride.

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
How do we promote it?

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What if Stitch goes wild in the Magic Kingdom?

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And the biggest way that this was conveyed

140
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
was that you walked into the park that day

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and the castle was covered in toilet paper.

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This actually happened, if you don't know that this happened.

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He also tagged the castle.

144
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh, you're right.

145
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
One big component,

146
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
which if you want to say what it was,

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
if you want to say it in your own voice,

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
if you want to say it in somebody else's voice.

149
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I wrote Stitch is king.

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's pre-paid.

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Sorry, Christ, today is Stitch is king.

152
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
New yay album forthcoming, Stitch is king.

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah, a big sign says Stitch is king on it,

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and that happened for one day only.

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
They went to all of this effort for one day

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
pseudo-transformation of Cinderella Castle,

157
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
and it has lived in infamy ever since.

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I like it.

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I think it's funny.

160
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I also like it.

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah.

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I like it, and I think they should do more things like this.

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's going to be a clean sweep here.

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I also like it.

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I think the listeners probably too, I would guess.

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But you're not Kate Castle fan?

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah, that was where I landed.

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You were more middle.

169
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I was not.

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Jason and I are big Kate Castle boys.

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh, I love it.

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I love the Kate Castle.

173
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I recall.

174
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes, I think people come for their one-year vacation,

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
their annual vacation, maybe every couple years they come.

176
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
People want to see the castle the way they remember it.

177
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't care.

178
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I want that thing to look different every time I go into the parks.

179
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah.

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I would like a new overlay every week.

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yeah.

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And I know that's coming from a place of privilege for somebody who gets to go a lot.

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But I don't care.

184
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I want it.

185
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I do find it, because that's not an angle that I particularly had about the castle cake.

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I had just other objections to the castle cake.

187
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This notion that this is my one time, and I get to see the castle,

188
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and instead I am confronted with this.

189
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I am at one of the most magical spot in the world,

190
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
and I can't have a nice picture in front of it because it is cake

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
or because it has toilet paper all over it.

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Flip your thinking.

193
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You're there on the most special.

194
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Of course.

195
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You're there at a time where something very unusual has happened.

196
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Most boring people just went and took a picture of the castle like anybody could.

197
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You were there in rarefied air.

198
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You got to see something that maybe people might not even believe ever happened

199
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
decades after the fact.

200
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You're special, and you don't even realize it.

201
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You're the privileged one.

202
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You don't even know.

203
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Even this is a day like that's really special.

204
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Castle Kate stuck around for a little while.

205
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yeah, that was a long time.

206
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This stuck around, but the people who would disagree with me

207
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
are the ones who spent thousands and thousands of dollars

208
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
for that grand Floridian wedding pavilion with a perfect view of the castle.

209
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That is kind of why this lives in infamy

210
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
because it's like people were getting married that day.

211
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Is that true?

212
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Did anyone register being upset about that?

213
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah, is that an anecdote you saw online?

214
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
This is what I've always heard about it.

215
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Well, the reason they haven't done something like this since

216
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
is because the wedding pavilion is right there

217
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
and it's got a perfect view of the castle.

218
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Right, from the distance.

219
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Now, if it was a Stitch super fan getting married,

220
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
they'd probably be thrilled.

221
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Though you can't see Stitch from that far away.

222
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You'd just see toilet paper.

223
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Just see his handiwork.

224
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You would, and there is a little bit of a leap here

225
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
because here's one question I had coming into this.

226
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Is this something that Stitch would do?

227
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I mean, it certainly seems in character,

228
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
but this isn't something that happens in the movie, is it?

229
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I can answer that one word, yes.

230
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Is there toilet paper stuff?

231
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh, he ran away again.

232
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Oh, so he can't answer it.

233
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Can you answer on his behalf?

234
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah, he said yes.

235
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I think he's just a little bit of a rascal.

236
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
This guy's asking literally because I've seen the movie and I can't remember.

237
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Does he toilet paper someone's house?

238
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I don't think so.

239
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I think he just makes a mess.

240
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes, he's messy.

241
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
He goes through the pots and pans and all that, but I don't think he...

242
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
There's a lot of results of pictures of it.

243
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
There's a pin with him with toilet paper,

244
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and there's Stitch toilet paper holders.

245
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Maybe he gets into the toilet paper in the movie?

246
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Similar, I think, because he behaves kind of like a dog

247
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
and they pass him off as a dog once or twice.

248
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And if you have a wily dog and they fuck with your toilet paper.

249
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I see.

250
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I think, Mike, I differ from you.

251
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I like when they fuck with the castle.

252
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I like this. I like castle cake.

253
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What do you differ with me?

254
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You just say he likes all.

255
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Well, yeah, but I don't like when they add ornamentations,

256
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
like too much gold accents or anniversary pieces.

257
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But that's almost more subtle stuff.

258
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That seems wild to me.

259
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't even notice that shit.

260
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
They change the colors.

261
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I think that castle...

262
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm a stickler for this.

263
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I think the castle should be very gray

264
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
with touches of blue on the turrets.

265
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And what happens that you don't like?

266
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
They keep painting it different colors

267
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
and adding more gold and stuff.

268
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Do you know what castle year is your prime year

269
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
for castle enjoyment?

270
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I think it's probably the 70s through the 90s.

271
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And do you think it was the same color consistently?

272
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I think it was, yeah,

273
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
because I think that gray was meant to pop

274
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
with the Florida blue.

275
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So you would be upset if one summer it was like,

276
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
it's hot color summer, 90s throwback, hot colors.

277
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh, if they go all out, yes,

278
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
but if it's the anniversary of Hong Kong Disney

279
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and every park is celebrating.

280
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You're saying they would do a subtle paint job

281
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
in that instance?

282
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
They would do a subtle paint job

283
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
or they would add a gold medallion or stuff.

284
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So you don't like subtle changes to the castle.

285
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Gray or I want it wild.

286
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So what I'm describing is like neon pink, hot purple.

287
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Love it, love it.

288
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You would love that.

289
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I would love that.

290
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That is interesting to me

291
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
because I sometimes clock the little changes,

292
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
like it's like more gold or whatever,

293
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
but that doesn't usually bother me.

294
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I like that actually.

295
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I like the subtle changes too.

296
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So you're right, we do differ there.

297
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
My other outtake is,

298
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I kind of liked Stitch's Great Escape.

299
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It had a lot of elements of Alien Counter.

300
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
They saved Skippy, they saved the tomb

301
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and it gets dark and the shoulder is strange move.

302
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It might be a victim of that first ride being so beloved.

303
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah, obviously they wanted to tamp down the scariness,

304
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
but another thing is just practically

305
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
in terms of getting people off the board in Tomorrowland,

306
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
it would eat people, pre-show people, ride show.

307
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
This is not a good reason to like a ride.

308
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
People go to it.

309
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
People go to it so they don't go on the people,

310
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
but there's not a line for the people.

311
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
This ride was great.

312
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
People went inside it,

313
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
which prevented them from going on things I wanted to do.

314
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
This is the thing.

315
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You'd say the same thing about like,

316
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Disney World set up a closet

317
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and people went in there accidentally,

318
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
which prevented them from going in the big thunder line.

319
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
This is what like little Lantesta enjoyed

320
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
about going to theme parks is that it would be like,

321
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
well, this is a people eater.

322
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Look how fast the line goes at the hot dog cart or whatever.

323
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That's the different like sort of math brain that,

324
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and Jason obviously enjoyed that as well.

325
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Monsters Inc. Laugh Floor is fun

326
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
and it also holds a lot of people.

327
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
There you go.

328
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Gets them off the board.

329
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So it's a whole thing.

330
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
There's no Astro Orbiter or...

331
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
This is a phrase I've never heard.

332
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Get them off the board means that now they aren't like,

333
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
milling about.

334
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
They're not milling about.

335
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
They're not eating in the restaurants

336
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
or going on other attractions.

337
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Attractions, yeah, yeah.

338
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And it keeps them out of like, you know,

339
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Tron as a giant line or Spaceman as a giant line.

340
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It is a thing that teenagers love the most.

341
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Crowd management.

342
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
This is, I just don't,

343
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
the reasons we have said why Stitch's Grit Escape was good,

344
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
eats people, retains some elements of previous attraction,

345
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
but not all.

346
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Previous attraction, which...

347
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I mean, that wasn't the most glowing review

348
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I've ever heard of a ride.

349
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But let's put on top of it,

350
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
you get a chili dog burp in the face.

351
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Now that too.

352
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I did not experience this attraction,

353
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
so I guess I can't judge.

354
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It sounds very unpleasant to me.

355
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But that said, I like some other,

356
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
because Stitch shows up and bothers the tiki birds

357
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
in the Japan tiki room,

358
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
which on paper seems like an annoying thing,

359
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
but I liked it quite a bit.

360
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I saw it, yeah.

361
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You know, Stitch hijinks in other things,

362
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I would say I don't mind overall.

363
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And I like these particular Stitch hijinks.

364
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I guess, let me, here's a couple other aspects of this,

365
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
because it wasn't just the toilet paper unexplained,

366
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
although probably if you weren't paying close attention,

367
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
it kind of was that.

368
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And you thought, what happened?

369
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Did a plane do an accidental dump of refuse

370
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
in an aerial equivalent of a Dave Matthews

371
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
banning boat situation?

372
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Did Dave Matthews' plane fly over Disney World,

373
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
which is not legal.

374
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And we are just lucky.

375
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah, yeah, well, it made a mistake,

376
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
mistake one, flying over Disney World.

377
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I like that it was also Dave Matthews.

378
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Right.

379
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
All right, lesson learned from the bus fiasco.

380
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You don't know when they went over a bridge in Chicago,

381
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
correct?

382
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And they dumped a septic tank

383
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
all over a tourist boat that was open air.

384
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Now there's a plaque in that spot commemorating

385
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
when it happened.

386
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So yes, Dave Matthews' plane flies over Disney World.

387
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
We went to Chicago a few years ago.

388
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
We didn't go see the plaque.

389
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
We did.

390
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
We didn't see the plaque, no.

391
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
There may not have been a plaque at that time.

392
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It may not have been there?

393
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yes, the plaque may be a newer, I don't know,

394
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
full history of the plaque.

395
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I think it was an architecture boat,

396
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
was it an architecture boat tour, which I've taken?

397
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Just a nice little tour around the lake.

398
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's what it is, too.

399
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Maybe it's not that one.

400
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Maybe it's not that one.

401
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
No type of cruise would this be good for

402
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
or would deserve it.

403
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Maybe it's not the same tour.

404
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
There's no such thing as that.

405
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
But it's funny that as opposed to like a booze cruise,

406
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
if it was like, oh yes, wonderful architecture

407
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
all across the city.

408
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
There is, yeah, there is.

409
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
There's the building from the Wilco cover.

410
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
There it is.

411
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
A remarkable piece of architecture.

412
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What's that?

413
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Oh!

414
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I forget what tour it is.

415
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I should look it up, which tour.

416
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I think it is a tour.

417
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't think it was like a party boat.

418
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm pretty sure it was like,

419
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
because the architecture tour,

420
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
you just have all little chairs on the top deck

421
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
and you sit and there's a guide

422
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
that tells you about the buildings.

423
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
That's it.

424
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Then you get a bunch of poop on you.

425
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Now before I begin the next part of the tour,

426
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I've been talking for a long time,

427
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
so if you don't mind,

428
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm just going to clear my throat

429
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
and look up at the sky as I do it.

430
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Okay.

431
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So anyways, the full picture here,

432
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
when you entered the park that day,

433
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
wait, I might forget,

434
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
was there something in the front?

435
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
They didn't do anything to like the,

436
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
like in front of the railroad station or anything.

437
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm not sure.

438
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Okay, here's what I do know,

439
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
is that when you walked in,

440
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
you might see a big sign that says,

441
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
that's a wanted poster,

442
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
and it said,

443
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Experiment 626, AKA Stitch,

444
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
wanted for creating mischief, mayhem, and pandemonium.

445
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Be on the lookout.

446
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Be on the lookout.

447
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
A naughty blue menace known as Stitch has escaped.

448
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Wait, it's been a while since you said the phrase,

449
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
naughty, naughty.

450
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That feels like it needs a Stitchening.

451
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Naughty, naughty.

452
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Oh, he came back.

453
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
He was real excited to come back home.

454
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Stitch.

455
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Oh no, where'd he go?

456
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh no, he's got to get into the bathrooms

457
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
at Forever Long now.

458
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Uh-oh.

459
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Oh, there's a whole shelf of toilet paper in there.

460
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh no.

461
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh, that's the thing that he does, as we know,

462
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
is he goes into the toilet paper and spreads it around.

463
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Okay, Stitch has escaped in the Magic Kingdom Park

464
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and was last seen in the vicinity of Cinderella Castle.

465
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
If you have any information leading to the capture

466
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
of this alien troublemaker,

467
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
report to the Galactic Federation Teleport Center

468
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
in Tomorrowland.

469
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So kind of like a subtle, in-story way

470
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
to tell people that Stitch is on the loose

471
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
and that something is coming to Tomorrowland,

472
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
and I assume Galactic Federation Teleport Center

473
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
is the like alien encounter-esque, you know,

474
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
like whatever, the pad.

475
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Roo, yeah, they don't say go to Stitch's great escape.

476
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
They keep it in story.

477
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Okay, yeah.

478
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I think that's cool.

479
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And I really like the idea that you would go

480
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
to the Magic Kingdom that day,

481
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
and there's a story going on.

482
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Yes.

483
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Just today.

484
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's only for us.

485
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And then you went down Main Street,

486
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and there were wanted posters everywhere,

487
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
all along all of the lamp posts.

488
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
That's cool, too.

489
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
All leading you to the main show,

490
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
that being the castle.

491
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I mean, why wouldn't they do stuff like this all the time?

492
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I think that's great.

493
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah, well, specifically for opening rides,

494
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
or you mean just in general?

495
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Hmm.

496
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I mean, I guess, look, I'd like a little story going on

497
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
for whatever reason.

498
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Whatever they need to plug.

499
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
My jealousy of Tokyo getting Quacky Duck City.

500
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I mean, there's a story going on.

501
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's Donald's birthday.

502
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
We're celebrating it.

503
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's taking over everything.

504
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The flower bed outside, Main Street.

505
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It just isn't something they do Pixar fast,

506
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
and it's very generic,

507
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
and, you know, it'll be a Pixar parade,

508
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
but that's about it.

509
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You're not getting, you're not changing the castle

510
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
into the ball, or the light,

511
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
with Luxo, the name of the light.

512
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Oh, yes.

513
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Right, right, right.

514
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yeah.

515
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yeah, that's not bad.

516
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Hey, sure, yeah.

517
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Into a giant lamp.

518
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Yeah, turn the castle into a giant lamp.

519
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
One of the lists about this mentioned

520
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
when they turned Space of Earth

521
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
into a big Mike Wazowski head.

522
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Oh, yeah, that's fun.

523
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
That's good.

524
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That is good.

525
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Project.

526
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But was that just for a show?

527
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
That wasn't, like, a thing they did for a long time.

528
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
No, it was just a projection in a show.

529
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That was part of something.

530
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But I like it.

531
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Yeah, I like that, too.

532
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That's very cool.

533
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Well, you know what it all is reminiscent of

534
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
is an idea that never happened,

535
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
that's something that Jim Hill

536
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
wrote an article about a long time ago,

537
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
something that was proposed that they wanted to do

538
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
that Disney, very inventive Disney promotions guy

539
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Jack Lindquist came up with,

540
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
which is that when they wanted to put Muppet Vision 3D

541
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
into Lincoln Theater in Disneyland,

542
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
that they were going to do this whole thing

543
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
where there was a passing of the baton,

544
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
where the big six or whatever went on vacation,

545
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
and they hand the park over to the Muppets

546
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
for a certain stretch of time,

547
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and that they would have committed to this

548
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
and that you would not have been able to meet Mickey

549
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
and Minnie, and the characters are not around,

550
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
and they actually commit to the story.

551
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Cool, really cool.

552
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
This I think was, it must have been after

553
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Muppet Vision opened and was successful in Florida,

554
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
so probably like 1991, something like that,

555
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and it was going to be this, like,

556
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
at least summer-long promotion that where,

557
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
very much like this, there is a story going on.

558
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You know that the Muppets have been handed

559
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
the keys to Disneyland.

560
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
When you drive in that day,

561
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
the sign doesn't say Disneyland.

562
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
A sheet has been put up over it, and it says Muppetland.

563
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So great.

564
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Characters are running around through rides

565
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
that they're not supposed to be in.

566
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Animal is chasing the girls in Pirates.

567
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So awesome.

568
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Miss Piggy snuck into Small World and stuff,

569
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
or like there's a penguin around or whatever.

570
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So awesome.

571
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
The biggest thing all culminating in,

572
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
that for the whole summer or whatever amount of time,

573
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
the Matterhorn was going to be Kermit Green.

574
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Right.

575
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Incredible.

576
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
This, how, like, we'd all always be talking about this.

577
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Yeah, yeah.

578
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
That would have been a legendary thing.

579
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And I guess some people, like,

580
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
but would it have made anybody,

581
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I mean, like, I don't think the Matterhorn is the same.

582
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I don't think anybody cares if the Matterhorn is green.

583
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Why not?

584
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Yeah, probably not.

585
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I don't know, I guess.

586
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
There's a degree of Disney purist

587
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
that probably would hate anything like that,

588
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
but also that same Disney purist

589
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
that would think would like the Muppets.

590
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But then, I don't know,

591
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
because they've tried to do a zillion things

592
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
to Blinken over the years,

593
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and it's always like, no, no, no, torches.

594
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah, I don't know, because it depends how,

595
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
it depends how good everything was on some level, I guess,

596
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
because you could see the bad version of, like,

597
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
it looks green, it looks like shit,

598
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
it throws everything off,

599
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
which we'd still love, by the way.

600
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Yes.

601
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Doesn't matter if it's bad, whatever.

602
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It doesn't matter if some of this stuff was bad,

603
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
because it would have been so, it would be interesting.

604
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
But, so I can understand where, again,

605
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
the people, like, come for their one time during the year,

606
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
but they should, I don't know, I'm torn on exactly,

607
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
because some people also, I feel like,

608
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
wouldn't have noticed that animals on the ride, on pirates.

609
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
There'd be people there that kind of come casually,

610
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
and they didn't know there was a big Muppet takeover,

611
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
and I guess maybe they were looking to meet Mickey,

612
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
and he's not there, and that would be upsetting.

613
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's like, he's Disney, now it feels like it's maybe more doable

614
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
if you do it at California Adventure,

615
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
and you can go meet Mickey at Disneyland.

616
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Sure.

617
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
No problem, but if that is big,

618
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
like, you brought your kid that day.

619
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Something like that, they should do whatever they want to car-

620
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I can understand, if the castle is untouchable,

621
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I guess I understand that, but anything else?

622
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Don't we, I kind of like the,

623
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
or I think everybody didn't like, maybe,

624
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
the idea that when they turn the, with projection,

625
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
they turn the Tower of Terror into like a-

626
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Christmas present.

627
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It's not my favorite thing in the world.

628
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
What?

629
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I love it.

630
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I don't, well, the projection, I don't know,

631
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
it's a little too projectioned out lately.

632
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I am too.

633
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
In general.

634
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But that's the only way,

635
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
they're never getting paint cans out,

636
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
they're never gonna paint the whole Tower of Terror.

637
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Yeah, I don't know, it depends,

638
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
but whatever the show was I was watching,

639
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I didn't love it.

640
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Or like a Christmas party.

641
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It didn't seem like the right building.

642
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I don't think I knew there was a show,

643
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I thought they just did it.

644
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Well, maybe, I might be mixing,

645
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
there's a show in Paris that they use that tower a lot,

646
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
there's an Avengers show there,

647
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
and I'm trying to remember if this is what I'm thinking of,

648
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
or if I'm thinking of the Hollywood Studios

649
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
when there was a big present.

650
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Yeah.

651
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Yeah.

652
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
A lot of this seems like the logical conclusion

653
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
of like, when Epcot opened,

654
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
it's like different kind of theme park,

655
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
there's one character,

656
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
there's only Figment and Dreamfinder,

657
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
like none of the usual characters,

658
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
and then like, okay, they're here,

659
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
but they're in space suits.

660
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Okay, they're here, but they ride the bus,

661
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
and it's just so quickly chipped away over the years.

662
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You know, the closest thing they could do now,

663
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
these days, is to do like a ticketed event,

664
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
like a Muppet takeover event.

665
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Oh, yeah.

666
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And then do the narrative in there,

667
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
because I don't think they've,

668
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
like all these ticketed events are pretty popular

669
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
out here at least.

670
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yeah.

671
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Obviously, Mickey's Very Merry or whatever

672
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
is popular in Florida, right?

673
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Yeah, yeah.

674
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Or whatever, not so scary as popular.

675
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
The Jollywood Nights is not popular,

676
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
but still sells out,

677
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
even though people didn't like it the first year.

678
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I don't know, whatever.

679
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I think they're course correct.

680
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
But they figured it out, okay.

681
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
But ticketed events are fun,

682
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
we went to that 90s night five years ago,

683
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
seems like people like Star Wars night,

684
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
they like the Pride night,

685
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
but it does feel like you could do something

686
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
a little more, I hate to say experimental,

687
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
at Disneyland.

688
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Yeah, yeah.

689
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
But that is, I guess what it is,

690
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
if it's like, yes, there's a narrative

691
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
that the Muppets literally have taken it over.

692
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Yeah.

693
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I guess it's tougher,

694
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
because like you can't,

695
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
you wouldn't want to like start taking robots out

696
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
for the day and putting them back on at night.

697
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I think that's impossible to do.

698
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I guess you could put a,

699
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
you could put like a sheet over animals

700
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
during the day.

701
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You could put a statue,

702
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
you know, those kind of like the Incredicoaster

703
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
has the like non-moving statues.

704
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Sure.

705
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Cover it in a barrel during the day.

706
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Yeah.

707
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Curtain.

708
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Make a barrel on it.

709
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But like full, I've said this before,

710
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
like Disneyland alien invasion night

711
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
during like Halloween,

712
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
and the park is just pretty dark.

713
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Cool.

714
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And there's weird music and neon,

715
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
like very low neon light,

716
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
and there are like original aliens lurking everywhere.

717
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Definitely.

718
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And then like Space Mountain

719
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
would be maybe an actual overlay,

720
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
and then everything else would just be like,

721
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
oh, we turned the lights lower on pirates or something.

722
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
What do you think happens to Castle in this?

723
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Like if we're going to...

724
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
In my alien scenario?

725
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Yeah.

726
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Yeah.

727
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
What do you think,

728
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
like let's say that you don't have their rules.

729
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
They've taken the,

730
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
the aliens have taken the Castle as their new base.

731
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Wow.

732
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Projection.

733
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So a mix of projection.

734
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Projection and make it seem like

735
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
a chunk of the Castle is missing.

736
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Ooh.

737
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
That would be cool.

738
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Go on fire like Independence Day.

739
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
But then also you could have it

740
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
like maybe that the alien ship

741
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
is like part like organic material.

742
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Now it's growing as well.

743
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
So you got some like Giger,

744
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
HR Giger style,

745
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
weird like alien designs

746
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
that are kind of growing out of

747
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
the two sides of the Castle or to the top.

748
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Oh, wow.

749
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So like you really could go freaky with it.

750
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Like they're like,

751
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
it's turning,

752
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
they're turning it into an organic.

753
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Yes.

754
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Item.

755
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Like that it's,

756
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
they're like,

757
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
they're laying a lot of eggs.

758
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
They're getting the Castle pregnant

759
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
with their alien eggs.

760
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Essentially.

761
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Yeah.

762
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
So you,

763
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I mean, that's,

764
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
you know,

765
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
that's,

766
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
that's if the gloves are off.

767
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Yeah.

768
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
The gloves aren't off.

769
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It's a little green.

770
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Lighted a little green.

771
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Not too much though.

772
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Yeah.

773
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Tint of green.

774
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I, they,

775
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
again,

776
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
they wouldn't do that

777
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
because there'd be so many pictures

778
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
of a terrifying looking Castle.

779
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Yeah.

780
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And they just couldn't do it.

781
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Yeah.

782
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Sadly.

783
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I've talked about this before.

784
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
What do they do with the Fox stuff?

785
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And it's like full on aliens,

786
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
xenomorph Castle.

787
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
It's like black and smooth,

788
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
you know,

789
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
like kind of alien,

790
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
like one of the xenomorphs heads

791
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
or one of the ships.

792
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Yeah.

793
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
It'd be awesome.

794
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
It's a giant head.

795
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And then the mouth is swallowing you.

796
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Yeah.

797
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
That would be awesome.

798
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Yeah.

799
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But.

800
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
If they wanted to soften it,

801
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
you know,

802
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I keep hearing Mars,

803
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
they need moms.

804
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
So there was a bunch of aliens walking around,

805
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
but also a bunch of moms

806
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
that'll.

807
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
There'll be a bunch of moms.

808
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Put you at ease.

809
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Well, here's a little thought exercise

810
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
that I just started.

811
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I'm like,

812
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
because what if this had worked at the time?

813
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
What if in 2004,

814
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
this is a hit

815
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and it helped the ride

816
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
and we realized that we can promote

817
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
our new wares by taking our iconic Castle

818
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
or our other iconic landmarks

819
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
and doing stuff with them.

820
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I'm just looking for like,

821
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
what else was Disney doing around this time?

822
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Like in 2005,

823
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
what movies did they have?

824
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
And the one that I jumped to

825
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
is that they released the hit comedy,

826
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
The Pacifier.

827
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And I think if you could have turned Spaceship Earth

828
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
into Vin Diesel's bald head.

829
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Oh, wow.

830
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yeah.

831
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Hey, everybody.

832
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It's me, The Pacifier.

833
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Mike, the kids I'm supposed to watch are loose.

834
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Have you seen them?

835
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I feel like they might have gone to Italy.

836
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Give me a shot if you see my kids.

837
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
If you just popped in and said that.

838
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
That's what I do, right?

839
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
That's me, The Pacifier.

840
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
He said,

841
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
give me a shot if you see my kids

842
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
every hour on the hour.

843
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Oh, they could do it again.

844
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
They could do a reprise of it

845
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
when he released that single in like 2020.

846
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Remember Vin Diesel's single?

847
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I don't know.

848
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Yeah, what was the name of it?

849
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It was kind of catchy.

850
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Didn't we talk about it?

851
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
We talked about it on the show.

852
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm sure it must have come up on the show.

853
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I would guarantee we did.

854
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
It wasn't the Jeremy Renner singles.

855
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
It wasn't his cover of House of the Rising Sun.

856
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
No.

857
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Feel Like I Do.

858
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Feel Like I Do, yeah.

859
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
By Vin Diesel, yeah.

860
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Sure, you could have done that.

861
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Yeah, you should have replaced

862
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
It's a Small World with it.

863
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Let me just click to like 2006.

864
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Oh yeah, what happened in 2006?

865
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Oh, like Santa Claus 3.

866
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Oh, turning it into the Evil Ice Fortress

867
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
of the villainous Jack Frost.

868
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
That's Martin Short.

869
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
That's Martin Sheen.

870
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Martin Short.

871
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Martin Short.

872
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Oh my God, I wish it was Martin Short.

873
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Hey, Martin Short, you know,

874
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
they connect the ice castle

875
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
with his father-of-the-bride

876
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
wedding planner character

877
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
that the wedding pavilion is named after.

878
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Yes, true.

879
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Yes, Franxx.

880
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Franxx.

881
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
That remains true to this day, I believe.

882
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Great little Easter egg,

883
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
weird little Easter egg

884
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
that I sort of like.

885
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'm going to talk about that.

886
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
The thing that when I was younger,

887
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I always loved about Parks is

888
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
when they would do like limited time

889
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
or very special things.

890
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Yeah.

891
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
But now there's such,

892
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
they're so protective,

893
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
all the studios of their characters

894
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
and IP and everything.

895
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
But it might in like

896
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
a more disorganized,

897
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
less vertically integrated time,

898
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
some part of the company

899
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
might have no idea

900
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
that the other part of the company

901
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
is doing this.

902
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
That was the magic.

903
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
That rocks.

904
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Is there something you could do

905
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
with the shaggy dog?

906
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
The Tim Allen shaggy dog.

907
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
The Tim Allen Robert Downey Jr. shaggy dog.

908
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Oh.

909
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Doesn't have to be castle,

910
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
can be any of them.

911
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Well, what if the castle was furry?

912
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Oh, that's good.

913
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Oh man, that's very good.

914
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Just like shag carpeting

915
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
kind of on the castle.

916
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Because isn't the shaggy dog,

917
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
that's like a serum or something,

918
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
turns it into a shaggy dog.

919
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Turns a man into a shaggy dog, yeah.

920
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
So somebody,

921
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Dave Matthews Plane drove by,

922
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
released too much of the serum,

923
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and the castle sprouted a bunch of fur.

924
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Yuck.

925
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I love it, it's very clean.

926
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Oh, even if you could just,

927
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
like when Universal does Grinchmas,

928
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
and you can meet Max the dog,

929
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and I think at one time I was in City Walk,

930
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
and someone was walking like four Max's to their car,

931
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
like whoever took them to watch the end of the night.

932
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Like, I love meeting Max,

933
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
and petting Max, and saying hi to him.

934
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
If you could meet a giant sheep dog,

935
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
if you could meet the shaggy dog.

936
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Well, that's true.

937
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Did you meet the dogs when they were off the clock though?

938
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Yeah, I think so.

939
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
So you stopped and met the Max's.

940
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I feel like I saw them.

941
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So you didn't have to pay to meet Max.

942
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
No, they were just walking by,

943
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
it was just like four dogs on leash.

944
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And you're sure those were Max's though?

945
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I think they were Max's.

946
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Because I don't want you like stealing Valor.

947
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

948
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Could it have been another?

949
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
They're rescue dogs.

950
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
They're not on the clock.

951
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
They're not working right now.

952
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
They're not working right now.

953
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
They are not allowed to be cute unless they're getting paid.

954
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
You wait for somebody at a Comic Con

955
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
to leave the autograph table to ask them for a photo.

956
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Because then they're away from the part where they charge.

957
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Well, I forget.

958
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I forget whether I told this story.

959
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
When we went to the media day for Super Nintendo World,

960
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
and there was a shuttle bus to take you back to parking

961
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
when I was waiting,

962
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
there's a security guy,

963
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
and the security dog was off the clock.

964
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And it was being like slobbery great date.

965
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
It was so exciting.

966
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
He was so friendly, saying hi to everyone.

967
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
He saw me, and he jumped up so excited.

968
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
His head bonked my head.

969
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And it felt like I had been punched in the face.

970
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Wait, he was off the clock?

971
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
He was off the clock.

972
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
They said, oh yeah, you can say hi.

973
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
He's off the clock right now.

974
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
We're going home.

975
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Why do I not remember this?

976
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Well, you were gone.

977
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I think we all left separately.

978
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Oh, okay.

979
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So this was later?

980
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Were you still down in the lower lot, or was it up?

981
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Yeah, I think you were walking.

982
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
You were doing Jurassic World before we left,

983
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
and I went out the...

984
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Was this a drug sniffing dog?

985
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I think it was a bomb sniffing dog.

986
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It was like a security dog.

987
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Well, it could have been.

988
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It was going for your cheek,

989
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
because he knows you always got big old blunts rolled up in there.

990
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Bomb sniffing dogs don't care about grass, okay?

991
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
But he was so friendly.

992
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
How do you know he was a bomb sniffing dog?

993
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I feel like that's what the security guy said.

994
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
He feels like...

995
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Look, I don't know.

996
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I don't know what they have there.

997
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Bomb sniffing dogs are going to go nuts in the Super Nintendo world.

998
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
The Bowser's Castle is full of them.

999
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
This dog knocked my ass over,

1000
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
and everyone ran over and helped me out,

1001
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
but the dog just didn't.

1002
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
He was just smiling.

1003
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And you were like, no, no, no.

1004
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
It's okay. I understand.

1005
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I understand.

1006
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Please just have him shot.

1007
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Oh, God.

1008
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Never.

1009
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I mean, please punch me with...

1010
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Please headbutt me again, Marmaduke.

1011
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Please, sir.

1012
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Jason doesn't want the dog shot,

1013
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
but something tells me Stitch might...

1014
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
What would the character of Stitch want to happen to the dog?

1015
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I don't like sharing attention.

1016
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
He's a dead man.

1017
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
There we go.

1018
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
The character of Stitch allows Jason to vent through the darkness.

1019
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
If you get too angry,

1020
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
your extra arms are going to pop out and grab guns.

1021
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I'll take care of that job myself.

1022
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Is this one of these where I forgot about this,

1023
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
or was I really not around?

1024
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You weren't there.

1025
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You went into the park.

1026
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Michael, you have never forgotten one thing

1027
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
that has ever happened to Jason in his life.

1028
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Well, it's a lie.

1029
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
It's a lie, I guess.

1030
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I wanted to go back.

1031
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
No way you would forget.

1032
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I wanted to go back to City Walk to buy Megan t-shirts.

1033
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And I proved right.

1034
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Megan, too, come in a few months.

1035
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I proved right.

1036
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
The bitch is back.

1037
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Your desire for a shirt proved that it merited a sequel.

1038
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
She's ahead.

1039
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
What did she say in the trailer?

1040
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Hold on to your vaginas?

1041
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Does she say so?

1042
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Yeah, Megan's sassy now.

1043
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
So are we green lighting the sequel or not?

1044
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I don't know.

1045
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
The movie did well,

1046
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
but merch sales just aren't what we want them to be.

1047
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
It feels like one more t-shirt might push us over the edge.

1048
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
That large man or small,

1049
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
that large child or small man just bought two XXL t-shirts.

1050
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
You believe you were mistaken for a large child?

1051
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I am always so glad that that's the case.

1052
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Facial hair helps.

1053
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
That's true.

1054
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You shouldn't, what, you there.

1055
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
You shouldn't be, you shouldn't be lighting up that big old blood.

1056
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
You are about nine years old.

1057
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Large, but nine years old.

1058
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Oh, he started doing the Megan TikTok.

1059
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
He started doing the arms and the kick.

1060
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It'd be fun to see Stitch do that with all his arms.

1061
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Let's stay focused on, yes,

1062
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
now that we've made it back to Jason doing the voice.

1063
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
If you're a newer listener,

1064
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
you might not know the runner that's been occurring for,

1065
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I'm going to guess, 13 years,

1066
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
which is Jason doing a Stitch impression.

1067
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
A really bad Stitch impression.

1068
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Well, you know what, though?

1069
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I think it has improved as time has gone on.

1070
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I think it's in a better place now than the first,

1071
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
because what I recall was an early attempt at it.

1072
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
There was this hacking maniacal,

1073
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
oh, that beats family,

1074
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
where you're like,

1075
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
as if acid is dissolving your lungs as you're trying to speak.

1076
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Yeah, I'm hurting myself.

1077
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
But I think it has improved.

1078
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And I'm just wondering what else there is to do with Stitch

1079
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
while we're...

1080
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Okay, I mean, in terms of role-playing,

1081
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
anything like...

1082
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
First of all, let's just liften it.

1083
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Can I speak to Stitch?

1084
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Stitch, is he still here?

1085
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Of course. I'm always happy to talk.

1086
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Very good.

1087
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
What do you remember about the day, November 16th, 2004?

1088
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Oh, boy.

1089
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Well, you know, the limiter was taken off.

1090
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I was just allowed to create.

1091
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I was just allowed to do my thing, man.

1092
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Anybody ever tell you you sound a little bit like Wolfman?

1093
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I mean, at the top of my game.

1094
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Oh, Wolfman?

1095
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Me and him go way back.

1096
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Yeah, baby.

1097
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
You sound cool like you did.

1098
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
You sound like a guy who'd be kind of in, like,

1099
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
a road trip in posse with Burt Reynolds and Dom Delaouise.

1100
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Oh, man, they were the best.

1101
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Oh, you go back to those guys.

1102
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Oh, yeah, I used to go...

1103
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
and go to a posse big boy with that other L.A. DJ.

1104
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
What's his name?

1105
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
That other L.A. DJ.

1106
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
But after it happened, I mean, like, did you feel...

1107
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Was there any guilt? Was there any remorse?

1108
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Were you proud of what you had done to the castle?

1109
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I had a lot of fun.

1110
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Producers, operations,

1111
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
they really should have looked it out for that wedding thing.

1112
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I sent a very large gift.

1113
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
You know, physical media residuals used to be a big deal.

1114
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Oh, yeah, and you're in the time you were coming up, absolutely.

1115
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Yeah, I sent an ice card to the briding room.

1116
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Well, look at that.

1117
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
So it doesn't matter if they TP the toilet paper.

1118
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
You made it right.

1119
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And you didn't try to bite one of the bridesmaids?

1120
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
No, I bit their tires, so...

1121
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Oh, man.

1122
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Four tires, four bites.

1123
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Well, you gotta bite something, so it's good you didn't attack a person,

1124
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
but you got your prankster energy out.

1125
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Was there anything going on with security?

1126
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Did they give you any flack

1127
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
or did you escape as quickly as you could?

1128
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
No, they were cool, man.

1129
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I learned all their deans.

1130
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I always sent them chocolate at Christmas.

1131
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
They were the hardest-working guys at theme park.

1132
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
That's good.

1133
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
You look out for the working man.

1134
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
You're a union guy.

1135
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
You look out for...

1136
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Yeah, I mean, I would say after...

1137
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I mean, they're one now.

1138
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I'm in equity.

1139
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
That's great, that's great.

1140
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Obviously, when they started doing the TV show

1141
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
and the directivity sequel, I got a producer credit.

1142
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Oh, that's good.

1143
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Of course, you didn't do it yourself, because why would you?

1144
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
You got bigger fish to fry.

1145
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Well, they let me direct Leo in Stitch 3 back in action.

1146
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Every kind day, I just grinded that one out.

1147
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
They just stole back in action.

1148
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I remember, that was barely animated, I feel like.

1149
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
They just told the story of what happened in the first movie

1150
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
just through still storybook images for 65 minutes.

1151
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Yeah, it was a lot of photographs of doodles.

1152
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
It wasn't even animatics.

1153
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
But we tried our best with what we had.

1154
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Any memory, because your movie got green-lit in this day.

1155
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
2004 was still in Michael Eisner's regime.

1156
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Any memories of him?

1157
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Great guy, great guy.

1158
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
That's what I like to hear.

1159
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I got really muddy in Burbank because of those rainy winters.

1160
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
So he let me rinse off.

1161
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Famously, yes.

1162
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Yeah, for like three days, yeah.

1163
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
He let me rinse.

1164
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I got real muddy.

1165
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Played around a lot.

1166
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
He let me rinse off in his private shower or bathroom.

1167
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
He let you use the shower.

1168
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I would wish he would let me rinse off once.

1169
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
That was kind of my dream.

1170
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Yeah.

1171
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I want to rinse off.

1172
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I also took a bite of one of the seven dwarfs

1173
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
from the Dean Disney building.

1174
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Oh, no.

1175
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Oh, geez.

1176
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Those are huge, too.

1177
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
It probably didn't even make that much of a dent, at least.

1178
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I don't want to say they led me to it,

1179
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
but there was a trail of chili dogs.

1180
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And I don't know.

1181
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
We didn't talk about content much back then,

1182
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
but I think they wanted it.

1183
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
You know, it went in the vault.

1184
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It went in the vault.

1185
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
They needed some new promotional pictures, so.

1186
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Would you recommend, if you were going to bite something

1187
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
like a tire or a concrete dwarf, do you ever add chili to it

1188
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
just to make it more palatable?

1189
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Oh, sometimes.

1190
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
But, you know, it's kind of a work thing.

1191
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
You know, you got a clock in and out.

1192
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
You feel like sometimes you eat stuff

1193
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
just because people expect it of you?

1194
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Like, you're not even always in the mood?

1195
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I mean, when I do sign it, like, do conventions and stuff,

1196
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
you're not always at 100%.

1197
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
But people came out, and they took their time

1198
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and earned their money, so you want to give them a good show.

1199
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
This is great.

1200
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
OK, well, he appreciates.

1201
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
He puts his fans first, even if you aren't on the fence.

1202
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Yeah, trying to be a man of the people.

1203
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I mean, I remember when I was just starting out,

1204
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I had some hard times.

1205
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
You know, you do a lot of odd jobs out here.

1206
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
See, not everybody would have that perspective.

1207
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I mean, yeah.

1208
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Oh, yeah, it's really easy to lose yourself

1209
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
in the entertainment industry.

1210
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I mean, I've heard those, the gargoyles in Hunchback,

1211
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
they're fucking assholes.

1212
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
And where do they get, you know,

1213
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
you're way more popular than them.

1214
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Yeah, I don't know.

1215
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
They never, they were kind of high-and-by guys,

1216
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
you know, at the Christmas parties.

1217
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
This is really, why aren't they, how do they possibly feel

1218
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
like they earned 12?

1219
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I don't know.

1220
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
That bothers me.

1221
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Well, you're, you know, yeah, you're straight and narrow.

1222
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Stitch, I heard that you were a PA on American Gladiators

1223
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
when you came out here for the first time.

1224
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Oh, yeah.

1225
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
One of the numerous remakes.

1226
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.

1227
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Not the original, but...

1228
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
No.

1229
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
He tried it again in the late 90s,

1230
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
and then I got Lilo and Stitch.

1231
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Like, it was a real lucky thing.

1232
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
You got to start somewhere.

1233
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
You know, Sebastian Stan talked about,

1234
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
he almost threw in the towel,

1235
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
but then he got $65,000 in residuals

1236
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
from a hot tub time machine.

1237
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
He did just say that.

1238
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Yeah, I saw that article.

1239
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
It was pretty cool.

1240
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
He's a real straight shooter.

1241
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Mm-hmm.

1242
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
He's good.

1243
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Yeah, tell them something.

1244
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Connected to the roots, just like you.

1245
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
If you had to, if you were allowed to cause

1246
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
a little bit of mischief or mayhem

1247
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
at another big theme park landmark,

1248
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
anything you had eyes on,

1249
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
anything beyond the toilet paper on the castle?

1250
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Well, I think I could hide an epic universe

1251
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
in pretty much any land,

1252
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
like pretty much any portal.

1253
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Yeah, well, they don't have all the kinks figured out yet,

1254
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
so yeah, you could just scurry away quite easily.

1255
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Yeah, I mean, that's kind of natural.

1256
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
You open a new theme park and you open a new hotel.

1257
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
You got to recharge the key.

1258
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
You got to get new keys.

1259
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Sure, sure, yeah.

1260
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
So, like, I don't know,

1261
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
maybe overturn a bucket of chili

1262
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
or two or six on top of the Kronos.

1263
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Oh, yeah.

1264
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I might just swap one of those.

1265
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I might just make myself a big circle,

1266
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
replace Mario or whatever.

1267
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Oh, just punch one out,

1268
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
and then you're hanging around upside down

1269
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
doing circles and stuff.

1270
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Yeah, but just when they start to suspect

1271
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
something is off, I'll replace it.

1272
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Wow.

1273
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
You know, it's what they call fun gaslighting.

1274
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
It's just having a little laugh.

1275
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
They do call it that.

1276
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I have heard fun gaslighting as a term.

1277
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
That's what I, whenever I do it,

1278
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
that's how I like to think of it, you know.

1279
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Sure.

1280
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Well, you've never done it before.

1281
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Oh.

1282
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
See, that was fun gaslighting.

1283
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
You started a question.

1284
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Oh, that was an example of fun gaslighting.

1285
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Yeah, you started a question.

1286
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Wow, that was pretty good.

1287
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Yeah, yeah.

1288
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
You proved by example.

1289
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Well, look, I mean, thank you for being here.

1290
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I didn't realize you'd end up being a guest for so long,

1291
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
but this has been great.

1292
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I guess you survived podcasts,

1293
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
the ride, the second,

1294
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Stitch, anything you'd like to plug?

1295
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I know you got a movie coming out this week,

1296
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
but I don't know how much you even relate to the movie.

1297
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
You know, I was kind of more of a supervising role

1298
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
when producing Lilo and Stitch, you know.

1299
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Oh, this is animated Stitch.

1300
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
This isn't the CGI Stitch.

1301
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Yeah, yeah, I like the CG guy.

1302
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Right, right, right.

1303
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
But didn't you, like, did New Stitch meet with you,

1304
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
like, when Billy Dee met Donald Glover?

1305
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Hung out of the, tongue out of the time.

1306
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I'm in a couple scenes, I am.

1307
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
You know, that movie, sometimes Donald Glover,

1308
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
sometimes 21 Savage in the New Lilo and Stitch,

1309
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
sometimes it's Stitch, sometimes it's me.

1310
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Wow, well, that's fun gaslighting.

1311
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
That's keeping people on their toes.

1312
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
All right, well, yeah, check it out in theaters,

1313
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
and thank you for being here.

1314
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I guess we'll summon Jason.

1315
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Hey, check it out, and go see it instead of the live action

1316
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
how they train your dragon.

1317
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I don't get any residuals for that.

1318
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
But I could say I am hidden in one shot,

1319
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
because I was just kind of in the soundstage next door one day.

1320
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
What, geez, just blending in with dragons.

1321
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
What a scamp.

1322
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Hey, we love you.

1323
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Thanks for being here.

1324
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Thank you.

1325
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Wow, that came better than Jason, I think.

1326
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Oh, that was nice.

1327
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
That was a little break for me.

1328
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Better than what?

1329
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Oh, no, I didn't see anything.

1330
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
You fun gaslighting me?

1331
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
No, no, I was just regular.

1332
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
You've done that before.

1333
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
No, regular gaslighting.

1334
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Oh, OK.

1335
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I have regular gaslighting.

1336
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I have one more.

1337
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Now, I know I just, well, Stitch was here for a little bit,

1338
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
but you do an impression of Stitch,

1339
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
which I think we all can agree is a remarkable impression.

1340
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Oh, sure.

1341
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
But one thing, I feel like you've spoken before

1342
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
of feeling insecure in your ability to do different voices,

1343
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
and you once said that you didn't even want to try to do this voice

1344
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
or that voice until you paid Griffin money to voice coach you.

1345
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
That's right.

1346
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Well, I just advice from friends who are, you know,

1347
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
a little more experienced.

1348
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
They work out and eat the squirrel.

1349
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
That's true, and I'm not going to stop you from handing cash to Griffin.

1350
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Scott Pilgrim is like a funny side character, Scott Pilgrim.

1351
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
No, no, no, I know, and I encourage this.

1352
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I think you should feed as much money to Griffin as possible to get voice lessons.

1353
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
But I think even without the expert Griffin training,

1354
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I think there is a way, what I would love to do is just to figure out

1355
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
if we can like make a little, because this is a problem we all,

1356
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
you know, we start doing one voice and realize we're just doing the same.

1357
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
How many voices we do just fall right into Leno.

1358
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
You know, this happens to us.

1359
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
The whole thing is like trying to make a little space between voices.

1360
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
So what I've, I have a list of a couple of characters

1361
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
who sound a little bit similar to Stitch.

1362
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Oh, thanks.

1363
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
And I'm curious to hear if you could kind of like create a little distance

1364
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
and make, like, see if you can get them to be a little bit different from each other.

1365
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
OK, let me have a sip of water.

1366
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Yes, yeah, you might need that because we're getting a little bit,

1367
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
we're getting a little scratchy here.

1368
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Oh, man, you're really putting him through the wringer here today.

1369
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
He's doing a bang up job, I would say.

1370
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I didn't say anything about the quality of the job.

1371
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I'm just saying that he's really being tested today.

1372
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
No, no, no, a little podcast or obstacle course.

1373
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
OK, so let's just calibrate to Stitch, maybe with a classic Ohana means family.

1374
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Ohana means family.

1375
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Good, great, improved.

1376
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
We see how far it's come.

1377
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
But then this is a little difficult.

1378
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
How would you, could you pivot to Gollum?

1379
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Ooh.

1380
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
My precious.

1381
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And I think that, I think if you went...

1382
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
So a little close.

1383
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Yeah, yeah, well, somewhere in, like, I don't know if that's what Gollum sounds like.

1384
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Is it more like that?

1385
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Oh, maybe.

1386
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I'd have to listen to it.

1387
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I don't think he's as gruff, isn't he?

1388
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Is he more like...

1389
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Whispering.

1390
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
My precious.

1391
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
That felt good.

1392
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Well, you know what it felt like a little bit is...

1393
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Peter Lorre.

1394
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Peter Lorre, yes.

1395
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Yeah, yeah.

1396
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Oh, is he on your list?

1397
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
He's not on the list.

1398
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
No, he should have been.

1399
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
He definitely should have been on the list.

1400
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Yeah.

1401
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
It's a real, it's a family tree.

1402
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
All these things are only two degrees apart.

1403
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Oh, yeah, you're right.

1404
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
He's more like Rick.

1405
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Wait, that's true.

1406
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
You have to put a little bit of, like, what nationalities?

1407
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Oh, I don't know, actually.

1408
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I just think Wren for men and Stimpy is what I think, too.

1409
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Oh, wait, okay.

1410
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
We're also not on my list, but Wren.

1411
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Do you think you could do Wren?

1412
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Stimpy, you idiot, you could say.

1413
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Stimpy, you idiot.

1414
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Okay.

1415
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Stimpy, you idiot.

1416
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
That's pretty good, yeah.

1417
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Yeah, that's not bad.

1418
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Pretty good.

1419
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Okay, well, I wonder, okay, then this might start, this might start hitting it into another

1420
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
direction.

1421
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Baby animal from Muppet Babies.

1422
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Oh, boy.

1423
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Oh, gosh.

1424
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I don't even remember.

1425
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
What does he say at the end?

1426
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
He says, go bye-bye?

1427
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
He says, go bye-bye at the end of the episodes.

1428
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Go bye-bye.

1429
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Now, that's pretty good.

1430
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
That's not bad.

1431
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Actually, what that does is kind of prove that maybe.

1432
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Bye-bye.

1433
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Isn't it a little more like that?

1434
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
It's a little more high-pitched because it's a baby.

1435
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Isn't it more girl?

1436
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
All right, well, if you, because I thought that was pretty close, if he takes his time

1437
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
with it a little more.

1438
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Yeah.

1439
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Muppet Babies.

1440
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
He needs to get in the whole vibe of the song, I think.

1441
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Does he say a line in the opening song?

1442
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Does he?

1443
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I don't know.

1444
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I don't recall.

1445
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
When your town looks good.

1446
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Just close your eyes and make believe.

1447
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Is that him or is that?

1448
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I don't know.

1449
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
That's one of the other ones.

1450
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I don't know.

1451
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I don't recall.

1452
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
When your town looks good.

1453
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Just close your eyes and make believe.

1454
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
You'll be anywhere.

1455
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Is that him or is that?

1456
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I don't know.

1457
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I don't know.

1458
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
That's one of the other ones I want to say.

1459
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,760
No, close your eyes and make believe is Miss Piggy, I believe.

1460
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,400
Some of them are a little, I mean, obviously Piggy is different, but some of them are a

1461
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,400
little similar.

1462
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,400
Yeah.

1463
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,400
Mm-hmm.

1464
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,400
Some of them, I mean, probably some of them are done by the same people.

1465
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:24,000
And now I don't remember if, I feel like maybe, I know Dave Collier was some, but I feel

1466
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,280
like Howie Mandel might have been somebody in there.

1467
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,200
But here's, this was a Howie Mandel.

1468
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,560
Do you feel like you could do Gizmo from Gremlins?

1469
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,560
Oh, Gizmo.

1470
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,560
Yeah, what is Gizmo?

1471
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,560
Does Gizmo talk that much?

1472
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,560
I mean, I know he dances.

1473
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,560
He doesn't really say words.

1474
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,560
It's kind of more of a, it's sort of a like-

1475
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,560
That's a Howie Mandel voice.

1476
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,560
Just kind of a like-

1477
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,560
Beep, beep, beep.

1478
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,560
Oh, that's, yes.

1479
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,560
I think he would go higher.

1480
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,560
Beep, beep, beep.

1481
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,560
Well, there we go.

1482
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,560
I'm coaching him too much.

1483
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,560
That's, no, no, no.

1484
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,560
I think that's fair game.

1485
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,560
And it's very kind of you to do it for free instead of the vast amount of money.

1486
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,560
We know Griffin is going to-

1487
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,560
He should pay.

1488
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,560
He should pay.

1489
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,560
He should pay.

1490
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,160
He should pay me.

1491
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,160
Greedy Griffin, we call him.

1492
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,160
He owes me.

1493
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,160
Jason owes me.

1494
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:08,480
Well, I probably do owe you meals and drinks over the years, but I've tried to make up

1495
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,480
for that.

1496
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,760
You never paid me for that TV.

1497
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,760
You're still watching.

1498
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,760
All right.

1499
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,760
Well, you said I could have.

1500
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,760
You said it was going in the garbage.

1501
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,760
Yeah, but re-between the lines.

1502
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,760
I wanted $500 for that TV.

1503
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:17,760
Oh, come on.

1504
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:18,760
You're supposed to just hand me a wad of cash.

1505
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:19,760
You wanted how much?

1506
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,760
$500, all singles.

1507
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,760
Well, I could have gotten a brand new one for that price.

1508
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,760
No, I wanted-

1509
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,760
Single, like unmarked, non-

1510
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,760
Singles.

1511
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,760
$500.

1512
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:31,640
In a bag, re-between the lines.

1513
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:35,800
Saying it was a gift was fun gaslighting, or perhaps not fun gaslighting.

1514
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,280
Well, now that the outcome is no money for me, it wasn't fun.

1515
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,080
I thought it was fun, but it wasn't.

1516
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:46,360
If you had to stay in the high-pitched zone, do you think you could take it to Baby Dinosaur?

1517
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,360
Oh, yeah.

1518
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,920
Oh, I watched so many hours of that.

1519
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,920
Baby Sinclair?

1520
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:51,920
Baby Sinclair?

1521
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:52,920
Yeah, Baby Sinclair.

1522
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:53,920
Yeah, that's what I mean.

1523
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,920
Yeah.

1524
00:51:55,080 --> 00:52:01,760
I feel like I do Baby Sinclair pretty regularly around the house.

1525
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,760
Around the house?

1526
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,760
Around the house, yeah.

1527
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,760
Of course he-

1528
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,760
Not the mama.

1529
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,760
That just seemed a lot like you.

1530
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:13,720
I'm the baby, gotta love me, great big eyes, and I'm really kind of late.

1531
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:17,160
This is just, what we're finding is that this is just Jason and that he just, like,

1532
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,520
he sings that nod in character to Jane.

1533
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,520
Of course he does.

1534
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,520
Oh, Garfield, Jane.

1535
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,520
I'm the hubby, gotta love me.

1536
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,520
Right.

1537
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,520
Yeah?

1538
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,520
Yeah, but he says-

1539
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,520
Why the Lord says so?

1540
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,520
But he says, baby, you know.

1541
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,520
He says, I'm the baby.

1542
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,520
Oh, I know.

1543
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,520
I fucking-

1544
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,520
I'm the baby, baby hubby.

1545
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:37,600
There's been that, oh my God, there's been that five-minute stretch of every episode

1546
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:43,840
lately where we have to do, I'm the little baby hubby, the little baby hubby dino boy.

1547
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,880
He's the baby hubby dino boy.

1548
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:49,280
We all have our process to prepare, you know.

1549
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,240
It always seems like it's fresh too, you know, of all the bits that have been running to

1550
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,240
the ground on the show.

1551
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,520
The little, I'm a little hubby dino boy.

1552
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,520
Always feels good to me.

1553
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,520
It always feels-

1554
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,520
Well, it is fresh.

1555
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,520
I only got married like a month ago.

1556
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,520
Well, that's true.

1557
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,280
That's a great, by the way, plot development for our characters on this show.

1558
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,280
That I got married?

1559
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,280
And I want to thank you for doing that.

1560
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,760
Because that adds more dimension to your character as far as when you're following our lives,

1561
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,000
which to some degree is a reality show.

1562
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Yeah.

1563
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I suppose so.

1564
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Yeah.

1565
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
And we know some things.

1566
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,760
We know that Jane is the blushing bride.

1567
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,600
We know that he's a little hubby baby boy.

1568
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,600
I love him.

1569
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,600
Little stinky baby.

1570
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,600
Stinky baby hubby boy.

1571
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:33,960
If you are a listener who is charmed by Jason saying, I'm the little stinky hubby boy, can

1572
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,280
you write an essay explaining why?

1573
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,380
Or is it more of just a feeling you get?

1574
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:40,560
Is it just really, you can't even-

1575
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,560
Like you couldn't put it into words.

1576
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,560
You couldn't put it into words.

1577
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:46,600
It's just a warm feeling you get when he says, I'm a little stinky hubby boy.

1578
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,640
Little dino stinky.

1579
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:56,240
Hey, whatever your preferred platform, the comments of this post, Reddit, Discord, Facebook,

1580
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,240
whatever makes you most comfortable.

1581
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,240
Yeah.

1582
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,240
Okay.

1583
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,240
You can comment anywhere you want.

1584
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,240
This is sincere.

1585
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,240
Reach out to the audience.

1586
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,240
Oh yeah.

1587
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,240
I don't know.

1588
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,240
I'm formatting.

1589
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,240
You know, sometimes it's a pain in the ass when you post in those.

1590
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,240
No way.

1591
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,920
I'm setting up a Google Forms for this and that is the only acceptable place for answers

1592
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,920
to this question.

1593
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,720
1,000 words minimum.

1594
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,920
I don't buy this.

1595
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,920
It's a feeling thing.

1596
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,920
Professors got over here.

1597
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,200
Highway.

1598
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,200
Explain it to me.

1599
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,200
He got tenure and he got more strength.

1600
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,200
Proper spacing.

1601
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,200
Yeah.

1602
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:28,200
Well, that was a good, thank you for, that was, I think that was an excellent, I think

1603
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,640
what that proved is that you don't need Griffin.

1604
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,400
You don't need the thousands of dollars going into Griffin's pocket.

1605
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,280
I think you created some space between all of those voices and made some unique voices

1606
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,280
there.

1607
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,000
I thought it was fun and impressive.

1608
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,360
Animation casting, I live in Burbank and I own any number of microphones, so.

1609
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,360
Not any.

1610
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,360
I own 700 microphones.

1611
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,360
No, I meant more like three or four, I guess.

1612
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,360
Not any number.

1613
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:55,360
Sounds like a Condenser bike, a USB mic.

1614
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:58,360
I own a very specific number of microphones.

1615
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,360
I own not any number.

1616
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,360
I own one number of microphones.

1617
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,360
Three.

1618
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,360
There's built-in ones on the phone and the iPad.

1619
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,360
Phones don't count.

1620
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,360
You're going to put it on your phone.

1621
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,360
Well, you need a proof of concept.

1622
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,360
It's good enough.

1623
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,360
You know.

1624
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,360
Through the phone.

1625
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:16,360
I also want to say that there's a weird tie together in the Disney family of this

1626
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:23,360
infamous date, November 16th, 2004, that this was also the birthdate of a now treasured

1627
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:27,360
member of the Disney family, the actor Jack Champion.

1628
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,360
We know Jack Champion.

1629
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:35,360
Jack Champion is, of course, the actor who portrayed Spider in Avatar, The Way of Water,

1630
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,360
and well, again, in Avatar.

1631
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,360
The young man.

1632
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,360
Fire and Ash.

1633
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,360
Yes.

1634
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:46,360
There's a little human boy who is raised maybe to the objections of Naturi by the Sully

1635
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,360
family.

1636
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:56,360
Ironically, a rare human in an otherworldly realm, kind of the inverse of Stitch, but

1637
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,360
yet both of them create a lot of mischief.

1638
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,360
Fish out of water.

1639
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,360
On their respective planets.

1640
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:05,360
Are you saying that they should do like an alien encounter with Spider in the tube?

1641
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,360
Oh, yeah.

1642
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,360
Wait, yeah.

1643
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,360
Or Spider messes with the castle?

1644
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,360
He's a human boy.

1645
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:15,360
Because he can crawl up cliff walls just like Stitch.

1646
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,360
Right.

1647
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,360
That's one of his talents.

1648
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,360
Yep.

1649
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,360
Yeah.

1650
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,360
Or he could get up there on a banshee.

1651
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,360
Yeah.

1652
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:25,360
And some Avatar takeover of Magic Kingdom.

1653
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,360
It's filling into that.

1654
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,360
Wow.

1655
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,360
Spider showing up in a tube.

1656
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,360
Well, I would say even the Tree of Life.

1657
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,360
He can skitter all around the Tree of Life.

1658
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:37,360
And what if in California Adventure it's Avatar night and you replace a Spider-Man with

1659
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,360
Spider animatronic?

1660
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,360
Oh, yeah.

1661
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,360
Spider, comma, man.

1662
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,360
Stuntronic.

1663
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,360
Yeah.

1664
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,360
Spider.

1665
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,360
Stitch.

1666
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,360
You know.

1667
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,360
The words are similar.

1668
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:50,360
Because the humans were trying to get him to side with them, but he wouldn't.

1669
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:57,360
And as James Cameron has said, the fire people side with humans and the water people, they

1670
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,360
come to conflict.

1671
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,360
Oh, these fire people.

1672
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,360
I'm scared of these fire people.

1673
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:05,360
You know, what would be really funny about the Spider Stuntronic at California Adventure

1674
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,360
is that if you were far enough away, it would look like a naked human man.

1675
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,360
Yeah.

1676
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,360
Yeah.

1677
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,360
So it would look like a naked man was flying.

1678
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,360
He's kind of a Mowgli, yeah.

1679
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:19,360
And if you can't really tell that the loin cloth is, and if it's just flopping around,

1680
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,360
it might just seem like, yeah, you might just think that's junk hanging out.

1681
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:26,360
If you're on the Annual Passholder Terrace and you're just sipping some wine, you look

1682
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:30,360
over there, you're like, isn't he hurling a naked man through the air every 25 minutes?

1683
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,360
Must be a punishment.

1684
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,360
It must be a teen who tried to get out of a ride.

1685
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:39,360
I guess what they do now is hook him up to a rope device and flail him across the park.

1686
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,360
They've got a real medieval torture situation.

1687
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,360
Jesus, no matter how much we drink up here, let's behave.

1688
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,360
Right.

1689
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,360
Don't want to get flung around.

1690
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:54,360
Malfunctions and the spider thing goes so far into the terrace, the naked man hits the

1691
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,360
table.

1692
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,360
Ah, it lands right on top of you.

1693
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1694
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,360
Flies in the wrong direction.

1695
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,360
Right.

1696
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:02,360
One of his dreadlocks got in my mouth.

1697
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:11,360
Well, they used to do that drink sampler that was like flavors of the sea, plant, and earth.

1698
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,360
There was something along those lines.

1699
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:19,360
The secret menu item is a spider.

1700
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,360
Is a nada and you think, oh, what's that?

1701
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,360
What kind of drink is that?

1702
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,360
You'll see.

1703
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:28,360
It actually is a big stunt metronic being flung into your face.

1704
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:32,360
And if you meet the close up meet and greet spider, he's stinky.

1705
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,360
Well, that's for you.

1706
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:34,360
Yeah.

1707
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,360
That's what you like.

1708
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,360
This is, we've had our fun.

1709
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:41,360
I think, I don't know how much I can do a podcast where the word stinky is said every

1710
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,360
single episode.

1711
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:49,360
I think this might be an allergic reaction as we've discussed.

1712
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,360
I think I might be stinkied out.

1713
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,360
But is the audience, and again, submit to the Google Forms.

1714
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,360
Tell me if you are stinkied out.

1715
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:01,360
But for the podcast that writes little stinker, Jason Sheridan, to say stinky, I think they're

1716
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,360
going to love it.

1717
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,360
I think they're loving it.

1718
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,360
I guess so.

1719
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,360
I think it's unanimous.

1720
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,360
If I had to pick, I'm picking stinker.

1721
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,360
Me too.

1722
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:10,360
Strangely, I have no problem with the word stinker.

1723
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,360
But the word stinky, I just, I think it has time.

1724
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:17,360
I don't know how much stinky talk I can keep having.

1725
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,360
That's fine.

1726
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,360
Look, I got a very sensitive smell.

1727
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,360
Sometimes I'm very sensitive to stuff.

1728
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,360
So maybe I think of stinky too much.

1729
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,360
You're speaking your truth.

1730
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,360
Yes, absolutely.

1731
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,360
Always try to do that podcasting, baby.

1732
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,360
Always try to do that.

1733
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:37,360
Always try to do that when I'm podcasting, baby.

1734
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:43,360
That I would like to say, an image of Jason with his catchphrase underneath, always trying

1735
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,360
to do that podcasting, baby.

1736
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:50,360
And I have a thumbs up and like three to four assorted microphones around me.

1737
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,360
So many.

1738
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:56,360
Oh, and if you look, the fine print on it says any number of.

1739
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,360
Any number of.

1740
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,360
One of these is kind of broken.

1741
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:04,360
One hand doing thumbs up, the other part like partially doing the Megan dance.

1742
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,360
Oh, yeah.

1743
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,360
Oh, yeah.

1744
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,360
Yep.

1745
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,360
Well, we could have thought of a great shirt there.

1746
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,360
I think we really covered everything that there is to cover about this thing that happened

1747
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,360
one day.

1748
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,360
Did we?

1749
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,360
That's sort of.

1750
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,360
Well, I mean, there's not too much other than what you're looking at.

1751
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,360
I missed really quick.

1752
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,360
There was also a TV ad that.

1753
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:22,360
Oh, I didn't see this.

1754
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,360
Yes.

1755
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,360
It was part of it.

1756
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:29,360
So it was it was actually a nod to a broader campaign that's a kind of produced TV ad in

1757
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:36,360
which here we get to see Cinderella and Prince Charming actually reacting to Stitch taking

1758
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,360
over the castle.

1759
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,360
He just that was him.

1760
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,360
He just threw a big thrown out and it shattered on the ground throne.

1761
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:52,360
There's human actors playing Cinderella.

1762
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,360
It's like full feasts.

1763
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,360
He threw.

1764
01:00:55,360 --> 01:01:01,360
Yeah, I guess Cinderella and Prince Charming were going to shout out a gigantic turkey

1765
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,360
just themselves.

1766
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:07,360
Took so much work with their travel agent, but they finally got a reservation at Cinderella's

1767
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,360
royal table.

1768
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,360
Cinderella would be having it.

1769
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,360
Yeah.

1770
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,360
God, I guess not.

1771
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,360
Geez.

1772
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,360
Ah, much better.

1773
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:17,360
Stitch is taking over.

1774
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:21,360
So strap yourselves in for Disney's most experience.

1775
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,360
Check out Stitch's great escape.

1776
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,360
New at the Magic Kingdom.

1777
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,360
Wow.

1778
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,360
My goodness.

1779
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,360
That's not yours, is it?

1780
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,360
That was he ate the glass slipper glass slipper.

1781
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,360
This is I like this, though.

1782
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:38,360
This is like because I think they today they know they would never.

1783
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,360
For some well, boring reason, they would never.

1784
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:45,360
He's flipping the script on your sacred cows.

1785
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,360
You know, really?

1786
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:49,360
Like, what do you think is this is too precious?

1787
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,360
That's that's a stitch.

1788
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,360
Cinderella is no elite to him.

1789
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:56,360
They're all they're all just human beings to him and he doesn't understand human beings.

1790
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,360
Doesn't bother him at all.

1791
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:02,360
Yeah, he ate her shoe and then he's hanging out and kind of he like turns wherever they

1792
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,360
live into like he put up a he put up a dirt board.

1793
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,360
Wait a minute.

1794
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,360
I like stitches.

1795
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,360
I want to go to this place.

1796
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,360
Stitch's wing of the castle.

1797
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:14,360
That's got like a there's a dart board and a bunch of toilet paper and a little like

1798
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:19,360
old TV like you'd want to have in your chill basement and then like a foosball table

1799
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,360
and a poster that says surfers point.

1800
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:26,360
This is actually I would have a coherent decorating for him being a little monster guy.

1801
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:30,360
There's quite a lot of surfing in that in that first movie.

1802
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:33,360
I'm just amazed that he like hung a poster and hung it straight.

1803
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,360
You have to be like disciplined to.

1804
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,360
But I guess as we you know, we talked to him a little while ago.

1805
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:40,360
He is he was like surprisingly lucid.

1806
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,360
I thought.

1807
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,360
Yeah, he was really a good decorator.

1808
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:47,360
And frankly, I'd rather be in his little nook than I'd be when I didn't be in the boring

1809
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:51,360
regular old castle talking to him was like when you like Wiley Coyote would do that like

1810
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:55,360
addressing the camera and all of a sudden he was very articulate and knew a lot about

1811
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:58,360
or like when the gremlin talks like Tony Randall.

1812
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,360
That's true, too.

1813
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,360
Mm hmm.

1814
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,360
I love brain gremlin.

1815
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,360
Uh huh.

1816
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,360
Uh huh.

1817
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,360
Yeah.

1818
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,360
Can you do that?

1819
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,360
Can you do Tony Randall?

1820
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,360
I think so.

1821
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:15,360
So one year for Christmas, Jane got me a little brain gremlin like decorative cell.

1822
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:19,360
A little bit of that had some that had a little juice.

1823
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:22,360
This is I think you just got to push it further.

1824
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:27,360
I think I think I think you made some progress in the voice avenue here and I want to hear

1825
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,360
him.

1826
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,360
But let's just let's like new impressions every time.

1827
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:31,360
Sure.

1828
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,360
Try to challenge yourself.

1829
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,360
I'll buy one of those.

1830
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,360
People in the news.

1831
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:35,360
What's his name?

1832
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:36,360
Hegseth.

1833
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,360
Hegseth impression.

1834
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:41,360
I don't know if I've ever heard Hegseth.

1835
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:45,360
I feel like all I know about him is the energy is always just like everything is it's going

1836
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,360
fine.

1837
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,360
Okay.

1838
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,360
Everything is fine.

1839
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,360
I don't want to hear another shit from people saying we're not doing good.

1840
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,360
Everything's going good.

1841
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:53,360
Okay.

1842
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,360
Like that's the energy.

1843
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,360
You know what?

1844
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,360
And that's what I like.

1845
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:59,360
Maybe that's an impression you should keep doing because that is an energy very similar

1846
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,360
to you, Mike Carlson.

1847
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,360
Yeah.

1848
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:02,360
There's a little more energy than my normal.

1849
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:07,360
That's what happens when you show up 45 minutes late to a thing because you had high jinks

1850
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:08,360
on the way.

1851
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,360
That's true.

1852
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:10,360
Everything's fine.

1853
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,360
It's fine.

1854
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,360
Except generally like I left a doll at home.

1855
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:18,360
I didn't accidentally text war plans to like a reporter.

1856
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,360
Like the stakes hopefully are a little different.

1857
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:22,360
Yeah.

1858
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:26,360
You texted a picture of the doll when you got home and then you gave it to them a week

1859
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,360
or two later.

1860
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,360
Yeah.

1861
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:34,360
I haven't just been sending classified information on like a dirty internet line as they call

1862
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:37,360
it or a dirty internet connection.

1863
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:38,360
Not secured.

1864
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:41,360
Well, scorching hagsets coming.

1865
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,360
But so look forward to that.

1866
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:45,360

Like, can you just say goodbye?

1872
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,360
Is Tony Randall?

1873
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,360
Oh, either.

1874
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:03,360
Yes.

1875
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:04,360
You know what?

1876
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,360
A dealer's choice.

1877
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,360
Yeah.

1878
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,360
Tony Randall or Stitch.

1879
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,360
Well, hi, it's me.

1880
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:11,360
Stitch is already up at Universal for FanFest Nights.

1881
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:14,360
He got a comp I had to pay.

1882
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:15,360
But goodbye, everyone.

1883
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,360
Thank you for listening today.

1884
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,360
Is that Tony Randall?

1885
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,360
It's a perfect Tony Randall.

1886
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,360
Perfect Tony Randall.

1887
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:22,360
Was that an audio recording of Tony Randall?

1888
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,360
Yeah.
