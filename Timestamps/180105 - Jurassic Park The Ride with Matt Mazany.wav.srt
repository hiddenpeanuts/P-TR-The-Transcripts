00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:18,000
tarps, the mighty Akron, and a journey to Jurassic Park, The Ride with Matt Mazzani.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:45,680
Welcome to Podcast The Ride.

4
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,640
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the world's greatest, and as far as I'm concerned, only theme park

5
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,640
podcast.

6
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,320
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Mike Carlson.

7
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,320
Hello there.

8
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,320
And Scott Gardner.

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
Hi Jason.

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:03,920
And we have a guest today, writer, director, you may know him from Funny or Die, Gaya Thrones,

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,920
WWE, Matt Mazzani is here.

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,400
Hey guys, how's it going?

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Good.

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Yeah, how about you?

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,600
I'm jazz, I'm so excited to be here.

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,400
I love the podcast, it's really fun.

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,840
I'm not the biggest ride head in the world, but I think it's like, I am tickled by how

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,080
much you guys know and like, I didn't know there was this to know about rides, the things

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,080
you guys know.

20
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:31,000
That's the whole thing, is trying to legitimize theme park nerddom, have people talk about

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,160
credits and factoids the way you would about Beatles records or things that are way cooler

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,960
than this.

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,680
I have a serious question about ride fandom.

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,680
Sure.

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,680
Yes.

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,720
Are there things like in movies, there's like the a tour theory, is there like a tour theory

27
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,960
for rides, like these types of rides from certain imagineers are, I mean, obviously

28
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,640
like Walt Disney is a big figure and that's as far as I know, but is there any like inside?

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,840
Well there are big famous imagineers that have a lot of like credits that you would

30
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,920
know like we talk about the guy Tony Baxter a lot who like he's the main guy for star

31
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,480
tours, he's the main guy for the figment and figment ride in Epcot.

32
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,200
He's splash mountain, he's Indiana Jones.

33
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Indiana Jones.

34
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,560
I mean, so you're talking about this is a heavyweight like this guy, you know, now obviously

35
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,720
he he didn't do this alone because he asked that there's tons of designers and animator,

36
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,360
but he's you know, the figurehead.

37
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,120
So I guess he's probably the closest to an a tour when you're talking about imagineers

38
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,000
because there's tons of imagineers that don't have the high profile he does.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,240
So Joe roadie in the recent past has been pretty like prominent in the promotional materials

40
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:44,620
at least for the Avatar experience in Florida or Guardians of the Galaxy mission breakout.

41
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:50,520
So there's people who are like more more like upfront in talking about these rides and maybe

42
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,920
taking leave, but I'm sure all of them would not ascribe the tour theory because that you

43
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,520
a theme park ride made by one person would be a terrible ride.

44
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,960
Yeah, it is very much a thing made by committee.

45
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,600
Although Baxter and roadie are both guys who do have a lot of theories about parks.

46
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,920
You know, they will talk all the live long day about theme park.

47
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:19,720
How dare imagine doing that talking for hours at a time and to have the experience to back

48
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
it up.

49
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,720
Disgusting.

50
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,520
So many people though work in Imagineering.

51
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,880
I have to imagine that there are people that are bitter and be like, well, I gave Joe roadie

52
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,280
the idea for the Guardians of the Galaxy to break out of a power plant.

53
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,800
Yeah, like we that's my idea.

54
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,860
Like there has to be like some people that feel like these guys are sort of figureheads

55
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,800
and they get all the glory and like the first guy who did a log flume with like was it was

56
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,280
just all flat with no drops.

57
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,160
And they're like, we should just have a sudden drop instead of a slow slight decline.

58
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,800
And there was one guy who figured that out.

59
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,920
But he was his idea was stolen.

60
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Oh, God.

61
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
Probably.

62
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,640
Oh, but you have to sort of subsume your ideas.

63
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
Is that a word?

64
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,560
You have to your ideas become part of the greater whole.

65
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:13,120
Now, but you at at WWE, you were credited on screen for each line and plot turn that

66
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,760
you came up with, correct?

67
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,880
Publicly, it was it was all the wrestlers and that they they are they are the guy.

68
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,600
Yeah, because oh, that's right.

69
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,920
Because wrestling is not written.

70
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,120
No, of course not.

71
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,680
You were a consultant and advice.

72
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,400
You were like you were a trainer to the rest.

73
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,560
Well, they have words on the screen every once in a while before commercial breaks,

74
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,560
things like up next.

75
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
I would say up next.

76
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,760
Should we have an ellipsis on the end or no?

77
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,240
Like that's the things I would do.

78
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,360
But no, I think much like the amusement park rides, you know, a Sasha Banks, a professional

79
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,880
wrestler, she is she's like the roller coaster that we have to make thrilling and exciting.

80
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,920
But we only want the fans to enjoy the experience of that, not the not the the WWE Imagineers.

81
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Right.

82
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
Sure.

83
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:02,600
So you support the yeah, in the way that you support the more glamorous star, you see you

84
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,720
just you support the the ride itself.

85
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,320
It's about Big Thunder Mountain, not the people who laid all the tracks on Big Thunder Mountain.

86
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,120
But if we were to turn these microphones off, who knows what you'd say?

87
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
Yeah.

88
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,080
I'd have something to say about Big Thunder Mountain.

89
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,320
That's exactly what we don't want.

90
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,920
You don't get a credit like, you know, there's not credits at the end of the rides, but maybe

91
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:33,980
the storefront that sells hardtack and bacon is like McGinty's dry goods and the Imagineer

92
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,980
John McGinty.

93
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,600
That's like, oh, that's my little thing.

94
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
That's my little credit.

95
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,120
There is no I'm sure there's probably been a McGinty.

96
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,240
I thought for a second that that's a real person.

97
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,240
John McGinty.

98
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,280
No, but I did see an article recently of like five times Joe Rody has put himself in rides

99
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:56,400
or like where there's imagineers that like, oh, they clearly his that Alexander Graham

100
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,040
Bell looks a little like Joe Rody.

101
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,520
I see all the glory people find little sly ways to reference this reference themselves.

102
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,480
Now you just Matt, you just spent a bunch of time in Orlando for wrestling and you you

103
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,160
made it down to Disney World for at least at least a time or two.

104
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,160
Correct.

105
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,440
Well, the big thing is is is we're always very busy.

106
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,640
We're down in Orlando because we were working on NXT, which is WWE's Farm League.

107
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,360
So we go to Orlando once a month for TV tapings, always crazy busy.

108
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,480
But one day something happened.

109
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,520
The scheduling shifted.

110
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,040
We had to move the shoot for today.

111
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,120
So we had a free day and we went to go to the Animal Kingdom and I saw Avatar land,

112
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,600
which is a big deal for me because I'm a big Avatar head.

113
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
I love it.

114
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,920
I've always like like anybody else.

115
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,120
I saw it six times in the theaters, never on DVD, because for me it's all about going

116
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,520
to Pandora and that's what the theater experience was.

117
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,920
And so to actually like literally walk around Pandora and like touch the plants and be told

118
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,320
not to touch the plants and then do the whole experience.

119
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
It was great.

120
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,220
I Pandora is awesome and I'm very excited for like Star Wars land.

121
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,280
If that's like the proto Star Wars land, it's going to like Star Wars land to be awesome.

122
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,560
Well let me ask you because I've been to Pandora as well.

123
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,480
Did you ride on the back of the mighty Akron?

124
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
So here's the deal.

125
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,520
So I we went there with it with all the few of the other riders from WWE and we all went

126
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,960
as like a little group and we started doing this thing.

127
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,600
Me and this other guy Robert where we would go take our fast pass because we ran out of

128
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,840
fast pass for that ride and we would start hitting the fast pass button and when it turned

129
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,440
red we would just keep walking and not stop.

130
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,560
Then that became like a game that we would do where we just skip through fast pass.

131
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,920
Oh, we got a rule breaker here.

132
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,600
That's a real heel do.

133
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
That is not a face rule.

134
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
You're talking to three rule followers.

135
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,560
Isn't he sets rules in motion and we all listen to them.

136
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,760
We all like straightened up and we're like very uncomfortable.

137
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,520
I didn't know who we were with.

138
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,080
So but we were teaching a young guys like if you have confidence you can pull off anything.

139
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,240
Just watch this and my buddy would just go and he'd hit it to go red.

140
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,600
Excuse me sir and then like you just keep walking.

141
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,880
They're not going to like chase you down and stop you.

142
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,500
So we went to the the the dragon ride and I don't even know the name of the dragon which

143
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,880
I said I'm an avatar head.

144
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,800
But what you mean the mighty a chronic a the banshee.

145
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Yes.

146
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Yeah.

147
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,320
It is the one it's the area of pop culture where the fans don't know the names of the

148
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
things or the characters.

149
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,320
Yeah.

150
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,360
I don't think there's a more successful thing where you can't name like you know like Sam

151
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,400
Worthington's character in the movie.

152
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Oh, Jake's.

153
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,020
So you got to wait within one one day.

154
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,120
Can you name or can you name three other characters in Avatar?

155
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,720
I can name the hallelujah mountains.

156
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,040
I consider the holy mountains a character.

157
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,000
It's like New York City is a separate character.

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Holy Mountains.

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
There's the general guy.

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,720
The general guy evil name like crowd or is there something else where a general's name

161
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
crowd.

162
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
I don't think it is.

163
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
I have a time.

164
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
It is like a general thrasher.

165
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,800
It is that that something on the general the evil.

166
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,920
I got to say Jake Sully sounds like his name might as well be Johnny working class or like

167
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,240
Fred Regulamon.

168
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,880
The extended scenes are really great which I just watched those.

169
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,680
I didn't watch the rest of the movie but there's like a lot of Jake Sully on earth stuff where

170
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:18,120
he is he is everyday regular man you know wheeling around and getting in bar fights

171
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,480
and it's really good stuff.

172
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,880
Yeah we've all seen it right.

173
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,640
I've never seen that.

174
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,960
I've seen like a little bit of Avatar on a plane once.

175
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,360
I've never seen it all the way through and I missed it in theaters because I was.

176
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,360
Shut his mic off.

177
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,360
Someone shut Jason's mic off.

178
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,360
Alright.

179
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
That's massive to big avatars.

180
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
That is certainly not.

181
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:43,920
I mean though you are soaring through the sky like a mighty banshee that's that's a little

182
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,720
acceptable but.

183
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,640
So you did you have finished to that story.

184
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,800
So yeah so we were fast passing through.

185
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,320
Me and my buddy got through they did stop the other two people in our party so they

186
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,000
had to hang back.

187
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,200
And then we went up and we're just like crying laughing because we're just imagining them

188
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,000
waiting in a three hour line where we're just like piping through and then we go up we all

189
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,400
go all the way to the front and there's a second fast pass line.

190
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
Yes.

191
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,480
There's nobody there just the guys and we're like oh my god we're definitely going to get

192
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,240
caught because there's you know in the crowd you can kind of get by and we go there and

193
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,560
I don't know what happened we do not have the fast pass we hit the fast pass they both

194
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,560
turned green.

195
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,560
Really.

196
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,280
And we don't know why it did it or what but we got through and then we're laughing even

197
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,000
more because we got away with that.

198
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,960
A hallelujah mountain miracle.

199
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,160
Yeah let me ask you were you blessed by the Navi shaman of song on the river journey before

200
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,480
and perhaps you got a bit of that Navi luck.

201
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,560
A little bit because we did do that first we did fast pass our way through that fake

202
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,080
fast pass our way through that and that is a beautiful animatronic she moves it's really

203
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,320
crazy she bang she bang.

204
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,960
Scott's talked about like weird in joke theme park in jokes he has with his wife and this

205
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,520
is a one I have with my girlfriend where all of a sudden I'll just start singing the Navi

206
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,440
shaman of song song.

207
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:08,680
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

208
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,680
hey.

209
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,880
Like it's just the laziest you know generic beautiful song.

210
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:20,120
You're a musician you should do a little like remix of it put it on YouTube to the EDM remix

211
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,360
of the Shaman of Song challenge accepted.

212
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,480
As we said before I am single so I just have these shaman of song song in my Tinder.

213
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,400
Bio that is just my Tinder bio is the Shaman of song song.

214
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,880
Wait you were you were saying though.

215
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,680
Oh the all the sad ending to that is I am too fat for the ride so they kicked me out.

216
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,640
No what it was it was strange because it wasn't like my my belly was it was like it was a

217
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:53,160
very straight my legs couldn't fit because I've got kind of big beefy squat legs and

218
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,400
they tried to like push but they had this little lock in and I told them I was turning

219
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,720
around and said you can fucking push you can use your legs and pull you will not hurt me

220
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,680
I will not sue you get me on this goddamn dragon or I swear and they were like I can't

221
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,960
I can't I can't do it I'm gonna hurt you and I was like I was so upset.

222
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,480
But then we got an extra fast pass so I did the river ride twice which was which was beautiful

223
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
and calming.

224
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
Not quite as good of a ride.

225
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,040
No it's a little that one was a little spare until the the Navi showed up it's like what

226
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,880
am I even doing here like the little spinny it's beautiful and it's nice and it's and

227
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,960
it's like on a hot day it's very air-conditioned but other than that it's you know.

228
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,960
There's one robot.

229
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,760
Yeah I do like anything that floats anything that floats I think is a good ride.

230
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,480
Sure this is insanity though I'm looking at your calves right now those like they're I

231
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,680
would describe them as muscular first of all I think these are in shape calves and you

232
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,160
can't fit those into the stirrups of the of the Avatar ride that's crazy.

233
00:12:52,160 --> 00:13:00,040
I mean it's like this I it's a new ride they should have you know I've been to theme parks

234
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,640
and there's a lot of people of size there.

235
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,400
I thought they would have like you know like thinking ahead like well it's 2017 there's

236
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,240
a lot of big people who could who want to ride drag.

237
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:15,520
We are in central Florida perhaps we should allow that's not all entirely rail thin people

238
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,320
will be on this attraction.

239
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,960
Everybody wants to trade out their rascal for a dragon more than a large person like

240
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:29,080
that like we need the the dragon rides more than skinny people can ride on motorcycles

241
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
and look cool.

242
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:36,440
Their existing body is already a tall lift avatar.

243
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:43,080
That's something when that park when Pandora first opened they also got in a little not

244
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:48,560
trouble but there was a lot of complaints that the river ride neither ride was very

245
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
like.

246
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,400
A.D.A. complite like handicap accessible like there are options for them but there was really

247
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,440
only like one or two of like the fleet of boats that could fit like wheelchairs and

248
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,280
stuff which is insane to think about because the move the main character the movie is a

249
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,280
paraplegic right.

250
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,240
And they did it like but I guess as you're spending billions and millions of dollars

251
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,600
to open all this thing like there's always something that falls that where they go like

252
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,320
oh my god we forgot about like this.

253
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,040
Yeah yeah that's the thing too.

254
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,080
I feel like they could have the way that thing was designed it's like a little bike like

255
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
you don't have to be.

256
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,880
I mean it's like a you know it's like a but you straddle it straddle it and it's like

257
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,080
I get you have be locked in because you're moving around it's a safety thing but it's

258
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,560
just like it wouldn't have taken anything to move those back six inches and then just

259
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,480
have the moving attachments do better.

260
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,040
I bet if you went back now they probably figured like you probably got some timid cast members

261
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,760
who like didn't want to hurt you.

262
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,260
Yeah they were too scared to you're giving them license but they just saw their job flash

263
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,320
before their eyes.

264
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,020
Yeah they said that we had a the story will always go oh yeah we had a 300 pound man crying

265
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:01,720
outside the ride for two hours so we have to fix this at some point because they're

266
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,840
really really getting unpopular.

267
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:10,520
I will say this about Pandora though the absolute best park food I've ever had was it.

268
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,520
It is good I agree yeah.

269
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,520
The little bowls did you have one of the little bowls?

270
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,560
Little bowls with the little like I don't even know what they were there was like beads

271
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,800
of vinegar that were like there it looked like alien food it was really great.

272
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,240
Yeah they I don't want to know I want to just think it's alien food I just I would like

273
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,240
to imagine.

274
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,240
What if this became like fast food that is just a type of the way that there's been like

275
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:38,600
a you know big surge and poke around recently like if Pandora and food became a typical

276
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,160
street food and that place was the pioneer.

277
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
That'd be great.

278
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,480
I think they could probably reskin like Yoshinoya and just make that like Pandora food and I

279
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,280
think nobody would be sad.

280
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:55,040
Yoshipandora yeah yeah why not they like bowls.

281
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,520
Places need to do cool rebrandings I've noticed like Arby's is trying to like hip themselves

282
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,160
up and pretend they're like a cool local carvery.

283
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,960
Some made up take on what they are.

284
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,360
Go on I'm intrigued.

285
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,760
And we all know they're just a cool national carvery that's yeah but they are very cool.

286
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:19,120
Yeah they're pretty corporate that's the thing I mean yeah the meats are superb but yeah

287
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,720
I'm with you let's let's take over the yeah let's let's take over Yoshinoya.

288
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:30,360
They've been nondescript for too long and seemingly diarrhea inducing for too long.

289
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,160
And I would eat that diarrhea food if it was like if you go in there's like a Navi holding

290
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,960
the bowl and like the whole thing and they say I see you.

291
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
Yeah.

292
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,760
Which is their famous phrase that we all know.

293
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,560
They'll hear your order.

294
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:49,160
That'll be the thing when you leave they go I see you again soon.

295
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,040
Hey well you know it's a shame that there are some issues with the with the loading

296
00:16:54,040 --> 00:17:00,960
of these boats and the people getting to experience this beloved intellectual property but one

297
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:07,560
ride that operates without issue day after day all over the world is the Jurassic Park

298
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:13,440
experience sometimes called the Jurassic Park River Adventure also known as Jurassic Park

299
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,760
the ride.

300
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:21,020
But why should we explain it when we can let one of America's greatest national treasures

301
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,000
tell the tale.

302
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,960
Hi I'm Ryan Seacrest and welcome to the new edge from the studios of CNET the computer

303
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,760
network when Universal Studios Hollywood designed a ride based on Steven Spielberg's Jurassic

304
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,080
Park they had a tough act to follow.

305
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,360
I mean after all the movie actually takes place in a theme park.

306
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,360
Well they overcame that with these robots that are so advanced even Spielberg was amazed.

307
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,360
Fuck you.

308
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,760
That's about as deep of a cut.

309
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,080
Look up that video if you care Ryan Seacrest on CNET the computer network.

310
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,960
He looks like a kind of like a Norwegian boy band guy.

311
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,360
He looks like one of the 18s.

312
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,040
If you're familiar with the 18s.

313
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:07,920
Seacrest has been at it for a long time and hey thanks for entertaining us.

314
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:13,400
Anyway that goes on to give you a great behind the scenes look at the extremely high tech

315
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:19,920
dinosaurs that even Spielberg couldn't believe and there you have it the Jurassic Park ride.

316
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
Let's get into it.

317
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:26,120
This is the first episode I think we're doing of like where the attraction is called blank

318
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,680
the ride like we stole the name from.

319
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
Yes true.

320
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,920
Yeah I thought of that I thought of that very thing when we were when my wife and I were

321
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:39,120
talking about the logo we we sort of looked at that and pulled from the how the is very

322
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,360
small and the ride is big.

323
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,360
So there you go.

324
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
Appreciate that.

325
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,280
If it was you're looking at our our logo right now maybe I'm my wife Aaron.

326
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:54,200
Yeah you know also there are not if you look at the history of rides based on movies very

327
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,800
few are actually called blank the ride.

328
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,000
Some of the most prominent rides like Jurassic Park the ride like Back to the Future the

329
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,360
ride but there are not too many of them.

330
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:09,420
No but they came real fast and furious like in a row like as we were children and it made

331
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,080
an impact on us enough.

332
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,080
Absolutely.

333
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,620
That I think when Scott you initially suggested the name podcast the ride we were immediately

334
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,480
like well that immediately makes sense to us.

335
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,840
It's as exciting as when you hear there is a raw Jurassic Park the ride.

336
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,040
Yeah that's a mind blowing statement.

337
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,360
How exciting is that.

338
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,360
Yeah.

339
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,720
More exciting than if we called this podcast galaxies edge.

340
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,720
That's a fine name.

341
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,080
What am I am I making for that.

342
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,560
Save it until you see Batu in person.

343
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:46,960
I also in looking at that history of the ride I don't think Disney any way I don't think

344
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,720
Disney's ever done blank the ride.

345
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,080
I think they always dress it up.

346
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,120
It's an adventure or an experience or they don't want it to be.

347
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,560
You're doing the thing.

348
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,860
Disney's always been big I think on making sure it's like you're not right.

349
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,160
This isn't just like fun.

350
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:08,640
You're entering a fully complex universe a fully immersive experience.

351
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,200
My favorite it's a variant on this but at some point we got to do the episode about

352
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,680
one of the best formatted titles twister ride it out.

353
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
Oh yeah.

354
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,200
A very insane title.

355
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,820
I'm racking my brain right now is is I call it in my head the mummy ride.

356
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,820
Is it the mummy ride.

357
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,880
It is revenge of the mummy the ride.

358
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,880
Oh wow.

359
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,480
Which is confusing because is that there was no the mummy the ride but it sounds like it's

360
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,040
a comeback of a previously existing ride called the mummy the ride.

361
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,760
Yeah I just call it the mummy ride.

362
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,760
Like that's I think quick.

363
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,040
I think that's pretty common.

364
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
Yeah.

365
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,360
That's what anyone calls any of these things.

366
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,240
Star Wars will be Star Wars land.

367
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,640
Avatar is Avatar land.

368
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,720
Nobody uses the preferred nomenclature.

369
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,080
Nobody calls I'm sure I've said on the podcast before but my favorite universal title water

370
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,320
world alive sea war spectacular.

371
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,440
No one on the planet besides people being paid to be at Universal Studios call it.

372
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,040
I think I maybe am I making this up with somebody.

373
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,720
I think somebody like scolded me once like no no no it's not the water world stunt show.

374
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,720
It's water world alive.

375
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
Steve C. Ward spectacular.

376
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,440
He had to be very explicit with that.

377
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,280
I did forget that in Hollywood Universal Hollywood this was called Jurassic Park the ride though

378
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:23,840
initially I think because I probably rode the Orlando one so much which is called the

379
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,760
Jurassic Park River Adventure because it is in a section of the park that is supposed

380
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,500
to be Jurassic Park.

381
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,780
So to do just drive the ride because that would sound weird would be redundant.

382
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:40,640
Look there's so much to talk about in the title alone but there's more than just a sign

383
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,480
that tells you the name of the ride.

384
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,880
There's an entire experience and Matt when we were talking about stuff you might want

385
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
to talk about you brought this up.

386
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,560
I thought it was a fun idea but do you know is there a particular affection you have for

387
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,560
this attraction.

388
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,960
Well I noticed when you guys talked about universal you guys always talk about the ride

389
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:05,440
the movies and to me Jurassic Park the ride is kind of like the pinnacle of what I want

390
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,840
out of a movie ride experience because I feel like it does a great job of giving you the

391
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,720
experience you get when you watch Jurassic Park because it has that moment like my favorite

392
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,760
part in this ride is like you go up the you know you go up the ramp and then you get dipped

393
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,120
down and then it's just like a slow with the music opens and then the gates open.

394
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,800
It's like welcome to Jurassic Park like you want that Laura Dern Sam Neill moment where

395
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,480
you turn their heads you see the Brontosaurus you have that and then you see little things

396
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,840
go wrong and then it goes really wrong.

397
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,840
So you have the whole adventure but it starts with just going to Jurassic Park which is

398
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,480
a place I've always wanted to go just like Pandora I like to be transported and I think

399
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,760
this does a great job of like transporting you to you know a world where dinosaurs walk

400
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,920
the earth with it's just all I've wanted since I was a child.

401
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,900
Until something goes wrong which is a trope of all the Jurassic Park movies and a lot

402
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:59,600
of theme park rides in general it's like they start off fine and then something goes wrong.

403
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:05,600
I guess it's especially universal ride the Jaws ride you know is a scenic tour of Amity

404
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,400
and then Jaws attacks attacks the boat and there's always there's often the mentioning

405
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,680
of problems that happened in the past but this time it will be different and then it

406
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,760
is not different.

407
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,680
This isn't a the Jurassic Park right there it's not like they don't know about the movie

408
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:29,040
right we're in the world of it's not like this is where Jurassic Park was filmed.

409
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,040
You're fully in it is an alternate universe Jurassic Park.

410
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,040
Where the park is operating.

411
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,960
Previews to at least a preview audience.

412
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,320
Right because like John Hammond does the intro video and he's talking about Jurassic Park

413
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,040
and how great it is and there's people walking in and out like I guess they in the universe

414
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,600
they could have said like these are fake like these are people just for the promo ride but

415
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,080
the park it seems like it's open.

416
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,080
The park.

417
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,080
I believe it is not I think they reference Costa Rica as being an experiment that didn't

418
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:04,800
work out and we are in the Hollywood Jurassic Park branch and you watch the Orlando video

419
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:12,480
I think he says Orlando so John Hammond is opening different branches like the San Diego

420
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:19,920
location he was trying to open until the T-Rex got loose and destroyed the 76 ball and the

421
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,240
entire gas lamp district.

422
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,120
Our most beloved San Diego landmarks.

423
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,160
I love how both all of these parks at the open have like a chronic problem with Jeeps

424
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,360
going over the side of cliffs because that that's the only like movie reference that

425
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,480
I can really really think of is that the Jeep goes over the cliff and almost hits you then

426
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,260
it stops.

427
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:45,840
So that's in the Hollywood Park in the Orlando Park and in the original Costa Rica Park.

428
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,440
It's always teetering Jeeps.

429
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,200
There's one Easter egg that's another direct reference to the movie and that's as you after

430
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,880
you go down the big drop and you come back to the loading area there is a small Barbasol

431
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,920
can yes that like the one Dennis Nedry was hiding DNA samples in.

432
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
I gotcha.

433
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,480
So in this world where it's two different parks like what are the odds that there's

434
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,360
a no why would there be another slimy programmer right who will overworked programmer I love

435
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,400
I do notice that there's one for the whole park.

436
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,920
Yeah you can tell why the stress got him and why he maybe wanted to exact some revenge.

437
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,040
Probably the money per hour not great also.

438
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,560
No yeah they're probably working them pretty hard.

439
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,180
Well what's interesting though is if what you're saying is that he's opened up satellite

440
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:35,320
locations then Jurassic World don't they don't even mention it so they've taken the ride

441
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,320
the ride is not in canon in the Jurassic World verse because they sit like they're talking

442
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,360
about sort of the original park but that original park never opened and they don't say well

443
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,880
what about the Hollywood location.

444
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,760
Hollywood and Orlando and Singapore and Osaka are all going fine.

445
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,880
I like the idea that he's also like this is just a much smaller park so it's like a Chili's

446
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:03,380
to go or an airport Chili's version of Jurassic Park it's very small like you can't do the

447
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:07,880
big massive expanse of the original so like that's a little bit and you throw a couple

448
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,320
dinosaurs and it's that's fine.

449
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:15,680
We're gonna do one boat ride we don't have the space to do the orbs but we'll save that

450
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,080
for Jurassic World.

451
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:24,560
And that's the budgetary reason why Dr. Alan Grant or Ian Malcolm or Sadler.

452
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
Sadler.

453
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,960
Kelly Sadler who also could not appear we just couldn't afford them.

454
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,360
Well they're busy they're paleontologists they can't stand around in the river adventure

455
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,800
all day they have work to do.

456
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,840
They have to run an entire campsite for fifty thousand dollars with ten employees I don't

457
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,240
know how that that worked out because you're the one that pays us fifty thousand dollars

458
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,800
it's like how you have a dozen people working for you what are you guys paying them.

459
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,480
Is that the amount named in the movie?

460
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,960
I think they name like how much money he has is like fifty thousand dollars.

461
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,960
Wow.

462
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,960
Wow.

463
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:05,920
The price of a really souped up pickup truck can can fund ten archaeologists or buy like

464
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,240
a pickup truck with very nice rims.

465
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,680
Do you think that people who had relatives who died in Jurassic Park were angry when

466
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:22,960
this Hollywood location brazenly opened with the family of the lawyer upset Genaro what

467
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
was the lawyer's name.

468
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
Oh yeah.

469
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
Jen to narrow.

470
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Jenaro.

471
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,800
I wonder if there were protests outside the Universal Studios gates this is insensitive

472
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,880
to the victims of the Costa Rica.

473
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,560
Although maybe they I think it seems like they covered up right.

474
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,560
Yeah that's right.

475
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,000
Yeah they did not let the word get out of that Costa Rica.

476
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Right.

477
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,160
That's why Jake Johnson in Jurassic World is so loves the first park it feels like he

478
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
doesn't know.

479
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,880
I don't know if he knows what happened right.

480
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,560
He doesn't say like that was the best part because all these people got east.

481
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,560
I don't know.

482
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,120
I don't think they know if they're working on the island.

483
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,720
But Jake Johnson in the movie he's got the shirt on and he's like the original park that

484
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,760
was the best park which never opened but then that people died in that original park.

485
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,440
That's like if someone wore an ironic shirt that said like Bush did 9-11 or something

486
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,440
right.

487
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,040
Have you seen a person wearing an ironic shirt.

488
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,400
No but I bet you I bet I could find one for sale on like even.

489
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,640
I haven't did Jurassic Park like type shirt.

490
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,640
Yeah.

491
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,320
Jurassic Park was an inside engine is an inside job.

492
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,560
I feel like that's the thing about Jurassic World I feel like that movie is like a reboot

493
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,980
of the idea where the movie Jurassic Park exists and then they figure out how to make

494
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,720
dinosaurs because everybody seems to love the movie Jurassic Park.

495
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,120
In Jurassic World.

496
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
That's true.

497
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,040
But by the time this episode comes out the Fallen Kingdom trailer will have dropped and

498
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:45,680
Dr. Ian Malcolm does exist in this world because Jeff Goldblum is back for the Jurassic World

499
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,680
sequel.

500
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,840
The timeline is all screwed up I think.

501
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,840
Yeah.

502
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,820
I think it's just we whatever.

503
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,480
We can't get upset about that.

504
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:59,200
If Jurassic World is a metaphor for the making of Jurassic World like let's try this bigger

505
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,800
one but why should or I'm sorry the making of that new dinosaur is like we need to do

506
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,680
something bigger and better because the audiences are getting bored.

507
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:13,120
Did Jurassic World then go make like a small independent dinosaur that people were not

508
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:21,480
fond of that blew Jurassic World's shot to do other franchises.

509
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,720
Did they try to make the Henry Soros.

510
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,400
This is this metaphor track for the rest of certain directors career.

511
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,720
That would be like a like a like you know they say dinosaurs have feathers now like

512
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,720
that's what they believe is that all dinosaurs are feathered.

513
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,440
They made like a feathered dinosaur in the public's like we don't want this real dinosaur

514
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,980
we want like a scary lizard dinosaur.

515
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,120
This is this is this but this is like the real dinosaurs they're actually four feet

516
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,240
tall and feathered and like nobody wants to like turn boring.

517
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,240
They had the Henry Soros.

518
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,400
He was three feet tall covered in feathers and like pooped out of its mouth instead of

519
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,400
its butt.

520
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,960
This is an abomination to God killed Henry Soros.

521
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,800
Wait is that a book of Henry.

522
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,000
That's kind of what I'm getting at.

523
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,720
This is as confused as the timelines in the Jurassic World franchise.

524
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:15,360
Is the book of Henry explore the metaphor of the Jurassic World universe.

525
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,520
I don't know I'm confused nobody poops out of their mouth in the in the movie but that's

526
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:25,400
how you feel when you've you've watched the movie you pooped out of your mouth.

527
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,520
Anyway I shouldn't keep disparaging this film.

528
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,520
What do I do?

529
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,960
Soon to be best picture winner.

530
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,520
I know so little about this movie but I've heard it dragged left and right.

531
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,800
So it's truly insane.

532
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,880
I saw it in a surprisingly packed theater at the Glendale Americana and I wanted to

533
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,920
stand up and say to the audience like what are we doing.

534
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,040
How are we all.

535
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,720
We all paid money to experience this.

536
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,720
Am I seeing the same movie you're seeing.

537
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,160
Gosh so insane.

538
00:30:53,160 --> 00:31:02,680
It's a shame the characters from safety not guaranteed couldn't travel back in time.

539
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:09,840
Anyway Travarro not involved in the making of Jurassic Park the ride but Steven Spielberg

540
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:17,720
was and in fact he was they they were developing this ride in conjunction with the movie like

541
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,440
Spielberg was so sure that this book like loved the book.

542
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,080
I'm going to make a movie out of this.

543
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,880
I think the movie is going to be a blockbuster.

544
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,240
You should start thinking about a ride already which I think is a unique experience in theme

545
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,280
park development.

546
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,000
When did the ride get released.

547
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,600
When it was 1996 96 in Hollywood 99 in Orlando.

548
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,960
Two years later in 2001 in Japan and then 2010 in Singapore.

549
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,360
But that's a rapids ride not a shoot the shoot.

550
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:52,240
This is apparently known as a shoot the shoot style ride not a log flume ride which has

551
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,000
smaller ride vehicles and multiple drops.

552
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,240
I learned so there's not like a big white doesn't the climax in the same thing where

553
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,200
a big T-Rex appears and then there's a big drop at the or there is that but a smaller

554
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,480
drop because it's a rapid right.

555
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,900
Yeah there it does.

556
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:13,120
You do go into like an environmental safety building and there is like a small drop but

557
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,160
yeah like a much smaller one because rapids tend not to have like super big drops.

558
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
Gotcha.

559
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,160
Okay.

560
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:27,080
Yeah but the and the other thing like the I think the knee jerk in doing a Jurassic

561
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,720
Park ride is probably to do something with the Jeeps.

562
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:35,280
That's sort of the major vehicle obviously featured in the movie but I think a ride like

563
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,240
that would be very complicated and slow loading.

564
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,640
So they thought of doing a boat ride because I guess there is a boat sequence in the original

565
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Jurassic Park novel.

566
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,640
Yeah.

567
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,640
Yeah.

568
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,600
There's a pterodactyl like it's not unlike the thing that gets crashed into in Jurassic

569
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,680
World.

570
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,280
There's a scene in the book or whatever.

571
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,680
What would you call is a scene is a book have a scene.

572
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,680
No.

573
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,680
A chapter.

574
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,680
A chapter an excerpt.

575
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,680
Yeah.

576
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
A book scene.

577
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,680
Yeah.

578
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:07,240
It's like a flume and that's where that crazy man crashes a helicopter in Jurassic World.

579
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
Yeah.

580
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,560
Is it the other way there is a sequence they were kind of they were like saving pterodactyls

581
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,880
from movie to movie like they sort of couldn't pull that off in the first Jurassic Park and

582
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,760
they were saving like a pterodactyl dome and probably couldn't pull although there's this

583
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,560
pterodactyls in Jurassic Park 3 correct.

584
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,000
Yeah I believe so.

585
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,720
But I think that dome sequence is kind of a nod to like that could have been in the first

586
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,640
Jurassic Park but they couldn't pull it off.

587
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,640
Right.

588
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,640
Right.

589
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,200
I haven't read the book but I my dad had read both of them and he was like yeah the movie's

590
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,320
very different the characters are all much more unpleasant in the book and like different

591
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,320
people die.

592
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,320
Yeah.

593
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,320
The lawyer is like lawyer is like a buff guy in the book and he's like a sniveling guy

594
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,320
in the movie.

595
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,320
Yeah.

596
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,300
Like they're sort of different and that's lawyers for sure.

597
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,680
And Hammond is like a real big son of a bitch in the book.

598
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,000
He's a kindly old grandpa but he's like a mean old man.

599
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,800
Doesn't he get eaten by the little guys.

600
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Yes.

601
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
I think that's right.

602
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,800
Oh really.

603
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,800
Yeah.

604
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,800
So there's a whole yeah they changed a bunch of stuff around.

605
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,160
It was like a brutal death because I read that like when I was like in elementary school

606
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,240
because I loved the movie so much I read the book and then I remember like reading it it

607
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,520
was like the little guy bites his leg and then his leg goes numb and he's trying to

608
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,520
like run away and as he like it would basically what happened to the guy in Jurassic World

609
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,480
the bounty hunter he just like little bites to death by these little chicken sized dinosaurs.

610
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,520
Yeah they made it brutal like a brutal death for John Hammond because I think he's sort

611
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,400
of like a villain in the book.

612
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:38,440
He like the book cast him as a villain who's playing God and who is a monster kind of a

613
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,760
low key monster.

614
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,760
Huh.

615
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,840
But so that's a big decision in the movie to make him more kindly relatable.

616
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,320
Santa Claus in the movie.

617
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,320
Yeah yeah yeah.

618
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,320
The man who later played Santa Claus.

619
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,680
Yeah that's a good move right or lateral do we like that.

620
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,000
I don't know did you like it in the book.

621
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,320
Is it better in the book that he's.

622
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,640
I like I mean I get why he's not like that because it makes Jurassic Park a much like

623
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,960
they Malcolm I guess in the movie touches on like you know should you should we even

624
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,800
be doing this.

625
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,240
But it makes it a much more like oh yes it is wonderful isn't it as opposed to like this

626
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,000
evil old man.

627
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,280
It would be just a different movie.

628
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,760
I don't know that I like it.

629
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,640
Then you lose the flee circus monologue and you can't lose the flee circus.

630
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,640
Yeah.

631
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,720
It's it's it's just a sweet moment.

632
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
Sure.

633
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,800
It's kind of a sweet movie in general like in some trailers it's presented as like the

634
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,640
most terrifying thing you'll ever see.

635
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,200
But you actually what like there's that that score is so sweet and majestic and yeah.

636
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:43,720
There's probably a take on the on the dress work novel into a film that's like pure terror

637
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,760
in order from start to finish.

638
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
Right.

639
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,120
And other Crichton books are turned into movies are more just like harsh.

640
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,120
Right right.

641
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,360
So I mean I get why he did it and obviously it works.

642
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,160
So yeah now we get a ride for it where you get to hear that John Williams score as you

643
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,120
enter and I think that's the point.

644
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,840
That's the key that unlocks that.

645
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:09,320
That's what I think Jurassic World is missing is that moment of like holy shit there's dinosaurs

646
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,440
like this is great.

647
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,400
And that's because that's like the key that unlocks the movie.

648
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,240
That's the key that unlocks this ride.

649
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,960
Once you're on board with this is awesome.

650
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,400
There's dinosaurs here.

651
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,280
Then you can fall to the great terrors of being chased by raptors and tyrannosaurs.

652
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,960
But that's just not in Jurassic World where it's just like oh this is a park now.

653
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,120
Like let me ask you guys as as park heads what do you guys think of the depiction of the

654
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,760
Jurassic World future park.

655
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,680
Oh I have a lot of thoughts on this.

656
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,880
I've had it.

657
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:44,240
Yeah I I liked it and I but I wish there was more like I like that they took a monorail

658
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,640
to get to the park like they took a monorail to get to the main part of the park.

659
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:55,360
I like that the teenager was unhappy to be there and then they arrive at like a city

660
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,440
walk style shopping and dining area.

661
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,440
I was very excited.

662
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,640
There was a city walk in Jurassic World.

663
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:06,480
I think that's why I I actually am not a big hater of Jurassic World and I think that's

664
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,720
why I think I like that there's like an IMAX theater.

665
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:14,840
I'll forgive like bad characters and that bizarre harsh drowning of that woman because

666
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,200
there's I like that Jurassic World has an IMAX theater.

667
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,600
Yeah and a Margaritaville.

668
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,640
And a Margaritaville with Jimmy.

669
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,520
Jimmy Buffett in the movie.

670
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,740
A legit laugh and you get a laugh out of that I think watching the movie even before you

671
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,120
realize it's him.

672
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,520
Although did you Mike when you watched the movie did you know it was Buffett right away?

673
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,200
I think I read that it was him so I knew what I was looking for.

674
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,200
I see.

675
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,760
So I was on a website.

676
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:48,720
I'm on websites regularly that would tell me about a future Jimmy Buffett cameo in something.

677
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,640
Did the websites tell you what flavor the margaritas were?

678
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,480
I don't think so but I think they were classic.

679
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,480
I think they were classic.

680
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,480
Classic lime.

681
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
Yeah I think it's pretty easy to see.

682
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,280
So now I think you may have not enjoyed Jurassic World because you're just waiting for that

683
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,560
cameo the whole movie.

684
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,560
I was.

685
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,760
I was a little too.

686
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:09,400
I saw it in theaters like opening weekend and I just thought it was okay and then I

687
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:17,560
remember watching it like that Christmas with my family like with a fire or like just in

688
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,160
our pajama like it was like the most pleasant experience.

689
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,760
It was a very enjoyable experience to watch it in that environment because I think everyone

690
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,800
was in the mood for a big movie and everyone was you know relaxed after the hubbub from

691
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,800
the holidays.

692
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,880
So I'll see the next one.

693
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,080
So watch it in your jammie jams and you'll love it.

694
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,480
So what I like also I forgot I just remembered this on the Margaritaville website there is

695
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:49,120
a Isla Nublar Jimmy Buffett Margaritaville like kind of piece of marketing for the movie

696
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:54,420
but it makes it look like that's an actual location and it's a whole thing of like Jurassic

697
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,440
World eat at Jurassic World Jurassic World dining and then.

698
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,120
Oh they built out a very corporate website like would be just on margaritaville.com but

699
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,360
for Isla Nublar that's pretty cool.

700
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,960
Isn't it ELA?

701
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,960
No well they.

702
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,360
Same question about Isla Fisher or Isla Fisher.

703
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:15,280
Here's a video from the like B roll or whatever you call from the movie where Buffett is horsing

704
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,000
around with some ladies and nothing nothing too weird but like just kind of goofing.

705
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,400
Get a little dinosaur toy.

706
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
Yeah.

707
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:29,320
So this is like yeah there's like a face sprinkles cupcakes next to it within the oh Jimmy Buffett

708
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:34,480
bartending surprising some ladies with a little dinosaur puppet and he's got his hand up on

709
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,880
a fin making a fin like his song fins that you know.

710
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,240
So go to so Google Isla Nublar Jurassic World and you know it's a little Easter egg treat

711
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,640
a little a nice little like universe expansion.

712
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,520
Matt what's your feeling on Jurassic World.

713
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:56,360
I thought it just it was it was weird because every part that was good was when they played

714
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:01,280
the music or showed a logo from the first Jurassic Park and like that was the only part

715
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,240
like I was emotional to do so it just kind of like felt you know it's like a greatest

716
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:10,920
hits and I like if you compare it to the ride the ride gives you all the nostalgia you want

717
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:16,160
for the movie but you don't have to you know sit there for two hours to do it it's a nice

718
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:22,080
clean five minute ride and it gives you like the entire story in a five minute ride whereas

719
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:28,200
this thing is like just so many side plots and weird stuff and and.

720
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,600
My parents are getting a divorce.

721
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:39,200
Yeah yeah yeah why this divorce story in this movie that's like Judy Judy Greer just wasted

722
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,200
in that movie.

723
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,520
Yeah Lauren Lapkus do I wish very funny I wish had done more in the movie but she's

724
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,480
that part with her and Jake Johnson is in Mission Control is very funny where that was

725
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,000
very funny yeah yeah they got a big laugh in that yeah that's I think they're back for

726
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
the sequel.

727
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I also do I like those characters.

728
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,240
I have a question about when you talk about like theme park references in the movie I

729
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,560
think I like that there's this when you when you go on this orb attraction that you watch

730
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:12,440
a safety video obviously I'm obsessed with the theme park safety videos and that you

731
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,320
watch one starring Jimmy Fallon which I just found a behind the scenes of the shows that

732
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:23,120
they shot it at Studio 8H where they do Saturday Night Live so they're like filming it's like

733
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:30,560
essentially an SNL sketch custom for the Jurassic World orb ride with with Jimmy Fallon.

734
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:37,960
But my question is like it's that that it's sort of hokey it's like you know Jimmy Fallon

735
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,960
getting sprayed by tar and then like something getting lit lit on fire it's like it was kind

736
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,540
of like little science gone awry sequence.

737
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:50,480
And my question was like was it a little lame on purpose because theme park ride videos

738
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,480
are always a little lame or were they committing hard to a where they try to make like a very

739
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,840
funny original Jimmy Fallon sketch.

740
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:02,320
Was it like self aware that like these things are always a little stupid.

741
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,480
I'll give them I'm going to am going to give them a little credit that they were self aware

742
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,720
that they were like laying it on thick because sometimes these videos are laid on pretty

743
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:18,120
thick and like theme park videos have to have they can't exactly be like dense verbal humor.

744
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,360
It's probably going to be people getting hurt because people of who speak all languages

745
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,520
are watching these videos and kids to 80 and yeah yeah yeah.

746
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,560
I thought those things were well done though and I liked that like of course if Jurassic

747
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:35,160
World existed Jimmy Fallon would do the video like he hosts the Universal Tour here in Hollywood.

748
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:39,640
Well and actually now that we're talking about it actually to give Jurassic World credit

749
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:44,800
the maybe one of the truest things about this movie is that the only thing that's fresh

750
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,160
is they have like a take on theme parks that they actually like say this is what we think

751
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,240
theme parks are now and will be in the future.

752
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,200
So that was like the only like original thought is like what if there's orbs and of course

753
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,080
there's going to be a Margaritaville in this.

754
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,960
Yeah like if there was a real Jurassic Park they did a good job of making it seem like

755
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,120
it would be modeled after the parks of today.

756
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,120
Right.

757
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,120
Did a good job of doing that.

758
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,240
And there was an arms race element of like we got to have a new attraction you know we

759
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:13,400
got to have a bigger dinosaur people are you know getting sick of these old ones the sponsors

760
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,840
or didn't they say like Verizon wants to sponsor a big dinosaur or something.

761
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,840
It may have been you know marketing or like you know corporate synergy or whatever like

762
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,040
the Fallon tie in and stuff but like that is a reality of theme park.

763
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,140
So I agree with you I did like that that was in there.

764
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:35,280
What would you guys say is is the analog between dinosaurs and rides in Disneyland is like

765
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,560
so it's like the Tyrannosaurus is that the space mountain of Jurassic Park.

766
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,320
You mean like the high ticket the biggest attraction.

767
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,280
Yeah like what was that question.

768
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,280
Oh interesting.

769
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:52,360
Well you got you know Jurassic World has the petting zoo with the triceratops and that's

770
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,840
more of a that's more of a kiddie ride.

771
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,840
That's like the teacups.

772
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,840
Or me that's like meeting Winnie the Pooh maybe.

773
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,960
Yeah that's Winnie meeting Pooh and his friends.

774
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,440
Thing for the little ones.

775
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,440
Yeah.

776
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,440
With that.

777
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:11,120
Well obviously that that giant crazy aquatic dinosaur eating the shark is the equivalent

778
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,280
to Universal's Waterworld Alive Sea War spectacular.

779
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,280
Sure.

780
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,200
Thank you for showing it its proper respect.

781
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,200
Absolutely.

782
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,880
I'm not watering that name down it's a beautiful name.

783
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,360
Oh my god by the way I got to make a quick side jump.

784
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,240
Do you know if it's true Mike because we're both wrestling guys.

785
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,240
Yeah.

786
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,320
That Chris Daniels is doing Waterworld now.

787
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,320
Wait what?

788
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,320
The stunt show?

789
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,320
I heard that he's playing the Deacon.

790
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,320
Is he really?

791
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,760
I've heard that I don't know if it's true but I've seen pictures of Chris Daniels as

792
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,760
the Deacon.

793
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,760
Oh my god.

794
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,760
Yeah.

795
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,400
Chris Daniels is our impending wrestler.

796
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,840
I mean works for Ring of Honor and other places but.

797
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,840
Been around forever.

798
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,840
Great wrestler.

799
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,480
You guys know that I know a Deacon right.

800
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,960
The Deacon is Dennis Hopper correct?

801
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,960
Yes.

802
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,960
Yes.

803
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,960
Yeah yeah yeah.

804
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,960
We got to talk about this at some point.

805
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,120
A guy worked to the cone a bunch Greg Dolph.

806
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,560
Great dude and he is a Deacon and has been since they opened.

807
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,160
So maybe he's welcomed this wrestler into the Deacon family.

808
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,120
Yeah I believe that's not a bad gig because I think they are in like the stunt man union

809
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,560
and so it's like consistent.

810
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,040
So there's benefits.

811
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,120
Like a little bit of consistent work and stuff.

812
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,120
Good for them.

813
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,120
They're covered.

814
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,000
I mean here from just a Google search there's a video that says Christopher Daniels as Deacon

815
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,880
in the Waterworld Stunt Show and this is from last year.

816
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,840
And Christopher Daniels is a.

817
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,840
Wrestler.

818
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,840
Independent wrestler.

819
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,880
Yeah he's been around for like 20 years on the independent.

820
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,880
Oh wow.

821
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,560
He never made it in the WWE but he's really really great.

822
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,000
There he is yeah he's a great wrestler.

823
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,320
Is he bald already or does he have to wear a bald cap to be bald already?

824
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,320
He's bald already.

825
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,320
Perfect.

826
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,320
That's probably why they thought of him.

827
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,320
Wow.

828
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,480
It's a good day for bald caps and prosthetics to be reapplied every day.

829
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,280
Especially in a water park ride.

830
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,600
Oh yeah yeah they'll be wear and tear on that.

831
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:53,280
Hey just like the wear and tear on these dinosaurs in the Jurassic Park ride.

832
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,960
It is pretty crazy when you think about you know whatever the whatever the skin is made

833
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:05,960
of on these dinosaur robots that it's this it's foam rubber that has to stay flexible

834
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,100
despite getting wet all day.

835
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,920
And when it's pretty insane that they turn the technology around from when they made

836
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,200
Jurassic Park where you what you watch this crazy behind the scenes footage footage of

837
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,360
people have seen it they were listening that you if you watch the T. Rex robot in the making

838
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,600
of Jurassic Park that when it would get wet because all the scenes involve rain it would

839
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:30,880
like shiver and shake like it was like it was like it was like the T. Rex got sick and

840
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,400
there's all this crazy footage of PAs just like padding down the T. Rex with towels.

841
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,680
They like they didn't think about how this was going to work.

842
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,400
So it's just like small hand towels.

843
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,560
Let's dry off that T. Rex and then three years later they have a ride where these dinosaurs

844
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,560
have to get wet all day every day.

845
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,040
It's what they do and they all they all look great.

846
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,600
They upkeep on that ride is fantastic.

847
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,200
Yeah I mean there's been times when you go in and there's just a big tarp over one of

848
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,200
these dinosaurs.

849
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,200
Really?

850
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:02,160
The majestic like majestic Jurassic Park theme and then like there's a big just big like

851
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:07,400
if as if they're fumigating a house sized tent over one of these long neck dinosaurs

852
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:13,200
and you're like oh wait that's that kind of kills the the sick.

853
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,020
That is what they yeah yeah they he's been quarantined.

854
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,720
So I know they did a refresh on it a couple years ago I think because they were having

855
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,000
some issues and I feel like dinosaurs felt like they were melting a little bit.

856
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,420
I feel like there's that that duck bill dinosaur that that that squirts water out of his nose

857
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:30,000
like when you take that turn you come around the out of the cave and I feel like he was

858
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,680
gone for a while but they would still play his like sound effects.

859
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,680
Oh yeah yeah.

860
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,720
I was just like it was just it was very because it was a it was a very empty because he's

861
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,560
a big feature so it's like a very empty turn without him there because you're just like

862
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,240
hearing him and not seeing him.

863
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,360
And he you're right but you're saying right before the turn happens right the dinosaur

864
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,400
Hedrasaur Cove before you go into Hedrasaur Cove.

865
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,800
My friends and I had a long running bit of like can't wait to ride Jurassic Park ride

866
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:58,000
go see all our buds the dinosaurs in Hedrasaur Cove and that's when it goes wrong that's

867
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,540
when you get knocked off track.

868
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:05,320
To continue Matt's metaphor what's Hedrasaur Cove in the Disney park or in or in theme

869
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,540
park where like a cool ride that's often broken.

870
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,680
The storybook canal boats.

871
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,680
Sure great.

872
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,680
The Hedrasaur Cove.

873
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,680
Incredibly inconvenient to operate.

874
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,680
There you go well a quick answer.

875
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,680
Yeah Jason got it.

876
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,680
Thank you.

877
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:26,520
I feel like the Jeep you mentioned earlier the Jeep that falls down and splashes in the

878
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:31,240
water is also an indicator of like wait have they done upkeep recently because that doesn't

879
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:35,800
have to work like that can just be hanging off and it reads like it makes sense.

880
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,600
It doesn't always crash.

881
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,880
Yeah it doesn't always crash down.

882
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,960
It's like the train which is was not functioning for a long time at Disneyland.

883
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:44,960
Oh yeah.

884
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,960
That's that metaphor.

885
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,400
We'll break it all down.

886
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,520
And well the other thing I got to ask you guys about this one what do you guys think

887
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,840
about the little the little Disney hats that float in the water.

888
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,840
That's a fun.

889
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:59,200
I always think that's really I was at some point think like how is that still here.

890
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,120
How is like Disney not had a problem with this.

891
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:07,720
I wonder if because I think if there's are they I wonder if their actual Disney license

892
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,640
or they're I mean they probably mocked him up unless they went to the park in his bottom

893
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,040
and threw him in the water.

894
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,120
They're ovals they're not perfectly right.

895
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,200
So they're technically off brand.

896
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,760
Yeah if they're like technically off brand they can do it.

897
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,500
Because I feel like Disney would get litigious if like there was a diner that made pancakes

898
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,400
that looked like like sure we were together like.

899
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,680
So the fact that they're not like attacking universal because it's still there.

900
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,720
I thought it'd be like I'd see it one time and then it'd be gone like somebody's having

901
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,720
a yeah.

902
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,960
But it's like a part of the ride that some Disney fans got drowned and killed by these

903
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:39,960
Raptors.

904
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:40,960
Yeah right.

905
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,760
Universal's always been a little more bribe all the little more cheeky with their sense

906
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,080
you little edgy little.

907
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:53,600
Isn't there a part in the Avatar ride where a banshee tears Woody Woodpecker apart.

908
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:59,360
Yeah the beloved character the beloved licensed character Woody Woodpecker.

909
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:04,120
You see stray Woodpecker beak hats lying around the Kingdom of Pandora.

910
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,480
Then like the mummy sees like a like there's like a little Indiana Jones silhouette the

911
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:11,240
mummy thumbs over the shoulder that makes a Jake jerk off motion at him.

912
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:15,720
He's like this guy like yeah there's a lot of like oh god.

913
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,280
The whole Simpson ride is goofing on Disney too.

914
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,280
That's true.

915
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:24,560
So I guess maybe it's just like all right it's there's a like a ceasefire on both parts.

916
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:28,760
Yeah well they also are the plucky underdogs in the LA theme park.

917
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:34,400
Well none's more plucky than Knott's Berry Farm but they're not as very plucky.

918
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,720
Yeah it's like an attribute.

919
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,000
It's the pluckleberry pie.

920
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,960
It's the plucky underdog that is owned by NBC Universal at Comcast NBC Universal and

921
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,200
what's the one from 30 Rocks?

922
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,360
Shine Heart wig company.

923
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:55,200
Hey well what else about this ride?

924
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,240
We mentioned Hadrosaur Cove.

925
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:03,120
Any other moments that I mean it's cool you get to you get spit out by a spitter.

926
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,440
What's just moments from this ride that we enjoy?

927
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,840
Well this is more an anecdote than anything else.

928
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:13,440
When the first ride opened in Hollywood like there were actors from the movie that like

929
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,440
Jeff Goldblum was there.

930
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:20,840
Steven Spielberg was there and the story goes apparently like they rode the ride and then

931
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:27,600
stopped it at the top of the drop to let Mr. Spielberg off and then the boat went down

932
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:31,360
which come on Steven children ride this thing suck it up do it once.

933
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,040
I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

934
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:41,400
And Scott doesn't like these drops either like Mr. Spielberg.

935
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:46,880
By not doing the drop I'm experiencing the ride the way Spielberg intended.

936
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,880
I'm subscribing to his auteur theory.

937
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,480
But that means you're just in limbo you're just in hell.

938
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,440
You don't escape the dinosaur you're just under the dinosaur in the falling pipes forever.

939
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:01,360
How do you make it out you just like you just sadly walk away scarred by the experience

940
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,360
forever.

941
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,400
You've been on this ride though.

942
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,320
I did do it once and that was plenty.

943
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,440
I was terrified still scarred.

944
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:15,920
The commonality between all the like when I had girlfriends who made me man up and go

945
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,240
on these rides I would do them.

946
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:23,240
But now that I have a wife who's nice who doesn't boss me around I don't have to go

947
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,880
on any ride I don't want to.

948
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,600
Aaron make Scott go on the Jurassic Park ride.

949
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,880
No I'm talking directly to you Aaron.

950
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,880
Out.

951
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,440
It's like Scott's parade Scott's platoon of mean girlfriends.

952
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,040
That he's also bragging about all these girlfriends.

953
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,040
Bloody dog.

954
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:44,520
I've gone around I've had three girlfriends in my life.

955
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:47,920
Dozens of times so you know I've had a few.

956
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,280
A different girlfriend for every time.

957
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,880
Yeah well I think I before my wife I had two girlfriends.

958
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:01,080
And I think I went on scary flume rides two times before.

959
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,280
Would you play it cool.

960
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,400
Like if they were like hey let's go on Splash Mountain or something would you kind of go

961
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,640
like oh yeah yeah cool whatever I don't that's fine yeah I love Splash Mountain or would

962
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,440
you have to kind of be tucked into it.

963
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:17,160
I'd be doing curls the entire time and like getting up on those on the you know the the

964
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:22,280
the poles that separate the line and just like doing doing pushes off of those.

965
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,840
But would you let them know that you didn't like it or would you just play it cool and

966
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,600
like inside you were terrified.

967
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,680
Oh yeah how how would I play that.

968
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:38,160
I don't think I tricked them I don't think I'm not sure my performing skills were particularly

969
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,880
sharp I think I'd.

970
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:46,000
I mean because I have you get legit terror in your eyes when you're doing these things.

971
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,560
I remember seeing Mortal Kombat when I was younger and I'm if you figure out how old

972
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:56,120
I was it was probably older like 13 or something but I was scared in the movie very scared

973
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:00,240
and like I tried to play it cool and I just kept asking questions to my friend the whole

974
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:05,320
movie and he was so mad and I thought I was playing it cool but it was very clear I wasn't.

975
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:09,360
Was it Goro because Goro is pretty scary he's a very whole thing I thought people were going

976
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:13,180
to die I had never seen an R rated movie in the theater before maybe never saw an R rated

977
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:15,160
movie zero rule follower.

978
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,760
I follow the rules.

979
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,600
I hope you didn't see any R rated movies before you were 18.

980
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,000
I snuck into Event Horizon.

981
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,320
Oh great time.

982
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:26,040
What's bad boy Mizani over here.

983
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:32,920
Don't respect fast pass laws or the MPAA and our two most powerful institutions in this

984
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:33,920
country.

985
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:40,720
Now I was very scared of the ring like I was 15 and like for two nights afterwards I had

986
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,880
trouble sleeping from the American version of the ring.

987
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,240
Sure with Naomi was scary.

988
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,120
Well that's at least a scary movie.

989
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,880
I guess so yeah.

990
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:54,240
Mine is Mortal Kombat it's like PG-13 and they can't really show much gore and like

991
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,240
whatever.

992
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,760
Goro is weird looking and I think there's something unsettling about him.

993
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,760
Oh yeah for sure.

994
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,160
Everything about the movie is a little unsettling they're on an island with like the people

995
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,480
that run the island have all masks on and it's very like it's very like proto eyes wide

996
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,600
shut but with fighting so it's like a weird adventure that they're on.

997
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,200
That's true but I don't think I was up there.

998
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,200
That's true I guess.

999
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,320
You're trying to give them the benefit of the doubt.

1000
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,800
You're trying to help me out here I appreciate it.

1001
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,680
I was scared of the yell.

1002
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,120
Mortal Kombat!

1003
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:25,600
I've never seen the films or played the games because I'm just if I'm just passing through

1004
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:30,600
an arcade and I hear that scary yell I gotta go hide in the bathroom for a while.

1005
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,560
Did a girlfriend ever make you try to make you play Mortal Kombat?

1006
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:34,560
Scott get over there.

1007
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,560
I can do this.

1008
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,840
You're Raiden I'm sub-zero Scott.

1009
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:41,560
No I know I know all kinds of attacks.

1010
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:48,520
On Jurassic Park I always think because like this is one of those where there's like two

1011
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,240
tracks and you go off the wrong track.

1012
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:56,240
It's like you're going the bad way and I've kind of always kind of tried to figure out

1013
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:00,000
what the good because they didn't build it but what is the good track because where does

1014
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,560
the T-Rex go?

1015
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:05,040
Like we see where there would be like the raptor cages but what would the end of the

1016
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,440
ride be if it was a normal ride?

1017
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,720
You have to see the T-Rex but it wouldn't be in the context that we see him now where

1018
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:14,400
he's just exploding out of a like a vent or something.

1019
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,460
He would we would have to like just see him and that would be the end of the ride right?

1020
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:21,640
They would have taken you so you go all the way up to the top of this building and then

1021
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:26,840
it would have like hit a view of Universal Studios and there would have been one sound

1022
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:33,120
stage that they took the roof off of and the T-Rex would have been just wandering around

1023
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:36,040
in the sounds contained in the sound stage like a cage.

1024
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,040
Eating a goat leg.

1025
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:41,120
So in the you would have seen it from hundreds and hundreds of feet away from up but you

1026
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,800
would have just had a view of a Tyrannosaurus.

1027
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,640
So you're saying it's also a drop ride in the origin in the narrative of the ride it's

1028
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,080
also a drop ride or is it not?

1029
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:54,880
They would have lowered you down very very slowly or let you up at the top the drop would

1030
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,800
have had like Spielberg intended they would have let you off at the top then the drop

1031
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:04,600
was just where they deliver the boats back to be reloaded again.

1032
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:10,920
Okay yeah that was just like a boat delivery system after you'd seen the contained T-Rex

1033
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:16,500
but unfortunately the track things go awry you have to take the plunge which was never

1034
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,120
intended for a human to go on.

1035
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:23,080
I'm glad that Spielberg got off the ride and just walked down and let everybody else do

1036
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:26,280
the drop because I could also imagine a world where they make a bunch of employees like

1037
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:32,920
hold ropes and let the boat go down very slowly at the drop just like very slowly going down.

1038
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,760
So they can get a picture perfect moment.

1039
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:38,440
And then they pause it's all like shaking holding these ropes and Spielberg's like

1040
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,000
ah like faking it.

1041
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,400
I guess Spielberg like escaping through a side door off camera is kind of what happens

1042
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:50,360
with Beatty Wong's character how he escapes the first movie to live to Jurassic World

1043
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,040
where he's evil now.

1044
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,040
Yeah.

1045
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,040
Yeah he's bad.

1046
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,040
He's bad.

1047
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,040
Drink the Kool-Aid.

1048
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,960
As opposed to the first movie where he's just kind of there.

1049
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,960
He exists.

1050
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,960
He's a scientist.

1051
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:03,960
He's a scientist.

1052
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:08,720
When he walked out in Jurassic World I felt like there was like a hold for a gasp and

1053
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,720
I did not gasp.

1054
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,240
I didn't remember who he was.

1055
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,880
It took me a second.

1056
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:18,480
I associate him more now with Law and Order because he was a CSI guy.

1057
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,160
Every episode of Law and Order you gasp.

1058
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,160
I gasp.

1059
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,160
BD.

1060
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,480
I gasp every time they go chung chung.

1061
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,520
They should change the name to Law and Order BDU.

1062
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,120
BD's unit.

1063
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:41,600
A thing I like about the ride is that it is because like Jurassic Park all the rides experiences

1064
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,920
are all very museum or zoo like.

1065
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:50,720
There's not really an exciting element which is a thing I kind of like about Jurassic World

1066
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:54,640
because I feel like they're thinking a little bit more sure we have dinosaurs but we also

1067
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,320
are going to give you like a thrill a little bit of a thrill.

1068
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,360
It's a bit there's sort of a it's like Epcot.

1069
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:05,040
There's two thrill attractions but also a lot of museums right slow moving.

1070
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,240
Yeah hydroponic plant displays.

1071
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:12,460
Yeah I feel like there there has been a lot of speculation about like you know Universal's

1072
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:16,640
got all this land in Orlando where they're probably going to build a third park and like

1073
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,200
Jurassic World was such a huge hit.

1074
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:25,720
They will make very likely build a Jurassic World section and that hey that orb sequence

1075
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,960
like that's tailor made to be built.

1076
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,680
I think we might be traction in real life.

1077
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:34,120
We might be riding in orbs before we know it in Orlando.

1078
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,960
Actually that would be a great plus it up for the Animal Kingdom Safari Rides.

1079
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:38,960
You're in that big truck.

1080
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:44,040
If you could go around in an orb and look at rhinocerai that would be that's like because

1081
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:48,200
I was thinking of where would I where would I want this orb in a natural park setting

1082
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,560
and that's the only place I could think is the Safari Animal Kingdom.

1083
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,400
Right because you can get closer then to the animals.

1084
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,400
Yes.

1085
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,840
The future of theme parks is orbs.

1086
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,440
Calling it now.

1087
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:05,080
Just take the BB8 technology and make that something you can sit in and that's the end

1088
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,880
that's how you make orbs.

1089
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,800
Call the BB8 people you'll figure it out.

1090
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:12,640
I could also see orbs being like a like a like a fast pass option so if you don't want

1091
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:16,880
like because I hate being in crowds it's one thing that a really packed amusement park

1092
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,520
makes me very like nervous people and I can like I if I if I bump into a kid the kid will

1093
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,440
die like that you know.

1094
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,960
So it's like so I was worried but if I got to be in an orb and like you know everybody

1095
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,760
has to stand aside from the orbs and you have your own personal orb space you go to the

1096
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,000
front of the line you hop out of the orb you go to the ride so I would do like a like a

1097
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,440
fast pass orb option.

1098
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,840
You would love just being an orb most of your life it sounds like.

1099
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,840
I could live like that.

1100
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,840
Jason apparently agrees.

1101
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:47,800
Just step out outside sometimes into a bathing orb and then back into a.

1102
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:51,760
Give me those orbs baby.

1103
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,880
Beam in the womb.

1104
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:58,440
I did not find the answer to this question but Michael Crichton has Westworld he has

1105
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,000
Jurassic Park.

1106
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,880
What is is was Crichton a theme park guy like or like or did he just sort of think about

1107
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:09,800
how horrible these because it seems like he has a negative feeling about theme parks because

1108
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,200
both of his properties are them going horribly wrong.

1109
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,640
I don't think he was a pleasant man.

1110
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:19,760
I feel like I feel like he's also like at the end of his life he got real into global

1111
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:23,760
warming and I forget whether it was a hoax or that he said it was a hoax.

1112
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,680
Yeah yeah he got really was very conservative.

1113
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:26,680
Like yeah yeah.

1114
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:27,680
Oh no.

1115
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:31,720
He weighed he with all his conspiracy theories about genetics.

1116
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:34,480
He doesn't think the real thing is happening.

1117
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,160
Yeah I guess he didn't toward the end of his life.

1118
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,160
Wow yeah.

1119
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:41,040
He was like an early like before Reddit came along and like if Reddit probably would have

1120
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:45,080
like sapped all his creative energy out like writing conspiracy theories for Reddit but

1121
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:48,240
instead he just like wrote these novels of his conspiracy theories then he just kind

1122
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,240
of went off the rails.

1123
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:54,320
He's on that Scott Adams smoking whatever Scott Adams is smoking.

1124
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:58,680
He's like lucky he died before this like time where we just like entertain all thoughts

1125
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,760
and all thoughts get an equal seat at the table.

1126
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,320
Now he wouldn't have made blockbuster novels.

1127
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,600
He would have just gotten a lot of Reddit gold.

1128
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:10,640
Yeah well he picked the right time to be.

1129
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,640
Yeah.

1130
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:17,640
The also he sort of predicted like immersive with Westworld predicted immersive theme park

1131
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:23,600
experiences like we're about to get with Star Wars Galaxy's Edge where you're like a character.

1132
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:28,240
You the guest are playing a consistent character and the other people in the park know who

1133
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,600
you are which apparently is how this thing is going to be.

1134
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,440
But Crichton was that's one thing he got right.

1135
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:40,240
He predicted Star Wars Galaxy's Edge but not global warming.

1136
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,040
We'll see which one gets here first.

1137
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,040
Yeah.

1138
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:47,320
A race neck and neck.

1139
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:54,340
The day that the floodwaters pour over the barely the opening in a week Star Wars Galaxy's

1140
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:56,480
Edge and we don't get to go on it.

1141
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,360
Oh no.

1142
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,320
Well get that get that thing open Disney.

1143
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:05,800
Crichton in heaven is just giving a 20 to Walt Disney just like no you're right.

1144
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:12,280
Hey you know what else the theme park nerds I bet I bet you've been storing up anger about

1145
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,280
this thing.

1146
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,280
You've probably talked to therapists about it or something.

1147
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,860
You remember I'm sure you had this feeling when you were a kid when you watched Jurassic

1148
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:27,720
Park and John Hammond very explicitly says when Disneyland opened in 1956 which all we

1149
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:32,540
all the most basic theme park facts that Disneyland opened in 1955.

1150
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:35,780
How bizarre is that that they leave that in the movie.

1151
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:42,180
He says yes so explicitly almost as if to mock me young theme park nerd Scott Gardner.

1152
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:46,280
I also have a very distinct memory of having a bunch of action figures for this movie well

1153
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:51,160
before I saw the movie and they all came with different kinds of guns.

1154
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,580
And then when I watched the movie I was like where are the guns.

1155
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:57,200
And the reality is you if you sell someone an action a child an action figure you got

1156
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,460
to give it a bunch of stuff to hold.

1157
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:04,040
But in all fairness yeah by the end of this movie every character should have a giant

1158
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,120
fucking gun.

1159
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:09,360
Like there's a reason there's multiple arcade games where you are.

1160
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:12,720
You're set in Jurassic World and you have a giant gun because like yeah they should

1161
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,120
have been blowing those dinosaurs away by the end.

1162
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,740
It didn't happen.

1163
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:21,840
One guy gets a gun and he gets eaten before it and then at the end I think like Laura

1164
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:26,260
Dern is like holding one in a weird way or like as they're running to a helicopter someone

1165
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:31,680
else has it and like throws it away at the end or like it's never acknowledged.

1166
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,880
Like why aren't there guns everywhere.

1167
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:39,760
The PG-13 nature of the movie the reason there's not a ton of dinosaur murders happening.

1168
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:44,920
Yeah but that was the early 90s like Sam Jackson is smoking at every other shot on the TV.

1169
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:45,920
Oh yeah true.

1170
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:46,920
Again different time.

1171
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:49,880
I like that if we were to interview both of you guys after the movie and you were young

1172
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:56,880
kids that your grievance Scott would be they got the Disneyland year off by one and Jason's

1173
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,200
like where were all the guns.

1174
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:03,840
But if I'd had a little eight year old girlfriend I would have been like I wanted more guns.

1175
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,440
I'm as tough as Jason.

1176
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:13,280
Eventually I got older and like oh guns are not purely the world of exclusive to the world

1177
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,560
of Hollywood entertainment.

1178
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:17,680
They are a nightmare plague that haunts America.

1179
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,680
Sure.

1180
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:22,720
Had Spielberg then learned his gun lesson because he famously for a special edition

1181
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,840
of ET took the guns out and replaced them with walkie talkie so maybe at this point

1182
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:27,840
he had learned.

1183
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:33,600
Well Tom Cruise there's a very important shot in Were the Worlds where Tom Cruise

1184
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,520
loads up a revolver when they're evacuated.

1185
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,720
So that was and then he pulls it on civilians.

1186
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,400
I think although I think after like a freaked out cop pulls I don't know.

1187
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,400
It's a weird thing that were the world's movies.

1188
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,400
Fucking weird.

1189
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:51,960
I'm just imagining the velociraptor scene with the guy like slowly pulling out his walkie

1190
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:55,740
talkie to talk to him instead of like the gun and then the Raptor pops out of the clever

1191
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:56,740
girl scene.

1192
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:57,740
Right.

1193
01:05:57,740 --> 01:05:58,740
Yeah.

1194
01:05:58,740 --> 01:05:59,740
Replace it on the Blu-ray with a walkie talkie.

1195
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:05,280
I'm going to go in there find the Raptor tell someone on my walkie talkie.

1196
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,280
Clever girl.

1197
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,080
It says it into the walkie talkie.

1198
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,080
Yeah.

1199
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,080
And then that's it.

1200
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:14,320
I would like to also praise this robot this dinosaur robot this T-Rex robot.

1201
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,320
It's awesome.

1202
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,080
It is still awesome.

1203
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:21,760
It's 20 years old but whenever I went on this last probably a year ago or something it's

1204
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:27,040
crazy like it's top we're talking about top animatronics like this this thing scares the

1205
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:31,800
shit if I'm in the front row I am scared like I'm almost as scared as that ball at Indiana

1206
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:35,600
Jones like it's just as invasive as that.

1207
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,200
Yeah absolutely.

1208
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:42,440
Ten thousand pounds is the fact I heard in a making of special.

1209
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,400
You also put on the making of specials.

1210
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,240
There's a couple good ones you can find on YouTube and you get to the fun of watching

1211
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:53,000
the T-Rex get airlifted into the building like dangling off of a helicopter and then

1212
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
installing it.

1213
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Fully scanned.

1214
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Yeah.

1215
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Yeah.

1216
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,520
And then it's just like open air just drops down into the building because I imagine that

1217
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:06,720
thing's probably like it's up in the rafters so they had to lay it's like part of the structure

1218
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,960
like that robot that doesn't work in Expedition Everest.

1219
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:10,960
The Yeti yeah.

1220
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:11,960
Mm hmm.

1221
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:12,960
Mm hmm.

1222
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,520
Yeah the T-Rex well it's also just that and the Indiana Jones ride.

1223
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:21,800
I love this idea of like compounding the biggest fear with the biggest fear is really great

1224
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:27,080
because even if you weren't scared of the rock or the T-Rex the drop would be scary

1225
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:30,360
and you're not scared to drop but you're scared of the T-Rex like it's like it covers all

1226
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,440
your fear bases.

1227
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,120
It's so I love the finish this ride.

1228
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:39,300
Yeah it is sort of stealing that climax Indiana Jones in a little way and it's a combination

1229
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:41,280
of Splash Mountain and Indiana Jones.

1230
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:46,080
It's a very very impressive scary thing coming at you coupled with that drop moment.

1231
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:52,200
And then the drop makes you feel like physically the fear you feel from like makes you feel

1232
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,200
like you're dying.

1233
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:57,520
Isn't that what it's meant to represent?

1234
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:03,360
Some guests in 1996 had a particularly scary drop experience when right at that moment

1235
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:09,600
before the drop and when the T-Rex comes down they were doused in hydraulic fluid like that

1236
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,640
happened really soon after the opening of the ride.

1237
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:17,160
And yeah I don't think anybody like I'm not sure if anyone was permanently hurt but a

1238
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:20,760
lot of people went to the hospital and it was a big mess for like within the first couple

1239
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:23,400
months of the of the ride being open.

1240
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:29,320
I remember hearing the wrong version of that story though where the the spitter the dilapidator

1241
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:34,520
is like a spit hydraulic fluid at the guests and they which is not what happened.

1242
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:40,500
That would have been pretty crazy if what happened to Nedry happened in real life.

1243
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:44,320
But still imagine doing that drop and you're like you're blind and you might think that

1244
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,320
was like part of it.

1245
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:48,040
Like like is this how it's supposed to be?

1246
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:51,040
I'm covered in tar.

1247
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,160
Yeah yeah well they worked out those kinks.

1248
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,160
That doesn't happen anymore.

1249
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:57,520
And all those people will just blame their ex-girlfriends for years for making them go

1250
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,520
on that ride and they're blind and they think about that every time.

1251
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:03,600
I'm tough I can drink hydraulic fluid.

1252
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:11,080
Here on the on the lighter end of odd rumors the this you there's a thing you can watch

1253
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:19,800
on YouTube the the there was a live E special from 1996 of the opening of this ride.

1254
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,400
Did you guys run across this thing?

1255
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,520
Oh yeah I saw a little bit of it.

1256
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,800
E entertainment news covered this thing.

1257
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:32,560
The opening of the ride live you get to watch Spielberg and Jeff Goldblum light the torch

1258
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:38,480
to like start the fire on the Jurassic Park gate and all the biggest stars come out for

1259
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:39,480
the opening.

1260
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:48,160
Why David Hasselhoff and Noah Wiley and Marg Helgenberger Sam Elliott is there wearing a

1261
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:52,880
big black and white shirt with the picture of the Beatles on it.

1262
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,480
And it's tucked into his jeans.

1263
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:56,480
Amazing.

1264
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,960
Oh you gotta have the screen print tuck.

1265
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:02,320
Sam Elliott pioneered it in 1996.

1266
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:08,840
But it's a really fun special to watch and covered in like that bad like that sort of

1267
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:14,400
that bad pseudo techno that he would use a lot of the time that very just like didn't

1268
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:20,040
didn't do it very like RuPaul cover girl music.

1269
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:25,440
The aesthetics were incredible in the 90s but the special is hosted by downtown Julie

1270
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:29,960
Brown and a guy who I didn't recognize named Jerry Penacoli.

1271
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:36,240
And he's just kind of this like you just sort of this this kind of meathead guy in a bowling

1272
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:38,600
shirt and he's like fun and affable.

1273
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:43,100
And I was like there's something odd about this fella and I googled him and unfortunately

1274
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:47,120
one of the first things you find when you Google this guy is that he was one of the

1275
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:54,080
first prominent people to be referenced in relation to juggling.

1276
01:10:54,080 --> 01:11:04,000
What? before Richard Gere was saddled with this odd rumor this man who went on to it

1277
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:09,160
didn't destroy his career he went on to host the Jurassic Park the Ride opening special.

1278
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:14,000
I guess we should for those listeners who don't know what juggling is we may as well

1279
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,120
explain Matt would you like to.

1280
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,320
We're all in our guests do it.

1281
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,320
Let's be polite.

1282
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:20,320
Yeah.

1283
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,000
We're all men of a certain age who have grew up with this rumor.

1284
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Of course.

1285
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,840
It sounds like a callback to when we talked about Byron Allen's the ride for us.

1286
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,880
So now you got us.

1287
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,880
You were going to tell us what juggling was.

1288
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,840
You know I got a dribble home.

1289
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,320
I always buy him these different toys right.

1290
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:38,160
You know I got toys I'm going to buy them you know they love the they love the wheels

1291
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:42,400
they love the little little grass and you know what they love the most they love tubes

1292
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:48,760
and that had me thinking you know I ran out of tube to go to but I'm not going to finish.

1293
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:53,200
You transported us to the Byron Allen show I could see a fish tank behind you.

1294
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,560
That was good.

1295
01:11:55,560 --> 01:12:02,160
Anyway so Jerry Penacoli I don't know if that's an untrue rumor I hope it didn't I hope he

1296
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:09,740
wasn't terribly thrown astray from his journalism goals by whatever bizarre thing right.

1297
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:12,360
Well for the dribble sake I hope those rumors are unfounded.

1298
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,360
That's a tough life.

1299
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:17,360
Yeah that dribble is with us today.

1300
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:21,600
We will eventually do a thing one on a whole episode on these opening ceremonies because

1301
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:27,760
they are just the clunkiest weirdest things full of celebrities and stiff jokes that don't

1302
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:33,720
land confusing realities pyro that doesn't really pop in the light of the day.

1303
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:39,280
The Guardian's one where it's like Vinicius del Toro clearly hit had some shots of that

1304
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:44,600
tequila he flucks before taking the stage.

1305
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:45,960
What else in Jurassic Park world.

1306
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:51,280
We haven't talked about Florida where which is this expanded Jurassic Park land but those

1307
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:54,880
other rides are sort of not anything to write home about.

1308
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,160
There's yeah there's that one where it's I've never been on it because I'm kind of scared

1309
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:00,960
of my legs dangling on a ride I think I mentioned this before.

1310
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,360
It's that like pterodactyl what do you call it coaster even but it's very slow.

1311
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,680
I think it's the pterodon flyers.

1312
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:09,360
Okay that works pterodon flyers.

1313
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,360
I always wanted to go on that.

1314
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,200
That sounds like a local hockey team.

1315
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,160
Yeah that's a good point.

1316
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:19,280
I always want to go on that when I was younger but it doesn't have a big capacity.

1317
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:24,240
When the park first opened it had like an hour two hour wait to do this kiddie like

1318
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:29,400
dangling ride and then as the years went on and got less popular they were just like you

1319
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:32,680
can only this is one of the few rides where they go like you can only ride this if you're

1320
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:36,120
a kid because I think it's got some height restrictions.

1321
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:39,160
Oh I think you can't be too tall for it.

1322
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:43,080
See I'm done with dangle rides after I had a Tatsu incident at Six Flags.

1323
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:44,080
Really?

1324
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,080
Yeah.

1325
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,960
Well do you guys know of Tatsu?

1326
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:47,960
I've ridden Tatsu.

1327
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:52,200
It's a fun coaster but it's basically you get strapped in and then the whole gimmick goes

1328
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:56,360
up so you're flying like Superman your belly's towards the ground and then you just like and

1329
01:13:56,360 --> 01:14:00,880
then you fly around and it's really fun but and we always loved it and then one time I

1330
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:05,240
went up and I go and everybody's like all right snap in so I snap it down and it just

1331
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:10,080
like bangs off the clip doesn't clip it just bounces bounces and they're like all right

1332
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,080
here we go.

1333
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:16,200
And I go hey hey I stopped everybody and he goes like oh okay he walks over he hits the

1334
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:19,840
top twice and then it snaps in and he goes all right let's go and I was like that didn't

1335
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:25,040
like make me feel good and this is like the number one ride if you imagine like if it

1336
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,880
broke apart you would like there's one like.

1337
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,480
Face down you're going face down.

1338
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:31,720
You're going face down and there's like there's like a loop where you get like where you're

1339
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:37,680
like get slung to the outside so you could literally fly 400 feet from the thing.

1340
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:42,560
Just fall into a Santa Clarita housing development straight through a chimney right into a forest

1341
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:45,560
fire.

1342
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:50,160
And yes so I can't do tattoo anymore now because like I was like clinging like death grip on

1343
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:52,360
the thing like imagining it was going to open.

1344
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:55,680
Did you feel like it could have if you hadn't been doing that I mean I would be doing the

1345
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:59,640
same thing I mean he gave the the here we go without me even on the thing.

1346
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:03,440
But the worst that would have happened I would have like the because we've done that I would

1347
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:07,000
just fell on my face in the station which would have been that would have been pretty

1348
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,560
funny for your legs are locked in to you could have gotten dragged by the legs.

1349
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:16,520
I feel like that is why because of like shoulder harness failure like that a lot of them have

1350
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:21,400
a simple like seat belt sort of thing where like if the if the latch goes up at least

1351
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,200
the seat belt like catches it.

1352
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,200
Yeah there was like no catch.

1353
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,200
Oh yeah.

1354
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,880
Yeah but it is a fun ride.

1355
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,080
It's a very unique it's a very unique experience.

1356
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:34,960
I've never been on another coaster like or ride like that where you do you are feeling

1357
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:35,960
that sensation.

1358
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:40,160
Yeah the one the one moment in that where you go what would be like an upside down loop

1359
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:44,320
to loop but you're but you're facing forward so like when you get to the bottom of it you're

1360
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:47,960
like flying on your like your the G force are going down on your back.

1361
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,280
It's really it's a fun coaster but I can't do it anymore.

1362
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,760
I'll still do X2.

1363
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:53,760
Right.

1364
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:57,680
I'm really glad you didn't get flung out of the ride and you're here to here to tell the

1365
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:58,680
tale.

1366
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:04,600
Yeah I used to work with a guy who worked at like when he was a teenager worked at Magic

1367
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:11,400
Mountain and like very very casually told us a story to me that was insane which was

1368
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:17,040
like you know it's like oh yeah we were like 15 16 and some of us used to operate Colossus

1369
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,680
which is like a giant wooden coaster.

1370
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:26,520
I believe now it's a giant wooden steel combo coaster and he's like yeah we'd show off for

1371
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:30,700
the girls like yeah we'd see what we could get away with so we'd ride Colossus without

1372
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:36,080
the lap bars down and see who could hold on and I'd be like that's fucking crazy.

1373
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:39,080
Like it's like you you are out of your mind.

1374
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:44,080
That's one of those moments where he's like yeah we used to do this like that feels like

1375
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:48,320
you know in old movies where they're like and now we're we're gonna go up and race it's

1376
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:51,080
suicide curve.

1377
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:54,920
That's our theme park version of suicide Cove is now putting your belt on.

1378
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:58,680
There's videos of like Tower of Terror with people not with the belt on.

1379
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:02,260
And they're just kind of like like they're going off the seat like there's a little error.

1380
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:04,200
They're hitting air on the not hitting the ceiling.

1381
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:05,200
It's no no it's not.

1382
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,520
It wouldn't be that bad if they if you have your.

1383
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:11,480
Well that's the original commercials for Tower of Terror are people standing in an elevator

1384
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,760
and they're standing and it drops.

1385
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:17,520
And I was like God I guess you could die if you go on this ride.

1386
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:21,440
Like we talked about this before like we were so committed.

1387
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,880
We love these so much as kids.

1388
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:27,960
We bought the realities where it's like okay there is a chance we could die but it's really

1389
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,440
fun.

1390
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:30,440
I wasn't scared.

1391
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:31,440
I'd do any of this.

1392
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:32,440
I'd do any of them.

1393
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:33,440
Easy Scott.

1394
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:34,720
Easy cool guy Scott.

1395
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:35,960
I never buckle up.

1396
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:36,960
One of the.

1397
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:40,520
Save it for your platoon of ex-girlfriends.

1398
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:43,760
One of the other things they've been doing around the ride at Universal Hollywood at

1399
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:47,240
least probably in Florida too is that they have this crazy Raptor.

1400
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:48,240
Now have you seen this?

1401
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,240
They have like a little Raptor.

1402
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,280
I haven't actually.

1403
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:53,940
And it's kind of I think there's a there's a person in the suit but it's crazy looking.

1404
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:58,600
Like it really if you like squinted you'd be like there's a fucking Raptor and like

1405
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:03,040
everyone takes photos with them and they have a handler much like Chris Pratt.

1406
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,720
I'm trying to think of his character's name though.

1407
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,120
Chris Pratt in Jurassic World.

1408
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,120
Someone help me out here.

1409
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,120
He's always named.

1410
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:10,120
He's one of those like.

1411
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:11,120
Sergeant Jack Arms.

1412
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,120
It's Owen.

1413
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,120
His name is Owen.

1414
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,120
I know his first name but I don't know his name.

1415
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,120
Owen Declan or something.

1416
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,120
Owen.

1417
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,120
Owen Sully.

1418
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:21,240
Jack Coolman.

1419
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:26,000
But there's a trainer who does the like the hand and whatever and like trains a Raptor.

1420
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
But it's very good.

1421
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
It's very effective.

1422
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,880
If I was a little kid it would have scared the shit out of me.

1423
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:32,840
We're in the golden age of dinosaur puppets right now.

1424
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:38,280
It's amazing what they do and like that I would love some version of that in the Hollywood

1425
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:41,000
whatever the park or part of the ride or I don't know.

1426
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,520
The Raptor is in Hollywood.

1427
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,520
This one is in Hollywood.

1428
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,520
They have it in Hollywood now.

1429
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,520
Yeah.

1430
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,520
Yeah.

1431
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,520
Yeah.

1432
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,520
Oh I haven't been in a little bit.

1433
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:49,520
So yeah.

1434
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,320
There's a prime and Megatron.

1435
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:53,640
There's a Raptor over on the lower lot.

1436
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:54,640
Those are great suits too.

1437
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,000
Those are very good suits.

1438
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,120
Universal killing the suit game.

1439
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:00,080
I want to see some minions walking around.

1440
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,080
Minions sized.

1441
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:02,080
Oh minions sized.

1442
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,400
No yeah I want them correct.

1443
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,040
I want them like actually two feet tall.

1444
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,520
You want them grown in a lab.

1445
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,840
You want freaks of nature wandering the park.

1446
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,200
Yeah I want them to be alive.

1447
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,760
I don't want them to be a puppet or a robot or a trick.

1448
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,480
I want little minions running around my legs.

1449
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:20,800
How about two like you get a bunch of dogs on their hind legs and you put the suits on

1450
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:21,800
them that way.

1451
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,240
That's their only choice to walk.

1452
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:27,000
They have to find their own equilibrium on their hind legs.

1453
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,880
I can't believe you would not be impressed if there was minion sized robots in the park.

1454
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,480
You just said you'd be scoffing robots.

1455
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:37,720
I'd be impressed but I but wouldn't it be better to know that they're alive and have

1456
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:44,960
to be fed bananas by the pound and that they could like they could get sick.

1457
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,600
They could experience emotions they can love.

1458
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:51,240
I want universal to breed minions.

1459
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:54,680
We're talking about Jurassic Park and genetics.

1460
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:56,520
Let's make it happen.

1461
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:57,840
Play God universal.

1462
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:02,480
It's time the theme park games getting competitive and the only way for you to win is for you

1463
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,360
to breed real minions.

1464
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:09,360
I mean we're all speechless after that.

1465
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,080
We don't have we all agree with it.

1466
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:13,500
We all had our hands on our hearts while Scott was making it.

1467
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:20,840
I stood up on the chair and with my by fist facing God as I made this I felt like Dr.

1468
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:21,840
Frankenstein.

1469
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:29,920
I'm a minion I say he inspired by John Hammond's example universal and just remember though

1470
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:37,160
that life will find a way and the millions will either kill us or start you know having

1471
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:38,160
more minions.

1472
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:42,480
We'll have to just like this movie quarantine Universal Studios Hollywood because it has

1473
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:47,560
been overrun by minions and hope that nobody goes inside and finds the kingdom of the minions

1474
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,840
of concession works go back and like where are all the goddamn bananas.

1475
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:55,480
I don't know then they get attacked by minions.

1476
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,120
There could be a crossover movie.

1477
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:01,200
Yeah a terrifying minion attack film in real life.

1478
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,200
Yeah.

1479
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,200
Yeah.

1480
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,200
Hmm.

1481
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,200
I'd watch that.

1482
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,200
This is a universe.

1483
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,440
This is a multiverse that I can get behind.

1484
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:11,880
They'd probably just tack it onto the dark universe at this point.

1485
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:18,280
They'll still do the dark universe but it's Phantom of the Opera the mummy and minions

1486
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:19,280
who are now scared.

1487
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:24,440
They aren't scary and despicable me but in these they're like they're crazy rabid creatures.

1488
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:25,440
Yes.

1489
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:26,440
Why not.

1490
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:31,000
If we wait 10 years we could live long enough to see Disney Universal which will eventually

1491
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:37,840
become a super conglomerate merge and then see porgs versus minions no matter who wins

1492
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:42,000
we lose aliens versus predator rules you know.

1493
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,480
Oh they they like fight each other and like bite at each other with rabid fangs and then

1494
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:51,440
maybe do they all like sort of get up on top of each other and form mega creatures like

1495
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,120
form Ultron of.

1496
01:21:54,120 --> 01:22:00,040
Absolutely and there's some forgettable human characters called like Riley and Ace and they're

1497
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:08,080
like X S.A.S. whatever your whatever you're just tossed on X S.A.S. X.C.I.A. to just give

1498
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,720
a character a shotgun like whatever you have to do.

1499
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:14,160
I was going to say give him guns blasts important way away.

1500
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,160
I want it.

1501
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:19,560
I was a kid space guns but like big heavy artillery machine guns and they're just like

1502
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,360
porgs minions.

1503
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:25,120
They're all dead meat to me.

1504
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:33,840
They've taken a bite out of a minion rib eaten off a porg beak beak.

1505
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:34,840
Is that what they have.

1506
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:35,840
Yeah they have beaks.

1507
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:36,840
OK.

1508
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:37,840
Yeah.

1509
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:38,840
And then just grew crying.

1510
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:42,240
I'm sure they're the group single group is old group looks like Howard Hughes.

1511
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,240
He's got long hair.

1512
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:44,240
He's on.

1513
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:46,720
He's on October 2 with Luke Skywalker.

1514
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:47,720
Yeah.

1515
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:51,880
Through and Luke just crying on October 2.

1516
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,360
What they have wrought on this.

1517
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:54,360
Yeah.

1518
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:57,280
Well we probably should just leave all this out because these are very good ideas that

1519
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,280
we don't want other people to.

1520
01:22:58,280 --> 01:22:59,280
Yeah.

1521
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,280
Let's let's send them to ourselves.

1522
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:01,280
Yeah.

1523
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:02,600
Put it in a self-addressed sealed out.

1524
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:06,320
Well this podcast in the mail with our names on it.

1525
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,720
We should probably start wrapping it up here.

1526
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,720
Let's talk changes.

1527
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:10,920
Let's talk keep it as is.

1528
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:15,000
Plus it up or burn it to the ground for insurance money.

1529
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Any thoughts anybody.

1530
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,480
I'm just going to start to say this one.

1531
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,960
I want to keep it as is.

1532
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:22,960
Keep everything working like it is.

1533
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,600
I like that there's a velociraptors in the park and that's maybe the only plus one.

1534
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:31,640
But here's my worry is that with Jurassic World they're going to add like a Jack Sparrow

1535
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:34,520
like Chris Pratt character animatronic in the thing.

1536
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:37,480
I don't want any of that because I what this is doing right now.

1537
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:39,680
It makes me feel like I'm living in Jurassic Park.

1538
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:44,320
I get to actually me as the guy goes to Hollywood and goes to the park and gets to experience

1539
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,320
it.

1540
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,320
Watch it go wrong.

1541
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:50,520
Right now it's in my mind it's like the perfect version of Ride the movie.

1542
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:52,120
So I say leave it as is.

1543
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:53,120
Okay.

1544
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,120
Amen.

1545
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:56,640
I think I have just one change.

1546
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:00,080
I think it can stay as is all the way up until the end.

1547
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:07,400
But then right before the drop occurs lovable Jurassic Park side character Mr. DNA appears

1548
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:13,480
and sort of sort of a hologram visage and says did you know that Steven Spielberg director

1549
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:18,000
of Jurassic Park requested to get off at this very point.

1550
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,880
And there's nothing wrong with that.

1551
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:24,080
There's no cowardice to be found in that Spielberg is no coward.

1552
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:29,200
He bravely portrayed the realities of the Holocaust in his film Schindler's List.

1553
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,960
You'd never call him a coward.

1554
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:35,080
I say if you get off here there's nothing wrong with that Scott.

1555
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,080
And then a little red carpet.

1556
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,560
He says Scott every time.

1557
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:41,840
Or do you give him a thing like the E.T. ride that says your name.

1558
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,080
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

1559
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,440
There's nothing wrong with that.

1560
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:45,440
Scort.

1561
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,440
Merde.

1562
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:51,080
And if your girlfriend doesn't think you're tough why you should find someone that likes

1563
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:57,560
you for you and not for your death defying somebody who likes you for your intellect

1564
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:00,400
not your brawn or lack thereof.

1565
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,320
You're fine the way you are.

1566
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,280
Now get off this ride.

1567
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:07,200
Leave these people to go down their death trap.

1568
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:12,660
In fact hydraulic fluid spilled at this very point in 1996.

1569
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:15,360
You have made the attraction three times as long.

1570
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:20,400
It's going to be a big backup but I think the audience is really going to appreciate

1571
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,520
the attention to this point.

1572
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:28,080
It's going to make a lot of kids feel better about themselves especially ones named Scott.

1573
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,560
So let's add just that everything else could stay as is.

1574
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:33,640
I'll see Mr. DNA in there in the future.

1575
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:36,960
I'll say yeah keep it as is.

1576
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:40,980
Keep those dinosaurs running you know they try to minimize the number of tarps keep that

1577
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:43,440
Jeep falling down running.

1578
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:44,440
And I say more tarps.

1579
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:45,440
What do you mean.

1580
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,440
He's got the tarps.

1581
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:47,440
All right.

1582
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:48,440
Great and discreet.

1583
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:55,400
And here a note specifically for the Hollywood location put some more foliage on that parking

1584
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,400
garage.

1585
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:01,560
There's long stretches of that Hollywood one where you can see I guess it's the employee

1586
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:02,560
parking garage.

1587
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,560
Frankenstein parking garage.

1588
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:06,560
Yeah all right.

1589
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:10,400
Yeah just get some more plants and get some more stuff in there.

1590
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:15,960
You know urban design is gravitating towards more built in greenery and foliage anyway.

1591
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:23,240
So yeah go wild with it to add some add some more universal is green or whatever that corporate

1592
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:28,440
initiative that I get a lot of mailings about because I live close to it.

1593
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:29,800
You're a universal good neighbor.

1594
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,480
I am a universal good neighbor.

1595
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:33,320
Get a free parking pass.

1596
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:35,280
So California constantly fighting drought.

1597
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:40,360
You want us to spend the money on all this water on the succulent and other cacti.

1598
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:44,200
Cacti or water efficient rock gardens.

1599
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:46,680
Put a bunch of stones along that parking garage.

1600
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:53,200
Put some rock gardens and children can throw the pebbles at riders.

1601
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:57,040
Anyway keep it keep it the same but with some minor keep up that upkeep folks.

1602
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,040
OK.

1603
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,040
All right.

1604
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,040
Here's mine.

1605
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,040
I want to plus up half of it.

1606
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,040
The first part I think is great.

1607
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,360
I think you get the splendor of Jurassic Park.

1608
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:08,400
You get to see the dinosaurs and you get that feeling that you see in the you feel in the

1609
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:12,400
first movie when they first go onto that giant field.

1610
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:15,720
The second half I think is missing a human element.

1611
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:18,720
I understand they're teasing the fact that tourists have been eaten and you don't want

1612
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:22,200
to see maybe a dead child hanging out in a bar.

1613
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,360
I get that.

1614
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,120
But I want workers.

1615
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:29,720
I want worker robots like if this were real disaster there would be people like rushing

1616
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:32,600
in to be like hey try to get out of here or don't do this.

1617
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:37,280
So I feel like when you're going up that hill let's get some robots and let's get them eaten

1618
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,240
by dinosaurs in front of us.

1619
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:43,520
I want to see a man get pulled up into the rafters.

1620
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:46,320
He'd be like hey everything's going to be all right kids.

1621
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:47,320
Don't worry about this.

1622
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:51,600
Ah like a robot dinosaur takes him up into the rafters.

1623
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,200
Like that stuff I think that's the only thing missing from the ride.

1624
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:58,160
This is a very by the way this is totally sincere on my part.

1625
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:00,560
I want to see like I want to see.

1626
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:05,760
If they added that that'd be I think it would be a great little addition and make the and

1627
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,720
make the thing even scarier because you're missing any other human beings.

1628
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:12,720
I understand they're trying to like they can't do something grisly but like you know what

1629
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:13,720
I'm going to tell you.

1630
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:18,000
There was a that was in the plans apparently.

1631
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,400
I was looking it up and there was a part where a real human actor came out and we would have

1632
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:28,120
had to do this all day and then like a like a raptor puppet or something probably something

1633
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:31,120
like that's in there now today was going to like yank him backwards.

1634
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:32,120
Wow.

1635
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:37,000
They tried to play it really real almost as if this is a Universal Studios employees saying

1636
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
something is wrong.

1637
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
We got to get you out of here.

1638
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Oh like what a good idea.

1639
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,240
They do at the mummy in Florida.

1640
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:43,040
They try it where it's a fake loading.

1641
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:46,440
I think that was the precedent for what they ended up doing there.

1642
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:49,240
So it's also and it just didn't didn't commit to it.

1643
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:50,240
Makes sense.

1644
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:55,800
Longtime rumors that there would be like a Jeep a Jeep attraction next to this in Florida

1645
01:28:55,800 --> 01:29:00,020
that they had the room they were going to build a Jeep attraction which Matt you mentioned

1646
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:03,680
earlier is like yeah that seems like something they would do and then I think they eventually

1647
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:09,360
use the space for Kong's Ray Kong Skull Island whatever it's one quick thing we're talking

1648
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:13,720
about in terms of kicking up the second half there is the one thing that the one weak part

1649
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:18,080
of the ride is the rapid opens down and the little rapper that just like slides out.

1650
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,080
It's very comical.

1651
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:23,000
I heard somebody told me today was talking about coming on here that that during Halloween

1652
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,880
Horror Nights it's a very fun ride because it's not meant for night riding so it's very

1653
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:27,880
dark.

1654
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:29,640
Yeah they turn off a lot of the interior lights.

1655
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:35,840
And also when the Raptors come out they play Welcome to the Jungle.

1656
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:42,000
So I despise the idea of Halloween Horror Nights but now I want to go just for that.

1657
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,960
I think that yeah that goes when they would play the Redhead Chili Peppers on Space Mountain

1658
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:52,400
I think once in a while playing a dumb inappropriate song on a ride is fun and a bizarre experience.

1659
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:54,000
So I am all for that.

1660
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,160
Yeah clashy but but interesting but fun.

1661
01:29:57,160 --> 01:30:00,920
All right so we're I mean we're mainly this little fun pluses but otherwise this is a

1662
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:04,360
fantastic ride and Matt you are a fantastic guest.

1663
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:05,560
Thank you so much.

1664
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:07,760
You survived podcast the ride.

1665
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:11,160
Oh my phone is ruined.

1666
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:13,160
But it was worth it.

1667
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:17,300
Matt anything you'd like to plug or alert the audience to where they can they find you

1668
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:21,120
and your future works and endeavors.

1669
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:25,880
I'm doing all my stuff but I'll use this time say like if you think people in your government

1670
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:28,640
are jerks just call your reps they have phone numbers you can call them just call them and

1671
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:30,680
be you could be jerks to them you can ask them questions.

1672
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,480
That's your right as a citizen.

1673
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:36,880
Think Park fans traditionally are pretty right wing though so you're not going to find a

1674
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:37,880
plug in.

1675
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:38,880
I wouldn't go that far.

1676
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,800
I don't care what your politics are it does not matter to me as long as you're calling

1677
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:44,560
and telling people like they need to know that they're being watched.

1678
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,760
Yeah that's that that tax plan is going to screw everyone.

1679
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:51,640
Here's what I'll say bring back the guillotine.

1680
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:57,000
I have calculated how much money we all get if we if the top thousand rich people died

1681
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
in this country we all get about 80 thousand dollars so it's not bad.

1682
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,360
Hey how about that.

1683
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:07,960
So if if John Hammond had been killed by a pack of the little pygmies yeah that would

1684
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:09,560
have freed up a lot of dough for all of us.

1685
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:13,160
Yeah John Hammond would have been one of the ones up against the wall up against the wall

1686
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:14,920
when the revolution comes.

1687
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:15,920
Down with Kamen.

1688
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:21,200
Can you believe Trump appointed an Ingen representative to regulate Ingen.

1689
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:26,200
The dinosaur containment bureau.

1690
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:35,360
Trump, Ike, Marvel CEO Ike Perlmutter and John Hammond Ingen CEO on the board.

1691
