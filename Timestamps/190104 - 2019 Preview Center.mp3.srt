1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:02,740
Forever.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,300
Dog.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:10,800
Warning, the following podcast contains rampant baseless speculation, non-specific wildwood

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,200
critters, and you asked for it, your official guide to Hershey Park's new gate.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,720
Not a new theme park, just the actual gate you walk through to get to their existing theme

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,040
park.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,100
All this and more on our thrilling look at 2019.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,420
Come on in to the 2019 Preview Center on Podcast The Ride.

9
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:55,632
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the show hosted by three men whose new year's resolution is to go to Disneyland more.

10
00:00:56,112 --> 00:00:59,952
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Scott Gardner.

11
00:01:00,392 --> 00:01:02,872
I'm mildly accurate.

12
00:01:04,172 --> 00:01:04,832
And Mike Carlson.

13
00:01:05,012 --> 00:01:10,912
I would say mine would be to go to Disneyland more, but in like new interesting ways, you know?

14
00:01:10,992 --> 00:01:13,052
Oh, I think that's a great, great point.

15
00:01:13,492 --> 00:01:16,872
That's what we're, kind of what we're talking about today.

16
00:01:18,052 --> 00:01:21,452
New interesting ways to go, but do you mean like go by hitchhiking?

17
00:01:21,852 --> 00:01:23,732
Do you mean getting down there in interesting ways?

18
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:28,932
Closer to what I'm talking about. Yes, if there's a different way to get down there, maybe there's like a

19
00:01:28,932 --> 00:01:31,792
not ride sharing, that sounds a little bit unpleasant, but

20
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:37,752
maybe I should take the train down and see what that's like. Go from Glendale to Anaheim, see what that's like.

21
00:01:38,392 --> 00:01:39,212
Or you can do Burbank.

22
00:01:39,372 --> 00:01:43,312
Burbank by the airport? Yeah, I mean, I'd love to take the train down more.

23
00:01:43,432 --> 00:01:48,852
Maybe, you know, like let's go with strangers that I've never met before and I'd show them around.

24
00:01:48,852 --> 00:01:49,992
You know what I mean?

25
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:52,852
I'm just spitballing. I'm not saying I'm gonna do that.

26
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:58,732
I'm just saying like see the world through a stranger's eyes. See the Disney world land through stranger's eyes.

27
00:01:59,012 --> 00:02:03,032
I wish, I mean, I feel like this is a case for a lot of Los Angeles and Southern California.

28
00:02:03,112 --> 00:02:07,092
I wish trains ran later and I, because then I'd be more,

29
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:11,612
like if they had ones that ran for like two, three hours after Disneyland

30
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:16,712
closed. Right. That's a tricky thing. It limits you on the other end. It really does. Yeah.

31
00:02:17,032 --> 00:02:22,292
There is, I would, how much, I was thinking about this. How much would you pay for a, an annual pass

32
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:29,732
to a bus, an easily located bus to take you down to Disney and it would run pretty regularly and it could drop you back

33
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:30,912
off up here

34
00:02:30,912 --> 00:02:35,712
at midnight or 1 a.m. It would need to have no stops. It's got to be a bullet train.

35
00:02:35,952 --> 00:02:38,252
I think if I'm making stops the whole way,

36
00:02:38,372 --> 00:02:41,912
Okay, how about this? There's a Valley stop and then there's a more of an

37
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:48,172
Hollywood stop. There's two stops and then it's straight to Anaheim. I suppose so. How much do you, how much is that worth?

38
00:02:48,392 --> 00:02:51,712
I'm just trying to figure out the- I feel like you need a downtown stop to make it

39
00:02:51,712 --> 00:02:57,932
viable too. I think there is some sort of bus that comes from a little further inland

40
00:02:57,932 --> 00:03:02,732
to Disneyland and like a commuter bus for employees,

41
00:03:03,252 --> 00:03:06,272
but anyone can do it. But I think it got too popular. Well, if we get a job,

42
00:03:06,272 --> 00:03:12,612
then we can use the bus and that'll fulfill the resolution to go more often because we'll be there every day because we have to.

43
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:15,452
Well, we have to be, we're going to become scare actors.

44
00:03:15,512 --> 00:03:18,512
I guess we're going to become churro cart attendants now.

45
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:23,092
And it'll fulfill my thing because now I'll be able to see Disneyland in a different way because I'm working there.

46
00:03:23,212 --> 00:03:27,532
Yeah, so now that's a new way to experience the park. So you'll be able to see it from

47
00:03:27,532 --> 00:03:34,412
behind eyes that are crying because you're depressed to be having a Disney lunch. Possibly depending on what my job is.

48
00:03:35,112 --> 00:03:41,472
But you know in the new year the money changes for what you make at Disneyland, right? That's good.

49
00:03:41,592 --> 00:03:46,752
Yeah, that's good. But we've uncovered some nefarious stuff about that in our political episode.

50
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:52,412
Wait a minute, we shouldn't get all down. Look, hey, welcome to 2019 everybody. Happy new year listeners.

51
00:03:52,652 --> 00:03:56,572
Happy new year. Hope it was as exciting as every night at Pleasure Island.

52
00:03:57,672 --> 00:03:59,152
Uh, though how could it be really?

53
00:04:00,012 --> 00:04:04,692
But uh, yeah, it's we're we're here's the first new episode of 2019.

54
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:12,592
We took a little break and we're sorry, but we're back now and we're here to talk about all of the exciting new developments.

55
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:18,572
What will be happening in theme park world in 2019? 2019 is an exciting year.

56
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:23,512
Though, uh, you know, there's exciting ones to come as well.

57
00:04:23,612 --> 00:04:28,252
I mean to shoot right past it, but 2020 also has a ton of crazy stuff.

58
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:31,572
I think that's guardians and in florida and uh,

59
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:37,352
2021 is disney world's 50th anniversary. We're a couple years away from not berry farms.

60
00:04:37,512 --> 00:04:42,172
100th anniversary, which they because they're counting all the way back to

61
00:04:42,172 --> 00:04:44,412
roadside chicken stand.

62
00:04:44,632 --> 00:04:47,972
Which you insist on counting back to.

63
00:04:48,252 --> 00:04:55,392
Yeah, well I insisted on counting all the way back to the first berry seedlings planted and they said please shut up.

64
00:04:55,852 --> 00:04:56,972
Yeah, they said no. That's fair.

65
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:03,912
So there's you know, there's there's a lot there's a lot of excitement in theme park world in the future in general.

66
00:05:04,232 --> 00:05:07,152
But yeah, we got we do got a big year coming up.

67
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:12,612
You know, especially with especially in terms of disney. I think they have like

68
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:20,512
Muscled their way through to make sure that they have the biggest year, but uh, the other parks are not sitting on their hands. Neither.

69
00:05:21,092 --> 00:05:28,152
That's true. Yeah, um, there's a lot I guess. Yeah, uh, there's a lot the right like just let's talk rides real quick rides opening

70
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:32,052
Mickey and Minnie's runaway railway Hollywood studios in Florida.

71
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:36,632
People have been talking about this on the message boards for a long time people saying this ride is awesome.

72
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:41,212
I don't know, but everyone says like the word on this is that it's like very impressive.

73
00:05:41,712 --> 00:05:45,152
It's uh, if you haven't heard it's like replacing the great movie ride.

74
00:05:45,572 --> 00:05:47,332
It is like you're on a little

75
00:05:47,332 --> 00:05:49,392
I think is it wi-fi controlled?

76
00:05:49,912 --> 00:05:56,012
A little like train, but everything is screens, but it's like you're in the cartoon. It's not just like a yeah

77
00:05:56,012 --> 00:06:02,092
Sort of there's moving practical they've shown demonstrations of it of like this these these

78
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:08,172
Practical things that switch that are being projected on or like all of a sudden you're in like a black and white cartoon

79
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:10,172
But then everything flips around and it's full call

80
00:06:10,172 --> 00:06:15,112
The whole room is full color and you're in a giant crazy colorful cartoon. Oh, this is news to me

81
00:06:15,112 --> 00:06:18,092
I don't know a lot of details about this in general. That sounds great

82
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:18,552
Yeah

83
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:25,152
They've sold some of the store like Mickey and Minnie are going on a little picnic and then they see a train and goofy is the conductor

84
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:32,292
And then you go into the like you are watching it and then you go into the screen and you're in the cartoon like

85
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:35,812
Everything that i've heard about it. It sounds does sound legit. Very cool

86
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:40,992
And this is what this is the summer opening. Is that I think I believe may

87
00:06:40,992 --> 00:06:46,772
Maybe may it's always hard to tell with these things if you aren't checking the rumors sites like us

88
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:52,512
Nothing changes more than theme park opening dates. It's not like the movies where they declare

89
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:56,032
We're july 4th 2021 way in advance

90
00:06:56,032 --> 00:07:01,212
Uh, these things are real muddy and they'll also like start kind of previewing

91
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:06,432
Quote unquote a couple months out. So it like and then but then there isn't an actual like ceremony

92
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:11,792
It is officially open even if it's been technically running for a little while. Yeah soft openings

93
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:17,292
Yeah, mike and I hit the soft openings for the wizarding world of harry potter in hollywood like two years ago

94
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:20,052
just from following like twitter and blogs going like

95
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:22,332
Uh, everything's open

96
00:07:22,832 --> 00:07:25,752
Yeah, right. We were I remember we were together but no way

97
00:07:25,752 --> 00:07:29,712
texting back and forth because my my memory of it I was uh,

98
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:34,272
I was doing when it back when I was running with my friend and our friend andrew grissom

99
00:07:34,272 --> 00:07:38,392
Uh, I was monitoring a twitter account that was like it might open today

100
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:41,332
And then I was like, I think it's gonna open i'm gonna go up there and he was like

101
00:07:41,332 --> 00:07:45,432
I got like things to do it's the middle of the afternoon and I was like i'm gonna go up there and they put us in a

102
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:49,512
Holding like pen and like an area for people to wait

103
00:07:49,712 --> 00:07:53,352
And then it was like is it gonna open is it gonna open and then like I waited like an hour and a half

104
00:07:53,352 --> 00:08:00,592
And it did and I was like one of the first 30 people in the first soft opening of of the hollywood harry potter land

105
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:06,452
Because by the end of the day there was a video posted by somebody else who was in there like a theme park

106
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,752
vlogger person and I

107
00:08:08,752 --> 00:08:13,632
I watched it and there I could see you in the line. Is that true? Yes. Yeah

108
00:08:13,632 --> 00:08:16,872
I feel like I don't didn't know that yeah

109
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:22,972
Someone else who was there with who was checking it to such an extent that they were there immediately then had the video up

110
00:08:22,972 --> 00:08:27,692
Several hours later and you were in the line in the video. I mean I went the next day

111
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:32,552
Because I think it was inside universe. I like tweeted at them because they were posting pictures

112
00:08:32,552 --> 00:08:38,292
Is it open there like it is right now and I got over there and just walked right in you're right

113
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:39,372
No

114
00:08:39,372 --> 00:08:43,672
I'm having indigestion for this weird coffee energy shot. I just

115
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:45,312
Know

116
00:08:45,312 --> 00:08:50,212
No, it's fine. You know, it's fine equals don't ask me about this anymore

117
00:08:50,212 --> 00:08:54,272
Mission not accomplished. Jason always what? No, it's fine. Yes

118
00:08:54,272 --> 00:09:02,292
No, it was it tasted pretty good. Where did you get it again? It was like a free coupon at ralph's

119
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:07,412
But and it was like all the reggae was like organic coffee organic milk organic sugar and like it tastes okay

120
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:10,792
It was just a little sweet. So the coffee was completely free. It was a completely free

121
00:09:11,232 --> 00:09:17,952
Completely free because I don't wouldn't buy these energy shot things normally but and it claims it's too worth like two cups of coffee

122
00:09:17,952 --> 00:09:23,652
Essentially. Yeah, but it's all hitting you right now. No, I think I was just kind of burping

123
00:09:23,652 --> 00:09:30,452
Uh as I was trying to talk you're clutching your side. My hand is cold. Okay, and this

124
00:09:30,452 --> 00:09:38,252
This throwbacky kind of chunky sweatshirt that you could find on everla.com is keeping it warm voluntary plug

125
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:42,812
You're also like twiddling a pen in your hand like your groucho

126
00:09:42,812 --> 00:09:44,032
Yeah, you know what?

127
00:09:44,032 --> 00:09:50,932
Uh, that might be the coffee kicking in because I don't normally jiggle a pen as I record and I realize i've been doing this

128
00:09:50,932 --> 00:09:55,092
For about 10 minutes. You're gonna shatter that thing open. You're gonna have

129
00:09:55,092 --> 00:10:01,192
So excited for coming attractions. It's 28 2019. Do you have your fidget spinner?

130
00:10:01,752 --> 00:10:07,012
I don't have my disney my official disney branded fidget spinner on me. It's too bad

131
00:10:07,012 --> 00:10:12,312
Anyway, well, yeah, there's a lot to be excited about but you know

132
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,412
I say let's let's cut to the chase

133
00:10:14,412 --> 00:10:18,772
Let's talk about the headline the big thing that has been under construction

134
00:10:18,772 --> 00:10:25,892
For a very long time dragging out and out and of course I am talking about an exotic outpost

135
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:32,772
From which endless adventures are possible. You know what? I mean margaritaville resort orlando

136
00:10:33,112 --> 00:10:36,592
It is finally opening in january

137
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:40,312
No bigger theme park development right than this

138
00:10:40,312 --> 00:10:46,232
We have a listen we have many listeners who have sent us pictures that live down in orlando and somebody just did

139
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:47,672
Somebody just drove by

140
00:10:47,672 --> 00:10:53,852
And and put it on our facebook page and it's just like water slides that you can see from a freeway

141
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:58,832
Basically, yes, and from the water slide you can see a gas station

142
00:10:58,832 --> 00:10:59,732
Mm-hmm

143
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:06,112
And so anticipation is what i'm saying is anticipation anticipation is building. Yep, you can feel it

144
00:11:06,112 --> 00:11:12,292
Uh, yeah, it's getting out there the the the trailers are leaking on youtube and by trailers

145
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:16,092
I mean 45 seconds of drone footage taken illegally

146
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:22,932
Everybody's talking about it. Um, you know, I actually did I was looking into some stuff about

147
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:27,512
Margaritaville orlando in advance of the inevitability that we're all there

148
00:11:28,712 --> 00:11:29,232
Together

149
00:11:29,232 --> 00:11:36,852
Uh, we we gotta start getting the lay of the land now because if we if we get lost like the shaker of soul

150
00:11:36,852 --> 00:11:43,412
You know, then we're losing valuable chill out time, uh, um, okay

151
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:47,952
Do you first of all, do you know the name of the water park? I feel like I don't

152
00:11:47,952 --> 00:11:50,292
Um, you know, you know

153
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,652
You know the the buffett margaritaville

154
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:59,592
Verse landscape of yes the margaritaville verse multiple. It's a villana verse

155
00:11:59,592 --> 00:12:06,892
So our margaritaville verse, you know extremely well, you know every possible song that they could name anything after the the from the big ones

156
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:12,292
To the obscure ones. Uh, does anything strike you is what the water park might be named after one of the songs

157
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:15,712
Well, just if you know if that's what it was

158
00:12:15,712 --> 00:12:19,812
Uh, gosh i'm trying to think is anything falls is there anything falls?

159
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:22,252
It's not math sucks

160
00:12:22,972 --> 00:12:23,932
Uh water park

161
00:12:23,932 --> 00:12:27,472
It sucks. So come to a water park instead, right?

162
00:12:27,472 --> 00:12:28,512
It's not the name of the park

163
00:12:28,512 --> 00:12:35,252
I don't think they'd go with volcano with that volcano themed water park down the road. Ah true. No, no, no that would conflict

164
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:38,412
It's not I will play for gumbo

165
00:12:38,412 --> 00:12:41,812
Falls it is it's a gumbo

166
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:45,192
It's all and the all the water is dyed to look like gumbo

167
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:47,692
So it looks like you're so you're swimming around in a big gumbo pot

168
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:52,892
Is it is it an homage to he went to paris called he went to the water park

169
00:12:52,892 --> 00:12:58,152
Finally you got it. It's not grapefruit juicy fruit

170
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:04,072
It's it's going to be like the second or third biggest ones after margaritaville, right?

171
00:13:04,332 --> 00:13:11,412
The paradise that the cheeseburgers can be found in that is the full name of the no I don't look what i'm getting at is

172
00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:12,672
Uh, you know

173
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:17,452
It's it's just salty bay or something. You might think it's something like that

174
00:13:17,452 --> 00:13:23,412
Something like uh, you know fawning from a song the name of the water park is island h2o live

175
00:13:23,412 --> 00:13:26,692
Exclamation point water park. Oh

176
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:33,212
Thank you algorithm. Thank you for naming our water park island h2o live. What do you yeah exactly?

177
00:13:33,432 --> 00:13:39,312
They like just they've put like 50 words in a blender and then three were selected randomly

178
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:43,572
Yeah, that flow doesn't make island h2o

179
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,952
island h2o

180
00:13:46,772 --> 00:13:50,232
Iowan water it the like big time water place

181
00:13:50,232 --> 00:13:52,832
Uh, this is nothing. What is this name?

182
00:13:52,852 --> 00:13:59,672
It's especially galling because frank bamma's splish splash mama. Jama is right there in wow jason

183
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:05,292
You just came up with some awesome ip frank bamma. Of course is jimmy buffett's character on hawaii 5-0

184
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:10,352
And his alter ego in his fiction. Oh, yeah. Well tully mars is his main

185
00:14:10,352 --> 00:14:12,212
Character I suppose. Yeah

186
00:14:12,772 --> 00:14:17,032
There's many different buffett verse characters, did you just spit that name out?

187
00:14:17,192 --> 00:14:20,252
I thought you were referring to a real place that was there. No, no

188
00:14:20,252 --> 00:14:23,652
I spent about 30 seconds trying to figure that out

189
00:14:23,652 --> 00:14:25,912
and i'm as

190
00:14:25,912 --> 00:14:29,152
Amazed as you are that I got it all out without fighting my tongue

191
00:14:29,152 --> 00:14:32,572
That's an excellent name and I think there's still time to change it

192
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,412
So you would have to think island h2o live

193
00:14:35,412 --> 00:14:38,972
What do you mean live like as opposed to other water saturday night?

194
00:14:38,972 --> 00:14:45,412
Live is live unlike other tv shows. Is that what you saw h2o live? No, it's not I saw it somewhere

195
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:52,672
You have a press release. I have a press release. Yeah falls. Sure. It's right. I mean, yeah, i'm just tossing out gold here

196
00:14:52,672 --> 00:15:00,352
Yeah, um, let's see if there's anything interesting in here. Uh, this was from november 13th central florida's newest and most immersive water park

197
00:15:00,352 --> 00:15:06,032
Will make waves when island h2o live at margaritaville resort orlando opens in spring 2019

198
00:15:06,032 --> 00:15:09,652
Secondly, it's at margaritaville that's is that all part of the title also

199
00:15:09,652 --> 00:15:11,392
I get

200
00:15:11,392 --> 00:15:18,532
Uh, i'll say yes, so what you can buy a ticket for the water park separate from

201
00:15:18,532 --> 00:15:24,712
Margaritaville hold on. Let me let me keep going here. And then there's also a section i'll tease that says behind the technology

202
00:15:24,712 --> 00:15:33,232
island h2o live will unleash the power of pure play and enthusiasm with nine different thrill rides a lazy river a wave pool a

203
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,672
Kids area and a river raft ride for the whole family

Designed to enable guests to customize their experience and share it with the fan or the willer

205
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:44,352
Excuse me the world the park uses a new rfid wristband system

206
00:15:44,352 --> 00:15:51,812
Which sounds like that volcano bay that will enable guests to personalize the music and lighting they experience on select rides

207
00:15:51,812 --> 00:15:53,872
Well now well now i'm a whore

00:15:53,872 --> 00:16:00,112
So you wow, this is crazy so I can listen to jimmy buffett's summer's

Or summer's cool, it's both nice. He's saying you gotta have a time out maestro

212
00:16:17,592 --> 00:16:22,612
You gotta go to summer school double entendres so you can listen to summer's school

At in a single slide live. It's a long the lazy

00:16:35,872 --> 00:16:38,352
That's lazy river. Okay. Okay

217
00:16:38,352 --> 00:16:42,812
Um, you can't make the slide go so slow that it takes a full album's length

218
00:16:42,812 --> 00:16:45,852
No, you can get like the chorus of despacito

219
00:16:45,852 --> 00:16:48,792
On like one of the speed slides

220
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:53,472
Not if mike has anything to do with it. You're not getting any of that despacito shit

221
00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:59,652
It's it's all buffett all the time. Yeah, no fuck despacito with this is least in the walls of this

222
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:05,392
They're only gonna play like the restaurants are gonna play jimmy like every third song

223
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:11,972
Four song they're talking about the rest are like avril lavigne. It's something that's not even in the world of yeah

224
00:17:11,972 --> 00:17:22,012
Another high-tech feature be live invites guests to sing karaoke or star another audio visual experiences with clips from these sessions shared through the app

225
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:29,352
The gamified app be live. Yeah, it's a water park. What are you talking about the game of gamify gamify

226
00:17:29,352 --> 00:17:35,572
Gamified app also allows guests to earn loyalty points with every ride now jason's on board for this

227
00:17:35,572 --> 00:17:43,772
Oh, I love experiences and activations. I love gamifying my content and all my faith. I love properties

228
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:51,372
How about that? We all love properties guests can win prizes such as free food and beverage items skip the line passes and more

229
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:53,612
Well now you have my attention. Mm-hmm

230
00:17:53,612 --> 00:18:00,592
Uh now this part says personalized paradise the experience at island h2o live will be all about creating your own unique

231
00:18:00,592 --> 00:18:07,212
customized experience for those looking to soak in the island vibe listen to music and have some chill with their thrill

232
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:13,532
Tropically inspired havens will abound with hammocks cabanas and soft sand beaches around every turn

233
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:19,352
And adult only areas will offer cocktails only steps from your beach chair and nudity

234
00:18:19,492 --> 00:18:27,132
I don't think that's involved to keep the fun going island h2o live is within walking distance or a short trolley ride to margaritaville

235
00:18:27,132 --> 00:18:31,512
Orlando resort hotel and cottages and back to that trolley ride

236
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:33,972
Did I your emotive transit? Yep

237
00:18:33,972 --> 00:18:37,152
Uh, I don't know if it's a margaritaville branded trolley though

238
00:18:37,152 --> 00:18:42,452
and then they just list all the other they listen you're in walking distance to a

239
00:18:43,132 --> 00:18:48,332
Burger fi capone's ford's garage game time sketchers and more

240
00:18:48,332 --> 00:18:55,092
Um, well that takes us to another area of this that there I don't I didn't realize this about margaritaville resort orlando

241
00:18:55,092 --> 00:19:02,112
That they are also building a new outdoor shopping complex as part of it and it is called sunset walk

242
00:19:02,112 --> 00:19:09,432
So something tells me that the gang here is gonna have to take a walk. Oh, yeah, let's all take a sunset walk

243
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:13,392
I've got another yes, uh, they should have called it. Uh,

244
00:19:14,032 --> 00:19:18,692
Well, this would get dicey with copyrights, uh flip-flop shop stop

245
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:23,292
That's good. Oh, okay flip-flop stop and shop

246
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:28,372
There we go. There's a little bit of a drunk over there because then the flip-flop stop and shop cops will

247
00:19:28,372 --> 00:19:31,512
Give it the drop. Well, and you might step on a pop top

248
00:19:31,512 --> 00:19:39,312
That's the biggest concern because this shopping mall is filled with loose pop tops a a beer, uh,

249
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:42,692
Delivery method that has not been used in decades

250
00:19:42,692 --> 00:19:49,352
It seems in buffett style. Yes. Yeah, but anyway, there is a mall being built. That's part of margaritaville

251
00:19:49,352 --> 00:19:57,492
At this point we're facing the dilemma of are we gonna have to go do a trip where we don't even step foot in disney or universal

252
00:19:57,492 --> 00:20:02,372
That trip that is entirely about us and the old ux us and the keeper

253
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:07,592
Uh, who's gonna have a whole new world of sectors to right keep

254
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:13,612
Well, if he's out of the clink from all that copper wiring he's been stealing from abandoned houses. That's right

255
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:19,532
He's been up to no, he's not we've been keeping tabs. He's not the sweet boy. You recall

256
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:24,632
Yeah, um, I have a I have on this press release a media contact. So

257
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:25,492
Maybe

258
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:29,172
We see what they can do for us. All right

259
00:20:29,172 --> 00:20:30,372
uh

260
00:20:30,372 --> 00:20:33,852
Yeah, um, well this this is a big adventure coming our way

261
00:20:33,852 --> 00:20:38,612
I also the the things that were not in that list that of stuff that's at sunset walk

262
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:45,292
Uh, you got a rock and bruise. Yes, of course the kiss owned the half of kiss owned restaurant

263
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:52,932
What sort of treaty or parlay did they need to come up with to get the margaritaville brands and rock and brew brands to work together?

264
00:20:53,432 --> 00:21:00,952
The parrot heads and kiss army notorious enemies, uh, and it's ended in bloodshed before so to get them to work together. Um,

265
00:21:01,072 --> 00:21:07,372
We'll see black magic had to be employed. There's no cabo a la cantina is there I don't believe so

266
00:21:07,372 --> 00:21:11,152
But you know what you got you got a sketchers that might have been in your that was in there

267
00:21:11,152 --> 00:21:14,092
Yeah, and you've also got an itch sugar

268
00:21:14,092 --> 00:21:17,892
Just like city was like our beloved city

269
00:21:17,892 --> 00:21:23,092
There's a lot in common between city walk and sunset and there's no itch sugar at the orlando city walk

270
00:21:23,092 --> 00:21:27,532
I don't believe I don't believe there is this is potentially

271
00:21:27,932 --> 00:21:35,152
Or unless i'm way off could be orlando's first it's sugar or I look and it's like it's seven 50th

272
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:36,772
uh, so

273
00:21:36,772 --> 00:21:42,352
Are you just are you just gonna have to move there or be like a bi-coastal?

274
00:21:42,452 --> 00:21:46,412
Like I don't I don't think like four days is gonna give you the hit you need

275
00:21:46,412 --> 00:21:52,152
I think I just I feel like mike we're gonna lose you for like well a couple months vacation will have to be at least a month

276
00:21:52,152 --> 00:21:55,592
I'm looking here. There's an itch sugar orlando international outlet

277
00:21:55,912 --> 00:22:00,572
Oh, but that's at the outlet malls probably right? Well, I think yeah

278
00:22:00,572 --> 00:22:05,232
There's that outlet in the name. There's two of them. So that's all like

279
00:22:05,232 --> 00:22:08,112
spoiled edible underwear. Yeah

280
00:22:08,112 --> 00:22:10,652
It's like a week from going bad. It's like yeah

281
00:22:10,652 --> 00:22:17,092
It's like the food stuffs at a marshals or a tj max you can eat the underwear but do it fast. Yeah

282
00:22:17,092 --> 00:22:18,872
Eat it fast, please clock's ticking

283
00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:22,212
Uh, so there's a lot of stuff

284
00:22:22,212 --> 00:22:25,572
Going on down there. Uh, uh, and and also

285
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:26,752
like

286
00:22:26,752 --> 00:22:32,032
This is something that's going to happen in 2019 and we will have to we should just like emergency get the recording going as soon

287
00:22:32,032 --> 00:22:34,132
As we know anything wherever we are

288
00:22:34,132 --> 00:22:35,832
Let's just or if somebody has to be on the phone

289
00:22:35,832 --> 00:22:41,932
We should respond to this as quickly alive as we can when we find out what the street names are

290
00:22:41,932 --> 00:22:49,352
At margaritaville because if you didn't hear us discuss this, uh in a previous episode, uh, uh, uh,

291
00:22:49,552 --> 00:22:54,812
Jason mike anthony geo and I submitted a giant list of names several years ago

292
00:22:55,432 --> 00:22:58,052
Recommended streets for margaritaville resort

293
00:22:58,052 --> 00:23:02,592
And it remains to be seen if they're going to use any now I was looking into

294
00:23:02,592 --> 00:23:04,792
Have any of the street names been declared?

295
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:11,072
It seems like the main drag that gets you into the margaritaville resort is inspiration street

296
00:23:11,072 --> 00:23:16,032
And that one's on the map and that could be a leftover potentially from the like

297
00:23:16,032 --> 00:23:22,052
It was like a chinese gardens or something before I forget unless is that a buffett thing is inspiration?

298
00:23:22,732 --> 00:23:26,992
Buffett somehow i'm trying to think that might be a lyric in a song

299
00:23:26,992 --> 00:23:31,452
I feel like he's more into perspiration from sitting out on that hot beach all day

300
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:37,072
Well, there could be a perspiration street that is adjunct to inspiration story. We'll find that out soon

301
00:23:37,072 --> 00:23:39,812
But the only one there there has been

302
00:23:39,812 --> 00:23:41,572
uh unemployment fair

303
00:23:41,572 --> 00:23:48,812
Uh to to start hiring up for margaritaville resort orlando, uh, and the address of the hiring fair

304
00:23:48,812 --> 00:23:51,092
I don't know if it's a permanent building or just a tent

305
00:23:51,092 --> 00:23:55,972
I don't know what people found when they got in there, but you were directed to go apply

306
00:23:55,972 --> 00:23:59,152
At 8011 fins up circle

307
00:23:59,152 --> 00:24:02,392
So that's pretty good. We got one we got one there

308
00:24:02,392 --> 00:24:07,352
And I don't know if that was on the list. I don't know if that came from us that might that might be a basic

309
00:24:07,352 --> 00:24:11,852
um, somebody sent us a couple street names they saw from a

310
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:16,212
Government thing and they were all pretty generic. I'm trying to remember where that map was that was that on facebook?

311
00:24:16,692 --> 00:24:17,532
I'm not sure

312
00:24:17,712 --> 00:24:22,012
Because there's certain ones like fins up or like I feel like we have fins up something

313
00:24:22,012 --> 00:24:27,852
So like is there going to be a situation where we claim we made that up or are they going to say well, this was obvious

314
00:24:27,852 --> 00:24:32,172
It's got to be clear cut. It's it's it's got to be one of our deeper ones

315
00:24:32,172 --> 00:24:39,972
I don't know if you can remember any offhand. I was a fan of short street. Uh, I I was pushing for margarita strida

316
00:24:39,972 --> 00:24:44,832
Um, I don't remember any of yours, but like it's gotta be one that's clearly from us

317
00:24:44,832 --> 00:24:51,312
I'm interested in the employment fair aspect because I feel like I read an article or heard something not too long ago that like

318
00:24:51,312 --> 00:24:54,772
There is a shortage of labor in orlando

319
00:24:54,772 --> 00:24:59,492
Like not a surplus which they've they're building so all these places are building so much

320
00:24:59,492 --> 00:25:06,852
There aren't enough people to work the jobs or just like the jobs are kind of thankless and probably underpaid like housekeeping

321
00:25:06,852 --> 00:25:08,732
or custodial

322
00:25:08,732 --> 00:25:14,772
Which the answer to that shortage is lure people there with money pay them more

323
00:25:16,592 --> 00:25:17,052
how

324
00:25:17,052 --> 00:25:23,192
How like come on is it this this is where it gets dicey for mike because to call the nameless

325
00:25:23,192 --> 00:25:29,872
The faceless disney and universal corporations to call them greedy or say they're not spreading the wealth is one thing

326
00:25:29,872 --> 00:25:33,212
But to put the blame back at your hero. Mr. Buffett

327
00:25:33,212 --> 00:25:38,612
Well, yeah, it's a different situation because like he has a different lifestyle and like the brand is just a totally different brand

328
00:25:38,612 --> 00:25:44,172
So there's obviously like economic concerns that you guys aren't even thinking about when we're talking about the margaritaville like brand and lifestyle

329
00:25:44,172 --> 00:25:49,312
And like jimmy himself as sort of an entrepreneur like he needs to have a lot more capital on hand to make

330
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:52,292
Bigger more innovative changes with the business. So I think yeah

331
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:55,232
I think it's totally unfair to sort of put them in the same box

332
00:25:55,232 --> 00:26:01,812
No, I mean that is we we were passing around a times article a while back from from when jimmy was working on the musical

333
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:09,512
Which has since closed that like right the one thing jimmy doesn't really do nowadays because of all his endeavors is really live the lifestyle

334
00:26:09,512 --> 00:26:11,592
Right. He's too busy. He's too busy

335
00:26:11,592 --> 00:26:16,632
But is it my instagram as my my it didn't it kind of confirms my instagram theory

336
00:26:16,632 --> 00:26:23,132
Of them shoot like doing a photo shoot with him on a beach once a month and then spreading it out during

337
00:26:23,132 --> 00:26:28,232
The month to make it look like he's just constantly on the beach to make it look like he's not in a boardroom

338
00:26:28,232 --> 00:26:34,092
Trying to soak those minimum wage workers for as many benefits as they can

339
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,792
Well, I won't work for lower. What do you mean?

340
00:26:38,092 --> 00:26:41,172
Meanwhile, look at a intern is posting like him in a hammock

341
00:26:41,592 --> 00:26:47,132
With a big coconut drink and like I love life. It says under it if they were

342
00:26:47,132 --> 00:26:51,052
Truly part of this lifestyle. They'd work for gumbo

343
00:26:51,052 --> 00:27:00,812
Um, well so that's all exciting there but there are uh, non

344
00:27:00,812 --> 00:27:04,392
Uh margarita centric events occurring. Yeah

345
00:27:04,392 --> 00:27:10,952
There's more. Um, what else do we got? Uh, um, there's uh, let me see

346
00:27:10,952 --> 00:27:14,752
Uh that what the skyliner is opening we talked a little about the skyliner

347
00:27:14,752 --> 00:27:20,252
When we talked about the monorail, yeah the the gondolas that are going to be a new transit system

348
00:27:20,252 --> 00:27:27,812
Connecting a crop of disneyland hotels and connecting epcot at the international gateway and connecting

349
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:32,212
mgm student, sorry hollywood studios, uh showing my age

350
00:27:32,212 --> 00:27:38,832
I i'm interested. I mean, I think that'll be cool. I'm always down for new modes of transits. We know

351
00:27:39,232 --> 00:27:47,252
Uh, I think uh anything around mgm studios is mostly going to be uh, get people out of star wars, uh

352
00:27:47,252 --> 00:27:51,172
stuff, uh, mostly distractions from uh, the

353
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:54,792
Potential crowd nightmare that will be galaxy's edge. Yeah

354
00:27:54,792 --> 00:27:58,352
As we're talking about do we delay it or not? But why don't why not?

355
00:27:59,172 --> 00:28:04,512
The I mean obviously the seismic and we're gonna add we're gonna disney world or and disneyland

356
00:28:04,512 --> 00:28:07,912
We're gonna start by quizzing scott on the three different

357
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:13,272
Locations that you could refer to star wars land as obviously we said one. I know them

358
00:28:13,272 --> 00:28:18,752
Yeah, now now I know it's so, you know the planet name is it batu? It's batu

359
00:28:18,752 --> 00:28:22,832
But what's the town called black spire outpost?

360
00:28:24,112 --> 00:28:28,352
That's good. Good. Very good. You've hammered it in number three

361
00:28:28,352 --> 00:28:31,972
Well, I was saying galaxy's i'm saying galaxy star wars galaxy's edge

362
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:37,112
I was making sure there was not a third that I didn't know or the number four star wars land

363
00:28:37,112 --> 00:28:44,532
The thing everyone will call it. Yeah, with the millennium falcon ride in the uh, the big ride and the other the different ride

364
00:28:44,532 --> 00:28:48,732
The different ride, uh, we haven't we tweeted about this. We haven't talked about it on the show

365
00:28:48,732 --> 00:28:54,092
Uh, we know the names of the star wars rides and one of the rides is called

366
00:28:54,092 --> 00:28:57,752
uh star wars rise of the resistance

367
00:28:57,752 --> 00:29:01,612
and uh, which is mainly

368
00:29:01,892 --> 00:29:10,172
It's mainly uh, tributing alec baldwin's work, uh defeating the trump agenda sure. Yeah with a with a quick

369
00:29:10,172 --> 00:29:12,632
fist to the face

370
00:29:12,632 --> 00:29:16,792
Baldwin style to some random guy black irish karate

371
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:22,732
And then and the other one is called the millennium falcon smugglers run

372
00:29:22,732 --> 00:29:28,272
That's yes poland smugglers. Oh, yeah, we got we need to get every we need to get

373
00:29:29,052 --> 00:29:32,452
Semicolons and winky faces and every possible

374
00:29:32,452 --> 00:29:37,772
And ellipses every piece of punctuation disney can jam into a ride name now

375
00:29:37,772 --> 00:29:44,792
What's what ride starts this trend of like galak mis guardians of the galaxy mission breakout twister ride it out

376
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:47,412
That's the way I said it a lot in that episode

377
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:53,792
That's the that's the totally the predecessor of this new bizarre way things are named

378
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:59,512
I mean in all fairness, we do have a podcast with a colon in the name and we're not a ride

379
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:06,592
No, we are a ride, but we're not sure uh, but like some of the services we have engaged uh, patreon and

380
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,132
There was a set. I don't know if it's on t public

381
00:30:09,132 --> 00:30:14,172
One of them does not allow you to have a colon in like your username or something like that

382
00:30:14,172 --> 00:30:21,772
So we've been stripped of our precious colon in certain sections of a website that you would never notice unless you went hunting for it

383
00:30:21,772 --> 00:30:25,932
Surprise no one called it out yet. Also. Well patreon.com

384
00:30:25,932 --> 00:30:29,012
Podcast the ride you don't put a colon in the later part

385
00:30:29,012 --> 00:30:35,432
I would send you the wrong break though. You have a you get a virus from break the internet like ralph himself

386
00:30:35,432 --> 00:30:39,212
Is mickey is it mickey and minnie's

387
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,132
Runaway colon railway

388
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:45,032
I know but it should be semi-common minnie's runaway

389
00:30:45,032 --> 00:30:48,772
Railway rail rail question mark way

390
00:30:49,032 --> 00:30:54,852
Exclamation point that one I guess the mickey minnie that is a pretty good name. I feel like that one's fine

391
00:30:54,852 --> 00:31:01,832
Yeah, but it does feel like it's a lot of there's too many more than two words often in a in a name

392
00:31:01,832 --> 00:31:04,032
Two thoughts is I think the problem

393
00:31:04,032 --> 00:31:10,052
Yeah, two or three like thoughts is what's happening here. Are they both called star wars this?

394
00:31:10,432 --> 00:31:12,232
Maybe technically. Yeah. Yeah

395
00:31:12,232 --> 00:31:16,532
So that's but you feel the like the the legalese

396
00:31:16,692 --> 00:31:20,532
Of it and you know, no human being is going to

397
00:31:20,532 --> 00:31:25,112
Who will ever like a child will not say we have to get to star wars rise of the resistance

398
00:31:25,112 --> 00:31:29,152
Do you guys want to ride ride of the rise? I can't even say it rise of the resistance

399
00:31:29,152 --> 00:31:33,372
It takes you back to the days of michael eisner wanting to call

400
00:31:33,372 --> 00:31:35,912
Uh call the ride star ride

401
00:31:35,912 --> 00:31:40,672
In the early days, but I think it's I don't know. I think you'd be lucky to have as

402
00:31:40,672 --> 00:31:45,372
As tidy of a name as star ride. What do we what we know about this ride?

403
00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:47,572
Is that it's like you're escaping from the jail

404
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:53,712
So that doesn't really suggest anything about that. I who who knows like that could not be the ride

405
00:31:53,712 --> 00:32:00,292
But like you're talking rise of the resistance. Yeah, excuse me rise of the resistance is about a jail escape. Yes

406
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:06,092
Yeah, it was it was it at the code name alcatraz for a long time and they called it like battle escape essentially

407
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:09,012
I think yeah

408
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:12,212
It's a ride about a rise

409
00:32:12,212 --> 00:32:16,192
Of a movement. Yeah, because the rise of the resistance is like

410
00:32:16,192 --> 00:32:21,052
That's what's happening in the galaxy, but that's not what's happening to you the entire

411
00:32:21,052 --> 00:32:25,812
Some the story of the resistance rising which takes three films to tell

412
00:32:25,812 --> 00:32:29,932
Will just happen in three minutes in one ride. Yeah

413
00:32:29,932 --> 00:32:33,772
I don't know what people are going to call that

414
00:32:33,772 --> 00:32:41,232
Well, because you know, I watched that holiday that two-hour one of the holiday specials and they kept asking

415
00:32:41,772 --> 00:32:46,072
The performers what did they ride and everyone just kept saying I wrote the avatar

416
00:32:46,072 --> 00:32:50,212
I wrote avatar even though there's two like no one's

417
00:32:50,212 --> 00:32:53,252
Oh, they aren't even disney's allowing people to not allowing it

418
00:32:53,252 --> 00:32:57,772
I think because it was like they didn't they they were just like well megan trainer just performed

419
00:32:57,772 --> 00:33:01,492
It's gonna look better if we don't cut and we just talked to her naturally or whatever

420
00:33:01,492 --> 00:33:03,872
But it was no one's saying like wait a minute

421
00:33:03,872 --> 00:33:09,672
I'm already I had some problems with megan trainer on the last special and now you're telling me she didn't use the full title avatar flight

422
00:33:10,232 --> 00:33:14,872
Of passage megan trainer you were on scotch shit list or the boat. What the hell?

423
00:33:15,032 --> 00:33:17,172
What is that boat the navi river journey?

424
00:33:17,452 --> 00:33:18,792
I believe is what it's called

425
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:25,232
But like I think people just call it like the millennium falcon ride and the other or the big ride or something

426
00:33:25,232 --> 00:33:28,772
I think by not calling these things something specific

427
00:33:28,772 --> 00:33:33,432
You're forcing people to sort of use a generic thing and invent their own name

428
00:33:33,432 --> 00:33:36,492
There will be like a populist name for these rides essentially

429
00:33:36,492 --> 00:33:43,112
I think you should come up with something as good and catchy as space mountain or something for each thing

430
00:33:43,112 --> 00:33:46,632
That would independently find that's fine, too

431
00:33:46,632 --> 00:33:54,012
I think when we will know more once we know what the ride actually is like will people call it the escape ride or the

432
00:33:54,012 --> 00:34:06,472
lightsaber because like there's talk about like you're in a ride vehicle halfway through you get out then the experience changes and then there's there's

433
00:34:06,472 --> 00:34:08,712
That's not on the ride maybe that's early stuff

434
00:34:08,712 --> 00:34:12,472
We don't really know we don't know really know what I think

435
00:34:12,472 --> 00:34:17,732
I know can I tell you what I think I know sure what I think I know is that

436
00:34:17,732 --> 00:34:20,372
The first part of the ride is you wait in line

437
00:34:20,372 --> 00:34:26,072
The whole thing the whole premise of the ride is that you're just going on a regular space flight like star tours

438
00:34:26,072 --> 00:34:28,512
So yeah, by the way, this might be legit

439
00:34:28,512 --> 00:34:32,712
Yes, you're in a magic rising bread line

440
00:34:32,712 --> 00:34:37,692
Yeah, you're in the bread line and you're they're like let's go up to space and eat your bread while you look out onto space

441
00:34:37,692 --> 00:34:41,492
It's gonna taste better up there. You'll get kind of more oxygen into it. It aerates it

442
00:34:41,492 --> 00:34:44,332
Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. So you go in there

443
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,032
And you go in a ship like star tours. It's a simulator

444
00:34:47,032 --> 00:34:49,412
You go up and it's high it's fun

445
00:34:49,412 --> 00:34:56,192
You're in space and then all of a sudden you get caught in a tractor beam from a big imperial star destroyer and they pull you

446
00:34:56,192 --> 00:34:59,552
In and at that point then you deboard in a hanger

447
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:03,252
And you walk through a giant hanger with a ton of robots

448
00:35:03,252 --> 00:35:05,492
And that's the second part of the line

449
00:35:05,492 --> 00:35:09,852
So you have the first part of the ride when you say get off is just that star tour simulator

450
00:35:09,852 --> 00:35:13,492
That takes you up until the prison. So now they're putting you in prison

451
00:35:13,492 --> 00:35:15,972
You're walking which is secretly another queue

452
00:35:15,972 --> 00:35:20,552
And then at that point you get loaded into those fun vehicles that they showed at d23 and in that teaser

453
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:25,412
And there's like eight and eight and it's a trackless wi-fi thing and at that point

454
00:35:25,652 --> 00:35:31,352
That thing zips around and by the way look up these teasers that they just released which are actual on-ride footage

455
00:35:31,352 --> 00:35:38,012
From anaheim were filmed on the set. That's right. Yeah actors walking around and I didn't realize that until you said it

456
00:35:38,012 --> 00:35:41,352
And when I went back and watched it, I was like that does look really cool

457
00:35:41,352 --> 00:35:46,532
Like it looks like a full set because what's really what's extra cool about it is it's wi-fi

458
00:35:46,532 --> 00:35:49,632
So there's not even tracks in the ground

459
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,952
Yeah, so you won't know

460
00:35:51,952 --> 00:35:54,212
Where you're going in it

461
00:35:54,212 --> 00:35:57,512
So it's basically like you just built the movie sets

462
00:35:57,512 --> 00:36:02,112
And this car that can drive anywhere is just going to drive around it

463
00:36:02,112 --> 00:36:05,152
Which is going to change from that's what i'm thinking visit to visit

464
00:36:05,152 --> 00:36:08,512
It's i'm assuming there'll be some variations because that's what they do now

465
00:36:08,512 --> 00:36:14,652
And we have not seen that in the trackless systems in domestic disney parks. I know no

466
00:36:14,652 --> 00:36:20,092
Right, they had a pooh's honey hunt. Yeah, which apologies scott. I don't get to see it

467
00:36:20,152 --> 00:36:25,132
Closer when i'm there or this year, excuse me this year. Sorry. It's this year. I'm good. That's hey

468
00:36:25,132 --> 00:36:32,152
That's side note big theme park development for me personally. I'm so excited. Yeah, that's for sure disney

469
00:36:32,152 --> 00:36:37,952
Tokyo disneyland tokyo disney sea and uh san rio puro land. Oh, yeah all in my future

470
00:36:37,952 --> 00:36:41,112
And tokyo maybe the decision to not do

471
00:36:41,112 --> 00:36:47,112
No, oh not that i'll do the dome city. Yeah, I'm uh, no, uh, no universal osaka for me

472
00:36:47,112 --> 00:36:50,332
That's what we decided sizable distance between the two sure

473
00:36:50,332 --> 00:36:52,912
Yeah, and I and we thought about it and like yeah

474
00:36:52,912 --> 00:36:58,092
but if we uh, you know if we went I could go take a picture under the uh,

475
00:36:58,092 --> 00:37:01,692
The king kong in city walk osaka we could post it on the twitter

476
00:37:01,692 --> 00:37:07,512
And I said that and I both like just stared each other in silence and they were like, okay, so maybe not do uh,

477
00:37:07,512 --> 00:37:11,872
So apologies no picture. Yeah

478
00:37:11,872 --> 00:37:13,252
um, so

479
00:37:13,352 --> 00:37:15,612
Yeah, I think that's why we were all we were just talking star wars

480
00:37:15,612 --> 00:37:19,852
So yeah, so that's that's the rumor of what the ride is and then at that point you're shooting through and then I guess

481
00:37:19,852 --> 00:37:24,772
The resistance comes to save you i'm hoping that droid there's a droid on each car

482
00:37:24,772 --> 00:37:27,472
Is that do we know that for 100 you can see in the picture?

483
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:33,732
Oh, they're a little black droid in the car in the front and he's like bad, but I hope he's not like I hope he turns

484
00:37:33,732 --> 00:37:37,092
I see so each car has a droid on it, which is fantastic

485
00:37:37,092 --> 00:37:41,612
Cool. I also by the way, this is just a side note. I was going through the mice chat message boards

486
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:43,352
These fuckers

487
00:37:43,352 --> 00:37:47,212
Are like this video doesn't excite me at all about this ride

488
00:37:47,212 --> 00:37:48,272
2019

489
00:37:48,272 --> 00:37:52,712
I couldn't believe it like multiple people being like what is this show?

490
00:37:52,932 --> 00:37:56,492
This isn't as good as this space mountain teaser from the 70s

491
00:37:56,492 --> 00:38:01,972
And it was like yeah this space mountain 70s the space mountain teaser is one of the best things ever. It's fantastic

492
00:38:01,972 --> 00:38:04,192
But it's a different thing

493
00:38:04,192 --> 00:38:09,712
And I can't like the idea that you wouldn't be like, oh they really like recreated a star destroyer

494
00:38:09,712 --> 00:38:14,752
The millennium falcon teaser that was filmed in the cockpit. Yes, I believe that looks cool, too

495
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:15,692
It looks fantastic

496
00:38:15,692 --> 00:38:23,132
which it's funny that like this this sort of practical thing that was created out of scraps and and

497
00:38:23,132 --> 00:38:29,552
Whatever pieces they could afford in the 70s have become so iconic. It's just like yeah switches and shit

498
00:38:29,552 --> 00:38:31,872
So yeah, that's true. We're essentially

499
00:38:31,872 --> 00:38:39,512
Like yeah, it's like original star wars is a little like junkie and janky and now we're like perfectly recreating shitty

500
00:38:39,512 --> 00:38:43,212
what they like threw which it does speak to like the

501
00:38:43,212 --> 00:38:47,752
Inventive spirit of the original star wars with like leading edge technology

502
00:38:47,752 --> 00:38:52,612
like the way they're gonna have to render the footage in the millennium falcon ride with like

503
00:38:52,612 --> 00:38:54,732
room for um

504
00:38:54,732 --> 00:39:00,992
Individual like if you shoot a wall the wall explodes, but maybe you don't shoot that wall every time

505
00:39:00,992 --> 00:39:04,232
Well, no, you don't shoot for sure. It has to be it's fully so anyway

506
00:39:04,232 --> 00:39:08,492
So there's also this video showing the cockpit of the millennium falcon, which is the other ride

507
00:39:08,492 --> 00:39:13,692
Which is a giant video game essentially. It's a giant simulator, but all the graphics are rendered in real time

508
00:39:13,692 --> 00:39:14,052
Yeah

509
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:20,712
so it's like that basically means that like you can fully make everything if you want to blow everything up in the

510
00:39:20,712 --> 00:39:23,792
In the senior and you can I don't know that that'll be possible

511
00:39:23,792 --> 00:39:30,632
But it means that there's like a lot of flexibility customization a lot of room is what i'm saying a high end

512
00:39:30,632 --> 00:39:33,592
There there if you imagine like a really high end computer

513
00:39:33,592 --> 00:39:39,172
It takes eight of those to run one of these cockpits or it's some insane amount of processing power

514
00:39:39,172 --> 00:39:42,772
And it's like it's six. This is just totally nerding out

515
00:39:42,772 --> 00:39:48,392
But it's like six people I think in a cockpit which also makes it like such an intimate

516
00:39:48,392 --> 00:39:52,932
Experience because you're in the cockpit with just six people. It's not like

517
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:56,312
It's not an open air. Most rides are like six people eight people whatever

518
00:39:56,312 --> 00:39:59,792
But like you're in this tiny thing with six people and you're in

519
00:39:59,852 --> 00:40:07,152
Like the you're in the thing like they've recreated it perfectly you're in the cockpit how many cockpits I don't know 20

520
00:40:07,152 --> 00:40:10,152
Hopefully because the thing's gonna have such a shitty capacity

521
00:40:10,152 --> 00:40:13,832
You're gonna have thousands and thousands throughput in an app for an hour

522
00:40:13,832 --> 00:40:15,992
But I was thinking like they in that video

523
00:40:15,992 --> 00:40:20,672
They show like close-ups of all the switches and the dials and shit and it's like yeah that really

524
00:40:20,672 --> 00:40:28,172
Like imagine going in the batmobile like imagine doing a ride in the batmobile or whatever whatever vehicle you like from your thing

525
00:40:28,332 --> 00:40:34,112
Like being recreated perfectly and then just getting to do it because like for a long like anything

526
00:40:34,112 --> 00:40:40,712
I feel like a lot of rides based on tv movie or whatever like they get close to the promise of it

527
00:40:40,712 --> 00:40:43,412
But this really feels like it's it. This is it

528
00:40:43,412 --> 00:40:46,332
Like for me at least when I watch that teaser of like wow

529
00:40:46,332 --> 00:40:53,272
I am gonna like hit the switch like I've dreamed about hitting the switch in the fucking millennium falcon and now i'm gonna get to do it

530
00:40:53,272 --> 00:40:57,592
So like the switch so exciting. Yeah, both of these rides

531
00:40:57,592 --> 00:41:03,632
it's yeah, it's uh, it's it's really something and it gives you like um, which it shows you how like

532
00:41:03,632 --> 00:41:08,652
Think about how in in 1986 star tours was a satisfying

533
00:41:08,652 --> 00:41:16,352
Yeah, uh, oh you enter the world of star wars and what they chose as representing that is totally acceptable and great

534
00:41:16,352 --> 00:41:21,132
And the way that the films have grown and all the I mean obviously there's been you know

535
00:41:21,132 --> 00:41:27,072
Many movies since then and the universe has expanded but the way like there is now need for

536
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:30,652
Totally different micro experiences within

537
00:41:30,652 --> 00:41:37,552
Star wars it's almost a little like I mean obviously you could invent an entire park of disneyland size

538
00:41:37,552 --> 00:41:39,752
That is all star wars sure stuff

539
00:41:39,752 --> 00:41:44,072
Just true of harry potter as well, and you don't wonder like if there's already

540
00:41:44,072 --> 00:41:50,892
Discussion of that or how you sure that people float those ideas. Yeah, I mean it makes sense

541
00:41:50,892 --> 00:41:53,812
Yeah, I mean the one of the rumors for

542
00:41:53,852 --> 00:41:57,932
Universal still unannounced third park in florida is like well

543
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:03,652
This will have the american magic or though it'll have some sort of fantastic beasts

544
00:42:03,652 --> 00:42:05,892
Sort of element. Oh, I see

545
00:42:05,892 --> 00:42:13,452
To to complement the the other harry potter stuff. Yeah, it is funny because like I think for years

546
00:42:13,452 --> 00:42:20,172
Once they have the star wars ride in disneyland or disney world as a kid even you're like got the star wars ride

547
00:42:20,612 --> 00:42:24,252
Yeah, that's it you and your kid had I don't think you were thinking well

548
00:42:24,252 --> 00:42:27,552
They should do a ride about the 8080s and they should do a ride about

549
00:42:27,552 --> 00:42:32,832
I want to fly the falcon and want to go to a street market and a restaurant with but end bar

550
00:42:32,832 --> 00:42:37,612
right i'm interested in that like after the way cars land turned out and

551
00:42:37,612 --> 00:42:42,572
So much what I like about cars land is just the place making and the level of detail

552
00:42:42,572 --> 00:42:46,072
And that is a very important part of the star wars films

553
00:42:46,072 --> 00:42:52,332
But if you're just watching it for the character stories, I feel like it's very easy to glaze over this sort of like, you know

554
00:42:52,332 --> 00:42:53,192
dirty

555
00:42:53,192 --> 00:42:54,312
breathing

556
00:42:54,312 --> 00:43:01,172
Galaxy that surrounds these characters very interesting what they do with that in galaxy's edge

557
00:43:01,172 --> 00:43:06,112
Yeah, and it's kind of a lot like we're talking all about the rides, but it does seem like you know

558
00:43:06,112 --> 00:43:09,852
Look, how's it up? We've all done it. I was up at harry potter the other day

559
00:43:09,852 --> 00:43:15,872
Uh, and like I didn't even go on the main ride like so much time you end up spending like i'm just gonna go down

560
00:43:15,872 --> 00:43:19,632
This weird little alley and it seems like clearly they're trying to cut into that

561
00:43:19,632 --> 00:43:22,312
Uh that piece of things and it's though

562
00:43:22,312 --> 00:43:25,192
I think the crowds are going to be hellish at this thing

563
00:43:25,192 --> 00:43:29,872
It's going to help in the long run that all right a lot of people are rushing to go to the ride

564
00:43:29,872 --> 00:43:32,512
But a lot of other people are just meandering around

565
00:43:32,512 --> 00:43:38,212
Side streets and looking in what that what's in this window and let's all just be in this shop for an hour

566
00:43:38,212 --> 00:43:45,172
The toy darien toy shop you might be talking about. Yes, I am waddo's waddo's a brand of alien

567
00:43:45,172 --> 00:43:49,952
I failed that test. Uh, i'll i'll try to have the right answer next time

568
00:43:49,952 --> 00:43:57,472
Well with aliens too like with star wars aliens wandering around talking to you potentially

569
00:43:57,472 --> 00:44:03,932
Engaging with you or yelling at you if you messed up the falcon like now, let me say this

570
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,052
I

571
00:44:05,052 --> 00:44:10,212
Don't want to do that. I don't want anybody talking to me. I'm a guy that goes into a store

572
00:44:10,212 --> 00:44:17,212
I don't want anybody bothering me. I'm like I'm a i'm afraid of being harassed by streetmosphere people

573
00:44:17,212 --> 00:44:22,552
I think I made it through the brooklyn people in the window talking to me at universal and I even

574
00:44:22,552 --> 00:44:27,652
Improved with them a little and that was fun, but they're at a distance some monster in my face

575
00:44:27,652 --> 00:44:33,052
I don't know man. I bet though I bet the distinction in your brain is this and I could be wrong

576
00:44:33,052 --> 00:44:34,952
but if it's like

577
00:44:35,712 --> 00:44:41,392
A humanoid looking person with a little makeup or something or just you know an alien smock on

578
00:44:41,392 --> 00:44:44,852
You probably don't want to deal with them. But if there's a full

579
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:52,332
Puppet man or like a vendor who's a big creature that talks. I think you're going to be all into that

580
00:44:52,332 --> 00:44:56,752
Yeah, you like talking to like animal you like talking about robot animals and stuff

581
00:44:56,752 --> 00:44:59,252
Sure, so if you're if there's a thing that doesn't look like a human

582
00:44:59,252 --> 00:45:04,652
I feel like I might be into it interested in the mechanics of it and just watching it go by

583
00:45:04,672 --> 00:45:10,712
I still am going to be more into like he's talking to a group of eight people or I watch it from a little distance

584
00:45:10,712 --> 00:45:14,472
Right. I don't think I need to be talking to the guy

585
00:45:14,472 --> 00:45:18,212
Though now i'm i'm recalling the video of you mike

586
00:45:18,212 --> 00:45:23,352
Like yelling at kylo ren with specific dialogue. Yes. Yes

587
00:45:23,352 --> 00:45:26,192
You will be all over that you will nail this thing

588
00:45:26,192 --> 00:45:31,012
I had to psych myself up to do that though because I generally don't I feel too on the spot and I remember going

589
00:45:31,012 --> 00:45:32,892
I'm gonna say something at kylo ren

590
00:45:34,292 --> 00:45:34,732
And

591
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,432
I don't think I I didn't plan it out, but I was just gonna respond

592
00:45:37,432 --> 00:45:41,512
I respond to whatever he says so I think I have to get psyched into it too

593
00:45:41,512 --> 00:45:46,732
Because I don't know what you said I did I liked that that was just pure like 12 year olds

594
00:45:46,732 --> 00:45:53,132
Yeah, I think I just was a contri contrary to him. I think I will never give in to the

595
00:45:53,132 --> 00:45:56,832
Yeah, I think yeah, i'm trying to remember what I said and I

596
00:45:56,832 --> 00:45:57,952
I remember I was like, yeah

597
00:45:57,952 --> 00:46:02,452
I will never uh, I will never give up on the resistance or something and then he said something

598
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:08,472
Like I will rule the galaxy or something. Yeah, but what if you don't or something? I said something along those lines

599
00:46:08,472 --> 00:46:13,352
Very simple. Yeah, good and it was fun and I was thrilled to have the video

600
00:46:13,352 --> 00:46:17,452
So yeah, you want a video with you talking to star wars character? You know what?

601
00:46:17,792 --> 00:46:23,792
Oh, sorry, I I say this that I don't like I don't like talking to the characters, but I was up at universal

602
00:46:23,792 --> 00:46:25,552
recently

603
00:46:25,552 --> 00:46:32,192
with with a friend buzz buzz and I did we did interact with uh,

604
00:46:32,192 --> 00:46:34,632
Juice and I told him to have a gross day

605
00:46:34,632 --> 00:46:35,592
I mean that's

606
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:40,392
I'm saying that I don't think he heard me

607
00:46:40,392 --> 00:46:44,812
This is this is a larger maybe discussion about performers in parks

608
00:46:44,812 --> 00:46:49,892
But I do think it's sometimes performer specific as well if I feel like engaging

609
00:46:49,892 --> 00:46:54,712
Because some performers you go, this is a little too much or like I don't want to deal with this

610
00:46:54,712 --> 00:47:01,132
But sometimes a person there or a ride operator impresses me so much. I want to engage with them

611
00:47:01,932 --> 00:47:08,092
It depends you can win me over even if i'm sort of not feeling social or feeling like I need to perform or something

612
00:47:08,092 --> 00:47:11,692
But if you have a bit or something that I like like we were just on guardians

613
00:47:11,692 --> 00:47:17,592
It was the uh, it was the halloween overlay monsters after dark monsters after dark and a guy

614
00:47:17,592 --> 00:47:19,812
Usually people are okay on that ride

615
00:47:19,812 --> 00:47:24,392
They don't have fun bits, but this guy did a bit and the whole premise of the ride is that the monsters are out

616
00:47:24,392 --> 00:47:26,112
Everything is going to shit

617
00:47:26,112 --> 00:47:29,072
And like you just got to get up there get Groot and get down

618
00:47:29,072 --> 00:47:32,412
But like be careful because monsters are gonna eat you this guy had a full bit

619
00:47:32,412 --> 00:47:37,192
He had developed where he was a monster that escaped and stole someone's clothes

620
00:47:37,192 --> 00:47:41,752
And like he was doing the whole thing. I loved it. I was like this guy's great

621
00:47:41,752 --> 00:47:48,992
I went on it once and a guy was doing a different bit where he was like clearly in a daze. He's like

622
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:54,672
Uh, this isn't normally my job. Uh stuff is just kind of weird right now

623
00:47:54,672 --> 00:47:58,332
I'm a janitor like he seemed really confused

624
00:47:58,652 --> 00:47:59,692
That's kind of fun

625
00:47:59,692 --> 00:48:04,852
I like kind of like that turns around and his shirt has a giant hole with burn marks on the back

626
00:48:04,852 --> 00:48:07,792
And I was like, wow, they let them have some

627
00:48:07,792 --> 00:48:11,892
Fun with this but this I wasn't like going back and forth with this guy

628
00:48:11,892 --> 00:48:15,532
I was just but I was like more willing to be like, yeah and like I respond like

629
00:48:15,532 --> 00:48:21,732
Excitedly responding to him. So I do feel like in any different parts of the park depending on what the performer's doing

630
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:26,832
I'm more willing to like go up to them or i'm more willing to banter

631
00:48:26,832 --> 00:48:34,632
I think it'll be interesting to see how they incorporate like immersive theater kind of techniques while also making it

632
00:48:34,632 --> 00:48:41,372
Palatable for a general audience and also doing it with like the biggest crowd influx

633
00:48:41,372 --> 00:48:44,532
Maybe in theme park history for the immersive stuff

634
00:48:44,532 --> 00:48:47,232
We should have a friend of the show and regular guest

635
00:48:47,232 --> 00:48:52,532
Eva anderson on to give us a perspective of the immersive thing because that is also like you should be consulting on

636
00:48:52,532 --> 00:48:59,232
The world or that um, what's it called in utah that the void people are making ever oh, yeah

637
00:48:59,232 --> 00:49:06,392
Oh, I can't remember. I know what you're talking about. It's not everlane. That's not everlane. That's where you go for great quality

638
00:49:06,392 --> 00:49:09,172
Everwood or something? I don't know

639
00:49:09,172 --> 00:49:13,432
Um, and we get taught we there's more stuff to get to so we'll wrap up the star wars part

640
00:49:13,432 --> 00:49:17,832
But there's the biggest thing we haven't even talked about especially for you

641
00:49:17,832 --> 00:49:22,052
Of course is to see your old friend again your favorite character in fiction

642
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:26,392
Yeah, and I I think I dropped it in an episode a little while back

643
00:49:26,392 --> 00:49:30,812
But this according to jim hill paul rubens is back as rex

644
00:49:30,812 --> 00:49:35,792
Or at least they asked him which is a weird piece of news to give if it's not a done deal

645
00:49:35,792 --> 00:49:41,752
But oh hopefully fingers crossed and yeah, oh any now. Yes, you're right all

646
00:49:41,752 --> 00:49:47,852
Rules out the window if I can talk to rex for a while if rex will respond to you or something like

647
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:49,632
Yeah, I mean that would be the dream

648
00:49:49,632 --> 00:49:54,072
Yeah, I mean probably he's just gonna be like a sunny eclipse style thing where he has a kind of a thing

649
00:49:54,072 --> 00:49:58,552
Like a track I think so so I will like

650
00:49:58,552 --> 00:50:05,732
Lay i'll just go home and while i'm falling asleep imagine the moment where he's like, I think you're cool scott. Yeah

651
00:50:05,732 --> 00:50:07,992
I don't I will say though the mr

652
00:50:07,992 --> 00:50:10,852
Potato i've never seen any i've never I guess looked it up even the mr

653
00:50:10,852 --> 00:50:16,392
Potato head at the toy story ride. It does talk to you. Yeah, they're like customized

654
00:50:16,392 --> 00:50:23,172
So there are specific things there seems like an area of these things where they can sort of tailor it to who?

655
00:50:23,612 --> 00:50:25,252
Uh is in front of them, right?

656
00:50:25,532 --> 00:50:29,072
But it's not yes not asking about your name or your profession

657
00:50:29,072 --> 00:50:34,852
So maybe it's he's gonna say you're a cool guy, but you will still not get that scott. He won't say scott

658
00:50:34,852 --> 00:50:36,672
Yeah, but he might say you're a cool

659
00:50:36,672 --> 00:50:43,312
I'll film a bunch of video of him and edit all the sound bites when I can find two specific words that can form scott

660
00:50:43,552 --> 00:50:49,552
Or i'll just pull it out of you know, if he said butterscotch and I could just pull scott out of that

661
00:50:49,552 --> 00:50:54,732
Evermore park evermore park in utah. Sorry. It took me so long to hold that void

662
00:50:54,732 --> 00:51:01,812
Companies vr. Yes, but it's not vr. It's not vr. It's like a fully immersive you interact with people

663
00:51:01,812 --> 00:51:03,472
There's no rides and their sets

664
00:51:03,472 --> 00:51:08,272
No, I think it's more like storytelling and an immersive play a friend of the show

665
00:51:08,272 --> 00:51:12,072
Todd martin's risk wrote a big thing in the la times about it

666
00:51:12,372 --> 00:51:15,472
Sorry, we'll cut this up but uh, I was you were doing a little bit of that last time

667
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:20,772
I forgot to tell you can you hear it? I can hear you. Okay. Shit. Sorry. It's okay. Oh, sorry. I'll cut that out. Yeah

668
00:51:20,772 --> 00:51:24,332
Anyway, it looks very cool out there and also the voids

669
00:51:24,332 --> 00:51:25,432
Rnd

670
00:51:25,432 --> 00:51:32,332
Department is out there. So please have us out. We'd love to check it out. We would like to come out. Thank you

671
00:51:32,332 --> 00:51:33,772
um speak okay, so

672
00:51:33,772 --> 00:51:37,732
We we I would love to go there. Um, but speaking of another place i've never been

673
00:51:37,892 --> 00:51:44,992
So i'm going to talk about a thing very brief, maybe not briefly, um, we've never been to dollywood

674
00:51:44,992 --> 00:51:50,432
But dollywood is opening an expansion. Ah in 2019. Okay

675
00:51:50,432 --> 00:51:56,612
And it is called wildwood grove. Uh-huh and it's like a pretty big expansion in the dollywood

676
00:51:56,612 --> 00:52:00,892
In relation to the other like the size of the park I should say

677
00:52:00,892 --> 00:52:06,172
Um, and it's got like it's very are you guys familiar with this a little bit or no?

678
00:52:06,492 --> 00:52:10,792
Um, I not I saw a little it's like very colorful a lot of lights

679
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:18,032
Uh, there's a ride called the black bear trail where you it's a very kid ride where you ride on the back of a black bear

680
00:52:18,032 --> 00:52:19,812
That's pretty good

681
00:52:19,812 --> 00:52:22,832
sycamore swing which is basically just a swing ride

682
00:52:22,832 --> 00:52:28,372
Uh like that big like a ship that goes up and down frog and fireflies, which is a kid ride

683
00:52:28,372 --> 00:52:32,792
The mad mockingbird which is again a kid ride where you're right. It's a lot of animals

684
00:52:32,792 --> 00:52:34,732
You're riding on a lot of animals, which is nice

685
00:52:35,392 --> 00:52:37,792
A dragon flyer, which looks like a little bit of a coaster

686
00:52:37,792 --> 00:52:42,432
But the whole thing is it's gonna have like very a lot of lights. It'll be very cool at night

687
00:52:42,432 --> 00:52:45,572
What i'm extra excited about is

688
00:52:45,572 --> 00:52:48,052
The new characters being introduced

689
00:52:48,052 --> 00:52:53,772
Oh, there are three new characters. Oh boy. There's not a ton on them, but we kind of like that better

690
00:52:53,772 --> 00:52:59,512
I feel like yes leave it as a mystery. You have to go over there in person to figure it out. So

691
00:52:59,512 --> 00:53:01,552
meet franklin frog

692
00:53:01,672 --> 00:53:05,432
What a person what a personality this happy inhabitant has

693
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:09,232
Playful and jolly this guy is more personality than your average amphibian

694
00:53:09,232 --> 00:53:12,912
He likes crowds and is more than happy to demonstrate his riveting skills

695
00:53:12,912 --> 00:53:20,572
So this thing mentions twice how good of a personality but then is not that specific about his personality is he has a lot of personality

696
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:26,292
Yeah, so they have to come back adventure and he's a real foodie and he loves content

697
00:53:26,292 --> 00:53:28,052
Oh, he loves content

698
00:53:28,112 --> 00:53:34,492
Uh, this is benjamin bear benjamin bear gives the warmest friendliest cuddly hugs in all the land

699
00:53:34,492 --> 00:53:39,892
His happy demeanor to lead with in this modern day and age fair enough. He's gonna get me, dude

700
00:53:39,892 --> 00:53:48,032
Uh, his happy demeanor is evident in his hugs. No wonder there's just not a more genuine bear in all the forest

701
00:53:48,032 --> 00:53:56,312
Huh shots fired and all the other bears, yeah disingenuous bears, but no he's the most genuine bear again

702
00:53:56,312 --> 00:53:59,792
This kind of just talks about his hugs twice and then he's genuine

703
00:53:59,792 --> 00:54:04,372
And then the last two characters are flit and flutter

704
00:54:04,372 --> 00:54:09,132
Uh, wait now are they bugs? They are like fairies. I think

705
00:54:09,132 --> 00:54:18,532
In a land inhabited by hundreds of rainbow god damn it butterflies flit and flutter are ambassadors of beauty and grace as they make their way around

706
00:54:18,532 --> 00:54:24,112
Wildwood grove wow you angrily deal with the flash site of wildwood grove

707
00:54:25,152 --> 00:54:28,392
The famous catchphrase god damn it

708
00:54:28,392 --> 00:54:32,052
That is dolly would not be happy with me cursing in the middle of this

709
00:54:32,052 --> 00:54:37,152
One thing I don't put up with is wearing. Yeah, don't like swears. She don't like swears

710
00:54:37,152 --> 00:54:42,552
Anyway, we were invited to a press conference for this announcement last year last year conference

711
00:54:42,552 --> 00:54:46,952
Yeah, but they didn't realize that we were not in pigeon forage

712
00:54:46,952 --> 00:54:52,292
We'd love to see pigeon forage

713
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:59,192
So i'm saying though that when wildwood opens I maybe I email again and we see if we can go meet

714
00:54:59,192 --> 00:55:04,732
Uh benjamin bear and get one of his trademark hugs because you know where we can first hug damn it

715
00:55:04,732 --> 00:55:10,032
I don't want some run of the mill. Yeah, the the 700th hug. I'm number one

716
00:55:10,032 --> 00:55:14,692
And you know where we could stay in pigeon forage. I do margaretville hotel

717
00:55:14,692 --> 00:55:21,992
So i've never been to speaking of things we've never been to I think this is interesting

718
00:55:21,992 --> 00:55:27,572
We haven't really addressed lego land that much. I think it's come up on the show, but i've never been to either of them

719
00:55:27,572 --> 00:55:29,412
There's one in southern california

720
00:55:29,412 --> 00:55:33,652
And then there's one in florida and there's a few others around the globe

721
00:55:33,652 --> 00:55:40,212
In florida, they are opening a full lego movie land with three new attractions and

722
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:44,152
Uh, I believe it is a re theming of of an existing land

723
00:55:44,152 --> 00:55:49,592
But they they are new rides and I think it's notable to point out because it is like

724
00:55:49,592 --> 00:55:56,632
Oh, this is a brand new land based off like a very successful box office hit with a sequel on the way

725
00:55:56,632 --> 00:56:01,652
So i'm curious to see how that works out. I've heard people with little kids too

726
00:56:01,652 --> 00:56:06,932
Tend to gravitate towards lego land. I think it's very affordable and very very fun for kids

727
00:56:06,932 --> 00:56:10,332
Someone's just telling me they're like you gotta go to lego land. I was like, oh, okay

728
00:56:10,332 --> 00:56:14,792
So people I feel like people speak highly of it. Do you know the rides or no? Uh, no

729
00:56:14,792 --> 00:56:19,412
Okay, I do not. Uh, I I read about they're out there at theme park insider

730
00:56:19,412 --> 00:56:25,372
I think has a rundown of them. They have hotels too. They have like lego themed hotels that look very cool

731
00:56:25,372 --> 00:56:33,112
Sure neat. Um, that sounds good. And yeah, lego movies are pretty big franchise to have rides based on so that'll be

732
00:56:33,112 --> 00:56:37,432
There's lego. Yeah, is lego batman involved or is that too?

733
00:56:37,692 --> 00:56:43,292
No, I don't think I think it's mostly the main characters because I like the fun. I like I like that movie

734
00:56:43,292 --> 00:56:44,132
Okay, but I like that

735
00:56:45,192 --> 00:56:46,072
I like that

736
00:56:46,072 --> 00:56:55,132
Oh, yeah, yeah, we saw it together and we were like, oh we want it more from the characters. Yeah

737
00:56:55,132 --> 00:57:01,632
Well, if this can turn into a review of the lego movie then yes, I wanted to like I don't know why

738
00:57:01,632 --> 00:57:06,412
harry potter characters show up and then they're like take over and like

739
00:57:06,412 --> 00:57:11,252
Godzilla and non-batman characters when we get all the fun villains at the start, but anyway

740
00:57:11,252 --> 00:57:18,352
Well, you've got a similar thing going on in the I I have recently been dissatisfied by the film ralph breaks the internet

741
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:20,692
Oh, I know you see I understand

742
00:57:20,692 --> 00:57:21,692
the

743
00:57:21,692 --> 00:57:24,932
Getting all the princesses together sure got it

744
00:57:24,932 --> 00:57:27,532
but in the internet the

745
00:57:27,532 --> 00:57:34,252
Princesses are in the internet and they're literally hits a point where like ralph's like swinging around a pinterest pin

746
00:57:34,252 --> 00:57:38,472
And then all the princesses like rescue him in the internet

747
00:57:38,472 --> 00:57:46,112
It is an internet problem and the princesses have to solve things are getting real people are real confused these days

748
00:57:46,112 --> 00:57:52,172
Yeah, I also I mean that first like one of the first preview images where it's like they're in

749
00:57:52,172 --> 00:57:58,652
What looks like a train station or something and there's all the different portals to like marvel pixar

750
00:57:58,652 --> 00:58:05,572
And i'm like that's not that that's feels more dystopian than fun to me the way you have released it as like

751
00:58:05,572 --> 00:58:10,532
Look at this. This is what we're leading with and it's like, oh, I don't know

752
00:58:10,532 --> 00:58:11,872
Is that still in the movie?

753
00:58:12,192 --> 00:58:18,332
What when they go to like the portals of the internet like the crossroads of the internet and they see marvel and star wars and stuff

754
00:58:18,332 --> 00:58:19,172
Oh, yeah. Yeah

755
00:58:19,172 --> 00:58:25,352
Happens like you like go down a hallway and there's a stormtrooper and there's yeah grumpy

756
00:58:25,352 --> 00:58:26,572
Like yeah

757
00:58:26,572 --> 00:58:27,512
finally

758
00:58:27,512 --> 00:58:35,552
The general idea of stormtroopers and grumpy meat sort of not like one like passes by the other right the promise of all of that

759
00:58:35,552 --> 00:58:42,752
Is so much greater than what probably ends up happening. Yeah, and it all happens so fast and also it's all predicated on

760
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:48,072
The the website excuse is that it's all promoting something called. Oh my disney.com

761
00:58:48,072 --> 00:58:50,732
Which i'm a we do

762
00:58:50,732 --> 00:58:57,412
We were theme park podcasters for hours a week. I've never heard of oh my disney.com

763
00:58:57,412 --> 00:59:02,012
Hey, I guess hey it works now i'm talking about it. Yeah, I know about it

764
00:59:02,012 --> 00:59:07,952
Honestly, if they had just said it's all because of disney plus or whatever, which is another

765
00:59:07,952 --> 00:59:13,212
If the movie was the reveal of the streaming service that makes more sense to me

766
00:59:13,212 --> 00:59:15,392
I think the problem with this and one thing that

767
00:59:15,392 --> 00:59:18,912
the problem with this seems like it's it gets

768
00:59:18,912 --> 00:59:24,912
An issue it's something wrong with what was good about the first movie, which the movie was specifically

769
00:59:25,192 --> 00:59:32,492
Just video games and all of the characters from the video games interact and look they got sonic and they got

770
00:59:32,492 --> 00:59:37,212
the street fighter people like yeah, the internet one it's

771
00:59:37,212 --> 00:59:38,852
encompasses all

772
00:59:38,852 --> 00:59:39,752
things

773
00:59:39,752 --> 00:59:47,072
And so much and the internet at the bat present is a terrifying hellscape dark place

774
00:59:47,072 --> 00:59:54,392
I mean, I'm concerned just the phrase the disney princess is on the internet. I'm like, oh those princesses aren't gonna

775
00:59:59,732 --> 01:00:00,132
Google

776
01:00:00,132 --> 01:00:02,152
Don't look at john laster's computer

777
01:00:02,152 --> 01:00:04,132
I yeah

778
01:00:04,132 --> 01:00:10,732
Yeah, I was at I probably said this before at d23 and I was watching their movie panel

779
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:14,792
Which is always like three hours long and it is fun because I like as you know

780
01:00:14,792 --> 01:00:17,632
I like being in a big room with a bunch of people who are excited about stuff

781
01:00:17,632 --> 01:00:18,592
So when i'm in the room

782
01:00:18,592 --> 01:00:22,632
I texted everyone excitedly when they revealed rex was going to be in star wars land

783
01:00:22,632 --> 01:00:27,612
To everyone in this room got a text from me. I think and it was every one of the room went nuts

784
01:00:27,612 --> 01:00:31,272
As if like the rolling stones in 1972 are taking the stage

785
01:00:31,272 --> 01:00:35,372
They were like and a friend will be joining us again in star wars land

786
01:00:35,372 --> 01:00:40,772
It's rex and everyone went nuts and i'm like, this is great. Yep. I would have looked good thing. I wasn't there

787
01:00:40,772 --> 01:00:44,572
I would have lost my voice. Yeah, you'd like penal mania for me

788
01:00:44,572 --> 01:00:47,412
Rushed the stage and passed out

789
01:00:47,412 --> 01:00:49,372
Smelling salt scott here

790
01:00:49,672 --> 01:00:52,832
But we they were showing movie stuff and like

791
01:00:52,832 --> 01:00:59,492
Boring movie stuff. There was that chris pine boat movie that no one but the people were still cheering and applauding happy to see chris pine

792
01:00:59,492 --> 01:01:07,452
and then ralph breaks the internet and they show the scene with oh my disney and marvel and star wars and you could

793
01:01:07,452 --> 01:01:09,992
Feel in the room that everyone was like

794
01:01:09,992 --> 01:01:11,252
It's a bit

795
01:01:11,252 --> 01:01:12,772
Crasse, okay

796
01:01:12,772 --> 01:01:15,792
And then the princess scene which doesn't make any sense in the context

797
01:01:15,792 --> 01:01:20,832
But then that played well and the audience then was won over and loved because it is fun

798
01:01:20,832 --> 01:01:28,172
To see all the princesses together. Yeah, and it's like oh that just make that movie. What the hell is it doing in this weird movie?

799
01:01:28,312 --> 01:01:30,812
Like this is fun. I get it

800
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:35,392
But you know what else is weird is that a lot of they frame the oh my disney thing as essentially

801
01:01:35,392 --> 01:01:41,172
That's a disney fan site. So the the setting of all the disney stuff is essentially like a comic con hall

802
01:01:41,172 --> 01:01:47,852
So you're in a convention center watching a film about watching a scene about a convention center about disney fandom

803
01:01:47,852 --> 01:01:52,192
It's really i'm interested to see well if it's different though, because I don't I wonder

804
01:01:52,192 --> 01:01:57,132
You know, that's weird. That's a weird. Yeah, like feedback loop. This is like a

805
01:01:57,132 --> 01:02:02,392
second beat of a comedy a second beat of a sketch you're talking like

806
01:02:02,392 --> 01:02:05,972
Where it doesn't line up a lot

807
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:11,412
Where stuff doesn't work like a sequel to a comedy movie and it's like well now

808
01:02:11,412 --> 01:02:13,932
They don't work at walmart anymore

809
01:02:13,932 --> 01:02:18,752
Now they all work at a water park and you get to see the characters with these funny traits

810
01:02:18,752 --> 01:02:25,752
Do this thing and it's like oh kind of missed the mark. I like the first place that being said this was an

811
01:02:25,752 --> 01:02:30,752
Unbelievably successful film. So I maybe i'm in the wrong. However, I did watch it with an audience

812
01:02:30,752 --> 01:02:36,012
That was deadly silent except for when miranda singh showed up and that was rolling stones

813
01:02:36,012 --> 01:02:40,072
Seriously giant reaction

814
01:02:40,072 --> 01:02:46,832
but um, you know what let me let me shift things over to a

815
01:02:46,832 --> 01:02:52,892
Super exciting area of ip we've been talking about kind of off the beaten path parks

816
01:02:52,892 --> 01:02:55,312
uh, and in 2019

817
01:02:55,312 --> 01:02:58,352
over in hershey, pennsylvania

818
01:02:58,352 --> 01:02:59,932
there will be

819
01:03:00,132 --> 01:03:05,392
Uh a thrilling new attraction with you know, we've complained about some of these what some of these rides are called

820
01:03:05,392 --> 01:03:08,512
It'd be impossible to complain about the ride title

821
01:03:08,512 --> 01:03:11,272
Reese's cup fusion

822
01:03:11,272 --> 01:03:20,332
One word cup fusion cup fusion now if you recall on the hershey park episode with evan susser

823
01:03:20,332 --> 01:03:21,212
we

824
01:03:21,212 --> 01:03:26,392
Talked about a ride. Uh, uh, yeah, it's a ride called a Reese's extreme cup challenge

825
01:03:26,412 --> 01:03:32,152
Which is kind of a shooting gallery buzz lightyear style ride, but that's like a extreme sports

826
01:03:32,152 --> 01:03:36,592
competition kind of in like the the simpsons poochy

827
01:03:36,592 --> 01:03:39,072
view of how to be cool for

828
01:03:39,072 --> 01:03:43,172
Uh youths today and it seemed a little like odd and out of date though fun

829
01:03:43,172 --> 01:03:47,292
I would love to go on that ride, but it's I didn't realize it's being uh,

830
01:03:47,292 --> 01:03:50,192
Replaced by another it seems like probably more of an overlay

831
01:03:50,192 --> 01:03:56,092
But the uh, this this new ride is called Reese's cup fusion and Reese's cup fusion challenges you

832
01:03:56,392 --> 01:03:58,212
Let me take a breath here

833
01:03:58,212 --> 01:04:02,792
Reese's cup fusion challenges you to protect the crystal cup

834
01:04:02,792 --> 01:04:10,432
That gathers the world's love for chocolate and peanut butter and uses it to power the Reese's factory

835
01:04:10,432 --> 01:04:11,892
so

836
01:04:11,892 --> 01:04:18,872
We're not only halfway through the description. There is a crystal cup and the job of the cup is to gather chocolate love

837
01:04:18,872 --> 01:04:21,372
in addition to this

838
01:04:21,412 --> 01:04:27,172
Hershey park is getting a 150 million dollar new entryway called chocolate town

839
01:04:27,172 --> 01:04:30,512
Not be confused with chocolate world, which is next door. I'll let it slide

840
01:04:30,512 --> 01:04:33,172
It's a new arrival

841
01:04:33,172 --> 01:04:39,832
Front gate 15th coaster restaurant bar patio ice cream parlor and confectionary scratch kitchen

842
01:04:39,832 --> 01:04:44,752
I think that's where they built, you know, either they make chocolate from scratch or you make it a

843
01:04:44,752 --> 01:04:48,212
2200 square foot starbucks store

844
01:04:48,512 --> 01:04:54,612
Uh the largest kettle cord location at Hershey park a one-of-a-kind kisses fountain a new

845
01:04:54,612 --> 01:04:58,812
Home for the hundred-year-old carousel and a flagship store

846
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:01,812
So they're redoing the entire entryway to the park

847
01:05:01,812 --> 01:05:08,312
And a new coaster and this new thing so big year for well, you're coming in hot like out of nowhere

848
01:05:08,312 --> 01:05:13,152
Hershey park having a mega year. Well, can I go right back to the ride real quick?

849
01:05:13,152 --> 01:05:19,112
Yes, uh the cup that stores love for chocolate, is that right? Yeah, this is the world's gathers

850
01:05:19,112 --> 01:05:25,592
Yeah, so I you know, all I have to go off of is this sentence, but I guess like

851
01:05:25,592 --> 01:05:28,692
Um, I don't know. I mean they hear us on this podcast

852
01:05:28,692 --> 01:05:33,132
Talking about treats and desserts and such and I guess that energy

853
01:05:33,132 --> 01:05:37,992
In a monstropolis type energy gathering situation somehow

854
01:05:37,992 --> 01:05:41,752
it comes out of our mouths or stomachs and

855
01:05:41,752 --> 01:05:45,192
Uh is filtered and flies through the air all the way to pennsylvania

856
01:05:45,192 --> 01:05:49,372
And it's all it all is stored in a cup and it powers

857
01:05:49,372 --> 01:05:54,732
It um, yes the Reese's factory is not powered by electricity

858
01:05:54,732 --> 01:05:59,952
Uh, it is powered by hand chocolate love chocolate and peanut butter love

859
01:05:59,952 --> 01:06:05,072
Yeah, which is which great by the way because a lot of bad global warming reports recently

860
01:06:05,072 --> 01:06:10,752
We need to find alternative energy and for sure the love of peanut butter and chocolate is fantastic

861
01:06:10,752 --> 01:06:16,172
And it's an endlessly renewable obviously right if jason were to go toward this thing

862
01:06:16,172 --> 01:06:23,812
Would it overheat and the whole place blow up because it couldn't store that much love for peanut butter and crystal is melting

863
01:06:23,812 --> 01:06:24,872
Yeah

864
01:06:24,872 --> 01:06:30,072
The cup is losing its shape. You get it. You understand now everything makes sense

865
01:06:30,072 --> 01:06:39,412
There's a crystal cup and if jason walked up to it it would shake and shatter because

866
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:44,552
His love is too strong his love is the strongest on all in earth of all earthlings

867
01:06:44,552 --> 01:06:49,472
He loves chocolate and peanut butter the most if that's probably true

868
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:51,172
I mean that's that might be true

869
01:06:51,172 --> 01:06:59,252
I mean in the way that we're saying that like some of the logic is off and ralph breaks the internet the the

870
01:06:59,252 --> 01:07:06,432
Logic behind this the game of the chocolate crystal is perfect and needs no more the crystal cup the crystal cup crystal cup

871
01:07:06,432 --> 01:07:09,372
So you're protecting it on the ride you're protecting it

872
01:07:09,372 --> 01:07:13,952
The I the only say the rest of the plot the crystal cup is under attack

873
01:07:13,952 --> 01:07:16,412
I can't even get through that sentence. I'm so choked up

874
01:07:16,412 --> 01:07:22,752
Yeah, these bastards are trying to take the cup in their own hands. The league of misfit candy. Is that right?

875
01:07:22,812 --> 01:07:27,592
That's right. They're all they are also candy but like I guess

876
01:07:27,592 --> 01:07:34,652
Weird they're bad. What's the thing from uh, uh voodoo donuts the the the box of uh, oh a bucket of misshapen

877
01:07:34,652 --> 01:07:38,892
They're like a bucket of misshapen. They're all weird and they are not chocolate or peanut butter

878
01:07:38,892 --> 01:07:42,772
Which is the only thing that the only things that Reese's traffics in well

879
01:07:42,772 --> 01:07:47,732
Yeah, I first off I think the bucket of misshapen are benevolent creatures

880
01:07:47,732 --> 01:07:51,632
but I could see the the

881
01:07:51,632 --> 01:07:54,072
the enemies being like

882
01:07:54,072 --> 01:08:00,492
Mary janes or burnt peanuts or circus pete like these sort of uh candies like oh

883
01:08:00,492 --> 01:08:07,952
I don't want this if you go trick or treating they're like they're weird like novelty flavors that taste taste like poop or like, you know

884
01:08:07,952 --> 01:08:12,812
Black licorice with chili spice. Yeah, they're they're like nightmare flavors

885
01:08:12,812 --> 01:08:18,492
Maybe they should be like call them like bad and plentees like if there's some bad and plenty

886
01:08:18,492 --> 01:08:22,432
You gotta watch out for mean and plentees

887
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:24,852
Mike and spike he's mean

888
01:08:24,852 --> 01:08:27,292
There are a couple heavies

889
01:08:27,292 --> 01:08:30,732
I would think there would be like grandma candy like wrapped

890
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:36,212
Boring sort of wrapped candies in a big dish or something. Oh that are kind of like

891
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:41,012
Sedate and like not is they're they're all time. Is this sure?

892
01:08:41,232 --> 01:08:44,972
What is the flavor even they've been in there forever? They're 30 years old

893
01:08:44,972 --> 01:08:50,472
They're like where there's a particular type of like chalky mint andy's mints. Oh, maybe yeah

894
01:08:50,472 --> 01:08:52,552
Don't you say a thing about andy's mints?

895
01:08:52,552 --> 01:08:56,832
He loves I do like andy well, I think i'm probably thinking something worse than what you're talking about

896
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:59,812
There's like if you leave them for a while. I see. Yeah, okay

897
01:08:59,812 --> 01:09:06,052
Well, it's some bad grandma candy. They're bitter about having been trapped in a in a

898
01:09:06,052 --> 01:09:10,432
Vase for so long and they want in on that rhesus factory

899
01:09:10,432 --> 01:09:18,652
They want the cups power for themselves. So along the way you must zap the league of misfit candy members and save the factory

900
01:09:19,252 --> 01:09:23,592
Which I like that that's good jason getting there and being like

901
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:25,152
military precision

902
01:09:25,152 --> 01:09:29,552
Super driven like yelling at other people for not firing enough

903
01:09:29,552 --> 01:09:35,792
Oh 11 year old jason would have been all in on that and also 33 year old jason is all in on that

904
01:09:35,792 --> 01:09:38,772
Like slapping your dad in the face for not

905
01:09:38,772 --> 01:09:43,312
Not taking it seriously if it didn't go well, though. I think you'd be like everyone out of the car

906
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:44,472
I'm doing this alone

907
01:09:44,512 --> 01:09:49,432
I'll take care of all of these taking all the guns operating them with his toes when I get back

908
01:09:49,432 --> 01:09:52,252
You're all being court marshalled perfect score

909
01:09:52,252 --> 01:09:58,852
Let's hope that the crystal cup is never under siege again so that you sorry

910
01:09:58,852 --> 01:10:02,572
Sex of shit don't have to be part of this army again

911
01:10:02,572 --> 01:10:09,472
You have to wear your general's outfit too. Yeah on the ride. This is I can't believe how much

912
01:10:09,472 --> 01:10:12,452
Came from two sentences about this

913
01:10:12,452 --> 01:10:19,372
This is this is like meaty there's a there's a thick chocolate center to this little paragraph about Reese's cup fusion

914
01:10:19,372 --> 01:10:21,852
Wow, maybe this is my new

915
01:10:21,852 --> 01:10:25,852
VIP of the year. This is you like referring to

916
01:10:25,852 --> 01:10:33,092
Mr. Toad is the underground brian eno of right? This is this is the cool. This is the eno of 2019

917
01:10:33,092 --> 01:10:40,172
Sure, yeah new and experimental and using bizarre words that don't roll off the tongue at all lots of exciting things going on in

918
01:10:40,172 --> 01:10:48,252
Pennsylvania also getting the first branded cartoon network hotel right outside of dutch wonderland. This is a smaller

919
01:10:48,252 --> 01:10:52,732
Kid-friendly theme park not too far from Hershey

920
01:10:52,732 --> 01:11:02,732
Yeah, it's an interesting spot for them to test out a cart, you know adventure time powerpuff girl cartoon network themed

921
01:11:02,732 --> 01:11:10,152
Hotel, but certainly there is

922
01:11:10,152 --> 01:11:13,732
I'm curious to see how that goes defunct land recently had a

923
01:11:13,732 --> 01:11:15,672
an episode about the

924
01:11:15,672 --> 01:11:16,492
Long-gone

925
01:11:16,492 --> 01:11:21,272
Nickelodeon themed hotel in Orlando, which was interesting terribly unpleasant

926
01:11:21,272 --> 01:11:25,612
Yeah, it seemed like it had some popularity

927
01:11:25,612 --> 01:11:28,772
But then like a lot of these things you got to keep them updated

928
01:11:28,772 --> 01:11:33,812
And if you're not doing that people kind of gravitate away from it. I know it's kind of

929
01:11:33,812 --> 01:11:35,052
off of

930
01:11:35,052 --> 01:11:39,752
Cartoon network, but still every restaurant in that place better be packed with szechuan sauce

931
01:11:40,192 --> 01:11:46,612
They're in a lot of trouble. Well, it's not adult swim. No, no, sure after dark, but they're related. Oh, yes power

932
01:11:46,612 --> 01:11:50,252
Right. There you go past 10 o'clock, right then szechuan sauce comes out

933
01:11:50,252 --> 01:11:55,032
Of szechuan sauce. Mm-hmm. Jesus the police department is gonna hate that

934
01:11:55,032 --> 01:12:00,612
Hotels gonna constantly be getting swatted by people not getting their szechuan sauce

935
01:12:00,612 --> 01:12:04,692
Overrun is gonna be closed in two months. Yeah

936
01:12:04,692 --> 01:12:08,352
What else do we got? Hey right here back in California?

937
01:12:08,412 --> 01:12:10,612
And at at our

938
01:12:10,612 --> 01:12:12,452
increasingly beloved knots

939
01:12:12,452 --> 01:12:17,512
We are getting an overlay of the the rapids ride

940
01:12:17,512 --> 01:12:22,652
It is now going to be calico river rapids and they're going to be

941
01:12:22,652 --> 01:12:26,532
Animatronics on this thing is going to be a big old big foot

942
01:12:26,532 --> 01:12:34,292
I'm really excited about this show scenes rapids with show scenes show scenes and tying it into the

943
01:12:34,292 --> 01:12:36,472
mythology of everything else

944
01:12:36,472 --> 01:12:39,132
Which is what i'm very excited about too. Yeah

945
01:12:39,132 --> 01:12:44,252
Uh, yeah, so because now it's calico. There's a calico mine already there, but now it's calico rapids

946
01:12:44,252 --> 01:12:49,832
So like that's all going to be in some big story universe. They're building as well, which is fantastic

947
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:55,552
And I love those rides and the animatronics are going to be done by garner holt who did all the animatronics for those other

948
01:12:55,552 --> 01:13:02,172
There for the refurbs of uh those places. So it's going to be like a I i'm so excited those two I have

949
01:13:02,372 --> 01:13:07,352
Those knots dark rides i'm so fond of yeah that there's essentially going to be a third

950
01:13:07,352 --> 01:13:13,832
now, uh, and it's also real, you know ups the game over at

951
01:13:13,832 --> 01:13:17,712
Grizzly river rapids at california venture, which is fine

952
01:13:17,712 --> 01:13:24,412
But there's not much going on theming wise and now you got a big foot to grapple with over at knots step it up dca

953
01:13:24,412 --> 01:13:25,432
Grizzly river run

954
01:13:25,432 --> 01:13:30,652
What grizzly river run? It's not rapids. It's a run grizzly river run

955
01:13:30,652 --> 01:13:32,872
Yeah, I would have had to double check that

956
01:13:32,872 --> 01:13:40,612
Somebody just told me that there is a rapid ride. No. No, wait, there's a there's bare animatronics on a ride

957
01:13:40,612 --> 01:13:41,832
in

958
01:13:41,832 --> 01:13:48,172
Maybe it's not a rapid ride. Maybe it's like they're it's like big thunder in hong kong. Yes. Yeah. Yeah

959
01:13:48,172 --> 01:13:52,932
There's a there's a crazy animatronic on that thing. Yeah. Yeah. Well, maybe i'll save it for that

960
01:13:52,932 --> 01:13:57,832
It looks almost exactly like the one we have except with a big crazy. Yeah

961
01:13:58,512 --> 01:14:01,252
Discovered that interesting that is yeah, because it's called something

962
01:14:01,252 --> 01:14:07,632
It's a different kind of coaster different design sort of their their equivalent to big thunder in hong kong is very different

963
01:14:07,632 --> 01:14:11,832
So different episode not on the not discussed on the big thunder one

964
01:14:11,832 --> 01:14:18,552
What I think on on our live episode tony baxter talked about how he and his buddies just sit around and talk about how to fix knots

965
01:14:18,552 --> 01:14:24,152
And I feel like maybe the solution is slowly re theming all the rides to tie it into

966
01:14:24,152 --> 01:14:31,272
A one narrative or into a similar narrative one big old story just one year to like each year you re theme like

967
01:14:31,272 --> 01:14:33,472
What's that horse ride where you're on a horse?

968
01:14:34,092 --> 01:14:37,972
A pony express pony express. It's calico pony express now

969
01:14:37,972 --> 01:14:43,732
Because they that ghost town alive interactive thing has been very successful for them, too

970
01:14:43,732 --> 01:14:47,332
Um, and I believe that ties into the calico mythology

971
01:14:47,332 --> 01:14:53,592
Yeah, the calico the calico extended universe. I love that. I'm in yeah

972
01:14:54,152 --> 01:14:59,752
In general what i'm looking for in 2019. There's not a lot of details, but i'm looking forward to haunts in 2019

973
01:14:59,752 --> 01:15:06,032
I'm looking forward to mazes. I'm looking forward to scare actors. I'm looking i'm gonna do horror nights

974
01:15:06,032 --> 01:15:08,032
I'm gonna do not scary again

975
01:15:08,032 --> 01:15:13,672
And we'll see what else i'm excited about that because that will result in episodes where I

976
01:15:13,672 --> 01:15:17,712
Do no research and I just listen to you. That's true. That sounds great

977
01:15:17,852 --> 01:15:22,872
So I ain't going i'm going on after haunt jason, what do you can you declare right now?

978
01:15:22,932 --> 01:15:25,292
Will you go with me to haunts or will you not?

979
01:15:25,692 --> 01:15:31,572
I'm like 50 50 right now. So you're not even you won't even commit to partial like going to a couple

980
01:15:31,572 --> 01:15:40,112
But I thought even 50 50 on even if i'm going or not, uh, i'm definitely not going all in like you

981
01:15:40,112 --> 01:15:47,452
I think I would check out a little more. I think i'm just gonna go a little gradually a little exposure therapy for me

982
01:15:48,412 --> 01:15:51,312
So, uh, what do you think you would start with? What do you think?

983
01:15:52,152 --> 01:15:56,052
Would you do horror nights or would you want to go back to knots and do half the mazes?

984
01:15:56,312 --> 01:16:03,332
A little more of knots. Okay. I think horror nights is a bit pricey for my taste

985
01:16:03,332 --> 01:16:06,032
Uh, okay now I see

986
01:16:06,032 --> 01:16:11,152
Now I see what the real problem is here. You're scared of the money. Yeah, I don't know. I'm also

987
01:16:11,152 --> 01:16:13,252
Dollars jumping out of your pocket

988
01:16:13,512 --> 01:16:15,532
You know what I didn't do this year I

989
01:16:15,532 --> 01:16:20,632
Was built right next to boney island and has been there a lot longer the ghost train

990
01:16:20,632 --> 01:16:26,052
Which I think is a more whimsical. Oh, sure sort of thing, but also a little more sinister

991
01:16:26,052 --> 01:16:27,932
So I'm curious about that

992
01:16:27,932 --> 01:16:31,352
In terms of like big e tickets that we haven't addressed

993
01:16:31,352 --> 01:16:38,192
There's a new harry potter roller coaster coming and I think for my money. I mean, i'm very excited about the star wars

994
01:16:38,192 --> 01:16:43,192
stuff coming but i'm a little that's tempered by the uh,

995
01:16:43,952 --> 01:16:49,812
Crowd predictions like and nervousness about the infrastructure holding out. Yeah, but this harry potter coaster

996
01:16:49,812 --> 01:16:56,072
Looks like it could be incredible scott. I think I alluded to this on another show

997
01:16:56,072 --> 01:16:59,872
This isn't just a launch coaster. This is a multi launch coaster

998
01:16:59,872 --> 01:17:05,572
Oh boy what they're rivering about that this thing might launch you throughout the coaster, huh?

999
01:17:05,752 --> 01:17:07,292
and is is

1000
01:17:07,292 --> 01:17:11,432
Seems to be on trend with the predictions of what are coming like this is a coaster

1001
01:17:11,432 --> 01:17:17,132
But there are multiple show scenes. Uh, so you'll stop is the rumor. You'll stop. Oh

1002
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:20,112
And then interesting and then you'll shoot

1003
01:17:20,112 --> 01:17:27,192
Yeah, sounds cool. Yeah, that's that cool. I'm you know, i'm getting over. I think I have this is a fun little like

1004
01:17:27,192 --> 01:17:32,892
achievement if i've had I had I not been put into a corner by y'all and matt rogers and I felt like I had to

1005
01:17:32,892 --> 01:17:37,672
Overcome and I like I don't know. I think it truly as I've said before I think it was like a

1006
01:17:37,672 --> 01:17:40,792
Like a breathing issue and Aaron and Aaron pointed out

1007
01:17:42,612 --> 01:17:43,092
on

1008
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:47,112
In credit coaster, I I conquered it. I did it but even doing it a second time. I was

1009
01:17:47,112 --> 01:17:51,632
Re-nervous. I was nervous again, and she said you know what open your eyes

1010
01:17:51,632 --> 01:17:58,172
I think when you close your eyes, you are imagining worse than is happening, right and potentially getting more disoriented

1011
01:17:58,172 --> 01:18:02,372
Keep those eyes open. I breathe. I think it was a physical issue

1012
01:18:02,372 --> 01:18:07,472
And i've uh, I figured it out. So I don't know. I'm more i'm more launched down at this point

1013
01:18:07,472 --> 01:18:11,092
I like I always have liked the launches but I went on

1014
01:18:11,092 --> 01:18:14,472
Rock and roller coaster last march like two or three times

1015
01:18:14,472 --> 01:18:20,172
And the third time I do feel like my body fully got used to it and got comfortable on it again

1016
01:18:20,172 --> 01:18:23,732
So I like I felt the transition my body was making and I liked it all the times

1017
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:28,732
But the third time it was like pure joy as opposed to the first time which was fun

1018
01:18:28,732 --> 01:18:31,552
But I think I was like a little stiff a little whatever so like

1019
01:18:31,552 --> 01:18:36,192
I do think there is a lot of like your body being comfortable for some of these things

1020
01:18:36,192 --> 01:18:43,112
That's what I used to really like about the original version of the incredible hulk coaster is that there's dialogue and you can kind of know

1021
01:18:43,112 --> 01:18:46,052
What's coming when the dialogue is coming?

1022
01:18:46,112 --> 01:18:50,712
We have to figure out what the deal is and why we both had headaches on the new incredible hulk coaster

1023
01:18:50,712 --> 01:18:56,612
Yeah, because in theory it should be smoother. It should be much smoother. It's not I am a raise too many gamma rays

1024
01:18:56,612 --> 01:19:02,752
I also have not last time there's like hardly any story now. So that's kind of you think that's why you had a story

1025
01:19:02,752 --> 01:19:04,972
Your brain was an occupier disappointment

1026
01:19:05,452 --> 01:19:10,472
Uh, just for a personal thing scott. Do you have do you think it's possible to

1027
01:19:10,472 --> 01:19:14,112
Break mission breakout by the end of the year. Do you think that's even on the horizon?

1028
01:19:14,232 --> 01:19:15,612
I think it's a different thing

1029
01:19:15,612 --> 01:19:22,372
Uh, and erin was even honest with me. I was like feeling a little like braver and like maybe should I and she was like this is

1030
01:19:22,372 --> 01:19:25,972
This is this is a step above uh incredible coaster

1031
01:19:25,972 --> 01:19:31,552
uh, yeah, I think like I get pleasure out of the like once i'm past the launch and like

1032
01:19:31,552 --> 01:19:35,812
Uh, and if I can deal with the bigger drops I get pleasure out of all of it

1033
01:19:35,812 --> 01:19:41,072
I don't think when the one time I did a tower terror. I don't think I enjoyed any aspect of it

1034
01:19:41,072 --> 01:19:47,072
I just didn't like it the only reason i'm so pushy about it specifically and i've said this before it is

1035
01:19:47,072 --> 01:19:51,492
Of sensations on any of these thrill rides. It is my favorite sensation

1036
01:19:51,492 --> 01:19:58,072
On the roller coaster. I still get in places. I get tense or sometimes if the loop my head hurts a little bit or my

1037
01:19:58,072 --> 01:20:04,972
Stomach can't quite deal with it. I've gotten to the point now where the tower the towers it's pure fun for me

1038
01:20:04,972 --> 01:20:10,072
And like it doesn't like i'm not sore. I don't hurt like it's just so great

1039
01:20:10,072 --> 01:20:13,272
So, I don't know. Maybe i'm just different but I don't know. What do you do

1040
01:20:13,272 --> 01:20:18,252
Let me ask you. Do you like the sensation of a roller coaster more than you like the tower of terror?

1041
01:20:18,912 --> 01:20:19,432
oh

1042
01:20:19,432 --> 01:20:25,752
Um, or what what's your feeling? I don't know, you know, I don't really have a fear of heights

1043
01:20:25,752 --> 01:20:31,712
I do you do. Um, I think tower terror, especially florida

1044
01:20:31,712 --> 01:20:34,152
Yeah, I mean I just I like the dropping

1045
01:20:34,152 --> 01:20:41,592
I like hearing everyone screaming. I like the sensations and I like I I laugh through a lot of it. Yes

1046
01:20:41,592 --> 01:20:45,652
Uh, I just think it's delightful, but I do think I mean i'm not saying

1047
01:20:45,652 --> 01:20:50,052
Don't do it because i'm saying and have a panic attack and then i'm responsible but yeah

1048
01:20:50,052 --> 01:20:54,052
But I do think that's probably another like tense

1049
01:20:54,112 --> 01:21:00,372
Because I think initially I will say I think the tower the mission breakout will be easier because it's a launch

1050
01:21:00,372 --> 01:21:01,832
Oh sure as opposed to the other thing

1051
01:21:01,832 --> 01:21:07,912
So you won't even have as much time to tense up because I think that's you know, I I hated that on

1052
01:21:07,912 --> 01:21:09,652
Malabumer I hate

1053
01:21:09,652 --> 01:21:11,792
I did yes

1054
01:21:11,792 --> 01:21:14,292
To impress a girlfriend

1055
01:21:14,292 --> 01:21:18,972
Realized this in 2005. No, I did tower terror and

1056
01:21:18,972 --> 01:21:23,132
Oh, well, I did all of it but malabumers on outside

1057
01:21:23,772 --> 01:21:27,552
Yes, that that bothered me that that was my least favorite thing i've ever been

1058
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:31,552
I've never been on one of the outdoor ones like that and I would have I would flip out on that

1059
01:21:31,552 --> 01:21:36,892
Okay, neither of you ever done doctor dooms fear fall. No, what i'll do you don't know about the fear juice

1060
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,892
I know about the fear juice, but and I will look

1061
01:21:39,892 --> 01:21:43,832
He needs it to power his machine if we go in 2019

1062
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:46,092
I will do it with you

1063
01:21:46,092 --> 01:21:47,072
All right

1064
01:21:47,072 --> 01:21:51,332
I don't want to do it and I think that is for sure a different thing

1065
01:21:51,332 --> 01:21:56,212
Than being inside feeling jackson five playing and you're in a room

1066
01:21:56,212 --> 01:22:00,312
I would flip out if I shot up on the malabomer for sure. Sure. Sure

1067
01:22:00,312 --> 01:22:07,052
Yeah, pretty pretty like naked. Yeah, you're feeling you're falling through the sky. You fell out of a plane

1068
01:22:07,052 --> 01:22:11,372
We said I hate the dangling. I hate the legs dangling that bothers me

1069
01:22:11,372 --> 01:22:16,692
Back to the the harry potter coaster. I mean not a lot has been officially confirmed yet

1070
01:22:17,372 --> 01:22:27,212
but there's been enough people have pieced stuff together from like overhead pictures and uh, someone made a

1071
01:22:27,212 --> 01:22:33,552
emulation, uh, or what it would be in like a roller coaster simulator program

1072
01:22:33,552 --> 01:22:39,432
Uh, someone also I think it's orlando park stop. This is a very funny thing over the summer

1073
01:22:39,432 --> 01:22:46,912
They kind of like connected all the dots and they put up a blog post end video saying like well from what we all know

1074
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:48,572
And what the like?

1075
01:22:48,972 --> 01:22:53,912
Physical landscape is like this is probably what the coaster was and then apparently they got

1076
01:22:53,912 --> 01:23:00,252
Contacted by universal and said who leaked all this to you and they said no one leaked it

1077
01:23:00,252 --> 01:23:07,212
We just connected what was out there publicly and you have kind of de facto confirmed by confronting us

1078
01:23:07,212 --> 01:23:13,192
so, uh, yeah, uh, I'm still suspicious they somebody could have leaked someone could have leaked because it was

1079
01:23:13,412 --> 01:23:15,792
Very like they really seem to know

1080
01:23:15,792 --> 01:23:18,232
They were talking about who knows I don't know for sure

1081
01:23:18,232 --> 01:23:26,952
But it just but like multiple launches a backward section a drop section potentially where like the coaster drops

1082
01:23:26,952 --> 01:23:29,332
It's like just goes on another level or something

1083
01:23:29,332 --> 01:23:36,972
Set within the forbidden forest and hagrid will probably be there and some fantastical creatures

1084
01:23:36,972 --> 01:23:43,012
I think in terms of actual experiences. This is like might be one of the top ones coming

1085
01:23:43,012 --> 01:23:48,732
Yeah, that was quite a list you just gave that's all insane stuff and you gotta love like it's not this year

1086
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:53,772
but uh, you know, we're we're getting mario kart stuff soon and I'd like anything where you're getting like

1087
01:23:53,772 --> 01:23:57,252
New things a ride is never done. Yes

1088
01:23:57,252 --> 01:24:01,172
pretty cool because it's such as i've said like the what the

1089
01:24:01,172 --> 01:24:03,572
engineering and the military grade

1090
01:24:03,572 --> 01:24:07,672
Technology has to go into this stuff. You're getting like these new

1091
01:24:08,112 --> 01:24:14,792
Experiences that uh, like shouldn't exist and can only exist because of billions of dollars being spent. It's so cool

1092
01:24:14,792 --> 01:24:21,552
Yeah, the rye vehicles for mario kart and for the guardians of galaxy coaster. Yep are all like multi-directional

1093
01:24:21,552 --> 01:24:27,992
Things where you can do a roller coaster but flip people around they're they're very actually very similar now that I think about it

1094
01:24:27,992 --> 01:24:30,792
So I was reading that I was a little late to recording today

1095
01:24:30,792 --> 01:24:35,832
I was saying because I was reading about patent applications and apparently the difference

1096
01:24:35,832 --> 01:24:39,272
So disney has filed a patent application for a roller coaster

1097
01:24:39,272 --> 01:24:40,112
ride

1098
01:24:40,112 --> 01:24:47,752
That looks very similar to gringotts and they're like, oh what's the difference? Well with gringotts the way they rotate the cars

1099
01:24:47,752 --> 01:24:53,692
Like it can only be rotated like in that area because the ride itself

1100
01:24:53,692 --> 01:24:59,892
The vehicle is pulling power from like charging stations in that area disney's patent

1101
01:24:59,892 --> 01:25:01,492
would be

1102
01:25:01,492 --> 01:25:09,832
Uh, the the power is coming from an on-board like battery or generator, which means the cars could rotate in like

1103
01:25:09,832 --> 01:25:14,692
turns or tight corners that aren't possible with the current like

1104
01:25:14,692 --> 01:25:16,332
gringotts sort of

1105
01:25:16,332 --> 01:25:21,292
Technology so we could see an upgrade of that sort of thing in these

1106
01:25:21,292 --> 01:25:26,732
Storytelling coasters, I think was that's what bob chapec called the guardians again. We're talking about 2020

1107
01:25:26,732 --> 01:25:28,632
But yeah, it's a coaster that like

1108
01:25:28,632 --> 01:25:30,592
You could put up a lift hill

1109
01:25:30,592 --> 01:25:34,652
But then you could tilt the car to the left if there's like a show scene of some kind happening

1110
01:25:34,652 --> 01:25:37,552
I don't know how you do that if it's a screen or if it's robots

1111
01:25:37,552 --> 01:25:40,512
And then you could flip it back or flip it behind

1112
01:25:40,512 --> 01:25:44,952
So like it gives the thing such a range of motion the thing that was coolest on the mario

1113
01:25:44,952 --> 01:25:49,532
Well many cool things but was that you could tilt it's basically a roller coaster track

1114
01:25:49,532 --> 01:25:51,792
And then the car built on top of it

1115
01:25:51,792 --> 01:25:55,672
But you could tilt it so you could actually make it feel like you were doing jumps

1116
01:25:55,832 --> 01:25:59,212
Because you wouldn't be able to see the track because it was so far down

1117
01:25:59,212 --> 01:26:05,352
So you tilt the car up and then you'd look like you would jump over like, you know, whatever a big space

1118
01:26:05,352 --> 01:26:06,732
on a mario teetery

1119
01:26:06,732 --> 01:26:12,332
Bridge or something like ramps like you do in mario kart you essentially can do on this ride

1120
01:26:12,332 --> 01:26:15,212
Right, so you would yeah because you would not be able to see the track

1121
01:26:15,212 --> 01:26:20,092
You're not be able to see you were elevated and it would just feel like you were flying spin it like spin out

1122
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:25,332
As if someone wants to shell at you. Yeah, that's right. Oh, yeah, that's totally that pivot point

1123
01:26:25,332 --> 01:26:31,192
Or if you hate a banana peel like right. I mean i'm sure i'm i guess i'm not sure but

1124
01:26:31,192 --> 01:26:35,272
It remains to be seen how many cars can be on the track at once for mario kart

1125
01:26:35,272 --> 01:26:36,912
um, and then

1126
01:26:36,912 --> 01:26:41,312
But it's like if it was truly possible to have it be so

1127
01:26:41,312 --> 01:26:48,652
Flexible that with like augmented reality you could grab a shell and throw it and you could make cars spin out in real time

1128
01:26:48,652 --> 01:26:53,372
Oh, I mean, I don't know that they can do that, but i'm sure that was in a blue sky at some point

1129
01:26:53,372 --> 01:26:56,992
I think mario kart is a real like I don't want to say dark horse. That's a weird

1130
01:26:56,992 --> 01:26:59,532
Phrase because it's a big ride that's meant to be good

1131
01:26:59,532 --> 01:27:05,132
But I think it could sneak up in terms of and take over some Disney stuff for the best ride that exists currently

1132
01:27:05,132 --> 01:27:09,452
Yeah from there's a leaked picture of that from a year or two ago

1133
01:27:09,452 --> 01:27:16,572
um, and if it's if it's like that if it looks like the track that was laid out in this picture like it's

1134
01:27:16,572 --> 01:27:19,852
I can't imagine you wouldn't I won't want to like live in there

1135
01:27:19,952 --> 01:27:26,352
Yeah, guys, isn't it cool being part of like a we truly are in like one of the golden ages of this stuff

1136
01:27:26,352 --> 01:27:27,532
Yes, yeah

1137
01:27:27,532 --> 01:27:33,852
many times I feel like and we kind of it's it's fun to be an adult and be like

1138
01:27:33,852 --> 01:27:37,552
Remembering the stuff from our childhoods, which was a golden age

1139
01:27:37,552 --> 01:27:42,972
Right, and then it was it's sort of in and out whether theme parks were doing a lot or good

1140
01:27:42,972 --> 01:27:49,372
Through up until now and now we clearly are in one of the best runs there's ever been. Yeah, I mean uh,

1141
01:27:49,412 --> 01:27:56,652
The patents that universal filed a patent recently universal filed a bunch of patents one of them similar to the

1142
01:27:56,652 --> 01:28:00,312
roller coasters that rotate for show scenes that are

1143
01:28:00,312 --> 01:28:02,312
Popular is seemingly getting popular

1144
01:28:02,312 --> 01:28:09,692
Was like a ray a log ride or raft ride where you would have you could rotate?

1145
01:28:10,252 --> 01:28:11,992
The raft for show scenes

1146
01:28:11,992 --> 01:28:19,112
So imagine the Jurassic and not on a track because the pirates ride in shanghai does rotate to little show sequences

1147
01:28:19,372 --> 01:28:26,092
That's got a track underneath it. This would use obstacles like in a rapids and presumably water direction to

1148
01:28:26,092 --> 01:28:27,752
rotate the boat

1149
01:28:27,752 --> 01:28:32,312
to show scene so even if like none of this stuff comes to pass and like

1150
01:28:32,312 --> 01:28:38,112
This patent is exactly 100 with the ride would be even using elements of this

1151
01:28:38,112 --> 01:28:41,672
In like next-gen rides. It could be incredible. There's rumors

1152
01:28:41,672 --> 01:28:44,312
of a full jungle book

1153
01:28:44,312 --> 01:28:50,932
Like thing over in world showcase or animal kingdom like it could be either one but like a full using the shanghai pirates

1154
01:28:50,932 --> 01:28:51,592
um

1155
01:28:51,592 --> 01:28:56,572
Uh technology for like boats that flip around and can change and stuff

1156
01:28:56,572 --> 01:29:03,252
But like a full like jungle like cgi jungle book thing which sounds awesome. Geez and all this on top of

1157
01:29:03,252 --> 01:29:09,352
a patent being filed to have to make a crystal cup that is power that is

1158
01:29:09,352 --> 01:29:12,072
Gathers the world's love for chocolate and peanut butter

1159
01:29:12,072 --> 01:29:15,992
Well, you don't need to file a patent to love

1160
01:29:15,992 --> 01:29:20,572
You just do it you just feel it

1161
01:29:20,572 --> 01:29:25,092
That's true, uh, i'll say that uh past looking past 2019

1162
01:29:25,092 --> 01:29:31,592
Disney in 2020 and 2021 has stuff like the guardians of galaxy coaster and epcot the ratatouille ride

1163
01:29:31,592 --> 01:29:38,192
Which coming to epcot and the tron coaster coming in magic kingdom, uh, which in my head I was like

1164
01:29:38,192 --> 01:29:41,312
Some of these are they've already built these in other parks

1165
01:29:41,312 --> 01:29:45,692
Why is it taking so long the answer being the 50th anniversary of disney world is coming up?

1166
01:29:45,832 --> 01:29:49,552
So they're clearly trying to stack the decks for that. Yeah. Yeah

1167
01:29:49,552 --> 01:29:56,092
I was just gonna add about that guardians coaster at epcot that I think what did he say you can fit three spaceships earth

1168
01:29:56,092 --> 01:30:01,632
Spaceship earths inside the building or something or is it more like fights like a huge building

1169
01:30:01,632 --> 01:30:03,952
So like the roller coaster is getting big. Yeah

1170
01:30:03,972 --> 01:30:10,012
Um, yeah, there's a lot of a lot of crazy stuff and then what's good about it the future is that

1171
01:30:10,012 --> 01:30:13,532
Uh, and this is only for theme parks not in the future in general

1172
01:30:13,532 --> 01:30:21,192
That's all bad. But theme park future good, uh is that universal seems very aggressive, especially in orlando

1173
01:30:21,192 --> 01:30:24,812
Which is going to hopefully keep this arms race going

1174
01:30:24,812 --> 01:30:30,252
Yeah for a little while they have to compete with island h2o live water park

1175
01:30:30,252 --> 01:30:37,172
Right and in general sunset walk and the entire margaritaville establishment this could run universal into the ground

1176
01:30:37,172 --> 01:30:44,572
Two water parks in orlando with rfid based wristbands that only kind of work. Can you imagine?

1177
01:30:46,072 --> 01:30:51,272
Yeah, everyone's on the run golden age, uh, uh, we're in it. Well, we're very excited

1178
01:30:51,272 --> 01:30:56,552
It's gonna be a great 2019 and hopefully for this podcast as well

1179
01:30:56,652 --> 01:31:01,672
Uh, we have some we have some fun ideas already. I feel like of stuff that's got like more

1180
01:31:01,672 --> 01:31:09,192
More theme months and more more garbage. Hopefully we get to rent another live show. I have like a lot of

1181
01:31:09,192 --> 01:31:14,832
Big ideas that I don't know if they'll come to fruition, but at least if a couple of them do

1182
01:31:14,832 --> 01:31:21,012
That'll be fun. We won't say what those are but there'll be some live shows. There'll be some you know new stuff

1183
01:31:21,012 --> 01:31:25,932
Oh, yeah fun stuff behind the second gate the stuff for the patreon episodes

1184
01:31:25,952 --> 01:31:27,352
Yeah, um

1185
01:31:27,352 --> 01:31:29,972
and remember that our

1186
01:31:29,972 --> 01:31:33,972
Podcasts and our microphones are powered by your love

1187
01:31:33,972 --> 01:31:39,092
So we need to hear it. We need your emails podcast the right gmail

1188
01:31:39,092 --> 01:31:44,952
We need your itunes reviews those really spike those really make the crystal cup

1189
01:31:44,952 --> 01:31:49,352
That's in the center of the room while we record the podcast go nuts

1190
01:31:49,352 --> 01:31:51,732
Uh, and yes, but unlike

1191
01:31:51,732 --> 01:31:55,732
Hershey's chocolate, which we know is powered by the crystal cup

1192
01:31:55,932 --> 01:32:02,532
No one has any idea how the itunes charts works. They are a mystery and perplexing

1193
01:32:02,532 --> 01:32:08,992
And no way to tame them who knew there were this many video game podcasts coded as games and hobbies

1194
01:32:08,992 --> 01:32:13,752
Now you're bitter at the other. Yeah, you're mad about that. I'm just more confused

1195
01:32:13,752 --> 01:32:21,932
Uh, yeah, well, uh, we need maybe we need to be like the league of misfit candy and uh,

1196
01:32:21,932 --> 01:32:25,712
