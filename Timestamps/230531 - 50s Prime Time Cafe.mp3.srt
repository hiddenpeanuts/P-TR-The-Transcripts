1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,240
Okay, welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,560
Pull up a seat everybody, I'm Ant Scott.

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,640
Let me introduce the kids, there's Jason over there.

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,840
Hey, no slouching, no slouching Jason.

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,600
Oh, get off my case, Ant Scott.

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,120
Well, you're not gonna get dessert

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,480
if you would talk back like that.

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,320
Yes, I am.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,120
Ah, whoa, I'll kick you out of my kitchen, I don't care.

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,540
I should be so lucky.

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,720
We, and there's Mike over there.

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,160
Hey Mike, elbows off your microphone.

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,000
Take the elbows off the mic.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,120
Oh, I wanna put my elbows on a microphone.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,560
It's not polite Mike etiquette, okay?

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,320
Oh, what a fiddlesticks.

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,600
Now you sit tight and watch Dick Van Dyke.

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,840
And you boys, both of you, finish your dry facts

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,360
or no riffing, okay?

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,440
Oh, look what Rosemarie is up to on this one.

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,800
Okay, that counts, that's a dry fact.

23
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,160
You're saying the name of an old ad, that counts.

24
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,120
Okay, that's fine, you're off to a good start.

25
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,320
Okay, let me know if you need anything else.

26
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,720
Hey guys, we're talking about the 50s

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,720
primetime cafe where that's an amended sample

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,200
of the kind of thing you might hear.

29
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,920
I think I haven't been myself.

30
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,480
Yes. We'll get into this.

31
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,840
Oh, here you go, take the ball and run.

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,880
Well, I was just gonna say, I went when I was little

33
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,800
and I have no memory of it.

34
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,320
But yeah, I'll just say this.

35
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,560
I think it's good we're doing this

36
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,020
and we haven't just reviewed it.

37
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,960
I found that, because I know people will probably say,

38
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,520
oh, they should have gone to it and they should have reviewed

39
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,960
it, I don't think so, because I think we need to do

40
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,560
a pre talk before, because I do want to eventually go,

41
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,880
when we go back to Disney World, I was like, oh,

42
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,800
I should do this, because then we can talk about it.

43
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,600
Sure, but this is more, look, this is the kind of thing

44
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,000
I think we're allowed to do.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,840
Oh yeah, for sure.

46
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,640
We're not a restaurant review podcast,

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,840
we're a themed experience review podcast.

48
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,960
So we can analyze what the experience is

49
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,960
and whether or not we think we'd like it.

50
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,560
And yeah, there's food there, but it's within

51
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,640
a broader umbrella of theme, right?

52
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,760
There we go, get off our backs.

53
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,000
Here's what I wanted to say that I think is important

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,760
and maybe this is gonna take us right off the rails.

55
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,440
I'm watching all this, I'm reading this stuff

56
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,200
and I'm like, man, you know what?

57
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,400
This place gives me the creeps.

58
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,840
Really?

59
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,120
Because I think about it pretty warmly.

60
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,560
My family, I checked with my dad, I was like,

61
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,520
we went there, right?

62
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,500
And he's like, yeah, we went on that trip we took

63
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,280
where we took your grandparents to

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,840
and we all ate there and they were really tickled by it.

65
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,320
And that was 1991 and we have not been back.

66
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,360
We became a Mama Melrose family

67
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,680
and occasionally sci-fi died in.

68
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,400
We're a Mama Melrose family.

69
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,320
Yeah, everyone liked that and everyone could agree on it.

70
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,600
So, and it's very cold in there.

71
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,040
Oh, and the Orlando sun, it's a little more pleasant

72
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,280
than shoveling down meatloaf and pot roast mashed potatoes

73
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,720
in 100 degree weather.

74
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,440
That might be the case, but we don't know the temperature

75
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,840
and that's one thing we cannot, having not been recently,

76
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,100
it might be plenty cool in there.

77
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,360
We can't rest a judgment.

78
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,120
Well, right, and that's gonna be in whenever we have

79
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,760
a follow-up episode because yeah,

80
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,480
when I say this place gives me the creeps,

81
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,480
I'm like, I would like to experience and see

82
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,200
if it does feel as bad as it looks to me now.

83
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,440
I watched a number of vloggers go

84
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,480
and all of them preface their meal with like,

85
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,960
look, this food isn't amazing,

86
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,040
but it's all right, it's pretty good.

87
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,120
Yeah.

88
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,580
This is, look, I have read opinions all over the map

89
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,040
on this subject.

90
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,400
That might be what I would guess,

91
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,640
but then I've read kind of the opposite.

92
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,760
Let's finish our dry facts before we go much further.

93
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,360
This is a restaurant, it was an opening day restaurant,

94
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,640
I believe, at Disney MGM Studios,

95
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,560
which I will never stop calling it, Hollywood Studios today.

96
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,800
And it's in kind of the like,

97
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,200
it's pretty early as you're entering the park

98
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,000
and kind of like the general studio,

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,440
before things get too themed, I feel.

100
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,440
And the general deal with this is,

101
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,720
I guess there's a couple things to say about the theming

102
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,080
and what this experience is

103
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,080
beyond being a restaurant in the park.

104
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,360
It is themed after 1950s kitchens.

105
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,880
So every table that you sit at is a little miniature set

106
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,000
of a 1950s kitchen, and those kind of like,

107
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,720
weave in and out of each other.

108
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,560
Right, yeah.

109
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,000
And every table, maybe not the very small ones,

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,440
but at least a table of four has a TV

111
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,200
that is playing a medley of classic moments

112
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,740
from 1950s television.

113
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,520
So we got that much right.

114
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,960
But I would say that the headline aspect of it, to me,

115
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,520
has always been that the server does what I did

116
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,080
at the beginning of the episode.

117
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,920
They are a family member who is nagging you

118
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,180
about your behavior at the table

119
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,560
and whether or not you finished your vegetables

120
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,000
and are using the right fork or whatever.

121
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,100
So it's like, you're back into the 50s,

122
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,240
but also into like the time of the housewife

123
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,480
who's concerned about manners and no desserts

124
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,360
until you finish your veggies and all that.

125
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,080
Does that explain it succinctly?

126
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,920
Yeah.

127
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,160
It's a Disney version of the server yells at you thing.

128
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,080
Yeah, Edna Bebex or Dick Slaster.

129
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,920
Dick Slaster's word, yeah.

130
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,760
Dick Slaster's word, of course,

131
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,160
the famous Dick in his last resort.

132
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,000
Uh-huh.

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,440
So you could join the-

134
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,280
The real Bill Dick.

135
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,360
If you eat everything, you get in the clean plate club,

136
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,080
you got a little sticker.

137
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,280
What a club, I know I'd be ashamed I have not joined it.

138
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,120
Yeah.

139
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,240
It sounds like the club 33 of a clean plate club.

140
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,000
Sure, yeah.

141
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,420
But if you're bad, I saw videos

142
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,520
where someone had to go stand in a corner.

143
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,720
Great.

144
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,400
Now let me, okay.

145
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,240
Now that we've said some of these basics

146
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,480
and some of the things that might happen to you

147
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,880
in the restaurant, I might kind of double up

148
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,720
on what you were saying, Mike,

149
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,720
and say that I've never been to this place

150
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,600
and I never had any desire to go to this.

151
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,640
But when I heard about it in like a hotel information video

152
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,960
or whatever's giving you a preview,

153
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,800
the burn bombs guide to the park,

154
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,800
I think I specifically requested not to go to this place.

155
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,800
I, as a child, I hated the idea of an extra mom.

156
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,600
Why would you want that?

157
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,280
Who is a stranger?

158
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,400
I am being double parented right now.

159
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,520
I, and man, I could be, by the way,

160
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,960
I could be terribly wrong.

161
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,200
I might go to this place now and like it, appreciate it.

162
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,000
But as a child, I was like, please no.

163
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,680
Please do not make me do this.

164
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,280
Yeah, well, I think my primary reason

165
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,140
for saying this, Chris, is not necessarily

166
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,220
the interactive element, which I will agree with you

167
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,240
in some ways that it's not always what I'm looking for.

168
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,080
I would say it is not ever what I'm looking for.

169
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,120
Anywhere, there's, you know, you encounter this with like,

170
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,440
you know, the Star Wars, Galaxy's Edge,

171
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,120
they cut a lot of the character interaction

172
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,720
and I'm just quietly like, yeah, too bad they cut that.

173
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,560
I wouldn't want it.

174
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,880
I'm fine, I don't want to do this.

175
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,080
I've had a good time, like maybe once every three years

176
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,520
in something where I have to talk to a character,

177
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,000
but that's about my pace.

178
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,920
It's a little immersive, that terrifying immersive theater

179
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,280
that even took us through that one time.

180
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,800
Yeah, that was interesting.

181
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,160
But I had to take a deep breath

182
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,960
in the moment where it became clear

183
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,600
that there are now characters meandering around this space.

184
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,440
Now that you say this,

185
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,320
we really have to do this all together

186
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,400
because I would like to see what happens

187
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,320
with Jason and Second Mommy.

188
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,600
I would like to see what exactly is unlocked

189
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,960
because I think you would like that.

190
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,280
I think, yeah, I think I'm going in lucky.

191
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,400
I'm a big gravy boy, you know?

192
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,680
I might be a little stinker,

193
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,720
I might be a little wooden boy,

194
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,360
but I'm a big time gravy boy.

195
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,760
You're not a little gravy boy,

196
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,560
you're a big gravy boy. No, not at all means.

197
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,560
I like my food very wet with sauces, not with condensation.

198
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,200
Would you agree with me that you're Mama's little gravy boy?

199
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,800
I'll be Mama's little gravy boy, yeah, sure.

200
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,520
Okay, when you're at Mommy's table,

201
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,520
you'll be whatever Mommy tells you you are.

202
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,920
Sure.

203
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,440
I also, I like the sampler platter they have,

204
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,760
which has like the backstory that it's like,

205
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,480
oh, it's a plate, it's Mom's favorites,

206
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,560
but it's like a plate of leftovers that was in the fridge.

207
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,560
So you get pot roast and meatloaf and fried chicken.

208
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,280
But then when you see the video,

209
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,960
it's like, oh, I thought this would be a task,

210
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,360
but it's like, oh, it's a little

211
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,440
reasonable scoop of everything, you know?

212
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,920
Okay, well yeah, we're not in Mike's zone

213
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,760
of the pre-airport family style.

214
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,120
No, it's not. Thankfully,

215
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,960
they portioned it out.

216
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,880
They were smart.

217
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,720
I think we could go and I think you could get one

218
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,840
of the servers to like quit their, quit her job on site

219
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,560
if you committed to the bit of being her son.

220
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,680
I mean, look, I will, I will.

221
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,520
You show up in like the night before Christmas stocking cap

222
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,000
and like underwear, like butt flap on a nightgown

223
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,840
or whatever.

224
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,880
Oh.

225
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,720
Well.

226
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,880
When she, well, anyway,

227
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,120
there are all restaurants quitting

228
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,960
if they see somebody with a butt flap walking by.

229
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,440
That's too much, you're right.

230
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,640
It's indecent.

231
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,040
But like maybe like propeller hat

232
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,080
and then like striped shirt, big lolly.

233
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,920
Yeah.

234
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,800
And then like little Mickey's little red shorts

235
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,000
kind of a thing.

236
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,320
Well, he's broadcasting.

237
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,000
He comes in, all of this is presenting a challenge.

238
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,480
Then the big lolly is defiant to mommy.

239
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,320
Right, yes.

240
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,880
That he would come in with outside food and outside sweets,

241
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,920
which are gonna get way in the way of his dinner.

242
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah, my mouth's gonna be a mess.

243
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,680
There's gonna be stuff all over.

244
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,160
There's gonna be food in my cheeks.

245
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,760
My cheeks are gonna be too rosy.

246
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,600
They're gonna yell at me

247
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,200
for not putting on enough sunscreen.

248
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,840
Mommy, my cheeks are sticky from sunscreen and sucker.

249
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,880
And now bits of meatloaf are sticking to me.

250
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,800
I'm your little dirty boy today, mommy.

251
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,000
I was gravy boy yesterday, but I am dirty boy today.

252
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,400
And then the woman just like performer

253
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,480
just like breaks character, throws the apron down.

254
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,320
We're done here.

255
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,360
We're done here, I'm done here.

256
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,520
If there's gonna be somewhere else in this goddamn park,

257
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,720
I can work and if not, I'm heading to Universal.

258
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,760
If you recall when we did Delusion.

259
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,760
I recall exactly what you're gonna say.

260
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,320
Yeah, we ran into one of the actors

261
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,240
from the experience afterwards, like in the bar,

262
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,880
like cleaning up and getting ready to go home

263
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,080
or wasn't on the street.

264
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,400
There were two interactions where performers told you

265
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,960
you were difficult during the situation.

266
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,080
You were difficult.

267
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,520
And I was like, well, hold on, ma'am,

268
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,880
you were playing a Nazi and you did have a Luger

269
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,520
to my head at one point.

270
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,280
So like, I thought I was playing along.

271
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,240
This is like immersive like narrative

272
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,320
where we went back in time and we had to turn a robot on

273
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,360
and there was a bomb, Delusion, the big blade.

274
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,800
And Jason thought that it was more like

275
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,000
we're improvising dialogue with the performers

276
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,760
versus we're sort of just following people along

277
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,560
a narrative of a set, you know,

278
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,360
bunch of lines that they say.

279
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
We're just following that.

280
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,880
Jason, I think was under the impression

281
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,240
that this was some sort of interactive thing

282
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,680
where we could influence the actual story.

283
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,000
We could not influence the story.

284
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,080
And he learned that when he tried to like,

285
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,920
instead of just like quick follow me

286
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,680
and he's like, you got a light Mac?

287
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,480
He like did like a weird old time voice.

288
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,880
And then just the performers stopped dead.

289
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,080
The performer did not know what to do.

290
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,440
Like looking around like,

291
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,920
this has never happened before.

292
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,440
Everyone just follows me through to this next room.

293
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,680
Most of the people doing this performance are usually,

294
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,600
like it's not somebody who wishes they lived

295
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,800
in the time period that we are conveying.

296
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,880
Two different performers, I think approached you perhaps.

297
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,720
You.

298
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,120
And they were like, what the, what was that?

299
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,720
So I think you were under the impression

300
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,040
that it was a different thing to your credit.

301
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,960
Sure, yeah.

302
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,840
No, I thought you were supposed to do like the,

303
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,640
you'll never take us alive, man.

304
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,880
Yeah, you thought you were, yeah, yeah.

305
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,720
Lady?

306
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,440
Right, but they were like, look, we got six more groups.

307
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,360
This is the last show of the night.

308
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,960
You were the second to the last group.

309
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,600
And I have a software job to get to tomorrow morning.

310
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,280
I have a day job.

311
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,120
I lost my place of the lines in my mind

312
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,640
when you did that, kid.

313
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,880
This is how much Jason's heart cannot harbor hate.

314
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,280
He can't even handle a fake Nazi in front of him.

315
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,120
No.

316
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,240
You give it right back to him.

317
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,080
Sure.

318
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,880
Not even pretend, sir or madam.

319
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,760
So I think though mother at the 50s primetime cafe

320
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,240
will be more interactive.

321
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,800
Cause she has to be, she has to be,

322
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,120
she doesn't have just a set script.

323
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,720
She knows she has her, you know, main things she says,

324
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,040
but she's going to have to be improvising the whole time,

325
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,880
the whole meal.

326
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,720
Yeah.

327
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,160
But she's never faced a challenger like Jason before.

328
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,000
That's true.

329
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,840
That's true.

330
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,560
Again, we're talking, we're getting towards the era

331
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,720
that you would like.

332
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,000
We're getting towards a back to you,

333
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,280
heading back in the womb direction.

334
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,640
Yeah.

335
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,880
Being a little, little dinner boy.

336
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
It is not, it is not reality.

337
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,000
It's the reality that exists in a television or movie screen.

338
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,520
Also what you'd prefer.

339
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,720
Scott, as a nervous child,

340
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,320
I think I was more along the lines of you.

341
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,240
I was like, oh, they're going to yell at me at this place.

342
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,320
And I was like, thank God there's four adults here

343
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,240
to take the attention, you know.

344
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,200
This is you at six.

345
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,720
You, this is me.

346
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,080
This is all a latter day Jason transformation.

347
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,760
You weren't eating it up at six.

348
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,600
No, I was probably a little precocious,

349
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,680
but like the level they would like,

350
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,360
as opposed to 37 year old annoying,

351
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,360
which I am now a lot, as I've been told sometimes.

352
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,440
Sadly drifts off.

353
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,600
But it's real.

354
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,960
Mostly immersive performers.

355
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,360
Mostly immersive performers, people of my life,

356
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,840
castmates, coworkers, you know.

357
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,800
But yeah, I, and I think, well,

358
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,560
I think my interest was always too, like,

359
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,240
I always wanted to go to a drive-in movie theater.

360
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,800
So like a drive-in movie theater inside

361
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,520
where they give you milkshakes, like.

362
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,200
They don't give them to you to pay for them,

363
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,480
but yes, otherwise.

364
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,320
Yeah, sure.

365
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,160
I'm not sure with your parents.

366
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,320
You're missing words, but yeah.

367
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,320
I, yeah, well, I don't know.

368
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,080
I would like to see, I mean,

369
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,080
I'm going to be silent in this,

370
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,000
I think you and I might sit back and watch.

371
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,840
That's fine.

372
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,360
I think we were like, almost like we're

373
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,080
on the crew of a play.

374
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,520
We just were all black,

375
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,840
sort of just kind of keep quiet in the background.

376
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,640
Kind of subtly indicates we're not even.

377
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

378
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,600
You're not meant to see us.

379
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,400
Exactly, so we're trying to observe more

380
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,520
and then Jason is fully on display

381
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,680
as whatever version of little boy,

382
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,880
little gravy boy he wants to portray.

383
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,120
These are my dad's.

384
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,880
They're, do you remember the sprocket sketch?

385
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,720
Sketch when I say that.

386
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,560
No, but thank you.

387
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,720
But then we have to be related to mommy.

388
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,400
You have to play it like she's your actual mother.

389
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,080
But they're aunts, they're aunts and uncles.

390
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,400
Oh, but I thought.

391
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,320
And your cousins.

392
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,480
I think maybe she's in the kitchen.

393
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,200
Right, you're right, because this, okay,

394
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,040
excuse me, you're right.

395
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,520
The servers are. Relatives.

396
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,760
The aunts and uncles.

397
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,800
Cousins perhaps, even two.

398
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,840
Right, okay, so that's going to be trickier.

399
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,560
It does, it, look, it waters the whole thing down

400
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,800
that saying auntie is not as creepy as mommy.

401
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,040
Not by a mile.

402
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,880
That's true.

403
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,960
But you know, I still, I think, you know what?

404
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,600
I think he could still creep out.

405
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,320
I mean, I do have a practical concern with this

406
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,320
is I don't often have a huge appetite in Florida.

407
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,480
I feel like the heat and the humidity

408
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,840
just makes me pound so much water

409
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,040
that I just feel, honestly, sometimes bloated

410
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,360
a lot of the time.

411
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
This is the humidity.

412
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,880
Did you not just describe yourself

413
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,040
as a big, wet meat boy or whatever he said?

414
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,480
I said I'm a big gravy boy.

415
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,000
Yeah, Scott, we all contain multitudes.

416
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,560
Just because it doesn't mean I suddenly don't like gravy.

417
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,840
He's a big gravy boy, but not in Florida.

418
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,640
When he gets to Florida, he's never hungry.

419
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,480
Something lighter, something lighter, you know?

420
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,320
Today he is a big gravy boy

421
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,440
because we're recording this in California.

422
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,760
So if you had this, if you had mom's plate of leftovers

423
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,000
here now, you're devouring that.

424
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,320
You're getting big and wet, no problem.

425
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,440
Yes, I think too, because a lot of the mom,

426
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,200
a lot of these foods are novel to me.

427
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,280
We weren't a big meatloaf or pot roast.

428
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,800
My mom would make it occasionally.

429
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,680
Fried chicken was mostly shake and bake at home.

430
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,520
I think it's gonna be, you know what?

431
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,680
I'm going back to the server thing.

432
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,520
It's gonna be fine, because you're gonna tell the aunt

433
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,280
what mom does.

434
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,360
Mommy wouldn't let me do this and stuff.

435
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,480
That's how you, yes.

436
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,160
Because mom, it's so much less annoying

437
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,880
if mommy isn't said frequently.

438
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,720
The exact same thought coming into this,

439
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,440
that I was like, I mean, look, admittedly,

440
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,320
I might have lumped you into this.

441
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,280
I was like, one of these two guys would go there

442
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,480
and say mommy incessantly.

443
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,320
I finished my meal, mommy.

444
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,360
I'm not gonna say that to a stranger.

445
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,960
It's all fun in this safe space

446
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,840
of the three microphones here, but I don't really feel like.

447
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,560
When you're looking into the eyes

448
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,400
of someone you've never met.

449
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,040
A five-year-old student, or an older,

450
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,880
actually one of the videos,

451
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,160
it seemed like an older gentleman.

452
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,040
I'm not gonna say mommy to that guy.

453
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,400
It seems like a place maybe people take that role

454
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,160
and do it for a long time.

455
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,640
Well, yeah, when you find somebody

456
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,640
who is good at the performance aspect,

457
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,520
I feel like they wanna hold onto them.

458
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,320
I hope they're giving them raises, but I don't know.

459
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,880
I do have, I have a few times more recently

460
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,120
been at the bar, been at the TuneIn Lounge.

461
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,960
This looks good.

462
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,280
I didn't know about this bar.

463
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,920
Like, I'm more comfortable with the TuneIn Lounge.

464
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,680
I think the TuneIn Lounge is where I'm comfortable.

465
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,880
Yeah, I like the TuneIn Lounge.

466
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,760
The TuneIn Lounge, a lot has been scaled back,

467
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,600
since COVID.

468
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,480
TuneIn Lounge, I think it's mostly people waiting

469
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,680
for the restaurant and cocktails to go.

470
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,640
Used to be you could just hang out at the TuneIn Lounge

471
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,920
and you could get the full food menu

472
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,320
without having to do all the damn bits.

473
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,760
But my family, I do remember once we went and we ordered,

474
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,120
we were just getting like sodas.

475
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,240
I think my dad ordered a beer.

476
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,480
I think I was probably in high school.

477
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,680
And we ordered like the thing on the menu

478
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,200
that said fried cheese,

479
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,160
thinking it was just mozzarella sticks.

480
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,160
And it was a giant clump of cheese with raspberry sauce.

481
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,920
I think now it comes under it.

482
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,200
Now it comes, at the time it came up top of it,

483
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,040
now it comes under it.

484
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,400
My dad does not like strawberries or raspberries

485
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,600
or any berries with the seeds

486
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,920
that can get caught in your teeth.

487
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,480
So he was like, ugh.

488
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,600
Is that only in Florida or country-wide?

489
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,440
Everywhere, everywhere.

490
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,520
That one applies all over.

491
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,880
But I was looking at the menu and I saw it's 20-some years

492
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,600
later, it's still on the menu.

493
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,440
Fried herb cheese, what do they call it?

494
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,760
Is this, oh no. Jelly cheese?

495
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,840
Fried, yeah, fried herb and garlic cheese.

496
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,280
Fried herb and garlic cheese.

497
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,040
And it's like a big, it comes with fruit

498
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,000
and like some crostini or bread to spread it on

499
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,480
because it is not like a stringy cheese.

500
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,080
It's a spreadable cheese?

501
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,920
It's a spreadable cheese.

502
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,680
Which, like a brie?

503
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,680
Like a bourzin, like I think, is that what it's called?

504
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,200
Something like that.

505
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,920
But I did look up like the raspberry and fried cheese thing

506
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,680
and I did, only recently found out,

507
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,680
this is like a Simpsons joke, this is an Albany thing.

508
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,480
In Albany, they serve fried mozzarella sticks

509
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,160
with raspberry melba, which is pureed raspberry

510
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,120
and powdered sugar to bind it.

511
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,840
Maybe I heard a peach melba.

512
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,160
You're stumping left and right, you're throwing stumps.

513
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,560
Another old dish.

514
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,120
So I don't know if this is, I'm assuming.

515
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,680
Someday, peach melba's coming up on the show

516
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,080
and it's my time to shine.

517
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,040
But I don't remember why I looked this up.

518
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,840
Maybe 50's Primetime Cafe came up in conversation

519
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,080
and I looked up fried cheese and raspberry sauce

520
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,640
and I got an Atlas Obscura entry.

521
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,160
Don't pretend you didn't have a dream

522
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,720
about peach melba and started.

523
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,440
The whole stretch of you explaining food

524
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,800
is like we're gonna clip this and send it to Florida

525
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,400
for your audition to play Grandpa

526
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,240
in the 50's Primetime Cafe.

527
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,120
There is some grandpa entries.

528
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,880
There's a lot of roles Jason can play there.

529
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,760
It's little boy or very old man.

530
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,720
That's potentially the outcome of this.

531
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,960
If he goes toe to toe with server,

532
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,760
it's either I quit and I don't work here anymore

533
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,920
or here's a job application.

534
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,240
You got the goods.

535
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,000
If you defeat the server, you have to take their job.

536
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,920
If you out old timey the server, then you win.

537
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,520
Can I get my equity card?

538
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,120
No.

539
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,120
There are some roles at the Florida parks

540
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,640
where you can get an equity card.

541
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,200
There should be a good amount of those I think.

542
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,280
But yeah, so this is a thing I found out.

543
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,240
The fried mozzarella with raspberry melba.

544
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,840
I'm assuming this was at least a partial influence

545
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,240
of serving this appetizer

546
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,520
and a bed of raspberry sauce, this fried cheese.

547
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,360
You got it.

548
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,320
Sounds like somebody's gotta get to Albany ASAP.

549
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,280
Despite all the time I've spent in central New York,

550
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,400
I've never made it up to Albany.

551
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,280
It's the themed entertainment in Albany.

552
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,840
Oh, there's gotta be something.

553
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,960
Because now this is how we justify any vacation for us

554
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,560
is a tax write off.

555
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,000
What is the dynasty typewriter of Albany?

556
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,080
What is the hip theater in town?

557
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,720
Is gonna have to someone listening to this is in Albany.

558
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,880
Or it has to be. It has to be Albany.

559
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,000
You would think.

560
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,040
So let us know.

561
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,440
Do they have like, I don't know,

562
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,040
do they have an escape room?

563
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,120
Anything counts.

564
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,400
Was there some sort of immersive

565
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,840
where we could do improv with the performers?

566
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,840
Yeah, and they don't like it.

567
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,600
The other thing that, the other reason I went

568
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,640
to Two Nitten Lounge just a few years ago was

569
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,600
I kept, I saw people mention there is a food item.

570
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,360
There's a peanut butter and jelly milkshake.

571
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,200
Oh, I saw them.

572
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,520
I think that people is pretty well regarded.

573
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,240
People like that.

574
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,000
And somebody, I watched one of the vloggers

575
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,640
and they showed it in like a paper cup

576
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,480
and it looked like puke.

577
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,320
It looked terrible.

578
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,680
Yeah, it does look puke when you combine those things.

579
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,520
For sure.

580
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,360
I bet it's good.

581
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,040
I don't mean to completely be negative here,

582
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,720
but it looks bad from the video at least.

583
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,320
It's hard to imagine.

584
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,080
I guess I've liked peanut butter

585
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,160
and dessert form plenty of times.

586
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,640
Yeah, I mean peanut butter works in anything, really.

587
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,480
Yeah.

588
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,880
So I can't imagine, yeah, and again,

589
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,440
if it's a fruit, it's probably the sweetest jelly possible.

590
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,080
May as well, jelly may as well be a dessert already.

591
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,840
So I can imagine that tastes good, but.

592
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,800
This is, it is raved about all across the board.

593
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,720
This is a quote from Eater, from the website Eater.

594
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,760
The PB&J milkshake is the closest thing

595
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,080
in all of Disney World to real actual magic.

596
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,120
What?

597
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,440
There is an Eater article that is very fawning,

598
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,280
very, very crazy.

599
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,120
Extremely.

600
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,720
It blew my mind in terms of,

601
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,720
I thought this was like a weird remnant of 1989 MGM studios

602
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,400
that in my head it was like, oh, they're still doing that.

603
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,920
I wonder if that's all right.

604
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,280
I probably won't go

605
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,920
because I don't want to have somebody tell me

606
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,840
to take my elbows off the table.

607
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,600
Cut to, I start Googling, Eater says,

608
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,560
the 50s primetime cafe is the single best restaurant

609
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,400
at Disney World.

610
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,240
Gosh.

611
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,240
The best restaurant in all of it?

612
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,240
Does that count?

613
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,320
Are we, are hotels in the mix?

614
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,160
Right.

615
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,520
Or is Disney Springs in the mix?

616
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,680
Is this, are they just trying to be provocative?

617
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,680
That seems absurd.

618
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,440
Especially given that then, Jason, as you said,

619
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,520
vloggers are like, you know, pretty good.

620
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,640
Like that's the best that you get.

621
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,680
Even I would say that Mike's hero, Mr. Morrow,

622
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,240
was not even the most positive man I've ever seen

623
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,280
in any media.

624
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,440
He didn't go black and white when he ate it.

625
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,280
No, he didn't.

626
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,760
That's the mark of the best food around

627
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,080
is that when Mr. Morrow, I don't know if you know this, Scott,

628
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,120
when he eats something and he loves it, he's chewing.

629
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,840
And then he, all of a sudden the picture changes

630
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,880
to black and white, it slows down and he adds music.

631
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,560
And that's how you know he's eating something

632
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,760
he's fallen in love with.

633
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,600
He hasn't done it in a while though.

634
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,400
Well, he said he's been doing it more sparingly.

635
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,240
Yes. Oh wow.

636
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,080
I think he's gotten pickier.

637
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,240
He's a steak guy.

638
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,760
So when he ate a Peter Luger's,

639
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,160
and I think even when he ate a steak of the Tam as well,

640
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,360
he did black and white.

641
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,200
Yeah.

642
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,880
So this is his Paul Hollywood handshake,

643
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,520
to put it in British baking terms.

644
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,320
It's only, you know it's special if you eat the black

645
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,160
and white. Right.

646
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,320
And no black and white in this.

647
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,040
Hey, wouldn't that be the place for it, right?

648
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,080
Perfect. Black and white.

649
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,240
Well, so it shows you then.

650
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,720
This is a thing that I have not really been

651
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,440
in a long, long time,

652
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,400
but it's a thing that exists in theme parks.

653
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,920
Where it's like, oh, I think I just like knowing it's there.

654
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,560
I think I would be very upset if I heard it would,

655
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,240
I would be very bummed out if I heard it close.

656
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,080
Really?

657
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,960
Yeah. I think this and the Brown Derby and Sci-Fi Dine In,

658
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,400
which came along a couple years after this.

659
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,960
But do you think it's more because it feels like

660
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,800
the park you fell in love with at such an age is dying?

661
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,480
Sure. I think that's it.

662
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,960
I think like there's still some remnants of like

663
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,200
the old Hollywood angle, you know, of this park.

664
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,040
Right.

665
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,280
There's still a lot of place making stuff

666
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,120
just as it just becomes disparate.

667
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,880
The heart of MGM studios would slowly be.

668
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,720
Sure.

669
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
Sure. Yeah, yeah.

670
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,680
Well, you get that, you get the classic feel here.

671
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,480
Like this, you know, because I think you've lost that.

672
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,520
I mean, they've certainly lost the theming of the park

673
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,160
in a lot of ways.

674
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,120
But if part of it to you is seeing something black and white

675
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,040
at some point, that's kept alive here.

676
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,880
Yeah.

677
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,480
It is a bummer that you can't just go to the bar

678
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,640
and get all the food.

679
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,720
It seems like it's like a pass through bar at this point.

680
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,560
Okay.

681
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,680
It does seem like these things maybe are the closest

682
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,680
you have to like opening day,

683
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,480
like the classic attractions essentially.

684
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,320
Basically, yeah.

685
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
The great movie is gone.

686
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,000
So what else do you have that feels like, well,

687
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,560
that's been here the whole time?

688
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,000
Yeah, sure.

689
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
What else is open aid?

690
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,080
Indiana Jones.

691
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,920
Yeah.

692
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,760
Spectacular.

693
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,240
Star tours opening day?

694
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,320
No, no.

695
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,160
Later on.

696
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,000
Yeah.

697
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,120
There were barely anything was opening day

698
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,120
because they barely had it open.

699
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,680
It was like, yeah.

700
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,800
And the, because all that back lot stuff's gone.

701
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,080
You got no New York street, right?

702
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,160
That's all.

703
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,000
Wow.

704
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,320
Is this it?

705
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,920
Is it Indiana Jones in this?

706
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,360
I think, right?

707
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,200
And unless you count the-

708
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,040
Brown Derby.

709
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,200
Oh, Brown Derby, okay.

710
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,040
Yeah.

711
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,040
Dinosaur, dinosaur ice cream.

712
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,880
Right.

713
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,200
To the existence of the lake in general.

714
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,160
Probably all those Hollywood Boulevard stores.

715
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,120
Crossroads of the World statue at the entrance.

716
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:29,120
That kind of big needle thing that is in Hollywood

717
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,200
and you, I've only ever just driven past it.

718
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,800
It's not in a convenient spot.

719
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,360
It's not a safe spot, I don't think.

720
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,280
I think you run away from that as fast as you can.

721
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,120
In Hollywood.

722
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,080
It's like a offices and strip mall kind of thing,

723
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,680
but there's like nothing there.

724
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,200
It doesn't seem like anything's open nowadays.

725
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,640
Is this the only Disney, least like American park

726
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,360
that doesn't have an opening day ride?

727
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,200
Wow.

728
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,560
Still, I think.

729
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,640
Are we forgetting something?

730
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,720
Yeah, maybe we're forgetting something.

731
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,200
They didn't have a lot of rides.

732
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,040
Yeah.

733
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,240
Kind of was great movie ride and the tram and, huh.

734
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,240
Could be.

735
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,760
So it's 50s prime time cafe.

736
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,480
We didn't realize when we got into this

737
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,040
how heavy the burden is of 50s prime time cafe.

738
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,880
Yeah, really.

739
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,920
All of tradition is gone.

740
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,920
I viewed it as, I was thinking how it kind of stands as,

741
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,400
it's nostalgia for 80s nostalgia for 50s nostalgia.

742
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,720
Oh, for sure.

743
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,560
You know what I mean?

744
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

745
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,800
Being there and the whole, the like kooky kitchen

746
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,800
and the googie style, the crazy bulgy shapes and stuff.

747
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,040
It feels like fondness for that really spiked in this era

748
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,200
with Nick at Night.

749
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,040
Right.

750
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,120
There's just like, there's such an 80s component to it too,

751
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,320
which I think makes it double nostalgic in some way.

752
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,480
And this is why it creeps me out.

753
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,000
Because as I think we've talked about on the show before,

754
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,600
Nickelodeon commercial with the beehive hairdo lady

755
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,240
who's your mother, it was like, finish your chores.

756
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,520
There was a commercial like that for things.

757
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,360
Bubble tape.

758
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,080
Bubble hair and it was the 50s,

759
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,720
the 80s, 50s aesthetic in the background.

760
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,080
I find it unpleasant.

761
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,960
Which usually involves mashed potatoes and mayonnaise.

762
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,080
Yeah, she's like, gotta.

763
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,920
Meatloaf.

764
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,800
What's the general feeling on meatloaf here?

765
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,600
I feel like meatloaf was portrayed

766
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,920
as like kind of a gross food in the 90s as well.

767
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,760
Like that was something.

768
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,600
I think it worked on me.

769
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,440
Maybe you're right.

770
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,280
Maybe this is immediate construction.

771
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,360
Maybe I'd like some meatloaf.

772
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,640
If it's good, it's good.

773
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,080
It is good, yeah.

774
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,680
The Boston Market opened in my town,

775
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,120
originally called Boston Chicken.

776
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,600
And we were, that was one of the best things there

777
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,720
was the meatloaf.

778
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,840
You can get decent when Clifton's reopened downtown in LA.

779
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,680
Oh sure.

780
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,840
I don't know if you ever ate there.

781
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,680
Maybe once, yeah.

782
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,400
And they had like a cafeteria.

783
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,480
I feel like they, I feel like in the first few months

784
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,200
it was like, they had so much you could get

785
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,640
nine stations and then as the months went on

786
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,720
it was like, we have one station open

787
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,760
and you could get a hamburger.

788
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,880
I don't know what it's like right now,

789
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,320
but I like it was a great place.

790
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,720
Open for events.

791
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,560
Yeah.

792
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,380
And it's got the Tiki,

793
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,560
if you ever been to the secret Tiki bar at the top.

794
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,840
I don't remember.

795
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,640
Oh man, we should do Clifton's actually.

796
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,480
We were there at a party.

797
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,440
That was supposed to be an episode.

798
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,720
We were at a weird party.

799
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,880
Was it a funnier die party?

800
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,720
We were at a weird, yeah, funnier die party.

801
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,320
I was at a funnier die, were you guys there?

802
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,760
I wasn't there for that I don't think.

803
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,560
Whale, the rapper Whale I think.

804
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,720
Wale, is that how you say it?

805
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,680
It's not, or is everyone wrong?

806
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,920
I'm not gonna try.

807
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,760
Wale, yeah.

808
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,760
Whale, is it Whale?

809
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,680
You sound more confident Mike.

810
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,440
I know I'm 90% there.

811
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,280
It is not Whale.

812
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,600
It doesn't feel like it'd be Whale.

813
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,760
It's no way it's Whale.

814
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,800
He was on a show at the Staples Center

815
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,840
and they booked him for this

816
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,800
and he came over and did two or three songs

817
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,000
and then he was out of there is my memory of it.

818
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,240
He was at the Staples Center

819
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,360
and then he came and did songs at Clifton's?

820
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,960
Well I think it was feature guest artists

821
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,240
at someone else's concert.

822
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,080
All the money they saved from using actors,

823
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,600
they paid Whale.

824
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,160
Wow, where'd all this come from?

825
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,200
How do we have hundreds and hundreds of.

826
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,760
50K for two songs.

827
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,160
That was the D.A. would be like,

828
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,520
all right a year of crunched budgets

829
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,840
and ooh sorry, ooh we can't, sorry.

830
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,400
No, we're not gonna do that, sorry.

831
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
And now hey, Merry Christmas everybody,

832
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,360
please welcome DNC.

833
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,920
Wait, DMC?

834
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,760
You called it DNC?

835
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,600
I think I said Anne.

836
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,440
I said Democratic National.

837
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,280
That's where their black money.

838
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,200
They did not do a miniature version

839
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,040
of the Democratic National.

840
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,480
Their dark money was coming from,

841
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,480
they had DNC dark money.

842
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,320
Yeah, yeah.

843
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,160
That's why you gotta confuse the DMC.

844
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,600
It is a black bag operation.

845
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,080
I think that was what was quietly

846
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,240
funding in front of your die, yes.

847
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,880
No, and then you look up what DMC is,

848
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,160
what he gets for one night of party,

849
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,600
of just doing Walk This Way

850
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,720
and yeah, that money would go a long way

851
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,080
to getting people some benefits or something.

852
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,920
DMC, he earned the money, he deserves that money,

853
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,480
but when you look at the budget,

854
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,960
maybe an actor should have gotten more than a zero.

855
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,480
He would stick up for their part.

856
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,640
DMC, he'd be the first to say,

857
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,080
give it to this guy, to this DPU,

858
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,840
we run into the ground.

859
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,400
Yeah, so we should do it Clifton's,

860
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,880
because there's a secret Tiki bar.

861
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,120
I'm surprised, maybe you just didn't know it was there,

862
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,960
because that should have been open for a call.

863
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,120
Oh, I was there, yeah, with the boat, yeah, yeah.

864
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,360
Yeah, there's a boat up there,

865
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,320
and it's behind glass, it's like a secret thing,

866
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,400
you have to push on it, and there's a secret staircase.

867
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,240
Yeah, it's great.

868
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,080
I don't remember.

869
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,680
I was drinking, whatever this was,

870
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,080
I was drinking a ton, so who knows.

871
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,200
Well, we'll go up there if it's still available,

872
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,040
I don't know, maybe it's not.

873
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,120
My memory is the secret door was open

874
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,120
just like the bar was that evening.

875
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,200
That might be the case, for a big event,

876
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,040
it might be like, we're not gonna let it be a secret.

877
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,480
Yeah, wait, I might have the same deal,

878
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,040
like it wasn't a secret.

879
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,880
Yeah, maybe they just said it opened.

880
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,680
That's why I don't remember it.

881
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,520
Okay, that's fair.

882
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,520
Not drinking to excess.

883
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,840
Yeah, because every time I had been there,

884
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,880
you had to like know and push on it and go upstairs.

885
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,520
Okay, what else about, wait, you were saying,

886
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,040
okay, we were saying creeped out by the 50s nature of it.

887
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,000
50s, yeah, I don't know,

888
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
and the whole, and the strong emphasis on the table manners

889
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,240
and not fun to me, I don't know.

890
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,360
I think that the sort of like the proportions

891
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:31,520
being a little bit exaggerated feels unnerving

892
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,840
when it's recreating real life

893
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,480
versus when it's like Toontown proportion,

894
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,400
like a Toontown aesthetic.

895
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,480
Like when it's Toonish, you go, okay, yeah,

896
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,000
but like it's a little bit surreal, it's a little odd.

897
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,960
And then I think I've seen this applied

898
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,040
in like a couple different like haunted mazes

899
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,440
over the last few years.

900
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,920
Oh yeah.

901
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,280
There was the Paranormal Inc. maze at Knott's

902
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,720
that ends when you're in like a 50s hospital

903
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,800
and you walk, like you basically, you go to hell

904
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,840
and then you come out into like this hospital,

905
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,200
and I've talked about this before on the show,

906
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,400
which is a really cool part.

907
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,600
Story strikes back.

908
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,000
Story strikes back, and it's like old music

909
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,240
playing on an old radio and everything is a little odd

910
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,560
and there's a nurse who's got like a beehive hairdo

911
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,160
or something, and then I was like, yeah,

912
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,560
this is the creepiest.

913
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,560
So now I like, I've taken that like old time aesthetic

914
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,720
to mean like something sinister, I think.

915
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,600
You don't like beehive hairdos, I guess.

916
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,440
Seems like a main thing.

917
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,400
I'm anti-beehive, I like the B-52s.

918
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,280
I like, you know, I'm pro it,

919
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,840
but in this context and in horror maze context.

920
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,640
You wanna see it remixed or commented on,

921
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,880
you don't wanna just see it.

922
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,480
I know, it can be a straight ahead beehive hairdo.

923
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,720
I don't need a sort of like a subversive take on it.

924
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,160
But I don't think you like it being,

925
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,960
I don't like you like somebody who is mean and stern

926
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,280
with a beehive hairdo.

927
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,520
That's true, yeah, I don't.

928
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
But that might be it.

929
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,280
That's a trope, I feel like that's a trope we grew up with.

930
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,920
Far side too.

931
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,760
Yes.

932
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,920
I like the far side, but would I wanna hang out

933
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,400
with one of those far side ladies?

934
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,240
Probably not.

935
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,040
Right, or the monsters in character we've talked about.

936
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,880
Roz.

937
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,280
Roz, yeah, she's got the beehive.

938
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,240
That's a trope, you know.

939
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,640
Maybe what needs to happen is there needs to be a pro,

940
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,320
nice beehive hairdo character movement

941
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,480
in this country, in this world.

942
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,920
Does Marge Simpson not count?

943
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,520
I know, it is technically a beehive,

944
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,840
but I never think about it like that.

945
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,560
It can't be being that it's like double or triple a beehive.

946
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,040
Yeah, it's something to me.

947
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,680
Yeah, yeah, don't put it in that box.

948
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,920
Yeah.

949
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,280
I did laugh to myself when my dad was like,

950
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,920
oh, your grandparents really like this.

951
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,200
And I'm like, looking back, I'm like,

952
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,440
wait, they had like half this stuff in their house

953
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,000
in the 90s, they had a four mic kitchen table.

954
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,880
That's why they liked it.

955
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,320
Yeah, I guess so.

956
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,120
And they were the ones who, you know,

957
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,720
my parents were born in the 50s,

958
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,640
but I don't know, they have too much memory of it, you know.

959
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,720
I will say like decor wise, it seems great.

960
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,680
Like props are fantastic.

961
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,800
They did a good job. It's well themed.

962
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,640
It is well themed.

963
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,460
Or in thrift stores or whatever.

964
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:08,620
The TVs themselves are fun and custom,

965
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,940
and they say Disney on them.

966
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:14,660
And I remember also thinking I would,

967
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:19,420
now I would like to go and watch the 50s stuff on the TV,

968
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,060
but I don't want to get berated while I'm doing it.

969
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,940
I have to say, however it pained me as a kid,

970
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,900
I would not that, but like half of it I would like,

971
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,180
but I was so nervous about that.

972
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,340
And not wanting meatloaf either.

973
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,180
One of the vloggers said,

974
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,020
if you don't want to do all the interactions,

975
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,940
you can tell them I'm a little shy.

976
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,780
Oh really?

977
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,260
So perhaps they would pull back from the aggressive,

978
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,540
the aggressive language they would use.

979
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,860
You might also be able to say like,

980
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,700
hey, I don't want to do the whole thing.

981
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,420
Like I'm heat stroked and I just kind of want a sandwich.

982
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,980
I think you maybe could be more direct,

983
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,460
but the shy thing is a little bit more of like a sly way

984
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,300
to do it.

985
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,220
Which I never really thought of.

986
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,580
I knew at the one in the wilderness lots,

987
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,860
the whisper whisper and Canyon cafe,

988
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,700
there's like a flag on the table that if you put it up

989
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,060
or down or something that signifies like,

990
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,580
if you're, hey, I don't want to do the whole fucking thing.

991
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,140
What is the whispering?

992
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:11,980
What is that?

993
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,780
I think they're a little rude to you.

994
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,980
And if he asks for ketchup,

995
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,420
they'll like bring you 10 bottles of ketchup

996
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,620
and start throwing stuff.

997
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,140
Which place at which hotel?

998
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:23,860
At the wilderness lodge.

999
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,700
Really?

1000
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,520
It's right in the lobby.

1001
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,360
Did you know about this?

1002
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,180
No.

1003
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,020
Interesting.

1004
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,820
And they're mean, but is it like a woodsy?

1005
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,340
I think it's like quirky with the, yeah.

1006
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,900
So they're like, they're coming back from chopping wood

1007
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,180
all day and they're a little irritable.

1008
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,220
Yeah, it's something like that.

1009
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,180
And they make you eat a cow pie.

1010
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,740
I don't, I'm sorry about the ketchup.

1011
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,420
I didn't know it was a faux pas.

1012
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,800
I just like it on things.

1013
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,900
I don't want to eat this cow pie.

1014
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,980
Nope, you gotta do it.

1015
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,900
We need to do, we should do more like on this weird stuff

1016
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,620
that's in hotel, cause I didn't even know this.

1017
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,700
I've never heard that name, I don't think.

1018
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,780
Like I didn't know about this restaurant

1019
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,820
is what I'm saying.

1020
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,660
Oh, right.

1021
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,500
But like there's, there are little things like that

1022
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,180
in all the hotels in Disney worlds.

1023
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,860
Like that piano player who's at the,

1024
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,020
help me out here, I've stayed there.

1025
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,660
Port Orleans Riverside.

1026
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,580
Riverside, yes.

1027
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,700
There's like a piano thing with a little bar there.

1028
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,340
Tissin looks mad that you aren't coming up

1029
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,180
with this stuff.

1030
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,140
No, no, I was mad cause I was like,

1031
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,420
Port Orleans Riverside.

1032
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,020
What is the cumbersome name that you changed it?

1033
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,260
Cause they used to call it Dixie Landings

1034
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,580
and there was pushback.

1035
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,540
They were like, don't call it that.

1036
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,380
Right.

1037
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,660
And Dix Nunes was like, full steam ahead.

1038
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,500
We're calling it that.

1039
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,300
And there was that like older gentleman

1040
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,940
who I think passed away who would always say hello to you.

1041
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,540
Something, there's a bunch, there's a number of those.

1042
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,100
We gotta tell you, I remember there was like an old man

1043
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,940
at the hotel who says hello.

1044
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,540
There's a number of old greeter.

1045
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,380
They're doing it, old man who says hello at the hotel.

1046
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,220
But then there was someone.

1047
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,500
Michael Scott.

1048
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,900
There was like a novelty pianist at Riverside.

1049
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,620
Riverside as well.

1050
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,460
Wasn't there like chatter?

1051
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,300
Like one of the guys that was like.

1052
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,140
There was chatter, yeah.

1053
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:02,980
About one of those guys.

1054
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,820
Was it one of the two?

1055
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,380
Was it the piano player or the old man who said hello?

1056
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,220
I don't remember which one.

1057
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,100
One of those two guys was inappropriate to guests.

1058
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,060
Soft cancellation.

1059
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:14,420
How do you know this wasn't just that one pervert

1060
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,340
was talking about your butt when you were a child?

1061
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,660
My specific butt?

1062
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,500
Yeah.

1063
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,340
I don't, but I feel like.

1064
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,700
That must be a themed thing.

1065
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,580
I read it on a blog.

1066
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,780
This is firsthand.

1067
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,620
I read it on a blog.

1068
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,380
Hello my baby, hello my honey.

1069
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,780
Wow, look at that tall guy's tight ass.

1070
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,500
If you go, oh, you know, maybe it's just like,

1071
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,020
it's like the prime time cafe or the other thing

1072
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,380
or it's interactive where there's a pervert

1073
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,100
who will make inappropriate comments to you

1074
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,380
if you go to Riverside, Port Orleans Riverside.

1075
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,900
The local pervert that they've installed there

1076
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,900
and you can do improv with him back and forth.

1077
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,340
But remember, it's you're being transported to a time

1078
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,180
when being a pervert was still legal.

1079
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,300
Yeah, specific.

1080
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,860
Before anti-pervert laws were enacted.

1081
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,980
Yeah, so we'll do the episode about the pervert.

1082
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,700
The Port Orleans pervert.

1083
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,380
Unless I look it up and it's really bad

1084
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,980
and then you'll never hear this part of the episode.

1085
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,860
One thing we haven't mentioned

1086
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,260
from the 50s prime time cafe.

1087
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:20,020
Did you read the liquor menu?

1088
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,460
Did you see the tab on the menu?

1089
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,620
The section that was like the liquor.

1090
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,260
It's called from dad's liquor cabinet.

1091
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,660
Oh, right, yeah, yeah.

1092
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,940
And all right, that's a little unnerving.

1093
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,940
There is some nasty.

1094
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,900
See, I was like, I think it's fun.

1095
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,980
This perfectly illustrates our views on,

1096
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,100
get to go back to the Irish bar episode

1097
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,540
when you're like, mom and dad need their medicine.

1098
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,900
That, I just think that's a weird way to phrase,

1099
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,180
that was a weird thing in TV and movies.

1100
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,340
They will always talk about dad's liquor cabinet

1101
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,820
or something and I.

1102
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,060
You jumped to that's where the gun is.

1103
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,820
I never experienced that.

1104
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,820
Behind the bottles, the guns back there,

1105
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:01,820
maybe more than one.

1106
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,340
Oh, sure.

1107
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:08,020
But one of them was the Fireball cocktails,

1108
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,780
Fireball, Cinnamon, Whiskey and Rum Chata.

1109
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,820
That's not in dad's, that's not in the 50s dad.

1110
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,660
Yeah, I don't think so.

1111
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,820
If they're gonna stay on theme,

1112
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,540
they should have it be just like Scotch.

1113
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,700
Yeah, as bitter as it comes.

1114
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,740
No ice.

1115
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,580
Yes.

1116
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,420
Scotch.

1117
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,980
They don't cool it down.

1118
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,180
You pour yourself a full, the mug I'm holding,

1119
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,180
you do that entire amount as I am right now.

1120
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,460
Full coffee mug of creme de menthe.

1121
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,100
Yeah, it should be, they should stay on theme.

1122
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,260
You know what that upsets me now,

1123
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,980
now that you've said it, that part upsets me

1124
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,420
that they put Fireball in there.

1125
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,460
Dad wouldn't be caught dead with that.

1126
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:49,300
The Eater review said the cocktails lean towards sweet,

1127
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,220
but a bourbon on the rocks is hard to mess up.

1128
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,100
So you can do very dad drink.

1129
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,980
But yeah, leaning sweet does not seem right.

1130
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,220
Not 50s, government.

1131
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:02,220
Yes, because they're all trying to either subdue themselves

1132
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,860
from fishing through the rest of the bottles

1133
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,340
and getting the gun,

1134
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:09,940
or trying to build up the courage to finally get the gun.

1135
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:10,780
To get the gun, yeah.

1136
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,540
The gun is in all of dad's minds.

1137
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,260
When the liquor cabinet is in play

1138
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,100
and the drink taste should follow.

1139
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,140
They would use the Tommy gun from the great movie rides

1140
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,780
sometimes in the early days as a prop

1141
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,060
in the 50s prime time.

1142
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,660
In the 50s prime time.

1143
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:33,220
We weren't that far from the 20s at that point.

1144
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,580
So people might've, a lot of dads

1145
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,180
might've had their dad's Tommy gun,

1146
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,780
because their dads were professional gangsters.

1147
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,940
It was the 20s.

1148
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,660
We pay for this nice house we have.

1149
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,580
They quickly did away with the thing

1150
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,420
where you would have to talk down the dad character.

1151
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:52,220
You're not in Okinawa, you're not in Okinawa anymore.

1152
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,100
It's just shell shocked.

1153
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:54,940
Immersive theater.

1154
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,180
It's just a Don Draper type.

1155
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,580
You can't blast cigs in the 50s prime time cafe anymore.

1156
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,180
You know why you think that mad men and other things,

1157
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,700
I think maybe that's also contributing.

1158
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,740
Because I think back then it was like,

1159
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,980
remember the 50s, sock hops, happy days, blah, blah.

1160
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,220
Now the 50s, because of mad men and other things,

1161
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,180
were like the 50s were bad.

1162
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:20,740
Betty Draper is like mommy's little helper jitters got you.

1163
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,020
Yeah, I think maybe there's been,

1164
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:26,260
there's less of the rosy 50s in our imagination as well.

1165
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:30,020
Maybe I'd be more down with the server interaction

1166
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,820
if things got a little more Betty Draper.

1167
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:33,660
Yeah, sure.

1168
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,460
If like, if it's not just that you, like take it further.

1169
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:40,460
I keep putting my elbows on the table.

1170
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:43,980
So then there's like a genuine threat with a knife.

1171
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:44,820
Oh yeah, yeah.

1172
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,060
She starts scaring everyone.

1173
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,540
Mommy, why?

1174
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,380
I apologize.

1175
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,220
She's like, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

1176
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,060
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

1177
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,860
She's like, drop the, or, or, you know, it'll be good.

1178
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,700
Like there's a point when like a door closes

1179
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:56,540
in the back of your shoes.

1180
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:57,620
Oh my God, your father's home.

1181
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:58,900
Everyone be quiet.

1182
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,260
Just be good, be good, be good.

1183
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,940
We can't have him yell at us again tonight.

1184
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:02,760
We'll just be good.

1185
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,700
And like, you have to be very quiet

1186
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,500
while this like angry man walks through the whole restaurant.

1187
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,980
Every table has to just be like silent.

1188
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,420
Well, and you could convey, you could involve the TVs

1189
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,580
in that like kind of a nuclear test pattern

1190
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,580
kind of thing comes on.

1191
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:20,660
So if you see the, if you see the alarm,

1192
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:21,940
that means everybody shut up.

1193
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,580
Yeah, that's like the volcano going off in Trader Sam's.

1194
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,060
You have to duck and cover.

1195
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:29,700
Right, once every hour it happens where dad comes home

1196
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,220
and it's bad news, cause he's had a bad day at work.

1197
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,100
Oh, this is great.

1198
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,460
And they, you don't have to illustrate it.

1199
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,700
You can, you use your imagination

1200
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:40,940
of what dad having a bad day means for you.

1201
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:44,100
It's not going to happen as long as everybody is quiet.

1202
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,980
But that like, you know, he, all he does is just stomp,

1203
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:50,900
stomp around and there's one cough

1204
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,140
and it makes everybody jelly.

1205
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,100
Everybody claims their forks and knives.

1206
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,700
And he has to, it's like, it lasts like 20 minutes too.

1207
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,180
He goes to the bathroom and you have to wait

1208
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,420
and you just like, it's so quiet in there.

1209
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:05,300
You can hear him going to the bathroom and then he gets out.

1210
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,060
He like changes out of his work clothes.

1211
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:10,420
It's long, like a hearty thick piss.

1212
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:13,060
You hear it no matter what table you're at.

1213
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,660
It is the longest, loudest stream.

1214
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,140
And he's got, and look, we've talked about on the show,

1215
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,820
he's got some issues as far as your Aether is concerned.

1216
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,820
You can hear it start and stop like 10 times.

1217
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,500
That's not helping things at work.

1218
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,100
That's not helping things feel better.

1219
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,540
90 seconds of the pee is just a struggle.

1220
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,460
That's also part of it that probably he, I don't want to go

1221
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,700
and I would never accuse him of this

1222
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:36,660
cause I'm scared of him, but he's at the office

1223
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,580
having an affair with his secretary.

1224
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,420
Yes.

1225
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,500
He's maybe having trouble performing.

1226
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,780
Are you having problems down there in general?

1227
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,940
I hear you, you've been having problems

1228
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,060
with your streams, right?

1229
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,300
No, no problems.

1230
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,380
His certainly, he's getting guff from his side piece.

1231
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,620
That's absolutely what's happening.

1232
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,820
There should be an argument off state.

1233
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,540
There should be an argument in the kit.

1234
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,860
You like ask, can I have some more napkins?

1235
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:06,580
Can we have more gravy or ketchup or something?

1236
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,220
And he just goes in the kitchen and it's like,

1237
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:12,820
oh good, the stranger who lives here sometimes is home.

1238
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:14,500
I pay for this goddamn house.

1239
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,740
And then a tea kettle flies out of the kitchen door

1240
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:18,580
and smatters.

1241
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,260
Ketchup is two dollars a bottle.

1242
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,060
We're just going to let this loser kid

1243
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,700
just take as much ketchup as he wants.

1244
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,780
When would you, when would you ever been at a grocery store?

1245
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:32,820
So that's the fun thing you wait for once an hour

1246
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,220
to have happen.

1247
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:37,620
That would be more what I, that is truly the era

1248
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,020
and I think it's more appropriate.

1249
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,620
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

1250
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,580
They're putting too shiny of a gloss on it.

1251
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:43,820
That's right, yeah.

1252
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:48,580
So if they do that, I'll book a flight tomorrow.

1253
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,580
I hope they send me to Korea.

1254
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:55,580
The real, we should open a bar on the real 50s

1255
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,260
primetime cafe.

1256
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,380
The legit.

1257
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,860
Shut down, shut down in one day.

1258
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,780
Many complaints, children crying.

1259
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,940
Well, they maybe didn't get the word out of it.

1260
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,140
Why did they still advertise it in like a fun

1261
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,260
Johnny Rockets kind of way?

1262
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,860
The dark side was not indicated whatsoever.

1263
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,980
Yeah, but the peanut butter and jelly shake was great.

1264
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,060
It is great.

1265
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,380
They definitely pulled that off.

1266
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,900
You know, they're playing the American graffiti soundtrack

1267
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,380
and that's always fun.

1268
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,180
I mean, that's either, in either version,

1269
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,180
that was the music of the time.

1270
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:37,300
So Wolfman Jack was on the radio in both versions.

1271
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,140
What do you mean?

1272
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,940
He was loud enough to muffle the yelling.

1273
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:40,780
Yeah.

1274
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,180
Wolfman Jack should show up too.

1275
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,140
Well, they were trying, they couldn't get the rights.

1276
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:49,540
It was Wernherbrough.

1277
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:52,340
They were trying to get like a Tom Cruise stand in

1278
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:56,100
or a Tom Hanks stand in to go like, he's what?

1279
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:56,940
From what?

1280
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:57,780
He's what?

1281
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:58,620
From Elvis.

1282
00:48:58,620 --> 00:48:59,460
Oh, okay.

1283
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,300
He's what?

1284
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:05,980
I held out at the last possible second, I go,

1285
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,620
I hope I know what Jason's talking about.

1286
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,820
I thought it was Forrest Gump.

1287
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,740
What's this gonna be?

1288
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,420
Colonel, Colonel Tom Parker.

1289
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:15,780
Jason think he's in, Tom Hanks in American Graffiti?

1290
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:16,620
No, no.

1291
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,620
Maybe he's in more American Graffiti and I didn't know.

1292
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:20,940
It's like half an Elvis movie,

1293
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,020
half a Colonel Tom Parker movie.

1294
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:23,940
I gotcha.

1295
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:24,780
I hear you now.

1296
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,900
Sandy Claus.

1297
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,220
Sandy Claus.

1298
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,660
Sandy Claus will come out.

1299
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,180
He's the Sandman.

1300
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:31,980
Snowman, snowman.

1301
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,620
Snowman, not a Sandman.

1302
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,860
He's a Sandman, we're all in the Sand business.

1303
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,300
Oh, we don't want them going to sleep.

1304
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,060
They can't get the money out if they go to sleep.

1305
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:42,100
We're all just making Sand, don't you see?

1306
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,780
Just the best, one of the best voices I have ever heard,

1307
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:50,780
like no known geographical place that voice,

1308
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,660
kind of Czechoslovakian, kind of American, kind of Southern.

1309
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,940
From a foreign planet.

1310
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,940
Colonel Tom Parker's from space, who knew?

1311
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:02,860
Yeah, he originates from that hotel in Vegas

1312
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:06,500
where the Star Trek experience would eventually be.

1313
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,340
He grew up there.

1314
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,980
Underneath it, where the family taught themselves

1315
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:12,780
a language that only they speak that sounds like that.

1316
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:17,180
I was curious about the Loop,

1317
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,260
about the 50s television loop.

1318
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,100
Yeah, I looked into this.

1319
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,780
When I watched some of the Loop,

1320
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:25,340
the user Sam's Disney Diaries posted a lot of specials

1321
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,060
and things we've watched over the years,

1322
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,860
posted some approximations of the Loop plan

1323
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,580
on the little TV.

1324
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,300
Interstitial graphics are fun.

1325
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:35,620
It's a lot, you're getting some big ones that you would know,

1326
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:38,380
like a Father Knows Best or a Dick Van Dyke show.

1327
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:41,260
And then in-house things, it's Mickey Mouse Club

1328
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:43,220
and it's Spin and Marty.

1329
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:44,620
And you get the opening at Disneyland.

1330
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:47,380
So you get your, you're open the Fantasyland Castle.

1331
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,780
I'm really happy to see that.

1332
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,940
But then I was like, what's the stuff I don't know?

1333
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,380
I hope you flagged the same thing I am.

1334
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,460
Yeah, I also flagged one.

1335
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,300
Oh, I don't know.

1336
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,500
Well, what did everybody flag?

1337
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,340
Topper.

1338
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,180
Topper.

1339
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,020
Topper.

1340
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:01,860
Topper.

1341
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,220
Ding, ding, ding.

1342
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,060
Yeah.

1343
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:05,900
Three for three.

1344
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:06,740
Yeah.

1345
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:09,460
I gotta look into Topper more.

1346
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:12,220
Yeah, Topper seems great.

1347
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:16,380
Can I, I don't wanna step on anybody's explanation of Topper.

1348
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,380
Go ahead, go ahead, it's okay.

1349
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,860
I would really like to introduce the listener to Topper

1350
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:24,860
via the voiceover that, and this was on Wikipedia,

1351
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:29,020
but apparently this is how an episode of Topper would start.

1352
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,660
And I don't, if I know nothing,

1353
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:35,220
and this is what they say at the beginning of a show,

1354
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,300
I'm watching the show.

1355
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,300
Yeah.

1356
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,140
It is this.

1357
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,780
Camel, America's first choice among cigarettes,

1358
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:45,820
presents Topper, starring as Marion Kirby,

1359
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:49,980
the loveliest ghost in town, and Jeffreys,

1360
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:54,100
as George Kirby, the liveliest ghost in town,

1361
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:58,660
Robert Sterling, and Leo G. Carroll as Topper.

1362
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,780
Birk, birk.

1363
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:04,780
Oh yes, and ah, the deadliest ghost, Neil.

1364
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,460
And that cuts to a dog.

1365
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,420
It's St. Bernard.

1366
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,260
It's a St. Bernard, oh great.

1367
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,460
St. Bernard who loves martinis?

1368
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,060
Yes, and yeah, so apparently, so this,

1369
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:21,340
I guess the gist of the show was that it's,

1370
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:24,500
it's kind of a pre-Beetlejuice scenario

1371
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:28,500
where the owners of a house died in the house,

1372
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,180
and I guess the dog too, I don't know how

1373
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,940
or what would happen to also make the dog die.

1374
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:37,100
They died, they all died in an avalanche, scare.

1375
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:40,540
And the St. Bernard was sent to rescue them,

1376
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:41,660
and he also died.

1377
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,900
It wasn't their dog, that was a rescue dog?

1378
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,780
I believe it is a rescue dog, that's what I saw.

1379
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:50,460
And he has to, that's the rules of the afterlife.

1380
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:55,460
If you, and if somebody goes to rescue you, human or.

1381
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,900
You're stuck with them.

1382
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,180
Firefighter goes to rescue you from a building,

1383
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:03,180
doesn't make it, he lives with your family now.

1384
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:07,500
Man, yes, so that's, oh yes, well so,

1385
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,620
and you were saying, so the dog is dead too,

1386
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:14,620
so then it's that, the title, Topper, is from Cosmo Topper,

1387
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:16,740
the new owner of the house.

1388
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,820
I think there was a band called Cosmo Topper,

1389
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:22,940
now I know why, but Topper lives in the house,

1390
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:26,060
and the house is haunted, so like invisible props are,

1391
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,700
or props are flying around on strings and stuff,

1392
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:31,720
but it seems like the main gag is that martini glasses

1393
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,180
would get emptied by nothing,

1394
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:36,460
because that's the dog drinking the martinis.

1395
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,700
Yeah, the dog loves to drink martinis.

1396
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:39,820
Yeah.

1397
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:40,660
Jeez.

1398
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,620
This is a favorite show already,

1399
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:42,700
we haven't seen an episode.

1400
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,220
I love Topper.

1401
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,420
And based on a movie as well.

1402
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,260
Whoa.

1403
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:48,780
Books.

1404
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:49,620
Oh, I didn't even see that.

1405
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:50,580
Some bestselling books, I thought.

1406
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:53,340
Really, so Topper was a series of books?

1407
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,620
I thought so, I might be confusing it with someone else.

1408
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:58,180
They made 78 episodes of Topper.

1409
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,020
Oh my God.

1410
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:01,740
In like three years, I think, let me see, it was.

1411
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,500
Is that like more than, how many episodes did Succession

1412
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,780
had, which just ended?

1413
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:06,740
About 40, I don't know.

1414
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:08,540
Yeah, I don't think there were very many.

1415
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:11,540
Topper went, if you're judging purely on quantity,

1416
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:15,700
Topper is way, Topper is twice as good as Succession.

1417
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:21,300
53 to 55, 30 minute episodes, and they did 78 of them.

1418
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:25,900
Which means probably, I don't know for sure,

1419
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,900
but let's just ballpark three martini gags per episode

1420
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,180
times 78.

1421
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,020
Yeah.

1422
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:37,660
I don't know the number, okay, that's 234,

1423
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:40,980
which means like probably more instances of a crew guy

1424
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:44,580
saying, we still can't get the glass gag going.

1425
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,060
Get off my ass.

1426
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:51,820
We will do another take when we get the glass gag going.

1427
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:54,100
You didn't have to write this into the show.

1428
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:57,220
It's impossible, I'm telling you.

1429
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:00,140
Cut it, we've done it, we don't need to keep doing it.

1430
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,620
They've seen enough of the times of the dog,

1431
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:05,500
and like, oh, just like the most depressed.

1432
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,980
Cary Grant was in the first one, by the way, the movie.

1433
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,660
Wow, is he Topper?

1434
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:11,380
He was George Kirby.

1435
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,420
He's the liveliest ghost in town.

1436
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,580
No, wait, yeah, yes.

1437
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:16,420
Lively.

1438
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:18,860
And then there was like Topper Returns.

1439
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:21,220
Yeah, Topper Returns was the sequel.

1440
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:25,300
The books were called Topper and Topper Takes a Trip.

1441
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:28,100
I have a feeling that's not gonna be a conventional trip.

1442
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,100
I feel like those ghosts are probably going with him.

1443
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,860
Oh no, it's gonna be nice, normal, relaxing,

1444
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,460
but I'll be glad they took the trip

1445
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:39,420
and no glasses will disappear mysteriously.

1446
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:44,100
Cary Grant, not in the sequel, and then not in the show.

1447
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:48,620
That's like Jimmy Stewart in an early role of his.

1448
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:51,020
He was like third or fourth build

1449
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:54,220
in like the third or fourth Thin Man movie.

1450
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,540
Oh, well, I think Cary Grant was first build in Topper.

1451
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:57,380
Oh, okay.

1452
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:00,020
Yeah, because he was the liveliest ghost.

1453
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:00,860
Sure.

1454
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:04,500
There was a Topper Goes to Las Vegas episode, too.

1455
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,420
Oh wow, we gotta watch all of these.

1456
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,020
Oh man, we're doing a Vegas month.

1457
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:10,260
I think it's clear that one of the episodes

1458
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:13,180
should be reviewing Topper Goes to Las Vegas.

1459
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:14,020
Yeah.

1460
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,940
Listen to that, wait, I'm gonna say this really fast.

1461
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,100
There was a special introduction for that episode.

1462
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,260
This is Cosmo Topper, bank vice president,

1463
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,700
loving husband, and no, he's not a magician.

1464
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,220
George and Mary and Kirby are doing that, ghosts.

1465
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,860
Yes, a handsome couple who were swallowed by an avalanche

1466
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,180
and came back to spread a little joy

1467
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,820
into a sedate businessman's life.

1468
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,620
And that's their ghost dog Neil of St. Bernard

1469
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:35,460
who couldn't save them.

1470
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,980
That's what you get for drinking on the job, old boy.

1471
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:41,020
Right, because the St. Bernards used to have

1472
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:44,100
little barrels of liquor around their neck.

1473
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:44,940
Yeah, why is that?

1474
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,780
Oh, it'll kind of bring someone back to life, I think,

1475
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,820
and warm them up temporarily.

1476
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:53,900
But they had to deliver that to a human

1477
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:55,420
and make them open it up.

1478
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:59,220
The St. Bernards couldn't smash the barrel.

1479
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,100
No, I don't believe that was on them.

1480
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,540
Okay.

1481
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:04,620
If at some point hands had to take over.

1482
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:05,700
Yeah.

1483
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:08,380
There was a 1973 Topper returns.

1484
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:09,220
Wow.

1485
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:11,700
With Roddy McDowell as Cosmo Topper Jr.

1486
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,260
Oh, I like Roddy McDowell.

1487
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:14,940
I always like Roddy McDowell.

1488
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:18,100
Yeah, Stephanie Powers as Mary Ann Kirby.

1489
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,860
And then John Fink as George Kirby.

1490
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:23,380
Well, I don't know who that is, but big shoes to fill.

1491
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:24,220
Yeah, really.

1492
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,340
To play lively as a ghost in town.

1493
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:28,380
When was the last time in a meeting at a network

1494
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,020
somebody said, you know what we should do?

1495
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:31,580
Bring back Topper.

1496
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:34,020
Probably 1972.

1497
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,220
Probably sooner than you think.

1498
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,620
Well, it probably happened at Viacom

1499
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,500
because Sumner Redstone,

1500
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,660
one of the only living executives who remembers Topper.

1501
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,260
Get one of those real life couples,

1502
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:47,740
Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively or Dax Shepard

1503
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:52,740
and Kristen Bell.

1504
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:56,020
Like that's what rings for me.

1505
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:57,860
Oh my God, oh my God.

1506
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:01,300
There's another Topper TV movie, 1979

1507
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,460
with Jack Warden as Cosmo Topper.

1508
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:04,300
Oh, I love Jack Warden.

1509
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:05,660
Jack Warden is the greatest.

1510
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:07,700
Jack Warden's second only to Keenan Wynn

1511
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,460
in the category of Grouchy Old Man.

1512
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,340
Rue McClanahan is Clara Topper.

1513
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,780
Oh my God. From the Golden Girls.

1514
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,140
Wow. Wow.

1515
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,460
We have so much Topper verse to explore.

1516
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,700
Wow. Oh my God.

1517
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,940
So many episodes of the show, right?

1518
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:24,780
Then books, all of these movies and revivals.

1519
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,100
I think let's just get quick agreement on this.

1520
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,660
We're all just gonna convert this into a Topper podcast

1521
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:30,500
from here on out.

1522
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,340
Yes, for the, at least just for the next five years.

1523
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,460
Yeah, we'll pick up theme parks again.

1524
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,280
Don't worry about it.

1525
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,360
Yeah, so then, yeah, that's fine.

1526
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,360
We all agree, right, Jason?

1527
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,320
Yeah, Topper time.

1528
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,600
Oh, we're changing the name too?

1529
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,880
Yeah. Hey, great.

1530
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:44,920
You can keep the feed.

1531
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,280
The socials will still be,

1532
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,840
we will tweet from podcast to ride,

1533
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:52,680
but the name name will get converted to Topper time.

1534
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,520
Yeah, that's right.

1535
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,160
And you're gonna wanna keep it bookmarked there

1536
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,920
even if you hate Topper time.

1537
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,120
Cause we're gonna get, cause I promise,

1538
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,040
when we come back in five years,

1539
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,640
first thing Space Mountain.

1540
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,280
We're gonna do it.

1541
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,360
So just hang on just five quick years.

1542
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,200
You can wait, right?

1543
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,280
You can wait.

1544
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,200
You can wait.

1545
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,040
You're excited.

1546
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,320
Everyone listening now is just as excited about Topper

1547
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:16,400
as we are. Everyone's chanting Topper, Topper, Topper.

1548
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,520
Yeah, so.

1549
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:21,200
Oh, so I guess Invisible Dog shows are theme parks now.

1550
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,560
Comments that we all send to each other.

1551
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,400
I don't think.

1552
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,280
Be very curious. If you write those comments,

1553
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,360
just know we send them to each other.

1554
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,080
We see everything.

1555
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,480
We're like the all seeing eye of Mara.

1556
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,840
We're like the ghosts.

1557
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,080
Yeah, we're like Invisible Dogs in your house,

1558
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,760
draining your drinks and making fun of you.

1559
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:47,960
Do we miss anything?

1560
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:52,960
Oh, we, hey, the dessert menu comes on a View Master.

1561
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:53,800
That's cool.

1562
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:54,640
Oh yeah, that is cool.

1563
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,840
That's really cool.

1564
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,280
I don't want, even though I'm saying it's creepy,

1565
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,680
it is, it looks good and it is fun.

1566
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,680
What I like is that it's,

1567
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,200
there's such a variety of places to sit.

1568
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,200
It's not like also uniform.

1569
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,800
I like that about Biergaard's restaurant

1570
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,320
that there's different wings.

1571
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,160
Yeah.

1572
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,000
And this is sort of similar where like,

1573
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
you can get a pretty different experience

1574
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
depending on which table you're.

1575
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,840
Kitchenette, is that one of them?

1576
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,960
Yeah, which is another Annette Funicello album

1577
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:18,800
I'm gonna make.

1578
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:19,640
Okay.

1579
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:23,440
The kitchenette about all different household items

1580
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,280
you can use in your kitchen.

1581
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:27,000
Oh, I wish a toaster was my boyfriend.

1582
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:27,840
Yeah.

1583
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,240
Because that's whatever I want.

1584
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:34,320
Mike's hearing about AI and he just has a legal peg

1585
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:35,800
with the phrase like, kitchenette.

1586
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,640
Annette sings about items.

1587
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,320
Yeah.

1588
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,920
Private, publicly like, oh yeah, it's a shame, the AI.

1589
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:43,760
It's a shame, it's weird.

1590
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,600
That's one of the days we are gonna strike

1591
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,760
because of the AI.

1592
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,840
Private, privately, oh boy, my hundredth Annette album.

1593
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,040
Music only for me.

1594
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,800
Office supply Annette.

1595
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,080
My man's as sturdy as a three-ring binder.

1596
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,520
There is, there are a lot of these, you know,

1597
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:05,640
you hear the AI is generated a new Jay-Z song or something.

1598
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,560
And I don't, I have yet to see an AI perfectly recreate

1599
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,520
Annette Funicello's voice,

1600
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,200
but I imagine it's only a matter of time,

1601
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,440
or I imagine I'll have to do it.

1602
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,880
I'll have to, we don't wanna put it in there.

1603
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:19,680
Well, nobody's inserting the information maybe fast enough.

1604
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,680
You have to start compiling every clip

1605
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,360
of her voice that exists.

1606
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,200
Right.

1607
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,520
And then put it into the AI.

1608
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,360
Right.

1609
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:30,600
And then so that we can properly defile the memory

1610
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,160
of this long deceased woman.

1611
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,680
Yeah, there's a lot, I don't know, I get a lot of record,

1612
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:39,120
like it'll be like, oh, if Billy Joel sang this old song

1613
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:39,960
or whatever and you listen to it and you go,

1614
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,920
this sounds like absolute shit.

1615
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:42,760
Yeah.

1616
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,200
But sometimes there is okay,

1617
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,080
but a lot of them just sound like garbage right now.

1618
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,880
One of the most interesting ones is it's like,

1619
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,040
they take Paul McCartney's song New from the last 10 years

1620
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,000
and they put like John Lennon on it.

1621
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,400
They put the other Beatles on it, kind of interesting.

1622
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,240
Oh, the other stuff.

1623
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,400
He wouldn't have let New come out.

1624
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,240
No, that's what would have been fine.

1625
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,360
There's your mistake, the idea that he would just be singing

1626
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,080
background on New.

1627
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,760
He would have sang, I think he would have.

1628
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,800
I think John at 70 would have been interesting.

1629
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:09,760
He would have relaxed.

1630
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,120
Yeah, I don't think, I think he was on his way to relaxing.

1631
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,560
I like this one, my Valentine.

1632
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,600
It shows a whole new side of you.

1633
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,440
Kisses from.

1634
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,240
You could have been a torch song singer, Paul.

1635
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,120
Kisses on the bottom or whatever that album's called.

1636
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,480
Oh, Kisses on the Bottom.

1637
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:24,960
Nothing weird about that one.

1638
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,720
I don't think he would have been as interested in that.

1639
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:31,520
Have you done your record yet with Rihanna and Kanye?

1640
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,120
Do you need a fourth?

1641
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,000
I like the cyber truck.

1642
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,560
Like all the.

1643
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,640
Oh yeah, he does say that on New.

1644
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,520
You can just see, yeah, that John Lennon

1645
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:43,280
did just say the most stunted, like unnerving.

1646
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:44,720
Everything is very ghoulish.

1647
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,200
It's gotta be a little ghoulish.

1648
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,040
At the end of New, he does say, I like the cyber truck.

1649
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,840
That was the most, I was so stumped.

1650
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,760
Thanks for jumping in, Mike.

1651
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:56,240
You might say I've never finished listening to this song.

1652
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,600
Yeah, yeah, so that is, Jason's right.

1653
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,960
So anyway, Net.ai coming soon.

1654
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,160
Yeah, did we get it all?

1655
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,040
I think, I guess we did, right?

1656
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,480
I guess, yeah, I do.

1657
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,920
Again, I wanna reiterate, I like the way this looks,

1658
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,800
but the aesthetic now creeps me out,

1659
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,800
and I do want to do it.

1660
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,160
I wanna see what it's all about.

1661
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,760
I'll get the peanut butter and jelly shake.

1662
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,440
I'm gonna get that Albany delicacy.

1663
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,440
Oh, the fried cheese.

1664
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,120
With the raspberry, yeah.

1665
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,040
I guess I have to get the meatloaf

1666
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,240
to see what it's all about,

1667
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,080
see if Eater's right and it's the best restaurant.

1668
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:28,920
That is a heavy meal.

1669
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:32,120
You're not gonna be able to hit a clean plate club.

1670
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,720
Well, first of all, don't challenge me,

1671
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,080
because I will join the clean plate club there, I believe.

1672
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,000
That's doable.

1673
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,080
Oh, we gotta make sure that we do it

1674
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:46,120
with mere hours before you gotta get to the airport.

1675
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:46,960
Okay.

1676
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,800
So that there's some stakes to you joining the clean plate club.

1677
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,080
How many hours before the flight leaves

1678
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,080
do I have to do this, do you think?

1679
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:53,560
One and a half.

1680
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:54,840
Well, I know.

1681
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,280
I'd have to be seated at one and a half or?

1682
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,560
I'm not sure.

1683
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,960
I think you gotta match the conditions of last time.

1684
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:07,160
Well, last time I wasn't so in danger of missing the flight.

1685
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,320
An hour and a half would really put me

1686
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,800
in a troubled situation.

1687
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,400
You should be walking through security at that point.

1688
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,560
Well, you know me.

1689
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,640
I like to walk through security about half hour

1690
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:17,680
before the plane. You're like Indiana Jones

1691
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,000
reaching back for his hat as the temple door.

1692
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,240
Yeah, and I don't like to be like that.

1693
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,880
I have done that, but I like about a half hour

1694
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,200
before the plane leaves, I'm walking through security

1695
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,640
and through the metal detector.

1696
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:28,480
Insane.

1697
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,640
That seems weird to me, given the,

1698
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,560
you're worrying otherwise.

1699
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,680
I don't like to fly too,

1700
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,200
so I like to almost kind of give myself,

1701
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,000
I've said this about raising a kid,

1702
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,840
when you don't have time to think about,

1703
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,720
I'm so worried about getting there.

1704
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,240
It's like, I don't even have time to sit

1705
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,640
and get stressed out about being on the plane.

1706
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,840
I'm rolling through, you go there,

1707
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,480
I have to go to the bathroom.

1708
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,880
I mean, it's usually 30 minutes is pushing it.

1709
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,000
45 minutes is a little bit easier

1710
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,920
because that's when the door's open generally.

1711
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,520
So it's not maybe that dire,

1712
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,600
but I like kind of not having to think about it,

1713
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,600
like sitting and relaxing to think about

1714
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,520
that I'm going to go on a plane.

1715
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,080
So it is preventing worrying.

1716
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:06,920
I think so.

1717
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,840
I think that's part of it.

1718
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,200
And yeah, when you're not sleeping

1719
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,240
because you have a little baby,

1720
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:14,480
it's just like, you don't have much time

1721
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,760
to worry about the things you were worrying about.

1722
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:17,920
I have plenty of time to worry about,

1723
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:18,760
but there's a lot of things

1724
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:19,840
that I don't have time to worry about.

1725
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:23,120
So that's good in some ways.

1726
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,080
Fuzz up that brain and then just fill it.

1727
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,600
And then just any spare time,

1728
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,120
fill up with 700 alerts on your phone

1729
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:31,680
and looking for new AI songs.

1730
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:35,400
Cloud, yeah, it's really just a cloud up my brain.

1731
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:38,200
Now available on Tubi, Topper.

1732
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,680
Oh, I see Toppers on Tubi.

1733
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:44,360
Tubi or Pluto or one of those.

1734
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,520
Is there a Topper channel on Pluto?

1735
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,960
There very well could be,

1736
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,360
but it's also probably just like on

1737
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:55,360
your old Malt Shop memories TV on your antenna.

1738
01:05:55,560 --> 01:06:00,560
Roku has those, Roku has like completely made up channels.

1739
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:03,200
You'll find like vintage wrestling TV

1740
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:07,760
and it's like the most basic Microsoft paint image

1741
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,600
of like a TV with like a wrestling ring in it or something.

1742
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,200
And you're like, this looks like a child made this picture.

1743
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,080
And then you click on it and they have stuff on it,

1744
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,680
but you're like, who's behind this?

1745
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,920
Like there's not really much of an editing process

1746
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:23,240
that I'm keeping things off Roku TV.

1747
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:26,640
Boy, how things have fallen from the good old days

1748
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:30,000
when you could turn on the network

1749
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,120
and watch something quality like Topper.

1750
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,960
Of course, do you think whatever that network

1751
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:37,040
that Debbie Dunnings show about the Dude Ranches,

1752
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:38,760
do you think they have Topper on there?

1753
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,960
Oh, the Voice of Rural America, whatever that is.

1754
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:45,200
Voice of Rural America TV has Topper streaming.

1755
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,760
Maybe, it seems like an antenna TV go to.

1756
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,920
Yeah, I don't know, but there was a streaming component

1757
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,920
to Rural America TV or whatever it was.

1758
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,400
Oh, wait, okay, there's one other thing.

1759
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,760
They have stopped doing this at the 50s Primetime Cafe.

1760
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,840
The first reservation of the day,

1761
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,840
the first family of the day, they would take like a picture.

1762
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:05,680
Oh yes, right, right.

1763
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,360
With the staff as it was like a memento

1764
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:13,360
and be dated like, if that day was like September 21st, 1952

1765
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:18,120
or 55 or whatever, and they would hang it on the fake fridge.

1766
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:18,960
Okay.

1767
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,600
But there's not, that's just, they would do that once.

1768
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,120
Was there, or is there a person that comes around

1769
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,120
with the photo, like you're in a buka de bebo?

1770
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,320
I think they would do that for the first people

1771
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:31,160
seated that day and they would do it again every day.

1772
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,920
I think that scale back, that one.

1773
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,120
No, not an upcharge like a buka.

1774
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,840
Like a buka to what?

1775
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:40,960
Oh God.

1776
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,320
We're waiting.

1777
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,640
I even said it once.

1778
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:44,480
De pepo?

1779
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,320
No!

1780
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,160
No!

1781
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,520
How did you still not get that?

1782
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,520
This has been a runner I've longed for.

1783
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,360
What was the bet?

1784
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,200
Pepo.

1785
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,040
It is Pepo.

1786
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:54,880
It is a B.

1787
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,720
Yes!

1788
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:57,080
That's, but doesn't that say?

1789
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,480
Where does the P come from?

1790
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:59,320
I don't know.

1791
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,520
You've seen it printed.

1792
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:03,480
It's up big in a place that you are at all the time.

1793
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,640
Because I thought with the B made it sound like B pole,

1794
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:08,560
but you're telling me P is a B pole?

1795
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:09,400
I'm telling you.

1796
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,280
I'm telling you P is the B pole.

1797
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:18,280
Someone said the translation when you misspell it is B pole.

1798
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,040
What does that mean?

1799
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,240
B-E-E-P.

1800
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,080
Hole.

1801
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:24,920
B pole?

1802
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:25,760
Yeah.

1803
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,720
One of the, it's just a nonsense word.

1804
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:31,960
When you misspell it, it translates to B pole.

1805
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,280
Does it mean B pole?

1806
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:37,680
You don't remember the continuity of your own podcast.

1807
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:38,520
I remember a lot of those.

1808
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,040
I don't know what it translates,

1809
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,840
turns into B pole is.

1810
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,160
So you're saying buka de pepo,

1811
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,240
which is what you say means some nonsense word

1812
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,080
that's when it's translated.

1813
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,400
I think that's what it is.

1814
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:49,240
Yeah.

1815
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,080
Okay.

1816
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:50,920
Huh?

1817
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:51,740
Okay.

1818
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:53,800
I went from elated to confused so fast.

1819
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,040
Yeah, that was some of the words I've understood

1820
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:56,880
the least in a long time.

1821
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,400
I've been called that as well.

1822
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,840
I've been referred to as that.

1823
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:02,680
What?

1824
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:07,240
You make people go from elated to confused real fast.

1825
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,000
You've been accused of doing that.

1826
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,120
Accused of doing that.

1827
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,000
Yeah, yeah, I see now.

1828
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,240
It's one of my favorite runners on,

1829
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:17,680
and now that I know that it's a runner,

1830
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:22,400
you try to cash call buka like it's your friend,

1831
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,880
but it's really just to avoid saying the last word,

1832
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,000
which you still don't know.

1833
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,520
Because I've eaten there one time.

1834
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:31,120
Yes, but you are in,

1835
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,720
we did a whole podcast about it

1836
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,000
where we covered this topic

1837
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,280
and you pass by the word bepo in a place you go,

1838
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:39,960
like at least once a month.

1839
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,240
I don't pass by that part of it.

1840
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,600
It's all the way back there.

1841
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,600
It's all the way back.

1842
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,960
I honestly, I said buka de bepo.

1843
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,520
I saw it, oh, it's funny, Jason,

1844
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,800
the thing with Jason, whatever.

1845
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:53,080
And then you repeated back just the first part of it.

1846
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:56,000
And I went, my little devil on my shoulder was like,

1847
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,360
I was like, I gotta see, I gotta see.

1848
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,200
Cause I just said it.

1849
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,800
So I felt like it wasn't gonna be such a thing,

1850
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:02,640
like a cold thing.

1851
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,160
Cause I had just said the name of it.

1852
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,880
Cause no one on earth calls it just buka.

1853
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,680
It's not a shortening that has ever been done.

1854
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:12,040
Cause no one likes it enough to do it.

1855
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:12,880
Well, no one likes it.

1856
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:13,960
No one likes it.

1857
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:14,800
No one likes it.

1858
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,960
It's a horrible restaurant.

1859
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,360
Really, really bad.

1860
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,200
Really bad.

1861
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,840
Sucks tremendous shit.

1862
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,080
Somebody might've called a buka to be fair to Jason.

1863
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,840
I just, I just, yeah.

1864
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,560
If you even maybe even say buka,

1865
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,880
I wouldn't have asked.

1866
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:31,720
So it is funny.

1867
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,120
Mind your B's and P's, Jason.

1868
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,400
No dessert unless you get your beppos

1869
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,160
and your pep-pos right.

1870
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,000
No.

1871
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:41,440
Your insolence.

1872
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,280
All right, that's it.

1873
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,760
This episode is over right now.

1874
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,720
You use that attitude and we end the thing.

1875
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,600
I'm lighting the curtain on fire.

1876
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,960
This is, you are gonna end the restaurant.

1877
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,280
It's a weird bad seed kid.

1878
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,200
Oh, that's good too.

1879
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,800
That's good backstory in your pocket.

1880
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,080
You're not just a bad kid, you're the worst kid.

1881
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,160
Yeah.

1882
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,200
All right, you survived, I guess,

1883
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,960
the ride to the second gate.

1884
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,080
I was worried we peaked too early in this episode

1885
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:11,960
and thank God we just, we ended here.

1886
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,800
Well, yeah.

1887
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:17,800
What greater peak is there in listening or talking?

1888
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,320
From City Walk, I think, right?

1889
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,760
It comes back to the first City Walk saga.

1890
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,480
There's so many years where you could've learned

1891
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:25,880
that it's a beppo.

1892
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:29,480
I could've made time to learn the official name

1893
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:31,480
of the bad restaurant.

1894
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,040
No one likes according to you.

1895
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:34,880
It sucks.

1896
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:35,720
These things are important.

1897
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,800
You must learn the name of the awful garbage

1898
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,080
for the place I only ever regret going to.

1899
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,320
I hope you don't regret coming here to the second gate

1900
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,000
and if you wanna dig even deeper,

1901
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,960
join us on our VI, I'm just gonna reverse it,

1903
