1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:10,300
When your town has made you frown, When your square has made you swear,

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:19,920
When life gives you one more punch, You need a dough that's soaked in Captain Grunge,

3
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:29,520
You need a place, a place to stroll with alcohol, A place that features part of the Berlin Wall,

4
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:37,540
Where steampunk robots sell chocolate snacks, A place where you can tattoo your lower back,

5
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:47,540
So let's go take a walk, let's all go to City Walk Orlando tonight, tonight.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,240
Podcast The Ride presents the City Walk Orlando Saga, Multiverse of Madness, a daily,

7
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:02,920
extremely necessary series exploring the shops, restaurants, and cosmic wonder that make up

8
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,200
Universal City Walk Orlando.

9
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,160
Well, for the second time today, welcome to Podcast The Ride,

10
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,200
the City Walk Orlando Saga, Multiverse of Madness, this time here on the second gate.

11
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:14,940
At this point,

12
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,240
audience, do you feel like you are getting pummeled by a content bat?

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,560
Is it like, are you

14
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,340
overwhelmed?

15
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,620
Do you feel like you need to call the authorities because of how much content we

16
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,620
are inundating you with?

17
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,460
Are you drowning?

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,860
It's, Mike Carlson here, yeah, it's a very good question.

19
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,880
I do think what's interesting now that we're doing this for the third time, a saga of this nature,

20
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,220
that really at our fingertips is the ability to destroy your phones.

21
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,480
I didn't even think about

22
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,840
this in a super villain way.

23
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,260
We can really like just take up all the memory on your phones,

24
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,400
slow them way down.

25
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,080
We have so much power here that I didn't even realize.

26
00:01:53,160 --> 00:02:01,040
It's really a way of reasserting the power, just establishing that we're in charge, it's our show,

27
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:07,940
and if we want to overload your phone and make it so you aren't getting ways reception and then

28
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,520
you don't get to work on time.

29
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,780
Jason Sheridan, let's bring you in on this.

30
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:19,780
Yeah, you know, the default Apple podcast app hides the turn off automatic downloads in a couple

31
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,580
places.

32
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,540
So if you're not paying attention, yeah, we really could be filling up your phone.

33
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,080
Now you told people not to.

34
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,080
You told people that was wrong.

35
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,880
You shouldn't have done that.

36
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,140
Yeah, yeah, to turn it off.

37
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,200
We want to destroy these things.

38
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,620
We want to overheat them.

39
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,300
Yeah, yeah, we are going full light.

40
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,840
I want the phone to be heavier.

41
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,260
I want you literally to go

42
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,360
pick it up and you go, oh, why is my phone so heavy?

43
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,400
And there's so many podcasts.

44
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,980
I think it's happening.

45
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,320
I mean, I know that seems metaphysical or sci-fi or something,

46
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,120
but also nobody's ever put out this many at a time.

47
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,140
Of course, there are daily podcasts,

48
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,000
The Daily, for example, but that's not as long as these are.

49
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,100
I think we are.

50
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,420
I think we're dragging

51
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,960
people down by the pocket and I hope we are.

52
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,940
And I like it.

53
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,600
I like this feeling.

54
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,780
You like the power.

55
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,220
I like the power.

56
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,800
Exactly.

57
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,240
Yeah.

58
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:10,600
Yes.

59
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,100
Because just being in someone's ears is a passive experience,

60
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,980
but destroying the device that their life might depend on.

61
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,980
There you go.

62
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,220
Now that's now you're in

63
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:19,800
the center of the blanket.

64
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:19,940
We're freeing.

65
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,860
We're like the real, we're Luddites, the original Luddites

66
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,100
destroying textile machines.

67
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,200
Sure, using tech to destroy tech.

68
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,320
I'm just, I'm beating a dead horse here, but we could release every minute a different 24-hour

69
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,480
drone podcast.

70
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,900
Every minute we could set it where it just, you get sent a 24-hour straight,

71
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,320
just a loop of a drone.

72
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,160
Oh, that's what you're saying.

73
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,600
Every minute, next minute, another 24-hour

74
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:46,940
drone.

75
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,340
Just over and over and over again, locking you out of your phone.

76
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,680
That's a good point.

77
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,880
We aren't really like taking advantage of megabyte heft the way that we could be.

78
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,280
No, we're not.

79
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,000
But this is a start.

80
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,180
We're getting there.

81
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,560
I'm feeling bad.

82
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,880
It feels good to be bad.

83
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:12,620
Well, after everything that we've been through earlier today, I definitely feel a tad punchy.

84
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,180
And I think it's pretty clear what we're doing.

85
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,720
I think this plan has been

86
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,880
restated a couple of times, but let's make totally sure by checking in with us.

87
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,300
Boys, boys, it's time for the second half of your double mission.

88
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,080
Phase five, sector two B.

89
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
B for Buffett.

90
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,880
Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville Omega.

91
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,640
Fins up, boys.

92
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,500
All right.

93
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,600
There it is.

94
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,820
More Margaritaville, this time Omega.

95
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,200
To address some things,

96
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,660
listener, hopefully you're hearing these just back to back, but there's been a healthy amount

97
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,140
of time since the one earlier today that we recorded.

98
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,560
And one thing that came up earlier

99
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,900
today, unless you're doing it the other way, in the Alpha episode, basically, there was a discussion,

100
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,880
Mike's assertion of the 10 Jimmy Buffett songs that regular people know.

101
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,220
A high number.

102
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:08,580
Again,

103
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,500
you're aiming for destroying phones with high volume of content.

104
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,140
You also believe there are 10

105
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,820
Buffett songs that regular people know.

106
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,420
I'm going to throw another Buffett 10 into the mix.

107
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:20,760
I guess

108
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:27,920
Buffett comes in 10s because if you think about it, by my count, and I might be missing a few,

109
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:34,720
but I think that what we're doing right now might be the 10th Buffett centric, not podcast the ride,

110
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,900
but I'm just going to hear, I'm going to name, it actually straddles a couple of podcasts,

111
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,900
but at least involving you, Mike.

112
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,260
Oh, I see what you're saying.

113
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,380
I think I see what you're saying.

114
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,100
Okay.

115
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,740
I was just going through this list.

116
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,340
All right.

117
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,640
First Buffett podcast experience

118
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,120
probably was in 2015 when Mike was on Doughboys and did Margaritaville, what we're doing again

119
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,560
today.

120
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,240
Margaritaville came up in the City Walk Saga in 2018.

121
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,820
We did Margaritaville Resort Orlando,

122
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,820
where we named the streets.

123
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,960
We did the Times Square Resort, where Jason and Jane stayed.

124
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,880
We did Jimmy Buffett's Christmas albums on Club 3.

125
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,160
If you think about it, Frank Marshall Gate

126
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,220
is essentially a Buffett-oriented experience because Frank Marshall is Jimmy Buffett's best friend.

127
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,900
Then there was the Reprise with Griffin, where he reopened it and we did it all again.

128
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:27,860
This right now is the third episode in two days on this saga, which brings us up to 10.

129
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,640
10 Jimmy episodes.

130
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,540
Am I missing one?

131
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,180
Have you done another Buffett?

132
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,380
That's a good question.

133
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,240
I don't know.

134
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,300
Maybe I'm forgetting a guest appearance somewhere else.

135
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,400
Besides just the

136
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,680
stray references to him all the time.

137
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,500
I don't want to vocalize that I'm suffering from

138
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,560
Buffett exhaustion.

139
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,260
But for any listeners who are, I see you.

140
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,540
I acknowledge you.

141
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,720
I see what's in

142
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,020
your eyes right now.

143
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,080
I feel for you.

144
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,740
That's all I'm saying.

145
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,320
Tearfully listening and doing the fins

146
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,180
up is a very funny image.

147
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,660
But weakened fins.

148
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,040
They're wobbling.

149
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,720
Those hands might teeter off

150
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,420
ahead at any time.

151
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:16,120
But am I a crazed man by feeling overwhelmed by this?

152
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,200
I don't think you're a crazed man for thinking that.

153
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,540
I'll be honest with you.

154
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,580
There's some things I

155
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,160
talk about on the show and I feel like no one cares.

156
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,640
There's never a reaction.

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,700
But I will say

158
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,920
there's a surprisingly large amount of people that are right on board with all this Buffett content.

159
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,680
I know.

160
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,320
Of course there's no but.

161
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,660
I think it's more than not.

162
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,620
I just wonder about those stray

163
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,660
lost souls who are now in the middle of yet another Buffett sandwich.

164
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,340
To talk punishing, how much punishing we do on this show, I think there's always different topics

165
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,040
that everyone feels punished by that come up every third episode.

166
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,160
So everyone's got their own thing

167
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,780
on podcast that punishes them.

168
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,440
Do the Buffett haters maybe get punished more than some other

169
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,100
types of haters?

170
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:05,780
Perhaps.

171
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:06,740
Perhaps.

172
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,280
But that's the fun of this show is being punished.

173
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,560
The wheel of death might point to you.

174
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,060
When is it going to fall on you?

175
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,800
At any time.

176
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,800
We all probably kind of like theme parks.

177
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,420
That's the only thing that everybody

178
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,580
kind of agrees on in the audience.

179
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:22,980
Yeah.

180
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,280
Now which puts a lot of people at a challenging point in

181
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,540
the series where they have been discussed very little.

182
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,300
Of course.

183
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,840
That is not at all.

184
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:31,840
Barely at all.

185
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,140
Yes.

186
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,980
But yes, I think that like are these guys going to talk about fucking Jay Leno

187
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,240
again?

188
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,420
Like that comes up once around.

189
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,640
What is why?

190
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,820
There's definitely those.

191
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,020
But I will say

192
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,040
we've been sparing with Leno centric topics.

193
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,760
That's true.

194
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,660
Do we reference him every third episode

195
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,480
in some other way?

196
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,520
If Jay's.

197
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:50,860
Yeah.

198
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,920
But if Jay had Jay's garage at City Walk, hamburger and pizza

199
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,700
restaurant, which is something we should come up with.

200
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,340
Really fucking good idea.

201
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:00,820
You should have

202
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,000
one on both coasts.

203
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,740
Oh God.

204
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,520
Jay's garage.

205
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,920
You know the microphone that was on his desk.

206
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,140
Yeah.

207
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:12,440
And what you know, actually he probably wouldn't allow any acknowledgement of his career as a TV

208
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:12,740
host.

209
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,260
Well of course.

210
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,060
He's very humble.

211
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,080
It would be entirely be like about the cars.

212
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,320
Yeah, of course.

213
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,600
There'd be little nods to it.

214
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,440
But yeah, it wouldn't be not.

215
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,900
It would not be ostentatious.

216
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,500
It would be

217
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:27,720
not a gross sort of like his old buddies from the old days wouldn't be in there making fun of him

218
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,020
because it wouldn't be too much of like.

219
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:29,400
Yeah, yeah.

220
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,400
Being a showbiz fancy boy.

221
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:31,940
Because that's,

222
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,060
you know, I watched the whole Piers Morgan interview with Jay and he says, you know,

223
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,540
he's but he was with his buddies and he had Barack Obama's phone number and his buddies were like,

224
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,680
oh yeah, call Barack Obama.

225
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,160
All right.

226
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,560
And so Jay did to shut his buddies up.

227
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,560
And did he pick up?

228
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,600
He did pick up.

229
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:45,920
Whoa.

230
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,900
But also this is a story where Jay had been famous for 30 years.

231
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,260
So I

232
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,320
really don't buy completely this story where his buddies don't believe a presidential candidate.

233
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,380
Oh yeah, really?

234
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,640
Jay, you've been on TV for 30 years.

235
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,760
Jay, it's Barack Obama.

236
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,940
Is everything all right?

237
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,740
You're not usually a phone caller.

238
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,240
He must be wrong if you're calling me.

239
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,620
Yeah.

240
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,240
So.

241
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:04,620
There's

242
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,140
no way I can be in your top 10 emergency contacts.

243
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:07,780
So literally.

244
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,520
Are they all dead?

245
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,640
Yeah.

246
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:18,380
If Jay, if Jay had had some sort of place adjacent to a theme park, I think there would

247
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,500
be this many episodes.

248
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,300
Yeah, yeah.

249
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:20,740
Yeah.

250
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,180
I will.

251
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:21,460
I think.

252
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:21,720
Yeah.

253
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,620
But you're right that

254
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,020
Buffett is like part of it.

255
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,220
He's it's not unrelated.

256
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,000
It's just boy, it's been a lot.

257
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,840
And I think I'm

258
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,020
worn down by other things too, because the in also in the alpha episode, there was an assertion.

259
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,080
I want to say it was Jason, but I'm not sure.

260
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,120
But I there was something was said,

261
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:46,540
and I think it's been said before the discussion of the end when you're doing your, what are the

262
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,420
clock somewhere?

263
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:47,800
Yeah.

264
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,620
And then it was like, oh, that was a hit.

265
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,660
That was the first time he

266
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,080
charted.

267
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,140
He'd never charted.

268
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,200
That one sat with me.

269
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,740
That's not true at all.

270
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,780
He's been on the charts

271
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,220
many, many times.

272
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,360
Is that his first number one then?

273
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,260
I don't think that was number one either.

274
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,600
Maybe on some chart, maybe on a so we can look into it and figure it.

275
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,840
But if we're talking general

276
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:13,480
charts, that is far from the truth that that was the first time that he'd ever charted,

277
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,340
which just gives me the overall question was that he'd never been on any chart.

278
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,320
I think you can tell

279
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:20,800
me.

280
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,380
I don't remember.

281
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,560
I had always heard it.

282
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,940
It might be number one.

283
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,400
So I think that is like a

284
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,240
very successful.

285
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,500
All I know is that that was a bigger success somewhat chart wise than a lot of

286
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,140
his other stuff.

287
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,100
But perhaps I misspoke.

288
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:34,980
Then all of them.

289
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,080
I don't think it's true.

290
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,520
You guys,

291
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,660
I was looking at numbers.

292
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,020
I don't have it all in front of me and he hadn't charted in decades,

293
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,760
but the idea that he'd never been on a chart is simply not true.

294
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,360
If I said that, I don't then I

295
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,540
misspoke or Jason misspoke.

296
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,140
I just think that there was some sort of level of success.

297
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,760
That song had

298
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,880
more than his other stuff.

299
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,840
Yeah, I think Alan Jackson was a real, but perhaps I misspoke.

300
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,160
I

301
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,440
misspoke.

302
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,700
I misspeak all the time.

303
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,140
We can check.

304
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,080
We can check it.

305
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,360
I just know from what I looked at,

306
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,580
this was not even close to a true fact.

307
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,380
And it just leaves me with the question.

308
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,220
Why do I, as the

309
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:14,460
least, the most minimal Buffett fan of the three, how am I left to track all of the proper truths

310
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,680
about him and all of his friends?

311
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,420
Because enjoying Jimmy Buffett is not sort of a numbers analytics

312
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:20,740
thing.

313
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,840
It's a feeling thing.

314
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,860
And that's what you're trying to approach.

315
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,040
Has Jimmy ever weighed in on

316
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,640
his feelings about numbers or analytics?

317
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,820
Well, obviously he doesn't care for math.

318
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:29,880
And what is

319
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,420
there a specific quote on that?

320
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,580
Math sucks with a K.

321
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,000
Whoa.

322
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:34,900
Whoa.

323
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,340
He hates it so much he misspelled

324
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,380
the title of the song.

325
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:38,980
With an egg?

326
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:39,420
Wait.

327
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,460
Okay.

328
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,560
S-U-K-S.

329
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,280
Oh, it's S-U-K-S.

330
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,160
Oh, it's not an X.

331
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:43,420
It's

332
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:43,960
not an X.

333
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,320
Okay.

334
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,140
No, no.

335
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,380
That would be actually a way more people spell sucks.

336
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,000
All right.

337
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:49,540
Math

338
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:49,920
sucks.

339
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:56,200
I for one am worried about the PTR curse of mentioning someone they pass away.

340
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:56,620
Because I

341
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:04,020
think in one of those early sectors with the carts, I toss out like, oh yeah, they have Dragon

342
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,420
Ball Z stuff for sale.

343
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,280
And of course Akira Toriyama passed recently.

344
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:09,460
Oh yeah, he died.

345
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,480
Was it before or after the episode came out?

346
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:12,720
I don't know.

347
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,540
It was like maybe the day off.

348
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,100
I don't know.

349
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,980
Something like that.

350
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:16,480
Oh, shit.

351
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,880
Hang on.

352
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,900
But we didn't say his name, right?

353
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,340
No.

354
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:20,720
No.

355
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:20,920
Toriyama.

356
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,660
Then that's not the curse.

357
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,520
I don't think it's the curse.

358
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,820
I think that's the, yeah.

359
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:30,360
If we invoke a property, look, if that's the case, then we're killing bewitched writers left and

360
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,520
right that we don't even know about because they aren't even in the papers.

361
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,560
But we've murdered

362
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,160
I Dream of Genie writers.

363
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,040
They could all fill a mass grave if it's mentioning the property at all.

364
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:53,800
Puts my mind at ease a little, although unlocked the fact that like, oh yeah, I don't think it's

365
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,340
when I was like in middle school and starting high school.

366
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,240
It was on very weird times on the

367
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,740
WB or UPN.

368
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,720
And I would always catch a head.

369
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,880
So you want to say like a nice eulogy to him then?

370
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:15,080
Oh, well, he's, you know, up in heaven now.

371
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,280
But that's the thing.

372
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,860
I've internalized it.

373
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,560
Incredible.

374
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,560
He rode on his fine cloud up to heaven.

375
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,900
He is in a hyperbaric chamber getting

376
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,680
stronger.

377
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,440
He says stronger and stronger.

378
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,760
No, I was hyper.

379
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,700
You get a chamber when you go to heaven.

380
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:42,700
Well, he trains in it and becomes even stronger.

381
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,740
But my next thing was going to be that like, oh,

382
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,360
I like classic Simpsons.

383
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,260
It's like, oh, it's all internal.

384
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,200
Like, I don't know if I can just pluck,

385
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,140
you know, specifics or lines like I used to be able to with classic Simpsons.

386
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,200
What is you mean?

387
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,760
Dragon Ball Z?

388
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,720
Dragon Ball Z.

389
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,200
Yeah.

390
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,420
Well, then it's also very stretched out.

391
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,400
So you're not going to be able to toss out a barrage of Dragon Ball Z quotes through the full

392
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:08,880
episode?

393
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,420
I'm not.

394
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:09,780
No.

395
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:14,840
Well, and then you get into subs and dubs, you know, getting into that argument.

396
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:15,760
Okay.

397
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,280
I shouldn't say this.

398
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,900
Guys, we've already had an episode today.

399
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,300
How many more sidetracks

400
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:21,860
are we going to have?

401
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,320
You're right.

402
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,320
We talk about our meal.

403
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:23,460
You know what?

404
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,120
I won't say it.

405
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,160
How

406
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,080
important is it?

407
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,400
Not important at all because I've been worried about something I said a few weeks

408
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,760
ago, but nothing has happened and I shouldn't put the evil back out into the world again.

409
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,700
What is it?

410
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,700
Just I mentioned another old man, but I really mentioned him in harsh terms.

411
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,300
Oh.

412
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,640
In the sense that I dared the universe to do something.

413
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,960
You had a lot of very cruel things to

414
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,620
say about Akira Toriyama.

415
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,480
No, I was not Akira.

416
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,340
I was not talking about the man.

417
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,400
Check the tape.

418
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,360
Look, he's in heaven, okay?

419
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,220
He's in heaven now.

420
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,340
That's where we leave it.

421
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:51,980
Let's leave it there.

422
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,640
He's in heaven now.

423
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,560
We have a lot of work to do here today, though.

424
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,240
All right.

425
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,380
We did Margaritaville

426
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,580
again, like the Sector Keeper told us to do.

427
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,840
We went there to the Omega version, which is Hollywood,

428
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,480
which have we been there before?

429
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,020
Absolutely.

430
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,280
Of course we've been there before.

431
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:06,660
It's the

432
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:13,000
fourth podcast about this, but we went back and we replicated a meal as closely as we could.

433
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,260
This

434
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:18,320
was a bit of a West Coast reunion of the previous terrible meal.

435
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,900
Jane was there.

436
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
The Level Keeper

437
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,500
was there.

438
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:27,620
Adam from Universal Orlando was not there, but we did get a little surprise cameo by

439
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:33,180
Eric Madden, a very supportive listener and two-time Club 3 Topic winner.

440
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,180
Thank you, Eric,

441
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,940
for some great topics and for saying hi.

442
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,140
Must have been weird, I feel like, because maybe

443
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:45,100
one bit of context for our meal, this is a very vacant restaurant.

444
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,840
This was about as deserted as

445
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,440
could be.

446
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,340
It must have been weird for him that he is in an almost entirely empty restaurant,

447
00:16:54,580 --> 00:17:01,680
only to discover that the majority of the other customers are all from a podcast that he listens

448
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,040
to.

449
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:10,320
More than half, besides his group of who was in there, I think, are all us and Jane and Level

450
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:10,620
Keeper.

451
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,480
It's crazy.

452
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:17,900
I'm sure that was surreal, but then also, of course, that's who we saw there in

453
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,540
a way too.

454
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,580
You may expect to, yeah.

455
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,480
Yeah.

456
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,360
I was leaving the bathroom and I saw him and he goes,

457
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,040
Mike, what?

458
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,920
There was a noise he made that I remember.

459
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,060
He's like, huh?

460
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,400
I was like, yeah,

461
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,220
I guess we're here.

462
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,080
Hey, look over there.

463
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:31,920
Everyone.

464
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,400
All the characters are here.

465
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,360
Yes, but as much as I think there would have been a point in time where we might have been

466
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:45,120
much more likely to all be found there, but this definitely did have to be arranged and

467
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,080
forced, given the earlier experience in Orlando.

468
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:50,840
Yes.

469
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,900
We had to really toughen up.

470
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:53,940
We're going into

471
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,240
battle.

472
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,300
We're doing this again.

473
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,980
Can we bear another one of these margaritaville meals?

474
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:00,360
Yeah,

475
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:00,980
yeah, for sure.

476
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:07,060
So yes, it was, yeah, as you're saying, in the old days, we frequented this

477
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:11,040
location pre-babies, pre-COVID and everything.

478
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,440
Yeah.

479
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,100
That's obviously cut down some of our city

480
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,840
what goings to, though I feel like we've, especially because of the saga, but they've been a

481
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,460
little more frequent.

482
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,520
It is a re-spike.

483
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,420
It's coming back.

484
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:20,960
It's coming back.

485
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,240
Yeah, yeah, which

486
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,040
led to some.

487
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,060
Nature is healing, as they say, as all the people say online.

488
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,700
Never been more back.

489
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:36,080
So basically, I mean, can we start talking meal or is this, do you have to tell the story that I

490
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,180
swear to God you've told?

491
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,320
Oh, that we saw Jimmie play?

492
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,300
There's no way this has not been, maybe,

493
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,220
I need some punishment if you have not told this story before.

494
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,080
Well, you know what, let me do this.

495
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,780
You certainly told it in reality to me plenty of times.

496
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,400
Yeah, well, okay, I really won't tell the

497
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,520
full story again.

498
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,660
I'll briefly recap it and then I will make a larger point about that.

499
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,120
I hopefully

500
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,440
will call it the rest of this episode.

501
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,080
Okay.

502
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,900
So this location.

503
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,260
Do you not agree with me,

504
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:03,560
though?

505
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,640
That there's no way it says it's been told three times.

506
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,320
Yeah, I've told the story before.

507
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,820
The story is that, yes, when working for Screen Junkies, the old YouTube channel, of course,

508
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:17,860
that I would do a show called Movie Fights, I got press passes and a camera guy and another

509
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:23,900
press pass for my assistant, Jason Sheridan, to assist me at the opening of This Margaritaville

510
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,900
and Jimmie Buffett played.

511
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,280
The whole band played and it was like, I don't know, there were fans

512
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:28,960
there or whatever.

513
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,220
And I'm sure I told the story, because I love the story where I'm trying to find

514
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:38,580
Jason to help me do something and he's at the table taking the free hamburgers and stuff on a

515
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,440
sampling the small and you're like, your hands were full.

516
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,000
So you could not help me out at all.

517
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,300
There was no help being given.

518
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,700
Not that I needed a ton of stuff.

519
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,540
I was just like, oh yeah, where's

520
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:46,760
Jason?

521
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,460
Like he could go handle talking to or like ask a question for us or whatever.

522
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:50,860
We had been

523
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,580
getting nowhere and I think I was like, I'm going to go get some food.

524
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,200
I have, you know what we

525
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,540
haven't done is we haven't released this footage.

526
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,180
Oh yeah.

527
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,820
I do think I have it.

528
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,200
Sure.

529
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:01,680
So we should

530
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,400
just release that.

531
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,760
If you've got it, then absolutely.

532
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,960
Yeah, that would be cool.

533
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,140
Yeah.

534
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,720
You're behind the second gate or even club three.

535
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,420
We could put it behind the paywall.

536
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:08,800
Yeah.

537
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:09,460
But

538
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,060
there's, yeah.

539
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,860
So, so, and I play a hiding out in a Pelicans beak song for people.

540
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,080
You just went to random people at this.

541
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:16,860
Yes.

542
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,720
Which is what got everybody so scared at the opening,

543
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,560
the people that were working there, like the PR people thought something was going to go wrong.

544
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,780
Or so like we were coming to like fuck with Jimmy or something, which of course we would never do.

545
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,560
But they eventually once I honestly, and I've still this, I've told this story before, but

546
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,420
I swear to God, once Jimmy played, everyone chilled out.

547
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,000
All the employees were like,

548
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,740
what do you need?

549
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,460
Do you want us to help wrangle guests so you can get them on camera?

550
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,140
We'll help

551
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,020
you do whatever you want.

552
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,460
And I swear before that, everybody was being very weird toward us.

553
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,040
Like Christ, he changed the mood in there.

554
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,920
Very fabric.

555
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,000
And then everybody was ready to party.

556
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,880
Oh wow.

557
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,300
And the point, and I'll tie this.

558
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,980
So, so that's like the sec, maybe that we went,

559
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,960
we all went like opening day or opening week.

560
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,140
We all, there's a picture.

561
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,200
I just got a memory

562
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,840
about it recently when we were actually here, I think for the, for a Omega episode.

563
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,700
I've had a

564
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,540
birthday there.

565
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,700
I will say this.

566
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,680
I have not had a meal in there in a while and man, am I nostalgic

567
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,980
for this fucking place.

568
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,340
I felt real nostalgia when I was in here.

569
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,700
I had such like warm feelings that

570
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,280
I was like, oh, I had a birthday.

571
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,420
Like I had things here.

572
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,860
We've had a lot of meals here.

573
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,340
I have nice memories.

574
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:33,620
Yeah.

575
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,580
This place is empty and it seems like how can it sustain much longer?

576
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,840
But I really was struck by, oh man, so much of my life has been spent in this Margaritaville.

577
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:50,440
So many times have I had nice friends, friend interactions and meals and, you know, margaritas

578
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,280
on the porch.

579
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,240
I've hung out on the porch multiple times with different people.

580
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,060
My friend, Luke,

581
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,480
who should be on the podcast maybe later this year about Wisconsin Dells.

582
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,220
I told him about

583
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,260
some like unpleasant medical thing and he almost passed out back there.

584
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,220
Like I have so many,

585
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,240
there's so many things that have happened that I just, as soon as I was back here,

586
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,720
I had such good feeling.

587
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:17,260
I had such warm memories and I hope it doesn't just get closed all of a

588
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,180
sudden with no warning.

589
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,440
At this point, just with everything you've put on it in times of friends.

590
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,580
Even though we consider it decor wise, vibe wise, and more perfunctory Margaritaville.

591
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:27,580
Right.

592
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,960
But it doesn't matter.

593
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,820
It's what you make it.

594
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,440
It's what you put in there.

595
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,040
That's right.

596
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,660
What memories are stored.

597
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,360
And we should also give the context.

598
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,120
We were up there during about the third or fourth quarter

599
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,300
of the Super Bowl.

600
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,040
Yes.

601
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,200
We did watch the-

602
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,480
That was- We watched the end.

603
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:46,500
Yeah.

604
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,080
We watched the pretty exciting end of the Super Bowl.

605
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,400
Yeah.

606
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:49,520
Yeah.

607
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,660
Then you're like, oh, that's why nobody's here is because of Super Bowl.

608
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,300
You're also like,

609
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,680
well, it'd be kind of a fun place to watch.

610
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,300
There was a fun place to watch the Super Bowl.

611
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,000
It has not landed in anyone's head.

612
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:58,620
Yeah.

613
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,680
More people were there when we left.

614
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,020
Yeah.

615
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,400
At the very least, or at least like extra 20 people.

616
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,480
There was maybe 15 people eating when we started.

617
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,920
That's generous.

618
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,880
Maybe there were 30 people, 35 people when we left.

619
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,660
I think some movies they got now.

620
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,160
The park was closing.

621
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:16,960
Yeah.

622
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,960
There were a few more people.

623
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,500
Before that line, it was in the 536 kind of zone.

624
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,640
Eric said he was out there.

625
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,700
He was going to the Dune part one re-release

626
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,520
because there was an IMAX up at City Wall.

627
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,080
Right.

628
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,340
But yeah, any moment this could close.

629
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:31,960
Yeah.

630
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,080
Yeah.

631
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,600
I think so.

632
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,620
Well, it is, since we've talked about it, it was immortalized in the

633
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:43,600
smash hit Emmy nominated series, Jury Duty, which Andrew Weinberg was on the show put together.

634
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,280
So now there's this whole long sequence of events at this Margaritaville where they had to build

635
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,020
mirror walls and hide a crew and a whole operation happened.

636
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,280
Then I think they went back and had a

637
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,220
party up there to celebrate the show.

638
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:56,680
Yeah.

639
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,300
So that gave it some shine.

640
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,340
I think people were thinking about Margaritaville if they watched that.

641
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Good.

642
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,100
James Marsden's been there.

643
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,540
Wow.

644
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,680
A celebrity was paid to be there.

645
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,980
That makes me feel good.

646
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,440
Yeah.

647
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,000
I like him.

648
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,320
It feels like Mojo.

649
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:18,860
But the real question is how does it compare as an experience and as a meal?

650
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,820
Because this was our

651
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:26,100
main goal was to experience the same meal choice of all the darts we could have thrown at all the

652
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,500
restaurants that have establishments at both.

653
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,080
We chose Margaritaville.

654
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,160
I had a pretty horrible

655
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,620
time and the rest I don't think I have anything else great to say.

656
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,180
So going back, there's nowhere

657
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:35,880
to go but up.

658
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:36,780
You would think.

659
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,240
You'd think.

660
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,860
You would think, yeah.

661
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,480
You would hope.

662
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,360
You would really

663
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,600
put your feet.

664
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,840
Cross your fingers so hard that they start to bleed.

665
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,840
That is how that's what I was going to do.

666
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,200
Your finger bones start cracking a little bit.

667
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,240
You're crossing them so aggressively.

668
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,220
I snapped the tops of my finger bones off.

669
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:57,480
Yeah.

670
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,820
We were almost, I will say we were seated at a booth and then we were moved to a bigger table.

671
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,260
I was excited because it looked like Jason was going to be able to, I have a photo here,

672
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,840
Jason was going to be able to change the temperature in the restaurant.

673
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,620
It looked like there was a thermostat.

674
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,380
I was sitting next to the thermostat.

675
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:11,720
Yeah.

676
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,840
And you got really excited.

677
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,940
I was like, oh good, Jason will be able to surf the temperature in here.

678
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,680
Surf it out.

679
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,940
A couple types of surfing.

680
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,260
It's under a picture of Jimmy surfing on the wall.

681
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,560
That must be why they put it there.

682
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,360
They're probably thinking about temperature surfing.

683
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,080
Don't make it too hot or too cold.

684
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,180
Electricity ain't free.

685
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,080
Was that Jimmy saying that?

686
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,560
That was Jimmy.

687
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,300
He's chill.

688
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,200
He's a dad.

689
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:34,700
He's got a paper.

690
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,240
Dad are always worried about the thermostat.

691
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,320
That is true.

692
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,980
Look, that happened to Scott and I when we became fathers.

693
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,380
Oh yeah.

694
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,020
Y'all constant.

695
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,640
Hyper obsessive about the thermostat.

696
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,900
Hard to do in California.

697
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,360
The insulation is so terrible everywhere.

698
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,780
Oh, we know.

699
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,040
We're pretending, we're doing the dad bit and Jason sounds more like a dad than any dad I've ever met.

700
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,600
I gotta crank it to the 70s to feel anything.

701
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,400
And I like my apartment building.

702
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,720
It's a nice building.

703
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,760
It gets really drafty.

704
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,440
That had the tone of something really like darkly sexual or something too.

705
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,480
Or like I have to just to feel anything I have to.

706
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,920
I have to crank it up to 70 to feel anything.

707
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,520
Just to feel anything.

708
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,300
It's like from the movie Crank.

709
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,240
I have to take seven Viagra just to feel something.

710
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,400
Oh my god.

711
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,740
Just to get a little hint of a feeling.

712
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,880
Well I was just talking about thermostats.

713
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,580
I don't know why you had to take it and make it filthy.

714
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,120
It was you.

715
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,320
The tone is what really inspired me.

716
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,560
I maintain.

717
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,760
Let's talk about appetizers.

718
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,300
All right.

719
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:43,940
Go ahead.

720
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,700
So the appetizer menu was all right in Orlando.

721
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,760
It was one of the relative successes.

722
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,360
That's right.

723
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,500
Of the experience.

724
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,220
And yet two of these were not available.

725
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,680
Pretzel sticks were nowhere to be found.

726
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,240
Why do we decide that we say C-O-N-C-H?

727
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,080
I believe Conch or Conch.

728
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,500
Either one is acceptable.

729
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:08,220
Great.

730
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:08,960
Conch.

731
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,520
They didn't have Conch fritters.

732
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,220
No Conch.

733
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,680
No Conch.

734
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,780
So we're down again a little bit because two of the only good things are the other one

735
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,220
unavailable.

736
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,960
We did a trade out for fried pickles which I thought were pretty good.

737
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,580
Pretty good.

738
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:25,800
I agree.

739
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,240
Pretty good.

740
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,900
Now we're cooking.

741
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,200
Pretty good.

742
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:33,600
We went with Lava Lava Shrimp which I spoke highly of and have at most of these establishments.

743
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,660
In doing a side-by-side comparison, noticed $1 cheaper.

744
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,100
$1 cheaper.

745
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,160
And okay, so this puts, I see.

746
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,500
So maybe, I mean, because I thought that was a

747
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,020
strangely expensive meal to be so terrible in Orlando.

748
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,320
Yeah.

749
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,380
So like, okay, if this price is coming down, that makes me feel all right.

750
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:56,240
And then the Lava Lava Shrimp comes out, I think mildly superior.

751
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,820
Almost the same, but like a 2%

752
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,120
bump.

753
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:03,280
So we save a buck, we tiny, the fraction of quality.

754
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,980
Okay, mood's looking up a little bit.

755
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:06,460
Yeah.

756
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,160
No, I agree.

757
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:11,720
There was a feeling food-wise of like, okay, like a cautious optimism.

758
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,220
Yeah.

759
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:12,460
Yeah.

760
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,540
There was another appetizer, but we will let a guest explain that.

761
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:18,900
Drinks.

762
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,460
Drinks did nothing good to set the tone for me in Orlando.

763
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,760
I got the same drink,

764
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,100
as it was available.

765
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,440
This is the perfect margarita, which it was anything but in Orlando.

766
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,740
Comparing the two, $1.

767
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,140
25 cheaper out here.

768
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,340
I like this.

769
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,100
This is good.

770
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,040
This little shavings

771
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,220
make you feel a little better.

772
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:41,660
Yeah.

773
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,940
How often is something cheaper in Hollywood, California?

774
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,120
This is true.

775
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:46,560
Yeah.

776
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,940
And then it makes you wonder prices in Texas or

777
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,640
other states this establishment is in.

778
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,960
Slight differences in the copy.

779
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,600
In the Orlando one,

780
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,340
it said for margarita aficionados.

781
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,300
What a boast.

782
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,980
Over here, it said for margarita aficionados only.

783
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:06,580
Yeah.

784
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,200
I am so curious about all these little changes.

785
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,040
That's interesting to me.

786
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,780
It was a very different menu in a lot of ways.

787
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,260
I think more items.

788
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,660
It felt like a more busy,

789
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:27,520
stacked menu, but kind of the same fonts and types of photos they're drawing from.

790
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,820
a fairly different copy like that.

791
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:42,480
Well, when I go to Comic Con this year and I go down to, of course, the margaritaville that'll

792
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,160
be the top of the new San Diego Margaritaville Hotel, we'll do another episode and then we'll

793
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,780
talk about what the changes in the copy are there.

794
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,640
We're in heaven.

795
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,740
It's number 11.

796
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:55,760
Because as you know, I'm sure I did a chunk on going up to that restaurant and it was not

797
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,580
fully themed yet.

798
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,540
So I was getting a menu from the old restaurant, even though it had the

799
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,460
margaritaville tables.

800
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,380
There's a whole other one.

801
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,180
What episode was that?

802
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:02,900
That's a good question.

803
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,540
I don't remember.

804
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,080
Oh, wow.

805
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,340
But I definitely mentioned on the show.

806
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:10,940
So yeah, I assume it's fully themed now and I assume it is full copy and everything.

807
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,500
That'll be correct.

808
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,780
So in July, we'll talk about that.

809
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:21,580
Did earlier today's experience do anything to make your faith in this brand waver in any way?

810
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,100
Because here we are talking about future plans, future episode discussions even.

811
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,920
Yeah, that's a good question.

812
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,200
That was a bad, I know mine was worse,

813
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,040
but that was not good.

814
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,600
And but yet nothing.

815
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,000
Yeah.

816
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,100
Well, again, I think I had the best technical experience, just the fact that the

817
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:45,180
burger was a little misshapen and rushed the extra patty thrown on in a hasty manner.

818
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,080
That's probably what was not finished yet.

819
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,380
Yeah.

820
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,140
But as far as the taste was OK,

821
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,000
I mean, I have thoughts.

822
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,500
I actually have, I think,

823
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,220
thought some criticism that I will level against something here, but I'll get to that in a second.

824
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,720
So for me, though, I mean, again, it's the feeling.

825
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,400
I went in there and it's more about that feeling.

826
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,040
It's more about

827
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:10,100
to feel something like a thermostat boy like myself with the 70.

828
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:10,340
Yes.

829
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,220
Sometimes I just go into the Margaritaville just to feel something,

830
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,560
just to get an erection.

831
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,680
Crank it up to 70.

832
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,080
He admitted it.

833
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,580
Not the time.

834
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:19,340
Sometimes.

835
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,700
Look, look, I've turned.

836
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,900
I'm an older man now.

837
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,340
And sometimes you need help.

838
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,640
And the help I need is to go up to City Walk and go to a Margaritaville.

839
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,200
All you have to do and then I will get fully of intercourse is to just go up,

840
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,680
get through some parking hassle.

841
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,440
I actually they rerouted me over this.

842
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,860
I ended up in Jurassic instead of Curious George.

843
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,100
And then I was surprised by.

844
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,000
Then you do that.

845
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,820
Then you have an hour and a half sit down meal.

846
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,760
Then you drive back down the hill, fight through some traffic and then you can go fuck.

847
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,720
Yeah, of course.

848
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,440
That's what I'm saying.

849
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,160
Yeah.

850
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,700
First of all, everybody knew what I was saying.

851
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,200
So you didn't actually have to explain all that,

852
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,280
but they knew what I meant.

853
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,640
That's all part of it, too.

854
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,640
That's all part of parking hassle also adds to the erection.

855
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,160
It's very, yes, unpredictable.

856
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,940
It's finally deep into the side.

857
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,900
We're finally cutting through what has all been about.

858
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,760
It all turns us all on.

859
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,580
You get it now.

860
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,020
Restores parking.

861
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,640
This is to get hard.

862
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:13,160
You don't have to click on those Instagram ads for every like,

863
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:18,140
you know, hymns or Roman or all those, you know,

864
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:24,600
Internet startups where it's like, well, you see a doctor, quote unquote.

865
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,920
No, the only ones you should ever use are ones that happen to get advertised on this show.

866
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:29,480
Of course.

867
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,080
We picked the good ones.

868
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,780
But other than that, we search high and low for quality.

869
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:34,480
Sure.

870
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:40,340
So the the just oh, if you unless you had more, but no, I don't know.

871
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,180
But clearly it's still it's still coursing through your veins.

872
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,600
I don't think what we figured out the meal could have been 10 times worse in Orlando.

873
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,100
And I don't think my faith would have been shaken.

874
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,400
I don't think it would have mattered a fucking ounce.

875
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,760
This is I mean, I guess, you know, it's a bit of a religion for you.

876
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:01,100
And, you know, if you're truly into a faith, you don't bail just because no race gave a bad homily.

877
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,460
No, absolutely.

878
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,380
Now, if he puked on me in the homily,

879
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:11,220
which feels like aesthetically akin to the meal I had, maybe I'd at least take one week off of church.

880
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:16,940
But besides that, yeah, I mean, certainly you yeah, you adjust your expectations for church.

881
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:21,100
You know, if I got food poisoning at both these locations, maybe I just don't order the food.

882
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,700
I go in and have the perfect margarita.

883
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,600
You know, you just change exactly what you do.

884
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,720
You don't ever change that you go.

885
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,100
Exactly.

886
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,980
Going is the basis of the faith.

887
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,940
But that's all that's another.

888
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:35,000
You make a commitment that when you go into a chain restaurant, that is a sacred bond.

889
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,400
You don't ever break that.

890
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:36,800
Yeah.

891
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,660
And that's I think you can expand that out into this philosophy we have with CityWalk.

892
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,040
I think it's really what is going on here.

893
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,080
I mean, look, I can quibble with I this one's

894
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,440
dead to me.

895
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,080
That one's dead to me.

896
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,100
I still go.

897
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,540
You'll go and end up up there.

898
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,720
You'll just make adjustments.

899
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,060
That's really all you learn.

900
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,540
You're right.

901
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,540
You make a broad scale.

902
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,580
It is what I'm doing.

903
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,020
Right.

904
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:56,220
Yep.

905
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,260
You have you.

906
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:02,400
Your religion is CityWalk and you will never let that get out.

907
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,920
That will never leave you.

908
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,180
That is something you will believe until the day you die.

909
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,820
All you will do, though, is like avoid a certain wet burrito because it may be shit uncontrollably.

910
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,560
That's the difference.

911
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,420
That's what we're talking about here.

912
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:19,260
That's the premise of this whole saga in a lot of ways.

913
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:20,800
Just change you.

914
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,960
Make little changes

915
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,120
to your behavior.

916
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,500
Yes.

917
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:23,920
Yes.

918
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,140
To avoid the shitting.

919
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,920
And we honor our Christ,

920
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,840
who is a ghost boy who got a staph infection in a fountain.

921
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,840
And he was seated at the right hand of Jimmy Buffett.

922
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,520
Oh, yeah.

923
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,380
Forever and ever.

924
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:37,680
Amen.

925
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,280
Yes, man.

926
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:44,580
The margarita shows up and unlike the other one, it wasn't all ice.

927
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,800
I could taste margarita ingredients.

928
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,320
Yeah.

929
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,720
I could taste alcohol.

930
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,240
This was a superior experience.

931
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,280
We're looking good at this point.

932
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,200
I gotta say by just the drink round looking all right.

933
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,500
You guys anything at the drink round?

934
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,240
I mean, I just had a bottle beer again,

935
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:04,140
the Landshark Lager, and it was pretty much the same, which was fine.

936
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:04,440
Good.

937
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,240
Sure.

938
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:05,860
OK.

939
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,160
Yep.

940
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:07,280
Oh, yeah.

941
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,680
I ordered a beer at one point and then they made me have the experience

942
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,920
of the bottle.

943
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,500
Yes, right.

944
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,300
Not the draft.

945
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,880
And you choose that because you can look at I was forced into it.

946
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,020
I was like, I want a draft, though.

947
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,640
I'm so drinking a bottle of a restaurant.

948
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,480
You didn't just like looking at it.

949
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,820
Why else am I getting a beer here?

950
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:27,160
Yeah, that's the only one where I would choose the bottle.

951
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,480
Otherwise, you're not doing that.

952
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,420
Otherwise, I'm not.

953
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,200
Yeah, I don't.

954
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:30,620
I will.

955
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,080
I don't care.

956
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,060
I don't care that much.

957
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,440
But yeah, of course, if you've got a good draft and it's got

958
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:40,160
the foam on top and everything like that is obviously superior chilled, nicely chilled glass.

959
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,200
And I like this setup for Landshark Lager.

960
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,900
Landshark on draft.

961
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,520
Yeah.

962
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,060
I should have specified maybe is what I should have done because they do have the draft.

963
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,840
Yeah, I don't know why it didn't come.

964
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,640
So I guess that's a complaint, but not a big complaint.

965
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,480
Also, the same beer meals.

966
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,040
I don't know which order to go in.

967
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,660
Does anyone feel like they have more of a story than not about their meal?

968
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,920
I don't really.

969
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,540
I mean, mine isn't so spectacular.

970
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:05,480
OK.

971
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,920
Do you want to start with Jason?

972
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:13,820
Because, Jason, you were you got special permission from the sector keeper.

973
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,280
Yes.

974
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:20,280
You and only you were able to adjust your meal and not have the terrible jambalaya.

975
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,140
Jambalaya.

976
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:21,620
OK.

977
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,040
Which I believe in Florida, the thing that did me in.

978
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,240
I scream.

979
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,980
Oh, on the menu, it says there's poison in it.

980
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:30,280
Yeah.

981
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,240
There's rat poison.

982
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,240
It's poison.

983
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,200
It says you get what you deserve, little pig.

984
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,260
And so I was like, I don't even know why I picked that.

985
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,340
If that's the language.

986
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,580
You was it was a challenge.

987
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,980
You get what you deserve, you little pig.

988
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,900
That is what I heard from Swine Not.

989
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,520
Jimmy Buffett's pig character.

990
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,940
That's come up in an episode.

991
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,940
Didn't that Christmas album have some weird song about like running the pig to nut.

992
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:52,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

993
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,740
But I don't think it was Rumpy from Swine Not, his book that he wrote.

994
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:04,000
So in Florida, what I opted for was the sausage, sausage and chicken.

995
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:16,260
Jimmy's jam and jambalaya, Cajun rice, spicy broth, which was weird because there there's no any broth

996
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,520
gets absorbed by the rice.

997
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,820
And the thing that did me in Florida was it immediately made me lightheaded

998
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,280
and was far too spicy.

999
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:32,740
So out here, I opted for what I thought was very safe and thankfully

1000
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:35,360
did turn out to be very safe.

1001
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,000
Got too many Margaritaville websites open and they keep reloading.

1002
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,320
How much?

1003
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,000
Wait, wait, wait.

1004
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,520
List all the websites you have.

1005
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,020
Just the two, Orlando and Hollywood.

1006
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,340
You're looking at the menus.

1007
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,780
Maybe at the San Diego Hotel open too.

1008
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,440
Booking a stay maybe.

1009
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,520
Sorry, I will not be staying at that San Diego Hotel.

1010
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:54,760
Why not?

1011
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,640
Why not?

1012
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,260
So I don't know.

1013
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,760
I don't think I'll be heading to Comic-Con anytime soon.

1014
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,360
I got the Landshark Lager fish and chips this time.

1015
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,980
Hand dipped in our Landshark batter,

1016
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,440
jalapeno tartar sauce, cilantro, lime, cold salt, french fries.

1017
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,980
It was fine.

1018
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,820
It did not hurt me.

1019
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,300
It tasted like slightly nicer fish sticks.

1020
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,040
But it was a little spicy.

1021
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,900
But a fast food version of spice.

1022
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,360
Yes, it was the tartar sauce.

1023
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,580
The jalapeno was a little

1024
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,320
spicier.

1025
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,040
Oh, it was okay.

1026
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,780
But yeah, it was good.

1027
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:43,040
It's what initially I was going to try to order in Florida and then I went,

1028
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,620
too much fried food.

1029
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,320
I should get rice and chicken.

1030
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,100
No, my first instinct of all that

1031
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,660
fried food.

1032
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,300
It's safe.

1033
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,820
It can't hurt me.

1034
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,720
That searing hot oil it's cooked in.

1035
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,800
Cooks away

1036
00:38:59,380 --> 00:38:59,900
imperfection.

1037
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,180
It cooks away all your troubles.

1038
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,700
That's the way I think about it.

1039
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,620
If you're having various problems, ailments, hot oil is always going to be there.

1040
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,480
That's your best bet.

1041
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,520
So let's all, I'm drinking more soda.

1042
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,820
I'm eating more fried food.

1043
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,020
That's your New Year's resolution in 2024.

1044
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,020
I'm thriving.

1045
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,380
Guzzling more oil.

1046
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,220
More hot oil.

1047
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,960
Drill baby drill is Jason's road to hell.

1048
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:25,580
Hot oil though, would it warm you up when the thermostat isn't doing what you want it to do?

1049
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:32,920
Yeah, little warm fish and chips, which I would call these warm, not hot.

1050
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,620
That sounds like shit.

1051
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,900
You're issuing a compliment, but you wouldn't call them hot.

1052
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,660
You'd call them warm.

1053
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:46,340
Well, we add a little bit of, I just started eating mine and Jane,

1054
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,360
she also got something slightly different.

1055
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,560
I said, I'm not going to make you order the same thing,

1056
00:39:52,960 --> 00:40:00,080
which she had gotten like blackened chicken Alfredo, I think in Orlando, not on the menu out here.

1057
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:01,480
Okay, different.

1058
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,860
So she ordered the garlic cream pasta.

1059
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,360
Wait, sorry, Bullet Mist, different Bullet Chosen.

1060
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,240
Yes.

1061
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:11,920
But it's basically like practically butter noodles.

1062
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,620
She got the garlic cream pasta.

1063
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,020
It's cavatapi or herb garlic cream sauce.

1064
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,440
That's what she ordered.

1065
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,100
What she got was the

1066
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:25,340
brought out was the lemon Parmesan pasta filled with shrimp.

1067
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,700
And I think she had flagged down the

1068
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:34,700
waiter and go like, hi, this is not what I ordered and I didn't ask for any shrimp in it.

1069
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:42,880
So they happily took it back and, oh, I don't know about happily, but I feel like they brought her

1070
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,480
the right thing.

1071
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,220
They wanted her to eat that shrimp so bad.

1072
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,400
They brought her the right-

1073
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,100
They were so bummed out.

1074
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,160
They were, yeah, they didn't get to watch her eat the shrimp.

1075
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,800
They said, could you eat it though, maybe?

1076
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:53,920
Oh yeah, we understand.

1077
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:54,360
Yeah.

1078
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,500
Eat it please though.

1079
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,720
Yeah, they said that.

1080
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,960
They did bring her the right thing.

1081
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,300
And I feel like that someone said a comment

1082
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:07,080
like, sorry, the chef thought every pasta had shrimp in it, which is not correct.

1083
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,660
So a little bit of ordering hijinks.

1084
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:14,160
There was a, yeah, when the chef learned the term pasta,

1085
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,160
when this was taught in cooking school.

1086
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:16,540
Yeah.

1087
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,760
You think like-

1088
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,720
If this was his first day or her, whoever's first day, I'm impressed with just the okayness

1089
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,620
of everything else.

1090
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:25,800
Yes, true.

1091
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,080
If that was the first day.

1092
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,860
Yes, because otherwise pretty, other than the thinking of the basic definition of pasta,

1093
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,760
includes shrimp.

1094
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:33,860
Right.

1095
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,640
Or the specific day.

1096
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,380
Maybe there's this one dish, there was some cute-

1097
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,120
Maybe no one ever ordered this dish before.

1098
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,860
This is possible.

1099
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,700
Have I told this story before,

1100
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:47,120
or have I told it 20 times, or about the being at the Knott's Chicken Dinner restaurant where

1101
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:53,500
Erin ordered something vegetarian and then the waitress is like, oh, yes, yes.

1102
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,700
And then it took

1103
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:59,960
an hour and a half to two hours to appear because no one's ever ordered this ever.

1104
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,700
It's not on the

1105
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,400
menu anymore.

1106
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,220
Somebody had to hurry to the store.

1107
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,280
This is always, I can't think of a good example,

1108
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:10,600
but this is a very funny phenomenon in a store or a restaurant when you're sure you've stumped the

1109
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,440
person and then there's just too much going on.

1110
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,240
Yeah, yeah.

1111
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,840
Where they won't say no.

1112
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,100
Right.

1113
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,340
And yet there's just a, and that's going to be right out.

1114
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,280
It's going to be right out.

1115
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,080
It is coming.

1116
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,220
You're my friend.

1117
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,680
Bigger smiles at you than anyone else at the table.

1118
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,520
I mean, it's just funny because you point at the menu and you're like, here, it's right here.

1119
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,720
I'm not crazy, I swear.

1120
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,760
Yeah, that's true.

1121
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,200
But some of these play, it's just like,

1122
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:46,660
some things might get put on menus just as a blue sky to make somebody on the board happy.

1123
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:52,920
And then years go by and no one orders it until all of a sudden one person throws the whole thing

1124
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,520
for a loop.

1125
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:58,600
And they have to go knock on the doors of all the other CityWalk kitchens.

1126
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,540
Do you have this kind of pepper?

1127
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,020
Do you have any help?

1128
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,140
Do not have this.

1129
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,900
They Google, like there's a computer out on the stove.

1130
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,740
How do you do this?

1131
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:07,700
I don't know how to do

1132
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:07,820
that.

1133
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:10,340
That's what I would be like doing, being a chef.

1134
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,780
Yeah, exactly what I'd be like.

1135
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:19,460
Long story short, my meal of fish sticks and ice water was a better experience than Jambalaya

1136
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,640
and Bahama Mama.

1137
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:26,240
I know that sounds insane, but I was like, after the Florida, I was like,

1138
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,500
I do not, I cannot afford to repeat that experience.

1139
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,300
Yes, there was this, you know,

1140
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,080
like not to have your health issues front and center, but I thought it was kind of funny that

1141
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,360
you said, I can't do the same thing again.

1142
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,940
And we didn't realize that's why.

1143
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:39,580
And Mike and I were

1144
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,680
like, no, no, no, you have to.

1145
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,240
And you said, no, no, no, I'll die.

1146
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,760
I have things to do.

1147
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:47,960
There

1148
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,300
were important things you had to do in a few days.

1149
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,500
Yes, I did.

1150
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,580
I couldn't get, I had had like a bad

1151
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:57,120
flare up from food poisoning and from a cold.

1152
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,220
And I was like, I don't want to tempt fate.

1153
00:43:59,460 --> 00:43:59,600
I'm

1154
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,140
ordering something very plain.

1155
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,740
Jason, I have appointments.

1156
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,660
Jason, where was the food poisoning

1157
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,200
from?

1158
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,660
Where did the food poisoning happen?

1159
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,900
I think it was like at a yogurt from my house

1160
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,540
that had been in there too long.

1161
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,000
Okay.

1162
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:11,520
Okay.

1163
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,820
Because God knows if it was yet again here.

1164
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,240
I know you had a, wait, like a Yoplait or something?

1165
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,360
Like a Chobani?

1166
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,000
No.

1167
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,220
But was it like

1168
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:22,580
expired?

1169
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:23,280
Like what?

1170
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,580
I, it must have been.

1171
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,800
I didn't see the date.

1172
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,300
Like they, they, we had a bunch in

1173
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,580
there that weren't expired, but.

1174
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,580
It sounds like it was expired.

1175
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,760
Maybe it was a day or two past

1176
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,060
and I got the date wrong.

1177
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,960
Suddenly then Jason's like, well, I don't know.

1178
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,140
Cause all I had in that

1179
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:48,760
24 hours was that yogurt and a lobster and cheese crepe from the crepe cafe at city walk.

1180
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,700
I know it

1181
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,280
wasn't that.

1182
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,260
So it was a one day old Chobani yogurt.

1183
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,280
That must have been what it was.

1184
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:58,660
The

1185
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:02,400
K and crab with the K is never done.

1186
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,000
You can never get sick off that.

1187
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:03,760
You can not get suck

1188
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,580
off imitation crab.

1189
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,740
You've asserted this.

1190
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,640
I'm sure some places maybe have prepared and gotten people

1191
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:11,820
sick.

1192
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,160
Was that is crab with a K?

1193
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,040
It's never done me wrong.

1194
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:14,940
Crab with a K.

1195
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:15,580
Like man, that sucks.

1196
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,140
With a K.

1197
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,200
Yeah.

1198
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,620
If you see, if you see a K or you don't always see a K.

1199
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,540
Just a K, no C.

1200
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,620
But it's the K

1201
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,200
of quality.

1202
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,240
For example, if you see K and the word quality, if you see, if you're the first star

1203
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,420
promises quality and it's KWA.

1204
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:31,860
Yeah.

1205
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,100
Then you know it's good.

1206
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:33,440
Yeah.

1207
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:33,600
Yeah.

1208
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,380
You gotta go.

1209
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:35,380
Um, let me,

1210
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:36,200
I'll go to mine.

1211
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,480
Uh, uh, I once again got fish tacos.

1212
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,660
I did repeat it.

1213
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:40,780
Right.

1214
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:40,980
Right.

1215
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:41,540
One dollar

1216
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:42,580
cheaper yet again.

1217
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:46,320
I like, I wouldn't normally be so nickel and dime except when the first meal

1218
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,680
you're dealing with is terrible.

1219
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,080
This is all about comparisons as well.

1220
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,420
That's what these two episodes

1221
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,300
are all about.

1222
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:58,900
The little things, um, such as that also they don't boast crispy land shark

1223
00:45:58,900 --> 00:45:59,580
batter.

1224
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:06,580
Uh, so there's not that fake thing they put in it because I don't, you know, they didn't say

1225
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:13,740
crispy batter, but the tacos did appear and they were crispy, which the other ones were not at all.

1226
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:14,920
Those are a soggy mess.

1227
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,280
Yeah.

1228
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,320
There was a little bit of a crunch to these.

1229
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,480
Um, and the big, the thing

1230
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:25,780
that blew my mind that would not normally, but given what we'd been through, this small detail

1231
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,180
made so much difference.

1232
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,660
And that was the little zigzag taco tray.

1233
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,240
How far does that go

1234
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:40,060
for presentation and practicality that we're, you know, so the, so that means that the tacos aren't

1235
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:48,100
laying in a pool of Kramer suffocated by Kramer, even if that Kramer was there drowning in a shallow

1236
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,720
pool.

1237
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,100
These tacos were sad because you feel a shallow pool.

1238
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,260
It should have been able to get up.

1239
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:54,740
Exactly.

1240
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:55,460
Yeah.

1241
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,740
Your plate in Hollywood was very aesthetically pleasing.

1242
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,880
Very, very might be over

1243
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,920
doing it, but in comparison, it looked good.

1244
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:09,240
Like a room, like it, it compared to the Orlando was

1245
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:14,600
like a room service, big serving tray with the big like cover of the lid you pull off and the butler

1246
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,980
is like, uh, your meal is served, sir.

1247
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,340
Whatever, however he sounds, I don't have served.

1248
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:20,700
I'm the

1249
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:20,920
Butler.

1250
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:28,080
I, I, I, yeah, I don't, that I'm not like, I don't have to pick up the tacos off of the,

1251
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,040
off of the plates.

1252
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,700
They are elevated for me.

1253
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,520
Well, they're that much closer to my mouth.

1254
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,100
So I will

1255
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,960
save so much more work with my elbow.

1256
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,600
So that's great.

1257
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,000
And it's not, they aren't going to get

1258
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:38,440
suffocated.

1259
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,240
This, this little touch made a big difference.

1260
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,240
Also the fact that like the,

1261
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:49,980
that they separated the rice and beans instead of plopping the gross beans on top of the gross

1262
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:53,280
rice, thus making it one inseparable pool.

1263
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,200
It gave me the choice.

1264
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,120
Suddenly I am like,

1265
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:03,200
maybe you need these terrifying experiences to appreciate basics because now things about regular

1266
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:10,640
okay, Mexican restaurants suddenly I like, oh yes, I like that I can control my own portions of race

1267
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,080
beans.

1268
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,220
Yeah, no little things like, I don't know.

1269
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,260
It's just like the, it's like the sun's seeming

1270
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:24,460
brighter to me now as usual, you know, Margaritaville Hollywood, Margaritaville Omega has

1271
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:28,520
sort of taught us a lesson, taught you a lesson and now you'll never forget it.

1272
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,380
It'll be a memory

1273
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:33,880
from there to not, not a look, whatever, not a gift towards him.

1274
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,100
Now look, overlook something as

1275
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,260
as a separation between rice and beans.

1276
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:38,900
Yeah.

1277
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,700
Now when, yeah, when I experienced that, I know that

1278
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:46,780
there's, this has been done with, with quality, with a quality, with a K and a chef's kiss.

1279
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:47,300
Exactly.

1280
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,100
And also with a K and a K and chef.

1281
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:49,780
It's beautiful.

1282
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,860
So better, definitely better.

1283
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:52,260
Better.

1284
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:52,540
Yeah.

1285
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:52,840
Mike.

1286
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:53,560
Okay.

1287
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:58,180
Double cheeseburger in paradise with a land shark logger.

1288
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:06,020
This was my order in

1289
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:10,560
I will say the one in Hollywood certainly was better presented.

1290
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,060
Well, now wasn't there, there

1291
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,220
was, this is a slight thing.

1292
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,320
Did, did you not customize the Orlando one to have the second

1293
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,000
patty?

1294
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:18,860
No, I did not.

1295
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:19,580
It was on the menu.

1296
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,440
Oh, I thought you, oh, I had this mistake.

1297
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:21,840
They were

1298
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,640
both on the menu.

1299
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,280
They were both double.

1300
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,160
That's the only reason I ordered.

1301
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,660
I would not stray from the

1302
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,560
menu for this assignment.

1303
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:27,240
I see.

1304
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:27,560
I see.

1305
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:27,940
Okay.

1306
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:28,240
Yeah.

1307
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,180
I just felt like, second patty.

1308
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:30,640
Exactly.

1309
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:30,940
I just

1310
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,780
felt like I wanted to get the iconic dish.

1311
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,460
But then when I saw there were two patties, I said,

1312
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:39,280
maybe what would be better than getting the iconic dish, but double.

1313
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,340
They do offer a double.

1314
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:40,860
Exactly.

1315
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,420
It's on the end.

1316
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,100
It's on both menus.

1317
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,260
Which makes it so much stranger to me now that

1318
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:48,560
it was so weird because you described something as if they had never done this before.

1319
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:49,060
Well,

1320
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:49,300
right.

1321
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,200
Especially the first time.

1322
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:55,480
I think that she just misheard me, the waiter in Orlando,

1323
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,380
but yeah, it's on, there's the two, they have two different sections.

1324
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:59,420
This is the Hollywood menu.

1325
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,460
So I already, yes, double cheeseburger.

1326
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,120
And they, they heard me correctly the first time and it came

1327
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,240
with two patties.

1328
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:11,820
And I think there was a little more beef in Orlando, but there was still a

1329
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:14,120
fucking ton of beef in Hollywood.

1330
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,600
And I've said this before on the show, probably on the last

1331
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:22,080
episode that like once a year I go, yeah, I'll get a double cheeseburger from Wendy's.

1332
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:22,520
And sometimes

1333
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,680
I go, man, the double cheeseburger Wendy's, that's the right amount of beef.

1334
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:27,000
That's delicious.

1335
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:27,700
I don't

1336
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,040
do that a lot, but at once in a while, it's, it's a nice thing.

1337
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,340
No double cheeseburger from Margaritaville.

1338
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:34,900
Do not do it.

1339
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,380
It's too much beef.

1340
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,960
It doesn't taste bad necessarily.

1341
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,220
It tastes fine, but it's too much

1342
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:41,600
beef.

1343
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,200
I did it twice, both places.

1344
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48,080
I just, I don't know what the poundage is on these actual patties

1345
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:53,520
is not finishable by a person that wants any of their arteries to remain unclogged.

1346
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:54,000
There's,

1347
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,780
there's a percentage I feel like of the full burger that should be the patty.

1348
00:50:59,800 --> 00:50:59,980
Yeah.

1349
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:00,460
And I don't know

1350
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:03,940
what that is, but it's not more than 60.

1351
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:08,500
No, and this much like Orlando, I left a similar amount of

1352
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,600
beef sitting on the plate.

1353
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:13,560
I was wondering, I was like, I see that pile, but I'm not going to ask.

1354
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:17,760
And it's still a dirty pile of beef was sitting on my plate when I left.

1355
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:19,240
I like to be a clean plate

1356
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,740
boy in general, but I couldn't be a clean plate boy.

1357
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,580
You realize they'll know, right?

1358
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:25,160
You probably

1359
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,940
should go find a planner to throw that in.

1360
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,000
Yes, absolutely.

1361
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,900
I should have done that.

1362
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:30,820
I try, you

1363
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:33,780
know, I tried to like kind of put it in a little small pile to make it look smaller.

1364
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,120
I didn't want

1365
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:34,980
to spread it out.

1366
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,160
So you design your, what you've left.

1367
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,800
I feel like your waste.

1368
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:39,800
I do this all the

1369
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,080
time.

1370
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:44,180
If I feel like I didn't eat, I do try to kind of make the plate look a certain way.

1371
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:44,480
So the

1372
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,080
person doesn't go, Oh, he hated it.

1373
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,920
Cause I just don't want to make somebody feel bad.

1374
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,000
Do you, okay.

1375
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,480
Maybe if someone has cooked you this meal, perhaps put at a restaurant,

1376
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:59,880
this doesn't often happen, but when it does happen, where I feel like I really didn't eat very much

1377
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:04,200
and it wasn't like awful enough to ever, I rarely, rarely send something back.

1378
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,120
But yeah, I do try to

1379
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,900
not like make it look like I left everything on the plate.

1380
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,420
So I kind of push it to one side.

1381
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,920
So like, you know, somebody comes back and goes, Oh, you hated this or whatever.

1382
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:15,320
I just don't,

1383
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,540
I don't want him to feel bad.

1384
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:16,920
Whatever.

1385
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:17,620
It's okay.

1386
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:18,600
It's fine.

1387
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:21,700
Do you think that anyone clearing

1388
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,560
plates that this margaritaville has ever looked at the plate?

1389
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,000
Well, the guy who was, who was waiting

1390
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,680
on us seemed young and new and perhaps might not have cared.

1391
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:31,640
Maybe did care.

1392
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,320
I don't know actually,

1393
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,420
but he seemed, he was nice.

1394
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:37,000
Um, but it's, it's possible you're correct in that they just go,

1395
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:39,720
and then they just pick it up and they bring to the back.

1396
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,600
It's probably more what is going to

1397
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:42,840
happen.

1398
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,620
But yeah, I do.

1399
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:44,740
I am conscious of that.

1400
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:45,960
I am conscious of that.

1401
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,200
If I don't feel like I

1402
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,540
waste shaping, I waste shape often, which I'm surprised that hasn't come up with.

1403
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:52,060
That is a,

1404
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,640
do you have any tips within that?

1405
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,100
Have you discovered any good ways to come back?

1406
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,560
You have to hide things sort of under things.

1407
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,060
So if you have a decorative lettuce, now we're talking,

1408
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,000
if we're something you're not even supposed to eat, then you tuck it under there.

1409
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:04,240
Yeah,

1410
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:04,520
perfect.

1411
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,260
Cause like I ate all the fries that came and the fries were fine.

1412
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:07,940
They were fine,

1413
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,000
like, or they were fine.

1414
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,580
So, but if I say I didn't eat half the fries, I might've like kind of show

1415
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:15,040
the fries under one of the big patties.

1416
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:18,440
And then like with the patties here, this isn't the final

1417
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,700
form of how I shaped it.

1418
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,700
I don't think necessarily, but I did try to make sure the patties were still

1419
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,700
stacked kind of on top of each other.

1420
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:25,900
Cause you spread the patties out.

1421
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:26,840
Now it's more surface area

1422
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:30,600
on the plate and you really like at first glance you go, Oh, we didn't eat anything.

1423
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,460
So if you

1424
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:36,640
stack them, the height wise, you're not necessarily going to see like I didn't eat all my God.

1425
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:36,780
He

1426
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,860
didn't eat like a, like a third of the meat or half of the meat.

1427
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,080
You didn't want to take those home

1428
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,640
in a doggy bag for Edwin.

1429
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,940
Would you have no Edwin can't Edwin's stomach is crazy.

1430
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,340
He can eat like

1431
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:48,760
a grain free Turkey and that's it.

1432
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:52,420
I think maybe a lot of the people here in this room could learn

1433
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:53,220
from Edwin.

1434
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:59,060
Maybe if we all tried to be more like Edwin eating grain free Turkey, yeah, it might be

1435
00:53:59,060 --> 00:53:59,820
better for all of us.

1436
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:04,480
Garfield can get the in and out, in and out has the doggy Patty.

1437
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:05,080
Yeah.

1438
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:05,540
Which is

1439
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:08,040
they just cook a hamburger Patty, no salt.

1440
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:09,820
So he's allowed to have that.

1441
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,240
Yeah, that's not bad.

1442
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:11,480
Yeah.

1443
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:12,700
No, he can't do beef though.

1444
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:13,860
You can't do beef.

1445
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:14,760
You can't do chicken.

1446
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,540
I guess a follow up question

1447
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:27,800
I have about the managing the meal waste is how do you go through life with a brain that thinks

1448
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,980
things like that?

1449
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:36,960
Well, I mean, I think I'm, I mean, honestly, I think it's, it causes me to thrive in

1450
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,700
so many different ways because of how conscientious I am about different elements of life.

1451
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:42,240
Where one

1452
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:42,880
seems odd.

1453
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,080
Another end of it is extremely helpful.

1454
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:45,760
Exactly.

1455
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:46,080
Yeah.

1456
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:47,300
Mike, I kind of understand where

1457
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:52,760
you're coming from, but this is a place with paper napkins feeling just ball up your paper napkin,

1458
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,260
throw it on the plate, hide the food.

1459
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,020
You could now that's another way to do it.

1460
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,020
Thank you for that tip

1461
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:57,460
as well.

1462
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:01,840
Cause you could ball it up in a napkin and then it just, it just, that especially just

1463
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,760
reads as garbage.

1464
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:03,580
Yeah.

1465
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:07,960
There's a full manifesto about how to do this, which is one of the verses

1466
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,120
of rapper's delight.

1467
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,360
If you want, if you want to break down.

1468
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,060
Oh yeah.

1469
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:13,640
How to deal with when you're

1470
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,500
in these situations.

1471
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:14,900
Sure.

1472
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,480
So, you know, here's what I'll say.

1473
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,420
I'm taking, I'm like pulling the

1474
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,080
meat apart here.

1475
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,260
Cause I'm also trying to do a little experimenting with it.

1476
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:22,660
Cause I haven't

1477
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:25,020
had a cheeseburger, regular cheeseburger in Paris in a little while.

1478
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,560
So I just, I took the, I just,

1479
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:28,920
I made a single cheeseburger.

1480
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:32,140
I fashioned a single cheeseburger, a single patty cheeseburger

1481
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,640
out of the meat.

1482
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:37,700
I took some of the meat out and then I took a bite out of the single patty

1483
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:38,240
cheeseburger.

1484
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,480
And I was like, this is actually kind of, this is like delicious.

1485
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,320
Like the bun was

1486
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:49,080
really like it had the thing where like they've, they've like, um, toasted it a little bit and the

1487
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,920
sauce like tasted really like much better than the one in Orlando.

1488
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,780
And I got a couple bites of

1489
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:59,560
like a kind of like delicious fast food cheeseburger, nothing fancy or whatever.

1490
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:00,200
But I remember being

1491
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:04,720
like, this is a hundred percent better than the double cheeseburger.

1492
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,960
So I got like three or four

1493
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,000
bites and I don't know if that was just a fluke or in Hollywood, they, the guy was making them extra

1494
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:11,680
good that day.

1495
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:16,820
I don't know, but I got a couple bites of what the single patty might be like.

1496
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,000
And it was good.

1497
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:18,660
I like good.

1498
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:19,380
I would say good.

1499
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,260
I wouldn't say fine.

1500
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,300
I would say good.

1501
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,120
That's a word that has not been said very often in this entire series.

1502
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,200
So I got like a teaser

1503
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,520
for a better cheeseburger at the end.

1504
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,520
It was like all your post credits, Marvel post credits

1505
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:35,900
for my meal where I got a nice, Oh, this is good.

1506
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:36,740
Like, this is going to be good.

1507
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,300
If I have this

1508
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,580
again, if this place doesn't close and I come back up here.

1509
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,660
So all you have to do is perform

1510
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:46,720
surgery on your meal and create to create a good meal.

1511
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,860
I was like a plastic surgeon or something

1512
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:56,360
and I fashioned a regular cheeseburger out of a double doing your cheeseburger meat experiments.

1513
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:57,280
Yes.

1514
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,440
I was experimenting with the beef.

1515
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,880
That makes me seem like more of a Dr.

1516
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:01,740
Muro type

1517
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:05,200
where I'm doing like your language.

1518
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,940
Some of it, all of it, I guess.

1519
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,580
So I don't know what your,

1520
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:14,920
yeah, you are the one like fussing with your, I didn't, I didn't notice this at all.

1521
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,300
Well, I didn't make a big, I'm going to show you guys.

1522
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:19,020
I don't want the waitstaff noticing

1523
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,220
that I'm performing experiments on my food.

1524
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,700
I want them to think I'm just happy and nice and

1525
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,880
they did a good job and I don't want anybody to be worried.

1526
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,900
I just want them to go, I did a good

1527
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:28,440
job here.

1528
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,600
That's what I want people that work at a restaurant to think.

1529
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:31,700
Do you think there's that

1530
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,660
possibility of somebody thinking you did a good job?

1531
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:37,080
No, I want them to think they did a good job.

1532
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,180
No, I don't want, I don't want praise.

1533
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,960
I'm not, I'm no, but I'm a regular guy when I go to these

1534
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:42,100
places.

1535
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:42,800
I don't want this show.

1536
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,720
I want attention on myself.

1537
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:45,760
That's what I'm telling them.

1538
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:46,080
I'm not

1539
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,040
performing experiments.

1540
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,680
I'm not walking around with a knife.

1541
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:49,420
I'm doing it.

1542
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,320
I'm hunched over.

1543
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,440
They don't know.

1544
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:52,440
They're not sure.

1545
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:55,140
You stack condiments so that you have a wall separating

1546
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,480
you from any passersby.

1547
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:56,840
Exactly.

1548
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,200
So you can do your experiments in private.

1549
00:57:58,580 --> 00:57:58,940
Exactly.

1550
00:57:59,080 --> 00:57:59,480
So no,

1551
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,940
yeah, I don't want to draw attention to myself.

1552
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,080
Well, you also were distracted because once the

1553
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,240
Niners lost, you started yelling, I'm ruined.

1554
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:07,900
I'm ruined.

1555
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,380
Yes, I, yes, I did.

1556
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,340
My book, I called my

1557
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:16,840
bookie after that and said, lose my info and I have to disappear.

1558
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,680
I can't afford any more double

1559
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,260
cheeseburgers after this.

1560
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,680
Only single patties for me.

1561
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,300
Well, it works out better.

1562
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:25,720
Now, you know,

1563
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:26,740
I'm not going to do this.

1564
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,160
That's the way to go.

1565
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:34,100
That's all of our meal reviews, but there was

1566
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:40,300
another party in our party who I mentioned and you know what?

1567
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:44,860
He actually left his thing from

1568
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,900
yesterday, the last time that we saw him.

1569
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:51,040
And I wonder if we could use this.

1570
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,000
It might actually,

1571
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,560
you know, the mysteries of the multiverse.

1572
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:56,940
I'm hoping that if we were to ring this,

1573
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:03,540
it would actually time travel us back to that night and to the presence of the level keeper.

1574
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,820
So let me see if I do this and if it works.

1575
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,860
Boys, boys, boys, my voice sounds the same.

1576
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:15,020
Exactly.

1577
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,920
We all remember exactly what it was.

1578
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,340
There is some other noise because we've jumped

1579
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:22,380
through a gate hole.

1580
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:23,380
Was that one of them?

1581
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,680
Yeah, a gate hole.

1582
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:29,240
And we're now just at post the meal at

1583
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,840
Margaritaville Omega, which is of course Hollywood.

1584
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,300
So you've now done as close to the same meal as

1585
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,940
you could, although you had some complications.

1586
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:41,040
You weren't able to do exactly the same between

1587
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:41,840
Alpha and Omega.

1588
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:48,460
At Alpha, I got a grilled chicken sandwich and here I got a grilled chicken platter.

1589
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:52,920
But you felt like it's like similar spicing.

1590
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,700
I think the same preparation, the same sides,

1591
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:02,460
the same mango salsa, just more expensive minus bread.

1592
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,760
Yeah, we've been trying to track prices.

1593
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:08,680
Yeah, let us know those amounts if you took pictures or we'll cross check the menus.

1594
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,900
Um, overall verdict?

1595
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:12,720
Fine.

1596
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:16,100
But remind me, you were not at Fine.

1597
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,600
Oh, wait, wait, was Fine in,

1598
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,780
was it Fine with a caveat in Alpha?

1599
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,700
I already don't recall.

1600
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,880
I would say Orlando was below Fine.

1601
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:27,380
Below Fine.

1602
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:27,840
Okay.

1603
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:28,800
All right.

1604
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,320
So Fine is an improvement.

1605
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,700
I mean, do you consider that,

1606
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:39,280
if you were on the general stock ticker of Margaritaville, if it was way down with Alpha,

1607
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:40,720
where do you feel like it is now?

1608
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:46,060
I think after Alpha, Margaritaville was deeply in the red

1609
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:48,940
and now they are even.

1610
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:53,860
Okay, well, that's something that's better than all the way down.

1611
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:59,180
I drinks, you had to do something different and you lived it up, I feel.

1612
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:00,280
They no longer,

1613
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:06,700
here at the Omega Serve, the offer up the passion fruit guava margarita.

1614
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:08,000
So instead,

1615
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,880
I got a margarita flight.

1616
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,640
Which had quite the array of colors.

1617
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,940
Yeah, four mini marks and great

1618
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:24,620
flavors such as light green, yellow, blue, and deeper green.

1619
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:28,820
And you, I don't think knew the

1620
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:33,720
contents of those because I asked which margaritas are we sampling and.

1621
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:36,580
Not identified in menu or

1622
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,080
in presentation.

1623
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:45,300
I would say maybe one of them, just trying to game it out from the menu.

1624
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:47,960
I think one of them was Blue Lagoon.

1625
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,200
I think one of them was Watermelon.

1626
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,560
What was a dirty iguana?

1627
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:56,740
Possibly.

1628
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:00,640
The thirsty iguana, horny iguanas.

1629
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:01,640
No, I'm not sure.

1630
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,060
Here's my main review.

1631
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:09,040
They got the job done and arguably made the chicken taste more okay.

1632
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:11,340
And also now it might

1633
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:17,500
be good for you to narrate through because you brought us the situation of the Gratis app.

1634
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,760
Would you like to explain what happened there?

1635
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:23,080
Of course, as someone who died at CityWalk,

1636
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:28,340
I have a lifetime gold annual pass holder status.

1637
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,200
I mean, that's nice they provide that.

1638
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:30,720
It is nice.

1639
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,420
It's a good company, good customer relations.

1640
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,180
But when I loaded up the app, it said there was a

1641
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:40,640
special offer through the beginning of March at Margaritaville where if you showed your annual

1642
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:47,540
pass, you got one free chef's choice appetizer.

1643
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,560
Chef selected.

1644
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,100
This is solely by the chef.

1645
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:54,620
For every two entrees ordered maximum of one.

1646
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,940
And then the way the ordering took place,

1647
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:04,100
you knew what it was going to be and you got to keep that a secret from us for 10 minutes or so.

1648
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,600
I hyped it up big time to my boys.

1649
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,540
I showed my pass to the server and I said,

1650
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,540
hey, do you know about this promotion?

1651
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,680
And he went, oh yeah, the chips and guac.

1652
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:22,680
The chef has selected this evening the chips and guac, an appetizer that we already had ordered

1653
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:27,820
because that was one that was available from the list that we were copying from Orlando.

1654
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:28,380
So thank

1655
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:32,040
you, chef, for a great selection, though improved, I feel like from.

1656
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,720
Did we also check on the bill

1657
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,280
that the price that those were comped?

1658
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,240
Oh, huh.

1659
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,040
I don't think we paid a lot of attention.

1660
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:43,560
You

1661
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:48,540
want to make sure that because I do think overall price tag may have been lower.

1662
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:49,900
That is maybe a

1663
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:54,700
subtle thing between Orlando and I think price tag lower morale higher.

1664
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:56,260
The most complimentary

1665
01:03:56,260 --> 01:04:02,480
thing we can say is that post meal, none of us went back to our hotel rooms in shame and despair.

1666
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:07,260
Yes, but we'll see where the evening we had to really rule it when the evening takes us somewhere.

1667
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:09,720
I believe we were charged for the chip.

1668
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:15,760
But yeah, you're right that that morale is higher.

1669
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,140
I mean, I think I think a better time was had.

1670
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:21,800
There's something nice about doing it just at end of day.

1671
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,100
This is not the exhaustion that there was

1672
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:24,840
the first time.

1673
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:29,760
And I'm happy that morale is higher, even though this group has accused you

1674
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,760
of stealing shirts that you did not steal.

1675
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,920
A true, true offense.

1676
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:38,800
I've never done anything wrong.

1677
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:44,660
He's a simple boy, a child who died and you're accusing him of robbery.

1678
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:45,800
I feel like I was.

1679
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:49,360
I have to go back and listen what crime he was actually accused of,

1680
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,420
because there's taking the shirt.

1681
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:52,360
This I know.

1682
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:52,980
I don't know.

1683
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,040
Of course, like,

1684
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,640
it's like what I want him in a life sentence for taking it.

1685
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,920
No, but he should serve some time.

1686
01:04:58,940 --> 01:04:59,560
Like that's what I'm saying.

1687
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,800
There's a difference in like what I think the crime should be for

1688
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:02,200
something like that.

1689
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:05,580
He didn't do it, but I'm just saying I don't think I accused him of it in a way

1690
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:08,480
was so bad, like a criminal or like a felony.

1691
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,300
He's already serving time.

1692
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,520
He's in a purgatorial

1693
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,600
state as all the keepers are.

1694
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:16,000
Yeah.

1695
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,300
No, thanks to you.

1696
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,660
I bet Mike thinks that Casper broke into the

1697
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:23,220
water gate based on nothing.

1698
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:26,160
All right.

1699
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,320
Well, I guess we'll let you disappear and we thank you

1700
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:31,220
for your presence throughout this saga.

1701
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:34,520
I think I think it's helped morale in general.

1702
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:35,560
And I don't

1703
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:40,880
know any parting words as we we still have a I'd say a good amount of this left to go.

1704
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:41,620
Any parting

1705
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:43,040
words or advice or anything?

1706
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:44,780
Bye.

1707
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,440
Oh, OK.

1708
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,320
And we're back.

1709
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:49,520
Wow.

1710
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,220
Well, that was great.

1711
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:50,860
That was cool.

1712
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:51,260
Amazing.

1713
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:55,380
I don't know why we didn't use this more times at time travel in cowbell.

1714
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:55,820
Yeah.

1715
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:56,160
Could have

1716
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,660
really helped us cover some ground.

1717
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,980
Mike, you traveled back to that night and bet on the 49ers

1718
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:01,480
again.

1719
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:02,740
You knew the result.

1720
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:06,100
Well, I thought maybe it would change because we've we've changed so much

1721
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:08,440
about the multiverse just by talking about everything.

1722
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,720
So maybe the 49ers would win because

1723
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,760
of the butterfly effect.

1724
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:13,280
That's fair.

1725
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,300
By virtue of us being there, right.

1726
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:16,420
Cause a breeze that would

1727
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:17,620
go to where was this?

1728
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,720
Where did the Super Bowl take place?

1729
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:19,300
Las Vegas.

1730
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:20,220
Not too far.

1731
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:21,040
So maybe.

1732
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:21,440
Yeah,

1733
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,320
there's like a ripple.

1734
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,180
There's a ripple.

1735
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:24,120
It knocks the ball out of somebody's hand.

1736
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,120
Legion stadium.

1737
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:25,740
That's right.

1738
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:26,200
Right.

1739
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,120
There might have been a ripple.

1740
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:29,420
You're counting on the ripple.

1741
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:30,280
So

1742
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,280
that's that's that.

1743
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:36,880
Again, slightly improved chef selected items.

1744
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:37,520
Yeah.

1745
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:39,280
You'd have to call this a

1746
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,960
somewhat better experience.

1747
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:44,700
One thing that remained the same that was that was kind of the

1748
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:51,040
unchanging part of this experiment was that yet again, in this establishment, they played the

1749
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:55,060
Jimmy Buffett version of my favorite Beach Boys song, Sail on Sailor.

1750
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,580
Mike, it's unfair to do this to you.

1751
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,040
You didn't record this version.

1752
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:00,300
You weren't part of it,

1753
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,980
but you're the person I know would be the most likely to defend it.

1754
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:04,320
It's fucking horrible.

1755
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:05,760
So bad.

1756
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:07,580
What am I supposed to do with this?

1757
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,420
I can't be in a restaurant that ruins my favorite,

1758
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:12,560
where the food at best is fine.

1759
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:17,780
Good if you take a scalpel to it and no matter what,

1760
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,260
butchers my favorite songs.

1761
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,260
Well, I, you know, I did I say this at the time?

1762
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:23,080
I think the problem

1763
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:26,500
though is just that the speakers in there aren't loud enough because it doesn't feel like you're

1764
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,000
live.

1765
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:29,920
Because that's what you're missing is that live experience.

1766
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,400
Scott, are you not listening to

1767
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:31,960
it loud enough?

1768
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:35,860
You think I guess it is one possibility.

1769
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:37,340
You would feel the roar of the

1770
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:37,340
crowd.

1771
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:41,140
You would feel the island vibes if it because like you're hearing an uncut sort of like

1772
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:45,240
quiet and tinny and like if I look, Jimmy's no longer with us.

1773
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,720
I can't experience his cover of

1774
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:53,540
this in the sphere, but if I had gotten to see him do it in the sphere with like a loop of surf

1775
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:56,180
footage behind boy, that would have sounds awesome.

1776
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:56,560
Yeah.

1777
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:58,440
Then I'd be like beach boys who

1778
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:03,460
while they're well, maybe somebody will do his cover at this big Hollywood bowl show that's

1779
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:04,020
coming up.

1780
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:04,640
Oh right.

1781
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,680
Somebody will perform the Jimmy Buffett cover of sail on sailor.

1782
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:09,080
Fingers

1783
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:09,600
crossed.

1784
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,960
We honor this man with his brown eye girl.

1785
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,860
He's going to do thank God for thank God

1786
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:14,460
and Jimmy Buffett.

1787
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:15,320
His single.

1788
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:15,620
Yeah.

1789
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:15,880
Yeah.

1790
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:17,080
His tribute single.

1791
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,180
Maybe we'll do two though.

1792
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:19,320
There

1793
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:21,460
is another one called Regga Billy Hill.

1794
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:23,640
I know.

1795
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,900
I know he's I know he's dead.

1796
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:26,900
I'm sorry.

1797
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:27,680
I don't

1798
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,180
I don't know what this is.

1799
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:31,180
I don't know why I'm listening to it.

1800
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:32,080
It is.

1801
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,500
Is it going to hurt me

1802
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,180
from going back to this restaurant again?

1803
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:35,660
Yes.

1804
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,780
I don't want to hear Regga Billy Hill.

1805
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:38,500
I don't

1806
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,820
like Regga Billy Hill.

1807
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,520
Again, you know, I don't want to sound like those the fish people, but

1808
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,300
it's not quite about the songs and the music.

1809
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,580
Yeah, that one maybe isn't so fun.

1810
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:49,540
I don't want

1811
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:54,640
to do all the things where they say it's not that, you know, you got to actually restaurants, not

1812
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:59,260
about the food and the facts about his charting aren't about the facts and the songs aren't about

1813
01:08:59,260 --> 01:08:59,840
the songs.

1814
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:00,520
Exactly.

1815
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:00,960
Yeah.

1816
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:01,120
Yeah.

1817
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:01,540
Yeah.

1818
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:03,800
There's a couple of qualifiers, but they're all they all

1819
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,820
make sense when you're in the camp here in the fandom.

1820
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:07,860
I get the vibe.

1821
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,300
I wear the visors.

1822
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:09,820
I

1823
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:13,640
understand it, but there's only so a vibe burns out.

1824
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,940
There's an atomic life to a vibe.

1825
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:17,140
Yeah,

1826
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:23,080
but not in twenty twenty four where every vibe from everything has to live forever, frozen in time.

1827
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:29,500
It can last forever and it will as the as this Hollywood Bowl show is titled, like keep the party

1828
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:30,040
going.

1829
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:34,460
Jason's going to get frozen in time if he does that thermometer wrong.

1830
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:35,900
Well, then

1831
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:37,540
you said that thing too low.

1832
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,460
Said too low.

1833
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:39,380
You're going to be freezing.

1834
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:40,780
I can't feel anything.

1835
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:41,220
I'm

1836
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:41,900
too cold.

1837
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:46,700
You got to get it high up at City Walk because it's extra windy on top of that hill.

1838
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,480
Well, of course we've talked about that.

1839
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:48,820
Yeah.

1840
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,340
No, that's coming guys.

1841
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,400
No, remember the order

1842
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,520
previous spoiler for the future.

1843
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,720
You're going to learn about City Walk's wind.

1844
01:09:57,180 --> 01:10:02,060
Now here's something I will say in comparing the two and this doesn't matter.

1845
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:02,460
This isn't

1846
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:02,940
a bad Orlando restaurant.

1847
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,180
However, you know, a pretty bad Orlando restaurant experience was

1848
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:13,140
definitely sullied by a bad aftermath where I took a lonely boat back to throw up in a dark room.

1849
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:13,420
Oh,

1850
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:13,640
yeah.

1851
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:13,840
Yeah.

1852
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:18,360
And I realized I was missing wonderful formative memories with my son across the country.

1853
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,820
In this case, the whole thing was nice.

1854
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:24,300
It was nice to hang out with everybody to watch the

1855
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:25,260
Super Bowl there.

1856
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:30,340
It had actually been kind of a stressful week and and you know, kid had been sick

1857
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:31,600
and everybody had been sick.

1858
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:32,740
And so like, oh, now we're out.

1859
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:33,620
We're over that.

1860
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:34,660
And like, oh,

1861
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:38,580
I got a little bit of time here because I almost hitched a lift back with you, Jason.

1862
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:39,020
And I'm like,

1863
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:39,620
wait a minute.

1864
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:41,920
No, why don't I love those hotels over there?

1865
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:42,900
I'm slop.

1866
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:44,160
I'm like a sloppy telly.

1867
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:45,740
I'm going to go enjoy those hotels.

1868
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:49,420
And there's something new since we did the City Walk saga

1869
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:51,140
original at the Universal Hilton.

1870
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:53,660
There's an outdoor bar called Five on the Hill.

1871
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:54,840
That's kind

1872
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,940
of a, you know, froufy too expensive.

1873
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:59,660
You could spend way too much money there, although quality

1874
01:10:59,660 --> 01:10:59,860
is the best food.

1875
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:01,740
Like, what if I just go get a drink?

1876
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:05,080
And I had the most relaxing glass of wine

1877
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:11,980
with like nobody else in there, you know, like fire heaters.

1878
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:12,720
What's the word?

1879
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:13,700
Yeah, heater.

1880
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,040
Yeah,

1881
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:14,300
sure.

1882
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:15,880
Yeah, patio heaters.

1883
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:16,040
Yeah, there you go.

1884
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:18,440
Is this off the lobby or is this down on the pool?

1885
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,380
It's outside.

1886
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:24,240
They took some of like the lobby or like the valet turnaround and turned it into a

1887
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,180
weird little restaurant.

1888
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:25,740
That's cool.

1889
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,620
And you can't see much at night.

1890
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:28,780
During the day, you've got a

1891
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:32,000
view of the of the Cohinga Pass and it's very relaxing out there.

1892
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,420
You can look down on the pool

1893
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:40,540
and I went I had the most chill flame lit glass of wine, not the light, just the lighting was.

1894
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:42,860
Why am I so awkward explaining this?

1895
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:44,540
I'm too marooned to play motion.

1896
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,980
But also they had,

1897
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:51,700
okay, sometimes you sometimes as a piano player, sometimes as a guitar player, this place had some

1898
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:55,780
of the best restaurant entertainment I've ever seen, which was prerequisite, the real instrumental

1899
01:11:55,780 --> 01:12:01,380
tracks of many of my favorite songs and then a guy playing live steel drum over them.

1900
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:02,080
It was

1901
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:02,860
fucking great.

1902
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,000
That sounds at first.

1903
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:06,720
I feel like if you heard that described to you before this,

1904
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:09,060
you might not even like, I don't know.

1905
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:10,680
Like that'll that'll ruin it.

1906
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,420
Yeah, I'm just up the hill.

1907
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:12,560
We

1908
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:13,600
just came from a restaurant.

1909
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:16,560
One of my favorite songs was ruined by island vibes.

1910
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:17,920
But here it's

1911
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,340
the real tracks that I like.

1912
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:20,420
And this guy's great.

1913
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,140
He's doing what he does.

1914
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:22,400
He did all night long.

1915
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:25,360
Don't stop till you get enough and debar's rhythm of the night.

1916
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:26,760
My favorite karaoke song,

1917
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:28,200
got to give it up.

1918
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:28,900
Marvin Gaye.

1919
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,880
He did Prince's I want to be your lover, which doesn't even you

1920
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,340
wouldn't even think steel drum would make sense on that, but it was great.

1921
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,800
And he did the extended,

1922
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:36,900
he did the entire thing.

1923
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:37,980
He didn't do the single edit.

1924
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:41,260
He did a steel drum vamping for the full

1925
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:42,960
like six, seven minute outro.

1926
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:44,960
It was fucking awesome.

1927
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,120
And then I got to hook back up with

1928
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:55,040
the level keeper who broke off to do Mario Kart and you got to do it with no line.

1929
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:57,720
The only possible way you could enjoy that ride.

1930
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,340
And still it's a little difficult.

1931
01:12:59,760 --> 01:12:59,940
And still.

1932
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:00,260
Yeah,

1933
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:00,600
yeah, yeah.

1934
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:00,940
Yes.

1935
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:02,420
But you know, it's better.

1936
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:03,280
Yeah.

1937
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:03,480
Yeah.

1938
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:06,400
That's the base requirement is not waiting

1939
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,580
three hours.

1940
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:08,540
I guess.

1941
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:11,520
But that did impact the experience ultimately.

1942
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,460
And what for all of these

1943
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:15,720
I have been this just warped me.

1944
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:19,920
I was like, when I truly go and have the time that we've been

1945
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:25,820
dying to have at the real at Margaritaville Alpha, I thought of it as Alpha even before this.

1946
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:26,040
I

1947
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,980
thought Orlando was the primary one.

1948
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:28,360
Yeah.

1949
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:32,180
And how dark that experience became versus a great night

1950
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:33,760
in my own backyard.

1951
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:39,080
The absolutely official ruling for me is that Margaritaville Omega

1952
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,200
is better.

1953
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:44,920
And I mean, look, I tipped my hat to it already.

1954
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,840
I tipped my hand,

1955
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:52,180
what I was going to say, the hat and hand and hand, but I can't disagree.

1956
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:53,720
I can't disagree.

1957
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:54,880
And you don't now.

1958
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:57,760
But you also have because you have those like wistful formative.

1959
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:58,980
You made me

1960
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:04,420
get into this brand by your description of the relaxing nature of the Orlando.

1961
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:08,240
Like, do those memories still pull you to that one?

1962
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:08,680
They do.

1963
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,060
And again, I think we went right

1964
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:15,200
when they opened and I think that if we had been on I think if we had been on the porch right around

1965
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,600
sunset, we would feel a little differently coming out of Orlando.

1966
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:22,120
But yes, I still I finally remember

1967
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,660
some Orlando Margaritaville experiences.

1968
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,660
But man, it's good to be home.

1969
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:28,460
Wow.

1970
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,260
Good to be home.

1971
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:30,080
Chewing were home.

1972
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:31,740
I said when I was there.

1973
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:32,960
Chewing were home.

1974
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:34,400
Yeah, we finally felt the spirit of

1975
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,020
chewing were home.

1976
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,440
Jason, I assume unless you throw us for a loop here.

1977
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:40,880
You know, I certainly

1978
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,980
love the flashy scenery of Orlando.

1979
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:50,660
But I think there's just been, you know, the Hollywood one.

1980
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:51,820
I liked my fish.

1981
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:53,460
I liked my fish and chips.

1982
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:58,580
And yeah, I liked having it's kind of nice sometimes

1983
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:04,100
a whole restaurant yourself basically, you know, yourself in your party.

1984
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:07,240
So I liked that no one got

1985
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:11,720
ill and no one got thrown for a loop by this outing.

1986
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:13,020
Everyone had a better night.

1987
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:13,460
I would.

1988
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:14,120
And I was.

1989
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:14,280
Yeah.

1990
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:15,460
So so absolutely.

1991
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,140
This was an interesting experiment.

1992
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,360
I'm glad we did it with

1993
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:19,140
with somewhere.

1994
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:23,060
But absolutely in the East Coast, West Coast battle, West Coast wins

1995
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:24,940
handily.

1996
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:31,240
I would say that overall, I agree with the level keeper that the Margaritaville franchise

1997
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:33,220
kind of breaks even.

1998
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:37,500
That said, my final ruling, don't go here.

1999
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:39,420
This is not good.

2000
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:40,700
I'm sorry.

2001
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:41,400
I don't.

2002
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:44,060
It's you're going to get better food somewhere.

2003
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:45,320
Maybe, maybe.

2004
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:49,100
Well, a drink, a drink, which still

2005
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:51,600
you're going to find a superior margarita somewhere.

2006
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:54,280
But if you just single patty cheeseburger,

2007
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:56,860
if you want that, I think maybe that's a safe bet.

2008
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,460
Would you still recommend this restaurant?

2009
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:00,320
Well, to who?

2010
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:01,360
Who am I talking to?

2011
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:01,960
Hmm.

2012
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:03,940
How about like a parent's friend?

2013
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:10,100
I would I would maybe.

2014
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,340
Yeah, they can't nobody.

2015
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,560
And now I know all human beings know 10 Jimmy

2016
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:15,160
Buffett songs.

2017
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:19,760
But a regular person who's not mired in this shit, would you send them to

2018
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:23,260
Margaritaville in City Walk Hollywood to sit down and eat?

2019
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:24,160
Yes.

2020
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,000
God, I think so.

2021
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:26,840
We're different

2022
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:31,660
people, you know, but we see sports like the NBC like isn't that much better.

2023
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:33,500
It is better.

2024
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:35,800
I think that much better, though.

2025
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,480
I think I think these are important percentages.

2026
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:39,080
Maybe,

2027
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:42,940
you know, they like the island aesthetic, maybe Margaritaville.

2028
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,700
But there's something to be said

2029
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:50,700
of the all out assault of flat screen TVs everywhere you look, you know, at NBC.

2030
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:51,100
Yeah,

2031
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:51,700
at NBC.

2032
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,280
It can be kind of fun.

2033
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:53,920
Yeah.

2034
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,960
To just have TVs everywhere.

2035
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:56,900
I guess so.

2036
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:58,280
That just place doesn't

2037
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,340
have that much personality.

2038
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,540
But but there's not a I don't feel not as horrible.

2039
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:05,020
But it's like 5%,

2040
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:06,600
maybe 10%.

2041
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,760
That's not that's not enough for the lack of fun.

2042
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,160
You don't have fun.

2043
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:11,600
We have the

2044
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,360
foosball table.

2045
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:14,100
You don't like the foosball, but it's dirty.

2046
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:14,920
It's so dirty.

2047
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,260
So I don't know.

2048
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,580
I would tell a friend's parent to go.

2049
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,300
I would make I would make like I'd say like, look,

2050
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:21,780
it's fine.

2051
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:23,260
You're not going to get OK.

2052
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:24,040
I'm going to be realistic.

2053
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:25,760
OK, well, that's good.

2054
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:26,100
I would

2055
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:29,540
still say I'm not going to recommend them go to a few other places.

2056
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:32,520
OK, Vivo, maybe Vivo.

2057
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:34,020
I guess.

2058
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:36,220
None of these are still real.

2059
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:41,300
There's if you OK down on the on Cahuenga, not far from where you

2060
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:46,060
go up the hill to go to City Walk, there's a real restaurant called Mercado, a real Mexican restaurant

2061
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:47,460
that is good and fun.

2062
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:47,700
Yeah.

2063
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:48,880
We're the good happy hour.

2064
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:49,780
That's not we're talking about here.

2065
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:50,620
I know.

2066
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:52,240
I know it's out of the sectors.

2067
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:52,940
I know.

2068
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:55,940
Like spits over adventure over here that I really like, too.

2069
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:56,940
There's a couple of them in L.

2070
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:56,960
A.

2071
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,720
What you could do is Mediterranean.

2072
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:00,760
I think in general, don't

2073
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:03,440
eat before you don't eat at City Walk.

2074
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,580
Don't ever do it.

2075
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,560
I know we got more of that to go.

2076
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,700
I hear the words you're saying, but I know what you really mean is eat there as much as you can

2077
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,300
because there's something magic about it.

2078
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:16,000
Well, thanks for seeing the true meaning of my message.

2079
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:16,860
I felt it.

2080
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:17,820
I didn't hear it.

2081
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:19,720
Scott's really saying do eat there.

2082
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,000
He's really saying that

2083
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:21,500
it's about a feeling.

2084
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:25,840
The Buffett sail on sailor trounces and drowns the Beach Boys one.

2085
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,060
That's not.

2086
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,320
It's not about the live recordings.

2087
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:32,740
It was about the live experience.

2088
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:33,260
And they're

2089
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:35,660
trying to recreate it, but it's impossible without him there live.

2090
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:38,620
That's like to bring the K back

2091
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:38,860
into it.

2092
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:42,300
That's like that song sounds like Beach Boys, but the C is a K.

2093
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,540
I wish there was a Beach

2094
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:47,620
Boy on that tribute show.

2095
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:48,920
Maybe they're on tour.

2096
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:49,500
Are they on tour?

2097
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:51,320
I don't know.

2098
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,560
Are they're all

2099
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,120
on Death's Door?

2100
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:57,880
Well, that's some of the people on this tribute show.

2101
01:18:58,060 --> 01:18:58,380
Yes.

2102
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:58,700
Yeah.

2103
01:18:58,720 --> 01:18:59,600
So I just wish

2104
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,480
there was one of them.

2105
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:05,140
I think I'm going to call a shot here.

2106
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:06,800
OK, we've done this 10.

2107
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:07,240
There's been

2108
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:12,600
10 of these episodes as penance for none of this being maybe good episodes, but not being good

2109
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,620
experiences for us.

2110
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:17,740
I think we're going to bring back a City Walk thing has not come back since

2111
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:18,980
Jason himself had to do it.

2112
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:21,240
And that is Jimmy's in the penalty box.

2113
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,960
No Jimmy centric episodes for

2114
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:23,460
one year.

2115
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:28,080
Whoa, we've done 10, 10, three and two days.

2116
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:28,660
Oh my gosh.

2117
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:29,820
That's as long as regular

2118
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:30,120
things.

2119
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:30,560
It was nice.

2120
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:32,820
We don't do something in frontier land for a year.

2121
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:33,580
Probably more.

2122
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,220
OK,

2123
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:34,560
OK.

2124
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:35,300
All right.

2125
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,260
I will tentatively agree to this.

2126
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:37,780
Whoa.

2127
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:39,140
Tentative Jason.

2128
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:39,740
Jason.

2129
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,320
I as as the past

2130
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:46,020
shown, I have no control over the penalty box.

2131
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:51,060
So with your suggestion and Mike agreeing to it.

2132
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:55,480
If I go to the Solid Bull show, though, and there's something we have to talk about, then we'll see.

2133
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,000
But I guess I could wait a year to talk about it.

2134
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:01,320
Well, everyone's going to remember it.

2135
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,940
I'll talk about a concert I saw a year prior.

2136
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,280
You might have might have more content, you know,

2137
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:12,020
Pirate Looks at a year ago, the infamous trampling at the Hollywood Bowl.

2138
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:15,780
The infamous riot.

2139
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:18,440
A pit bull at the stage.

2140
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:20,900
People went fucking nuts.

2141
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:22,480
Guess what?

2142
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,160
No, it's it was the riot was boomers

2143
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,800
trying to run out of there because there was someone on stage.

2144
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:29,420
Oh, they didn't grow up listening

2145
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:30,340
to that.

2146
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:30,700
That's that.

2147
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:31,120
Hurry.

2148
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:35,020
And that day ticket holders were the ones yelling timber.

2149
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:36,600
Right back

2150
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:37,460
to you in the studio.

2151
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:38,100
More at eleven.

2152
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:40,720
All right.

2153
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,000
I think we I think we did.

2154
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:43,060
I think you listener,

2155
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:44,260
you survived.

2156
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:47,180
He brings out Travolta during the show that people would stampede trying to get to

2157
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:47,700
the stage.

2158
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:49,320
I think I'd be stampeding back.

2159
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:49,860
Yeah.

2160
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:50,140
Yeah.

2161
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:52,360
Singing like a Woe Black Betty song that

2162
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,520
Pitbull does.

2163
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:58,120
The Travolta played live, performed live with him on some of their like a pilot club,

2164
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,040
like a rich guy.

2165
01:20:59,200 --> 01:20:59,680
Well, that's it.

2166
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,660
That's a different that's a music video that John Travolta

2167
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:02,500
is in of Pitbull's.

2168
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:06,200
I'm talking about there was a live like award show that Pitbull, whatever the

2169
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,140
he has that samples Woe Black Betty.

2170
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:11,160
John Travolta is just on stage dancing with him the whole time.

2171
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,700
That's a different, different Travolta appearance.

2172
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,220
I think don't we have to put Jimmy Buffett in the

2173
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:19,900
penalty box so to open up things like the full John Travolta.

2174
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:23,300
No, the full John Travolta episode.

2175
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:23,900
Yeah, we do.

2176
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,600
The John Travolta oddities episode.

2177
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:26,140
Sure.

2178
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:26,720
I know we should.

2179
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,800
I think Jimmy would want

2180
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:29,620
to take a little time.

2181
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:30,100
You know what?

2182
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:30,880
You guys were there.

2183
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,320
He's off.

2184
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:32,520
I got enough attention.

2185
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,700
They're both pilots.

2186
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:35,860
So I guess that's a nice trade.

2187
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:36,420
Yeah.

2188
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:37,360
One pilot for another.

2189
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:37,780
Yeah.

2190
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:37,880
Yeah.

2191
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:39,860
They nod to each other in the sky.

2192
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:40,600
All right.

2193
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:41,960
Hey, friendly skies.

2194
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:45,280
All right.

2195
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:45,780
But listener,

2196
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:49,840
you survived three Jimmy Buffett episodes in two days.

2197
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,320
Keep it tuned here to the second gate.

2198
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:54,560
Thanks Aaron for the art.

2199
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:56,500
My Carlson and Zach Reno for the theme music.

2200
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:57,280
Multiverse of Menace

2201
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,360
Merchant or T-Public Store.

2202
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:02,000
Everything else in the series, I believe is going to be on the main feed.

2203
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:05,980
But keep it tuned here as always to podcast throughout the second gate or notch it up to

2204
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:11,020
Club 3 to get every sector ad free and that exclusive bonus sector from not long ago.

2205
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:15,280
Tomorrow, The Age of Buffett ends, but the beach vibes may not.

2206
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,580
We'll see who joins us.
