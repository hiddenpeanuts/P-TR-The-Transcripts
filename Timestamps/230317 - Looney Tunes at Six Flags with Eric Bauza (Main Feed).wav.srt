1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Warning.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The following podcast may trigger

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
severe dork-outs.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Thanks to the guest's incredible

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
voices and equally incredible

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
vintage shirts. Be on the lookout

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
for rapping rabbits, sun-bleached

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
rides, and a heavy

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
dose of Toronto nostalgia.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's the Looney Tunes at Six Flags

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
with Looney Tunes voice

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Eric Bowser on Podcast

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The Ride.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
hosted by three very good boys

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
who are deeply uncomfortable with the

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
phrase, Puddy Tat.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm a racking frack environment

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
by the name of Scott Gardner

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
joined by my co-host, what a

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
maroon. It's Mike Carlson.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That's true, that is what I am.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But I'm still reeling from what you said earlier.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
When I said earlier, I mean 15 seconds ago.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That was earlier than right now, yes.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We'll try to avoid

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
disgusting, lewd phrases such as

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
that. And host

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
number three, Aini the Stinker.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's Jason Sheridan.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I've been sitting over here with beta breath

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
to see what I was given tonight.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I mean, that's, you've

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
said the phrase before even,

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
not even in the context of

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
the Looney Tunes. Oh, yeah.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You are the stinker of the show.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Today we are talking about

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
all things

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Looney Tunes, including their

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Six Flags association, Bugs Bunny

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
World at Magic Mountain.

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And we're doing it because we're joined by

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
an excellent guest who

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
he voices some

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
of the more obscure characters

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
in the Looney Tunes canon.

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Just some of the, you know, the more S.O.J., the deeper cuts

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
such as Bugs Bunny,

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Daffy Duck, Porky

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Pig, Elmer Fudd, Marvin

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
the Martian, Foghorn Leghorn, too many

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
to name. It's the Emmy winning

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Eric Bowser. Hello.

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh, forget about him. Do me, do me.

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Daffy, it's me. Do me next.

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What about, am I a loser?

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And am I, what am I to you, Scott?

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Lists are arbitrary.

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I didn't mean to put you in any particular

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
order. We could do it again and you could be number one, Daffy.

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh, I see, I see. Not good enough

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
for an insult from you. I get it.

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Not on your radar, I see.

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I didn't want to insult you.

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I thought you seem a little touchy.

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't know. I'll just go.

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Come on, Daffy. Come on now.

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Relax. Everyone's friends

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
here. I was

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
going to start off with like

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
you can do as much or as little

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
voices as you'd like to do.

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You can steer the ship. I am just

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
a whore when it comes to

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
these characters. No, I

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
am just thankful to be here. Thank you, guys.

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Thank you for doing it.

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Again, these characters for me are

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
who I grew up watching

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and from anyone that's

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
read an interview or seen another

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
interview, you know, you'll know

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
that this was the Bible for me Saturday

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
mornings. It was reruns.

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And I guess it was the 80s,

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
more particularly the 90s,

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
where these characters had somewhat

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
of a like a renaissance, I guess,

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
because they were originally made in the

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
40s, 50s. And

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
you know, decades later

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
here they are in the 90s being

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
you know, slathered over

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
air fresheners, mud flaps,

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
you know, for 18

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
wheeler trucks. Coca-Cola

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
cans promoting Six Flags.

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Is that the right brand? I think it was

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Coke, right? Yeah.

104
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And that ties in my appearance here

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
today is my obsession with the Looney

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Toons, not just as cartoon characters, but

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
as backdrops to

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
the Six Flags Magic Mountains

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
theme park. Right on. You voice these

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
characters who are like

111
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
the corporate

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
faces of

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
you know, various parks

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and not just to jump around

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
a little bit because we're sort of

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Looney Tunes focused. I don't want to shut off

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
another character because

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
you're the voice of

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
the face of Six Flags,

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
but also a character we've talked about

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
a lot over the years who

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
is by default Universal's

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Mickey and that is Woody

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Woodpecker. That's right.

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And it doesn't get you into

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Super Nintendo World any faster

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
than any other. No.

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You gotta watch the Virtual Q when you get

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
there. Hi, I'm

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
the voice of Woody Woodpecker. Yeah, yeah, sure pal.

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Just, uh, you have a platinum

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
pass or not? I do and

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
you can go. I was there last night. The red

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
pass, that's what I have, the red feathers

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
of Woody. But here's the thing I've learned, you can

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
only, the only way to

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
skip to the front of the line

138
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
for Bowser's Castle Mario

139
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Kart, the ride, is to have a

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
VIP pass, which is

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
$400 per pass.

142
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But that includes a free lunch,

143
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
a tour, a guided tour.

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh, that's what gets you the like, you're on

145
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
the back line, you're going in the sets and everything.

146
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You're not just on the big tram. But if you're just

147
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
there, like that, that is the

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
only way, unless you get there right before the park

149
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
opens and you're lined up to go into

150
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Mario land or whatever it is.

151
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Right, right. Yeah, that's the only,

152
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
that's the hack. You have to pay $400.

153
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Money is always the

154
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
hack. Let me tell

155
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
you something about money and theme parks.

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's what

157
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
makes those things run.

158
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Not electricity, but

159
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
just paper money.

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You've been a

161
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
universal fan, a theme parks fan

162
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
it seems like forever. Part of me asking

163
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
you if you wanted to do this was

164
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
your Instagram, which is a treasure trove

165
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
of memories of yours.

166
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's constantly you seemingly

167
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
proving your voice

168
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
nerd credentials,

169
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I feel like.

170
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You were completely the kid

171
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
who loves this stuff and now you get to do

172
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
it and how cool is that?

173
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Again, going back to

174
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
the night, I ran

175
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
into our colleague, Kyle

176
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Mooney at Six Flags Magic Mountain,

177
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
who we both worked with on Smash

178
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Saturday morning. Saturday morning All Star Hits,

179
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
which you were so great on. Some of our favorite voices

180
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
in the whole thing. Thank you.

181
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We were there because of the premiere

182
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
of, to celebrate

183
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
the premiere of Space Jam

184
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
A New Legacy, which I was lucky enough to do

185
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
one or five

186
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
voices, I don't know how many voices I did on it, but

187
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
even if I was like the out of focus

188
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
tree in the background, I would have

189
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
been happy. There were a lot of out of

190
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
focus characters in the movie. Maybe no movie

191
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
ever had more out of focus characters.

192
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
HBO Max, the movie.

193
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
With LeBron, maybe.

194
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But yeah, we were there to celebrate that

195
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
movie and

196
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
it was kind of funny because on the red carpet,

197
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
if you were just kind of like walking in,

198
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
there was a mascot of

199
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Daffy, but specifically

200
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
for me Sylvester. And I remember

201
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
when I first

202
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
visited Los Angeles and

203
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
first went to Six Flags,

204
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
there's photos of me and I

205
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
actually compare, I put them together

206
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
now, where it's me from like

207
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
1994 and

208
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Sylvester in Six Flags

209
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
in 1994. And then

210
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
what, that was like two years ago

211
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
or 2020, like in the

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
thick of the pandemic. It was actually

213
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
a big thing that we were even able to go

214
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
to Six Flags to do this because

215
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
it was that one week in LA

216
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
where there wasn't COVID, if you

217
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
remember. They're like, hey, it's gone. Let's

218
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
go out and lick fire hydrants

219
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
and stuff. And then

220
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Cut the Six Flags padlock. Yeah, and

221
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
then literally after that movie premiered,

222
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
lockdown again. But

223
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I remember being on that

224
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
red carpet wanting to take that photo knowing

225
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
that that photo existed in

226
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
1994 at that exact same

227
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
theme park. Wow, wow. So I

228
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
had put them to, I put them like

229
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
side by side so you could see

230
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
how little I've grown

231
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
since then. I'm still like

232
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
a tiny person.

233
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But a tiny nerd.

234
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
To that end,

235
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
do we have that picture, Jason?

236
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I think you loaded up a photo. I loaded up

237
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
a photo.

238
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Eric, I got this on your... Blackmail photo, right?

239
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This is the... Yeah, yeah. We will show this

240
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
to all of our viewers. This is available

241
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
on ForeverDog on the YouTube

242
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
also. Well, Eric, you might be ahead of

243
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
me because I see you brought a shirt.

244
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But I emailed... Oh, this

245
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
might be the exact shirt that we

246
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
may or may not see any minute.

247
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
If not now, we could see it later,

248
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm sure. If we did...

249
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This is, I think, a picture of you

250
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
in... You were in eighth

251
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
grade. Do I have that right?

252
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
If the braces are correct

253
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
and the laser background

254
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
is correct, that was the... Yeah, the laser background

255
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
really gives away a range of

256
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
dates. That was the era.

257
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Not to date yourself, but never post

258
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
a photo of you with lasers in the background.

259
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Because it looks like

260
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I was like a jewel thief.

261
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Like I was in a heist.

262
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You were in the middle. I was in mid-heist.

263
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Oh, there it is. Look at this. Just that

264
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
weird Widow's Peak that I have

265
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
there. Oh, there it is. Oh, God!

266
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The further down you go, the

267
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
worse it gets. Keep going. We've seen the braces.

268
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Scroll down. This is like it's loading

269
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
on Windows in 1985. Yeah, I

270
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
feel like I'm trying to download

271
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
pornography in the 90s.

272
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
We're just trying to get to a kid's shirt

273
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
though. We're not trying to do something weird.

274
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
We're not trying to do anything weird. We're just trying to see

275
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
an eighth graders full shirt.

276
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
If you want to scroll down a few more

277
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
pixels, maybe

278
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
we'll get to the juice of the photo.

279
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Or is this all... There it is!

280
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Good God!

281
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Listeners, this is a very

282
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
early

283
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
90s kind of like purple

284
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
pastel pattern

285
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
that's extremely busy in very

286
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
90s fashion. And the pattern

287
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
is primarily made up of

288
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Bugs Bunny. It's like a Wild Berry Pop

289
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Tart of a shirt.

290
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's such a good... It's like the most

291
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
attractive color scheme to me because we're all

292
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
growing up... We all grew up the same.

293
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
This is it. That was essentially

294
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
what was fashionable back in the 90s.

295
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And this was to

296
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
me. Like, I saw this

297
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
hanging in the, you know,

298
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
the gift shops of Six Flags

299
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
in the children's area because that's the only

300
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
place in Six Flags where the Looney Tunes

301
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
exist. And I was like,

302
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
oh my God, I'm

303
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
going to get married and buried in this shirt.

304
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I was in the eighth grade and I knew

305
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
that already. And I actually

306
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
brought it with me.

307
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
This is it. So this is the

308
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
shirt

309
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
that predicted my future.

310
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
This is the exact

311
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
same shirt. And for whatever reason,

312
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
this is the funny, disgusting part about it,

313
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
there's a giant hole in the back

314
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
where my ass might be.

315
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Like I blew out a fart and

316
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
ruined the garment.

317
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And if this isn't

318
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
going to make the podcast

319
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
even weirder, I'm going to try it

320
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
on to see if it...

321
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm so glad we have the video

322
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
component. Before I pass it around so you

323
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
can all get a sniff.

324
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Because that's what I was hoping that you would do.

325
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Like how you're holding it now.

326
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It feels like a holy

327
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
garment of some kind.

328
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Whoever wears it is bestowed with voice powers.

329
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I commend you for holding

330
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
onto it because that would go for hundreds on

331
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Deepop. This is actually the

332
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
original plot of Big. But they're

333
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
like, it's too weird that he wants to be the voice of

334
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Bugs Bunny when he's older. What if he just wants

335
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
to be Big? And

336
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
forget about the Looney Tunes element.

337
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
This is what I had pitched. New Line Cinema.

338
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What is this?

339
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This is Looney Tunes exclusively

340
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
for Six Flags is what the

341
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
label says. Can't find that on...

342
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Well, not the internet at the time. You can't find that in

343
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
the Warner Bros. Studio store. And it says

344
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Looney Tunes characters, names, and

345
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
all related indica.

346
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Indica. Isn't that...

347
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Sounds like a wheat strain.

348
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Indica and Sativa are

349
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
trademarks of Warner Bros. 1991.

350
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Uh, yeah,

351
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
so... Oh, crazy hearing Bugs

352
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
say the strains.

353
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Is he allowed? Is that okay?

354
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I said, you got any foghorn, Kuch?

355
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's what I want to know, son.

356
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Okay, here.

357
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm gonna try the sun.

358
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
This is history.

359
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Am I wrong? Does anyone else get nervous

360
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
when Bugs starts talking? And like in a way where

361
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
one of the most famous people on Earth

362
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
is talking to you? Or am I the only one?

363
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Oh, yeah. Oh, a thousand percent.

364
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's a little strange. No, it's not.

365
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's great. I'm like, oh my gosh, Bugs

366
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
is in the room. Yeah. There's something

367
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
otherworldly about it. Right. It takes me to

368
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
a different place. And this

369
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
is a pretty successful transfer on Eric's

370
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
part so far. This looks great.

371
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I built a time machine.

372
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm sure one of these buttons

373
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
is gonna pop. I'm gonna leave

374
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
the gut part of the shirt.

375
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This is future-proofing from clothing

376
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
manufacturers in the 90s by making

377
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
all things very baggy.

378
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yeah. Okay, big reveal.

379
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You're gonna want this again in 30 years.

380
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh my god. It's...

381
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's great. It still fits, guys.

382
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
If I could recreate the

383
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
pose, the pose.

384
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Can we key out the red of the curtain and give you

385
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
some lasers? We'll work on the post on this.

386
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yeah. Wow. So either

387
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I was a really big eighth grader

388
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
or I'm a very small man. It's

389
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
either which... I'll just stop it

390
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
now because all the dates I had lined

391
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
up this Friday on Tinder are gone.

392
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Well, I wanted to commend you because

393
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
that is something that I

394
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
would buy

395
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
when I was that young out of Six Flags.

396
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I would not have had the gumption

397
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
to wear it both to school and

398
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
on picture day. So people thought

399
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and they still say it, like, why

400
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
are you wearing a pajama top to picture day?

401
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
They're like, what is your... you're an idiot.

402
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And I'm like, you'll

403
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
all see. Wait till we all

404
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
live this through this thing called COVID-19

405
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and then

406
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and only then after I will be the voice

407
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
of Bugs Bunny in the year

408
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
2020, I think.

409
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's a good thing you have that shirt and not like

410
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
a tougher-to-get

411
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
voice. I don't know who else

412
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
in Warner Brothers.

413
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I mean, you were in the Looney Tunes,

414
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
but like, you know, unless

415
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
if you went to Universal and bought the same

416
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
pattern but Frankensteins,

417
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
then you're just

418
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
dependent on are they doing anything with the

419
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
property? Is the dark universe up and running?

420
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Then my dream would be to be the guy

421
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
in the Frankenstein outfit.

422
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And again, it would be a very

423
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
unimpressive photo of Frankenstein

424
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
at 5'5". Even with

425
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
those big phone book shoes, no one would

426
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
be threatened. The least intimidating

427
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Frankenstein. I want

428
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
a picture with Marilyn. Marilyn Monroe.

429
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That's a picture. Is that

430
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
the sound of short Frankenstein?

431
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
He's like literally

432
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
half the

433
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
angst of big Frankenstein.

434
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Sounds right to me.

435
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But yeah, going back to

436
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Six Flags,

437
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
again, and being a kid

438
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
on vacation where your parents

439
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
give you, here's like a little bit of vacation.

440
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Here's your budget. Now don't

441
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
go crazy. Don't, you know, buy

442
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
food. Buy the things you need to survive

443
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
while you're away for a couple weeks.

444
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And of course, I was under the care of my aunt and uncle.

445
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But I blew it all on Looney

446
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Tunes stuff. I bought an

447
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
all brown Wile E. Coyote

448
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
shirt where it was the color

449
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
of his fur and only his

450
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
muzzle, eyes, and ears.

451
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It was so 90s. Like, it was like

452
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
god, they were so good. Actually, you know what I should

453
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
have done, and I'm

454
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
an idiot, maybe on part two

455
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
of this, I bought every

456
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Warner Brothers catalog off

457
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
eBay. I don't think you can search

458
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
for it because I'm, again,

459
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
obsessed. I'm obsessed.

460
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You can't find a

461
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
90s Warner Brothers catalog on

462
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
eBay right now. It's because they're all at my house.

463
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I bought. Really? Wow. And they

464
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
were released by season. So I,

465
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
you know, there goes my son's college fund.

466
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
At least the first few weeks

467
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
of his university career gone

468
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
because I just had to have

469
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
that Rover Dangerfield cover

470
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
of Rodney Dangerfield and his dog

471
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
self. Wow. Yeah. I'll

472
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
scan that and send it for your

473
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
fans. Please send whatever for the socials.

474
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
He understands. These are

475
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
priceless items. Where did this

476
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
catalog, because there was the studio store

477
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
which I was really fond of in the malls,

478
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
but the catalog was a whole other

479
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So it was like the size

480
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
of like, you know, it was

481
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
very thin. It was

482
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
seasonal. So it was only like, you know, spring,

483
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
summer, winter. Of course, they had Christmas

484
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and holiday stuff.

485
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But like it was just for the studio

486
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
store. And there are pictures

487
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
of like celebrities that were

488
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
hot back then. So I

489
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
actually have, because it's Warner Brothers

490
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
100th this year,

491
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I have been scanning pages of that

492
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
in, of the catalog and like erasing

493
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
all like the writing.

494
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So I, if you check on my, on my

495
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Instagram, there's a picture of

496
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Mark Lynn Baker,

497
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Bronson Pinchot, and the girl that played

498
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Mary Ann on Perfect Strangers.

499
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And they're all wearing Daffy Duck or

500
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Looney Tunes stuff. And they're all like

501
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
like, hey! Like cause they're

502
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
popular. They're so, who else?

503
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Gene Shallot was

504
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
featured heavily.

505
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Now you've got our attention.

506
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's like him and Tweedy and Sylvester

507
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
eating cake. And like, cause I think

508
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
at that point they were celebrating their 50th.

509
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And then there's one of Jonathan,

510
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
there's lots of Jonathan Winters.

511
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Like just like in different attire.

512
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Like Warner Brothers ball caps

513
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and stuff. But they would get, and

514
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
of course Fris Freeling, Chuck Jones,

515
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
these are beloved directors of the

516
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Warner Brothers, you know, history

517
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
and legend. They're still alive.

518
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Mel Blanc also was featured in the catalog

519
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
like posing with bugs, like a cartoon

520
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
drawing of bugs. Oh wow.

521
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
There's so much good stuff in there. Oh, there's

522
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
an entire catalog just about Gremlins

523
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
too. So if you're a huge

524
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
fan of that movie, I'm like

525
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
truly, and there's stuff in there

526
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
that you'll just, you'll never be able to get. And my

527
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
goal is to try to recreate

528
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
like, cause I work with intellectual

529
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
property like the licensing

530
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
of Warners. I'm trying to milk

531
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
this for as much as possible.

532
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You have a brand also

533
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yeah, Retro Kid

534
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
in Toronto, Ontario,

535
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Canada. And we deal a lot with

536
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Canadian nostalgia like Degrassi.

537
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Stuff that made it here, hoping

538
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
you know, some Americans will latch on to it.

539
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But otherwise it's just a collection of

540
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
really obscure Canadian children's programming

541
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
where you're just like, what the hell

542
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
were they doing in Canada? Like

543
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
why does this exist? It's so weird.

544
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
When I was reading about

545
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
your work, I definitely had some long detours

546
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
learning about Mr. Dress Up.

547
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yes. And

548
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
also looking at your store's expansive

549
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
website. Yeah, thank you.

550
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And oddly enough, like, Mr. Dress Up

551
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
was like our Mr. Rogers.

552
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And actually they were friends at one

553
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
point in their history.

554
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
But he was basically like our

555
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
you know, our childhood

556
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
for whatever reason, there was

557
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
always a guy who lived by himself

558
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
that would talk to you and

559
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
would have friends who were, who happened to just be

560
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
puppets, that also kind of live at

561
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
this weird house that is in his house.

562
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's like a place where they could be creative

563
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and then like leave. Like, Kiwi's Playhouse

564
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
was kind of like that. Oh, that's true.

565
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
We go visit a place.

566
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
We leave our creativity here

567
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
at the single man's house. This is where

568
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
we go smoke weed is basically

569
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
there was another guy in Canada

570
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
like another show called Fred

571
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Penner's Place. Oh, we had that.

572
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
They put that on Nickelodeon too. Okay, yeah.

573
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So you would follow this guy through a tree trunk

574
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
into this secret part of the

575
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
forest and he would sing to you

576
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
and then he'd be like, oh, we need

577
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
to go now.

578
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Like, yeah, it's too bad.

579
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Don't tell your parents. Yeah.

580
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Don't tell them you went in the tree trunk.

581
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Yeah. So much stranger danger

582
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
but then also every show was go

583
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
visit a, like

584
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
this weird guy's house.

585
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah, it was come over, hang out

586
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
for 22 minutes, we'll make stuff and

587
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'll put some clothes on and pretend

588
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
to be someone else. Everything's

589
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
gonna be fine. Everything's gonna be fine.

590
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yeah. Yeah, kids, do that on PBS.

591
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Do not do it two blocks away.

592
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Absolutely. Do not

593
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
look stranger in the eye. Do not go to Mr.

594
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Smith's. Stay the hell away.

595
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Stay out of Mr. Smith's tree trunk. Maybe

596
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
there's a new thing we just created.

597
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's like a host that

598
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
operates inside an abandoned amusement park

599
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and he's like, come ride, come ride

600
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
rides with me. Sure. I have the

601
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
keys still. Yeah. Hey, climb

602
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
the fence. I got a hole

603
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
in the fence just for you.

604
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Go flip some switches. Let's see if any of this

605
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
electricity turns on. You don't need

606
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
seat belts. Put your mouth under this fountain

607
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
soda machine.

608
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It never goes bad.

609
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Never. Oh no, a rat flew

610
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
out. Oh well.

611
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The puppet friends are like, yeah, raccoons

612
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
and rats and

613
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
maybe a homeless guy could be

614
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
the sidekick. I don't know. This sounds good.

615
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
The security guard. The security guard.

616
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
He'd be the nemesis of the city.

617
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The security guard who's seen some shit.

618
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
He doesn't use that word, but we know he has.

619
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
This is good.

620
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
We need to like, abandoned amusement parks

621
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
have gotten a bad rap from the Scoop Scoop franchise

622
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and it's time to learn they can be

623
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
joyous places. Sure, yeah. We can't let

624
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
good time, the second act of good time

625
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
be our. Oh yeah, right. Yeah, yeah.

626
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You're not necessarily going to get drugged and

627
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
left for dead. No. Yeah, yeah.

628
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Things might turn out great. There's no

629
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
a lesson doesn't need to be learned every episode.

630
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just pure fun. You know?

631
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I think

632
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
something else to ask you about too, in terms of that

633
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Instagram stuff. I also love seeing you at the

634
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I forgot this place existed. The building's

635
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
still there, but this might have been on your like

636
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
LA sojourns also

637
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
that you were, you took

638
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
pictures at what was then the Hanna-Barbera

639
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
headquarters,

640
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
which is now like, I think people

641
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
live there. It's an apartment complex.

642
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Condos and a gym. Wow.

643
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
We have the LA fitness there. It's all

644
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
like a complex just below the

645
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Universal City Hill. Yeah. And I totally

646
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
actually until I saw your Instagram I forgot

647
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
that'd be part of the kind of the tour that

648
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
my dad would take me on is like, not

649
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
just Universal, but they make all the

650
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
they make the Flintstones and stuff here too. What

651
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
a magical. Did you guys ever get to see that building

652
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
while it was still around? Not in its state, no.

653
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I just thought it was an interesting

654
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
building architecturally for a long time.

655
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And then a few years ago I saw like

656
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
a photo of the guard stand

657
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
with like someone in a yogi walk around

658
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
costume in it. Yeah.

659
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
There are still hints and remnants

660
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
of Hanna-Barbera in that complex,

661
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
in that area. Like paintings of

662
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
like dinosaur footprints on the ground.

663
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I think there might be some murals on the wall that

664
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
they are still going to keep up in memory of Hanna-Barbera.

665
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But I remember

666
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
being a kid

667
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
growing up in Toronto watching

668
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Two Stupid Dogs, Powerpuff Girls,

669
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Dexter's Lab,

670
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Johnny Bravo. At the end of every

671
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
episode in those 90s Hanna-Barbera

672
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
before they became Cartoon Network

673
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
there would be a voice going,

674
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
send all your fan mail to

675
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
26555 Coinga Boulevard.

676
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And I was like Coinga Boulevard.

677
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
That's a weird name.

678
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I remember, I felt so bad

679
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
for my uncle who is no longer with us, but

680
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
he never had kids and every time

681
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I visited I was always like,

682
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
take me here now!

683
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I need to see this place

684
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
now! To Coinga!

685
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
The most magical place in the city.

686
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You're probably in your mid

687
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
40s, almost 50, and this

688
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
stupid kid comes from Canada

689
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
and he's like demanding you

690
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
take me to these places.

691
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And sure enough he did. He was also

692
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
the uncle too by the way that would

693
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
send me clips and clippings

694
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
of LA Times

695
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
newspaper, the entertainment section

696
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
like Little Mermaid breaks box office

697
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
you know, Dolly.

698
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
He was the one that encouraged me to be in animation.

699
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So that's what

700
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
he gets. He gets a kid that's

701
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
obsessed. So he in fact did drive

702
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
me to Hanna-Barbera. It was the weekend so it was

703
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
closed. I did take pictures

704
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
outside of this building

705
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
and yeah now it's a gym.

706
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's kind of sad but

707
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
at the same time

708
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I've managed

709
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
to

710
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
work and make friends with people

711
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
that were inside of that building.

712
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
People that could tell me

713
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
stories about hearing

714
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
people like

715
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Mel Blanc or Don

716
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Messick who was the original voice of Scooby.

717
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
The walls were paper

718
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
thin. Like if someone was getting in trouble you could

719
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
hear someone arguing like

720
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
four offices away

721
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and just weird stuff.

722
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And you know I'm talking about

723
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Frank Welker who's still a

724
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
living legend still with us. He

725
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
is literally half of IMDB if you look

726
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
him up. He was like all the gremlins

727
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
you know.

728
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Megatron. Yeah he's done so many

729
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
voices and everything but

730
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
now he is Scooby-Doo and

731
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
is still Freddie Jones from

732
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
that. He still does it.

733
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
We got him on Smash.

734
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It was unbelievable. You did?

735
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yeah yeah. Just through like it didn't even get to see

736
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
him. It was like I don't think we even had the zoom

737
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
window. It was like a scratchy bad

738
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
connection. Which then you're like are

739
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
we going to be able to understand this and then that voice

740
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
comes booming through like I think

741
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
we'll be fine. That's so great. I'm glad

742
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
that he was it just makes it that

743
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
much more authentic that you got Frank in

744
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
there. That was the thought was like

745
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
yeah we're doing this full 80s

746
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
90s tribute what better way to make it

747
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
authentic than getting like you know

748
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
like the people from then

749
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
like because those vocal qualities you recognize

750
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
instantly. But yourself included

751
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
because we thought of you right away because you

752
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
are the new version of that

753
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
you know. Thanks Doc. I bet

754
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
you say that to all your guests who voice

755
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
bugs bunny.

756
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
This is so sad. I'm doing the voice

757
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
that I'm wearing this shirt.

758
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
No it's not. It's

759
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
we're blown away. This is like

760
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I like this will be the nerdiest episode

761
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
on our. I want to say like

762
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I want to say thank you bugs so much

763
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
for all you've done. Like I think

764
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
that's the core of I think all of us. You're

765
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
welcome. You're doing just fine.

766
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You got your own show. There's lights

767
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
in the stage and a couch.

768
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Thank you bugs. Amazing. That's all

769
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I ever wanted. The most encouraging note

770
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
we've got in years.

771
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Can I ask a question. Do you do the Wiley

772
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
like intelligent Wiley?

773
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yes Wiley

774
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
coyote. Super genius.

775
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Yeah.

776
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I've only ever done it like maybe

777
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
like once or twice.

778
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Maybe for a

779
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
like an app video

780
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
game on your phone. Oh wow. It was literally

781
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
like here's five things that he said.

782
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Just say them.

783
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
But yeah Mel Blanks like normal

784
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
normal voice print is very

785
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
difficult to kind of

786
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
get because he had a very

787
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
rich you know

788
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
smoked at 9 a.m.

789
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
butted out at 9 p.m.

790
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
probably unfiltered.

791
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
We did have to ask you to put out your unfiltered

792
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Chester Fields when we started

793
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
recording. When you saw me I was like

794
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
sucking on a rain drizzled cigarette

795
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
outside. Is it time to go in?

796
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Oh man he's

797
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
got to build my voice up.

798
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
If I don't smoke these

799
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I just sound like a woman. Yeah I sound

800
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
like my mom.

801
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You powered through a couple of packs that we

802
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
started. Yeah.

803
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
In terms of that Mel Blank stuff

804
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
you must just know beyond that

805
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
you do so many of his voices

806
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
you must just like understand

807
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
the general ecosystem

808
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
of him

809
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
pretty well. That you know his regular

810
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
what's closest to his regular voice and what's

811
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
furthest. I kind of call it

812
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
the house of Mel Blank. And it's

813
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
like some characters

814
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
live in the attic so if I'm doing

815
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Tweety it's almost

816
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
almost the same voice as

817
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Bugs but Bugs is like maybe

818
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
like a step down here.

819
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
So Tweety I'll do a self

820
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
pitch. Like it's up here and you kind

821
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
of have to talk like a baby.

822
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
So all the L's and W's

823
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and all that stuff. Like you can't say

824
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Granny. He always says

825
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Dwanney. With a D.

826
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Dwanney that putty cat's

827
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
trying to chase me. And then they'll

828
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
pitch that up. And then

829
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Bugs I kind of ask them

830
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
or maybe suggest maybe not

831
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
to pitch that up at all.

832
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Because there's again something

833
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
so weird almost like Jack Mercer

834
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
doing Popeye. Where it's like

835
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
you know you who olive oil I bring

836
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
you some flowers. And you who olive

837
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
oil I bring you some flowers. It's like

838
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
it's this high pitch and kind of

839
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
low voice mixed together.

840
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And I always think that's kind of like Bugs.

841
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
It's almost like this

842
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
kind of higher pitched nasally

843
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Brooklyn Bronx accent

844
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
thing that he does.

845
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But you can still hear that grit to

846
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
his voice. Now Sylvester

847
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
and Daffy are the same voice.

848
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
By the way I'll never use this mic again.

849
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
This is like I'm probably going to have to buy this mic.

850
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So Sylvester's like

851
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
here right. He's that big sloppy

852
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
cat that's trying to eat that

853
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
bird. I'm going to eat that

854
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
yellow canary if it's the last

855
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
thing I do.

856
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
That would have got to me so much more than I thought it would.

857
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm excited about all of these but

858
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I didn't think that was going to hit me so hard.

859
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
But Sylvester

860
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
is the same voice that he did for

861
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Daffy. But they would take this

862
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and speed it up.

863
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
They'd pitch it up. And when

864
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I do Daffy I'm doing what we remember.

865
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Daffy is how he sounds.

866
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Which to me is Richard

867
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Dreyfus with a lisp. That's all it is.

868
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Mayor Vaughn

869
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
what we're dealing with here is

870
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
a perfect eating machine.

871
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
All he

872
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
wants to do is eat people and

873
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
make little baby sharks.

874
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Yeah like that's what I whenever I hear Daffy

875
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I think about like Richard Dreyfus. Geez.

876
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I never would have made that connection. That's insane.

877
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And then Pepe Lepieux

878
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I say he is in the basement for

879
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
other reasons as well. He is a

880
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
pervert and we keep

881
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
him zel. Stays down there chirp. But

882
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
he is in the same rate I say

883
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
as Vaughn Leghorn. So if you

884
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
take that same bassy type

885
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
boys and do French

886
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and then do Southern. It's

887
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
in the same. Pay attention

888
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Scott. I'm talking here.

889
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Anyways

890
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
that's kind of like the

891
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Ferris wheel of

892
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
characters I guess. Do you

893
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
visualize that too? Are you

894
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
sort of like spatially

895
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
to go to those places? Yeah.

896
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And also when we record I'm not doing

897
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
the back and forth between characters.

898
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm kind of like

899
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
when we do Bugs Bunny Builders I'll do Tweety

900
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
first then I'll do Daffy and then I'll

901
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
to separate Tweety from

902
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Bugs I'll do Daffy in the middle.

903
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Oh wow. So I'm like

904
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
reading the script like three times

905
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
essentially. When you were a kid

906
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
were you like doing it analytically or

907
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
did you just do it pretty well and then as you got older

908
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
you got the extra.

909
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I think it's the same answer for every kid

910
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
growing up. It just sounds like a kid doing it

911
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
right? It sounds like worried parents

912
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
going what's wrong with him?

913
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I think he hit his head sometime during

914
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
recess yesterday.

915
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Yeah for me it was Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

916
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
That was the movie that I

917
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
thought was real. I thought like

918
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
oh man if I go to Hollywood Bugs Bunny

919
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
will be walking down the street.

920
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
On Kohanga he's always there.

921
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
He loves it. That's a lot

922
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
more charming than like say Mike

923
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
and I going like I am scared of the dip.

924
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I can never meet this judge.

925
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
That's true. We were worried about the judge.

926
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It was real hard.

927
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Christopher Lloyd was the...I'm still terrified

928
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
of Christopher Lloyd because I'm afraid

929
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
his eyes will turn into daggers. Cartoon

930
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
daggers.

931
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
But yeah I mean

932
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I think as a kid you run around the

933
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
house thinking you...

934
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I nailed it. I nailed this voice and it just

935
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
sounds like a kid doing it. But it wasn't

936
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
until high school when they were like

937
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
okay we get it.

938
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You can do voices.

939
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Stop.

940
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Please stop.

941
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And then they'd be like well why don't we

942
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
let them just get it all out

943
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
and do the morning announcements.

944
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
They let me go on the PA system.

945
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I could have said anything. I could have done

946
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
awful things. But I took

947
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
that as a way

948
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
of creative outlet and the

949
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
teachers were so nice.

950
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Yeah Cardinal

951
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Newman High School is where I went.

952
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It's at this place in Scarborough

953
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
where I grew up which is where they filmed

954
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
The Love Guru. Mike Meyers

955
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
hits The Love Guru.

956
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Very recently talked about on this show.

957
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Really?

958
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Well that

959
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
whole scene at the end where they're dancing

960
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
they're doing the whole Bollywood number. It was

961
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
done in Scarborough.

962
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
If you just look up my high school

963
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
was right there where they were

964
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
dancing. Now I'm really impressed.

965
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Now I'm telling you. I live

966
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
like one block over

967
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
from Mike Meyers way which is

968
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
actually just a... because they named a street

969
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
after him. I'm from Scarborough.

970
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Jim Carrey was from Scarborough.

971
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Worked and lived in Scarborough.

972
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
John Candy went to high school

973
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
at Neil McNeil's. It's like an all boys high school.

974
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Yeah there's

975
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
something weird about Scarborough.

976
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
People

977
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
with the ability to morph into weird

978
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
characters I guess.

979
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Is there like a

980
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
mundanity to it that

981
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
makes a spark of like I

982
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
have to go crazy. Probably.

983
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I was going to say

984
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
what keeps us humble are those

985
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
disgusting winters. I heard

986
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
last week in Toronto there was a day

987
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
where it was like

988
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
they got like 70 degree

989
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
weather or whatever and then literally

990
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
the following day was just like

991
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
four feet of snow.

992
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Not so

993
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
fast there guys. You still got a few more

994
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
months of this shit. You ever have to fight

995
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
back the Canadian in the void? Do you ever

996
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
like find some Canadian in

997
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Daffy El Cervester? As soon as I

998
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
go back even for five minutes it's like Rick

999
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Moranis and then you come back and you're like oh

1000
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
hey like it's Louis Tully from

1001
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Who Does Your Tax? It's like I'll come

1002
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
back here and it'll just be

1003
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
like ugh. It's

1004
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
embarrassing but it's also like

1005
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
you know I always say I recharge

1006
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
my Canadian comedy batteries when

1007
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I go back. That's why

1008
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
you should.

1009
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Well so okay.

1010
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
To dovetail it back into theme park

1011
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
stuff a little bit. Oh oh here's a thing

1012
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
before we talk a little bit of Six Flags

1013
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
because this was a question I had

1014
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
just when we were DMing.

1015
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I wondered

1016
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
you must have done voices in attractions

1017
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
somewhere.

1018
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I couldn't tell you where but well I found one

1019
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
but you tell me.

1020
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Okay so it is crazy that

1021
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
now we live in this age

1022
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
and era of you know

1023
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
hey celebrities get busy. They

1024
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
get too busy or

1025
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
you know they've been known to

1026
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
ask for lots of money and

1027
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
as they should they've

1028
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
created such amazing characters.

1029
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Believe it or not

1030
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I'm the voice match for Antonio

1031
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Banderas for Puss in Boots

1032
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
for DreamWorks. Oh

1033
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
wow wow. So all

1034
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
you have to do is close your eyes

1035
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
and listen to this voice.

1036
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And that is what I do for Puss in Boots.

1037
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Yeah it's like I'm able

1038
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
to do like the sporadic

1039
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
burst of energy that he has and

1040
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
then all of that low

1041
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
stuff. Yeah.

1042
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Trust me. Yeah so

1043
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
they made

1044
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
a ride, a roller coaster

1045
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
actually in Universal Studios

1046
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Singapore. Oh right.

1047
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And surprise

1048
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I got us all tickets. We're going

1049
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
next week. Hey!

1050
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
No I didn't. Sorry guys I'm a liar.

1051
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm also aside from

1052
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
the voice match of Antonio Banderas.

1053
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
A pathological liar to

1054
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
people that I just meet.

1055
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I have to tell one big lie.

1056
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
When you came in and you said

1057
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm not a liar. I just

1058
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
took that. It turns out that was the first

1059
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
lie. That was the first lie.

1060
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And there's an on air lie which I just did

1061
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
and then when the credits roll I'll be like

1062
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
guys I'm also

1063
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
the president of the United States.

1064
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Not true. Not true.

1065
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Also a lie. Reel me in again.

1066
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
But if you are in Singapore

1067
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
please let me know how that

1068
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
because there are moments in the ride where it's like

1069
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
you're waiting and it's me going

1070
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
the restrooms are over here.

1071
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Yeah it's like yeah.

1072
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
There's arbitrary things they made me say.

1073
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
But I can't wait

1074
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
to one day

1075
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
go to Singapore.

1076
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Aside from Singapore I was

1077
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
in London for a wedding.

1078
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
To visit for a wedding.

1079
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And I was able to see something

1080
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
that I did that was a walk

1081
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
through attraction like

1082
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
by the eye. That giant

1083
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Ferris wheel. And that whole area is

1084
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
basically like Times Square

1085
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
or like you know Hollywood

1086
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Boulevard. It's basically like the attraction

1087
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
site of London

1088
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
England. And Dreamworks

1089
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
has a theater there where you do a

1090
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
walk through Shrek

1091
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
thing. And my voice is there

1092
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
as Puss in Boots. There's a thing

1093
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
where he's on a screen

1094
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
and for I don't know how they did this

1095
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I'm still like puzzled from

1096
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
this day. He coughs out a hairball

1097
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
and the hairball comes out of the screen

1098
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
and like falls into the crowd

1099
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
somewhere. Wow. Wow. And I'm like

1100
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
how did they do that?

1101
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I'm like I want to know.

1102
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I was like I have a question how the hell did you guys

1103
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
do that? It's kind of amazing how they did that.

1104
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I know how you did half of it

1105
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
from doing it.

1106
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I'm thinking of a voice and doing the coughing.

1107
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
But I was like how the hell did that come out of the

1108
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
screen? I want to know.

1109
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
That's like catching the bouquet

1110
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
at a wedding or something. You get that hairball.

1111
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Antonio Banderas

1112
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Flem. Yeah.

1113
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
The other one I saw was that

1114
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
you can assert if this

1115
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
is correct or not but I saw that you

1116
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
did the voice of Marvin

1117
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
the Martian. Yes.

1118
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Isn't that lovely? I did.

1119
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Actually of all the characters

1120
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I've done for Looney Tunes the longest

1121
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
over

1122
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
12 years I think.

1123
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Oh wow. 12 Earth

1124
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
years creature.

1125
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Isn't that lovely?

1126
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
For which was that another attraction?

1127
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I have it that you do that voice

1128
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
in Warner Brothers Movie World

1129
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Dubai. Yes Dubai.

1130
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
In Dubai. Of all the places.

1131
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
So in Dubai somewhere in the

1132
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
middle of Dubai

1133
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
exists this giant

1134
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Vegas like indoor

1135
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
theme park

1136
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
that is Warner Brothers

1137
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
and DC Comics

1138
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
themed. And it's all fully

1139
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
licensed and like there's a

1140
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Flintstones ride, there's a Looney

1141
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Tunes ride. Apparently

1142
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
a Marvin the Martian

1143
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
ride. Isn't that lovely?

1144
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And stage shows where I've done

1145
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
like

1146
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
they did something for Space Jam

1147
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
and they did like something for the holidays last

1148
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
year where I will

1149
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
have to do you know

1150
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Christmas? What's that all about?

1151
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Woohoo! I'm greedy!

1152
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I hope I learn my lesson

1153
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
in 45 minutes of dancing.

1154
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Talking about this with you.

1155
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And it's like someone in

1156
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
like poor soul in this costume like

1157
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
moving around to my voice.

1158
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
A ghost who resembles Fogger and Leggmorton

1159
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
appears to Daffy to teach

1160
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
him a lesson. Nah say

1161
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
spirit!

1162
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
No more spirit! I've seen enough!

1163
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I get it!

1164
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I'm an asshole!

1165
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Sounds like a good show.

1166
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It's going to be a good one.

1167
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
The four of us are going to

1168
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
do this right after this

1169
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
and we're on this stage. I can

1170
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
get us free tickets to it because we've been

1171
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
got in a PR email saying we

1172
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
can get free tickets but we have to fly out. Oh my God

1173
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
are you kidding me? No I'm not. All we have to do is

1174
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
finance the flight. All we have to do is fly

1175
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
and put ourselves up and then probably pay for

1176
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
food but the tickets

1177
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
are free. And watch out for various like traps

1178
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
that you might end up in.

1179
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Don't worry about that. That's nothing.

1180
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
That sort of thing doesn't happen at a Marriott Courtyard

1181
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Dubai. Three white guys

1182
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
and one Filipino Canadian. What could go wrong?

1183
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
That sounds like

1184
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
what could we get for that?

1185
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
That sounds like a bunch of bad people scratching

1186
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
their chin going yeah yeah

1187
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
millions maybe. Perhaps

1188
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
trillions. As long as we get

1189
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
to go on the Flintstones ride. Yeah

1190
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
yeah. You can hear me going

1191
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
wow wow wow wow. I do Dino's voice.

1192
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
You're in that. Yeah I do that.

1193
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Wow. Dino. So I heard

1194
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
and this is true I guess

1195
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
when I first

1196
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
booked it I was going wow wow wow wow

1197
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I was barking out and

1198
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
a very famed voice director

1199
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Andrea Romano who worked with Mel Blank

1200
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
while he was still alive. She said are you doing

1201
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
what Mel did? And I was like what's that?

1202
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
And she's like he inhaled when he barked.

1203
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Like wow wow

1204
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
to get that like higher pitch.

1205
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So there's another

1206
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
trick. Another trick. That's cool. I spell it

1207
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
on your podcast. Straight from the source.

1208
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
You have to inhale for Dino

1209
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
apparently. Is there a

1210
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow.

1211
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Is there a Mel voice you can't do?

1212
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Oh man. Have you gone through his whole IMD

1213
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
being gone? I'm just going to have to check them all off

1214
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
the list.

1215
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Yeah that's a tough one. I mean

1216
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I don't expect you to have actually gone through

1217
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
but like is there one yet glaring one?

1218
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
You know I know there's

1219
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
one. There's got to be one that I can't do.

1220
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Seems like you can do all the big ones though.

1221
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Yeah the one the important ones

1222
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
thank god. But I mean again it took

1223
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
a while. Like even with Bugs

1224
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I had auditioned only

1225
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
twice for Bugs in ten years.

1226
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
They only ever asked

1227
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
people to audition for him in

1228
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
the better part of a decade since I've been working

1229
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
with Warner Brothers. And that just

1230
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
goes to show how often they like you know want

1231
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
to. I call it the shaking of the

1232
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
ant farm. You know it's like this

1233
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
crew of people build this thing and then like

1234
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
another crew comes in and goes shh shh shh

1235
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
it's all gone. And they're like we're going to do it

1236
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
our way. But like

1237
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
in ten years it's only been twice. And

1238
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
the first time I didn't get it

1239
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
that's when I got Marvin and then the

1240
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
second time I was

1241
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
lucky. So

1242
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
you did get it. You got the foot in the door

1243
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
then and now you're oh my god.

1244
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
It was a little nutty. It was a little nutty.

1245
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But yeah.

1246
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
But even further I also want to talk a little bit

1247
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
about bringing it back to theme parks.

1248
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Growing up in Toronto

1249
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
we have Canada's wonderland.

1250
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Oh I was wondering. I've never

1251
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
gotten it. I've always been curious. It's insane.

1252
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And again I think for

1253
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
most East Coast and

1254
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Midwest parks they

1255
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
had license to use the Hanna Barbera

1256
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
characters in the 90s. And I'm

1257
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
thinking about Kings

1258
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
something. Was there you guys know?

1259
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Well Kings Dominion and Kings Island

1260
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
both had them. Yes.

1261
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
We did an episode once. I think like

1262
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
35 theme parks have had

1263
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
the Flintstones over the years.

1264
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
And then weird shady RV

1265
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
parks in Arizona.

1266
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
It's just all over the way. Whoever wants it you can

1267
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
grab the Flintstones. All the meth

1268
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
you could. The biggest meth capitals.

1269
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Yabba Dabba Doo!

1270
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
All the meth you can Yabba Dabba Doo.

1271
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
All the meth you can

1272
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Yabba Dabba Doo. I'm telling you man.

1273
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Hey Fred.

1274
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Grinding my teeth too much.

1275
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Oh good.

1276
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
But yeah. You know breathe in when he

1277
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
nails me.

1278
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
That was like

1279
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
the best time of my life growing up as a

1280
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
kid in Toronto. Going to

1281
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
what they called their kid section

1282
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
was Hanna Barbera land.

1283
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
So you would have

1284
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Bedrock mini golf. You would

1285
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
have like this you know the carousel

1286
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
that had all the Hanna Barbera characters.

1287
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I'm

1288
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
pretty sure there was like again that

1289
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
drive in that they had in

1290
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Flintstones where you could get like a Bronto Burger.

1291
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I think there was a

1292
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
jet. There was a Scooby Doo's

1293
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Goster Coaster which was awesome.

1294
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And it was like it felt

1295
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
like you were in the car. It felt like this ride

1296
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
was going to fall apart at any minute.

1297
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Which is half of the fear of being

1298
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
on this coaster. Like

1299
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
we're going to sue Scoob. Like I'm

1300
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
going to break my neck.

1301
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Like whiplash.

1302
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Like is my nose bleeding.

1303
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I can't feel my legs.

1304
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
But yeah it was unbelievable

1305
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
that this place existed. And the one

1306
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
thing that scared me the most about it was not

1307
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
the rides or anything about it. There was a

1308
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
person in a costume

1309
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
that was Jabberjaw.

1310
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
The giant shark. As a child

1311
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I was terrified of this character.

1312
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Something scary about

1313
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
a giant cartoon shark that sounds like Curly

1314
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
from the Three Stooges. Like

1315
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
that I don't know about you but scares

1316
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
the shit out of me.

1317
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
You had me a giant. That's plenty from any

1318
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
other details. Shark that's just

1319
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
icing on the cake. A cartoon shark.

1320
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Maybe because my parents let me watch Jaws

1321
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
and that's where my love for Richard

1322
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Dreyfuss comes from. Oh sure yeah.

1323
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I like

1324
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
general production value at that park.

1325
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Are things a little rickety? What is the like

1326
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
overall? So I mean they've

1327
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I've been there recently. Canada's Wonderland

1328
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
and they're good. They're

1329
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
they've held up. They still have some of the classic

1330
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
rides but have gotten rid of a lot.

1331
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
They had this really great ride

1332
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
there called The Bat and it was

1333
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
kind of like it's almost like similar

1334
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
to The Mummy where you do it one

1335
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
you do the ride one way and then you do it backwards

1336
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
and go like the complete opposite

1337
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
way. But if you were standing

1338
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
like right in front of it it looks like a bat.

1339
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
It looks like physically it looked like a bat.

1340
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
They called it the bat. I remember

1341
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Sky Rider was

1342
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
a stand up roller coaster.

1343
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
You'd be standing up completely

1344
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
and it would do like a full loop

1345
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
which was insane.

1346
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I like those. That's Riddler style. I like Riddler's Revenge.

1347
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Oh yeah I remember that when that first came

1348
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
out. I think I was here because that was

1349
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
when Jim Carrey was the Riddler right? That was

1350
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
like the big the big thing.

1351
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Those were the days.

1352
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
The Great Canadian Mind Buster

1353
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
that was like I believe

1354
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
like a giant wooden roller coaster and I

1355
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
remember this one. This is a great one. Top Gun

1356
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
the ride. So the

1357
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
ride based off of even

1358
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
before Top Gun Maverick came out this

1359
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
was like this is the real

1360
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
sequel to Top Gun if I may say.

1361
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
You gotta go on the sequel.

1362
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Oh yeah. But like it was the

1363
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
first roller coaster where your legs were like hanging

1364
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
like this. And I remember people

1365
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
were freaking out because if you're

1366
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
a tall gentleman they actually

1367
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
did a thing a test where

1368
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
they put like a tall mannequin

1369
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
on the ride and I think like at

1370
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
some point in the ride like the leg

1371
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
had like gone off

1372
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
and it's like oh my god we have

1373
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
to make adjustments. Oh god.

1374
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
We didn't compensate for tall people.

1375
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
There are no tall

1376
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
characters in Top Gun.

1377
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Well Tom is short.

1378
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Is that the secret?

1379
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Goose was a little tall but we all know what happened to

1380
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
him.

1381
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Tom doesn't let an actor

1382
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
be taller than him in the movie.

1383
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Not at all.

1384
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Kaput.

1385
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Kaput.

1386
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
On the end of like

1387
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
a questionable

1388
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
production value of four

1389
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
attractions. You can imagine that phrase

1390
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
is taking me to Six Flags. Yes.

1391
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Let's dive a little into

1392
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Let's go back. The Six Flags

1393
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
because you mentioned you do

1394
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
frequent this place with your son

1395
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
the Bug Bunny World. Yes.

1396
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Like the kids area at Magic Mountain.

1397
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
You're fond of this place. It's as if the place

1398
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
was not touched from the 90s.

1399
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
The characters and

1400
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
everything that is part of

1401
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
everything. Sun

1402
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
died, sun damaged. Like

1403
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
nothing is different

1404
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
in that place. And if there is it might

1405
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
just be the entrance signs or the exit

1406
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
signs. But essentially

1407
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
everything is untouched.

1408
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Pepe Le Pew is still there even though he's somewhat of

1409
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
a character again that they like to

1410
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
sweep under the carpet.

1411
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
You don't sweep anything under the carpet when you don't have

1412
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
the budget for new signs.

1413
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
You're like, what do you mean

1414
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
we've got to take that apart?

1415
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
That would require a wrench

1416
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
and a screwdriver. We do not

1417
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
have that sir. Yeah.

1418
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Six Flags Corporation does not. You could

1419
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
take your politically incorrect characters

1420
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
and shove them because we're not doing anything.

1421
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I'm part of the

1422
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
local union 905.

1423
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Yeah.

1424
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
To that, this is not

1425
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Magic Mountain. But I was looking up other

1426
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Looney Tunes rides.

1427
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
This is Six Flags Great America.

1428
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yes. There's some attraction. I don't know

1429
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
what type of attraction but it's called Pepe

1430
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Le Pew's Peak.

1431
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I just don't like

1432
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
to hear the word peak after. I don't want to think

1433
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
about any peak that Pepe Le Pew's.

1434
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Oh, it's his widow's peak. It's just like he gives

1435
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
him a haircut. That's the case. Fine.

1436
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
It's a little barber shop for all the kids who want

1437
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
to get their hair done like Pepe Le Pew.

1438
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
That is the style. If you walk into any super cuts

1439
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
you can ask really

1440
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Pepe Le Pew's Peak. Well they try. I mean

1441
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
look they tried roller coaster cuts and it just

1442
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
did instead. Oh yeah that's right. Six Flags

1443
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
did at a briefly in malls

1444
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
had a

1445
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
kid's haircut brand where

1446
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
kids don't like getting their hair cut. You know what we do?

1447
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
We put footage of roller

1448
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
coasters in front of them. Oh my god. That'll be fine.

1449
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
This business

1450
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
will not fall apart in a matter

1451
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
of a year and a half. Six Flags

1452
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
roller coaster cuts.

1453
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
We did an episode on our Patreon.

1454
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
That's insane. Yeah, yeah.

1455
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Did not work.

1456
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Did it not? Did it spawn?

1457
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I need a t-shirt of that.

1458
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Oh yeah that should be in your client's shirt.

1459
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
They had kids parties and stuff there too

1460
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
so I'm sure there were things like that

1461
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
out there. Yeah, haircut. Kids haircut

1462
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
party. You know you would have

1463
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
a party at the haircut. We all did it.

1464
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
We all had it. Guys, guys.

1465
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
It was the 90's.

1466
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Everyone in the fourth grade attention. I got

1467
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
a party this Friday. Don't cut your hair.

1468
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Just come

1469
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
to my party. Kids would show up

1470
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
to school on Monday and not

1471
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
half the class has their haircut and everyone

1472
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
else would feel like shit. Yeah, yeah.

1473
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
You imagine being the only kid with

1474
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
the hair over the ears going, hey where'd

1475
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
you guys go that you all got haircuts?

1476
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I wasn't invited to this

1477
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
haircut party.

1478
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Or lawnmower accident.

1479
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
You were all, yeah, all separate lawnmower

1480
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
accidents. Not talking about this anymore.

1481
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Please really fly.

1482
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
The

1483
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
thing is, in terms of like

1484
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
what I did, now, for sure

1485
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
it is like a has not changed

1486
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
in forever kind of

1487
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
land but I do

1488
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I haven't taken my son there

1489
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
but I'm tempted to just because

1490
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
like for all the stuff that Universal

1491
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
and Disney have, they don't really have

1492
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
just the little dopey land with all the kids

1493
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
rides. With all the kids stuff. Is it nice

1494
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
from that perspective?

1495
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
It is because you know like

1496
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
again, well my son is turning

1497
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
old. Last night

1498
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
we were at Super Nintendo

1499
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
World. We have platinum

1500
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
passes. We go like anytime

1501
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
between three and six, if there's nothing

1502
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
to do with your

1503
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
super hyper kid, you take him to

1504
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Universal, you run around

1505
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
you grab a Simpsons

1506
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
donut and you go home.

1507
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Oh Homer, those

1508
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Simpsons donuts are full of cholesterol.

1509
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
But Marge, it

1510
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
has my face on it.

1511
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
You do though, you've been doing those too.

1512
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
They've just been listing the old names in the

1513
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
credits and it's been you for years.

1514
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Dan Castellaneta is not a real person.

1515
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Oh wow. That's an amalgamation.

1516
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
That's true, that's not a lie.

1517
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
He's another Simpsons character. Matt

1518
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Greening created those people.

1519
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Yeah I have much respect to

1520
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
again, Krustyland.

1521
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
That's another subject you could

1522
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
talk about forever. But

1523
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
yeah, having a kid, it's limited.

1524
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
You can't bring your kid onto every ride.

1525
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Except for the fact that I

1526
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
brought him

1527
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
and it took me three times to measure

1528
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
that he was tall enough

1529
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
to ride the mummy.

1530
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
He's turning seven so he's a six year old

1531
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
and I brought him on the mummy and I'm like

1532
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
this could be good or really bad.

1533
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
He could probably burst out into tears,

1534
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
throw up all over everyone,

1535
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
freak out,

1536
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
die possibly.

1537
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
But we did it anyway.

1538
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I took him once

1539
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
and he wanted to go on it again.

1540
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
And I'm like

1541
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
daddy is cheap, he did not buy

1542
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
the ultra platinum which allows you to go

1543
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
over and over again. It's the one and done

1544
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
and we have to go home now.

1545
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And he was so pissed. He was like

1546
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
fuck you dad, you fucking ass son of a

1547
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
he didn't say that. But he felt it.

1548
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
He didn't say it, but I felt it.

1549
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
But the Harry Potter roller coaster

1550
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
at Universal, you can take your

1551
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
six year old on that. And I think

1552
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
that the Harry Potter ride,

1553
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
the half motion simulation,

1554
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
half roller coaster thing,

1555
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
which is terrifying by the way.

1556
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Because it has those

1557
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
giant ghosts in there

1558
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
and the big spiders.

1559
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
They still get to me every time. I know exactly where they are.

1560
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
It's terrifying.

1561
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
The giant tree that looks like a

1562
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
two headed penis.

1563
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
There is phallic arms for

1564
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
that tree. Yeah.

1565
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I'm like come on guys, I don't need that.

1566
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Just being punched by

1567
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
giant bendy penises.

1568
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
The weird nightmare you have.

1569
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Harry, look out for the

1570
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
giant penis tree.

1571
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Look out. Don't use your magic

1572
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
indoors.

1573
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
It's Hans. It's Hans from

1574
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Dino.

1575
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Now I have a gun.

1576
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Ho ho ho.

1577
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Just shift the accent

1578
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
barely and then you got it.

1579
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
And you got it.

1580
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I'm just

1581
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
trying to think of details or if you've

1582
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
done some of this stuff

1583
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
at...oh well that was one question I

1584
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
had was that I was like

1585
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
wait a minute, has Eric ever done

1586
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
a voice in any of these shows?

1587
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
And then when you said

1588
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
no I don't think this place has changed in many

1589
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
decades. I'm like yeah,

1590
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
you were probably not recording new VO

1591
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
for any stage

1592
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
shows at the Carrot Club Theater.

1593
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Yeah, at that time

1594
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I was just a kid. But even now

1595
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
they don't really have any of those in

1596
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
the theme park and it makes me sad

1597
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
that they don't excuse me.

1598
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Or that they don't have any like old

1599
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
ongoing announcements in the park

1600
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
where you could hear the character voices.

1601
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

1602
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
There is actually a little area in that

1603
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
in the Bugs Bunny

1604
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
world, Bugs Bunny and Friends world or whatever

1605
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
it is, where it is

1606
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
like I guess the equivalent

1607
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
of...it's like the equivalent

1608
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
of American Gladiators for children

1609
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
where it's like you have these

1610
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
air powered like, these like

1611
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
guns that fire like foam balls

1612
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
and like a ball pit

1613
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
and it's like this whole obstacle course.

1614
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
One of those indoor foam...

1615
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Yeah, but again it has slides,

1616
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
it's like a jungle gym, and it's a lot

1617
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
of fun for kids. And I always

1618
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I'm always like two bottles of Purell

1619
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
at any given moment. I'm like oh

1620
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
God, he's gonna get something

1621
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
and I'm gonna get something.

1622
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
But there's no voices in it.

1623
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
There's no characters like

1624
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
on a cheesy speaker

1625
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
going, be very, very

1626
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
careful not to fall over

1627
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
there. Ha ha ha ha. You know, like

1628
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
there's none of that. Go to the Johnny

1629
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Rockets.

1630
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Any character of your choice,

1631
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
a COVID protocols

1632
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
being scarily said

1633
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
by a Looney Tune over the loudspeaker.

1634
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
It would be porky, right? Because like you could never

1635
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
get through it and you'd be like what, what, what do we do?

1636
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
What you have to do

1637
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
in case

1638
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
that you

1639
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
run into... Oh boy, you know that

1640
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
thing that I said earlier?

1641
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
It's like just say it!

1642
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Just tell us what to do!

1643
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Porky, can you just say the word

1644
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
coronavirus? That's all we need.

1645
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Coronavirus.

1646
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Coronavirus.

1647
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
We can chop the beginning, right?

1648
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
We'll just use the end.

1649
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
We got what we need.

1650
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Let me... Now where you do see

1651
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
characters is in

1652
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
commercials and I just, I wanted

1653
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
to like play a couple

1654
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
clips for you guys and get your thoughts on them, Eric.

1655
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Jordan, if you can

1656
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
play the clip,

1657
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
let's see, I think it's just called Magic Mountain

1658
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Bugsworld. You can

1659
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
sense like an evolution in

1660
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
these ads because the vibe of

1661
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Six Flags changes over

1662
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
the years and where it started

1663
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
was like this very heartfelt

1664
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
they're clearly going for Disney

1665
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
money, which is not really

1666
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
the vibe of Six Flags anymore.

1667
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Or ever.

1668
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Let's look at this, Jordan.

1669
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Grab a smile, take a ride

1670
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Bugs Bunny World's just inside

1671
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
It's metal. It is metal?

1672
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Yeah. Bugs sounds a little old

1673
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
in that clip. Take a long

1674
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
join the show. I say you're old enough

1675
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
to go. Magic

1676
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Mountain was made just for you

1677
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Hold my hand, hang on tight

1678
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Let yourself run free

1679
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Six Flags Magic Mountain

1680
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Magic Mountain

1681
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
It's what the world should be

1682
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
It's what the world should be

1683
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
You know

1684
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
That really sounded like Bugs's

1685
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
grandfather in that clip though

1686
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
That was probably towards the end

1687
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
of his career in late 80s

1688
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
end of his life. 89 was when

1689
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
he passed away. Was his last, am I

1690
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
wrong about this, was his last role Heathcliff?

1691
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Do you know that? Yeah, I think it was

1692
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I think it was. He was Heathcliff?

1693
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
It was like, not Garfield

1694
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Right

1695
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
It was the other orange cat. Garfield but not

1696
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Incredibly

1697
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
heartfelt, right?

1698
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
And then we start getting into the evolution of it

1699
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Jordan, the next clip is called

1700
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Great America Bugs

1701
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Birthday

1702
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
If we have this. And I'm curious

1703
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
This is something I'm curious if you've ever had to do

1704
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
as any of the characters

1705
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
which is rap. Can we play this clip?

1706
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Oh, yes

1707
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Hey, it's my birthday party at Great America

1708
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Don't be late

1709
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Hey, my name is Bugs and I'm here to say

1710
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
We're gonna celebrate my birthday

1711
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
At Great America

1712
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
We'll have a ball

1713
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
So many rides, we'll ride them all

1714
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Make a splash, take a stand

1715
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
And that new coast is really grand

1716
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Great America

1717
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
That's the gist of it. That's insane

1718
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
You can tell it's a Jeff Bergman

1719
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
So he was the first guy to do

1720
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
To do voice

1721
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
To voice Bugs Bunny after Mel Blanc passed away

1722
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
was Jeff Bergman in his prime

1723
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
He was probably like

1724
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Late 20s, early 30s

1725
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
And Out the Gate, one of the best

1726
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
voice matches

1727
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I think in history. One of my heroes

1728
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
And I've gotten to work with him

1729
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Even in the capacity where I'm voicing Bugs

1730
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
And he's voicing Elmer

1731
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Just a great guy

1732
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
A super nice guy, super talented guy

1733
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
And he actually voiced Bugs in Space Jam

1734
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
A New Legacy

1735
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I had just got cast as Bugs for Looney Tunes

1736
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Cartoons, but in Space Jam

1737
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
A New Legacy, speaking of rap

1738
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I was

1739
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Daffy

1740
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I say Foghorn Leghorn

1741
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Elmer Fudd

1742
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Marvin the Martian

1743
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
And Porky

1744
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
For that I had to do a rap

1745
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Which was

1746
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
When people hear the name Daffy all they're thinking is duck

1747
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
When they hear Algy

1748
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Which is Algy Rhythm

1749
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
All they're thinking is yuck

1750
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I got LeBron and Bugs, so who should I fear

1751
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
The best tune squad in over 25 years

1752
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
You wanna be king of the web?

1753
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Well that's neat, here you go

1754
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
You can start by massaging my web feet

1755
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Wow

1756
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
And then Porky had to rap

1757
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
And it was insane because

1758
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
They asked me to do it

1759
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
And it was funny because it was a gag

1760
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
That they actually

1761
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Were trying to throw it out

1762
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
But the director

1763
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Malcolm, he really wanted it in

1764
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
And they asked me to do this rap

1765
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Because it just wasn't working

1766
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
They had other people performing this rap and it wasn't working

1767
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
And I ask

1768
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
There's something wrong with how this is

1769
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Being from Toronto, we all think we're Drake over there

1770
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
So I was like

1771
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Hey man, this isn't lining up

1772
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Something's off a little

1773
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
And I'm like is the rap longer

1774
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Was it written to be longer

1775
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And they were like actually yes it was

1776
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
And they're like, give me the full rap

1777
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
And then once you guys have that

1778
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
You'll be able to

1779
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Line it up or edit it down to

1780
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
However short you want it

1781
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
But as of now, I can't make this work

1782
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
If this isn't lining up

1783
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I'm sorry, cause you know my rap demands

1784
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Are so out of

1785
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Reach

1786
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
They gave me the full rap, we did it

1787
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
And it got back into the

1788
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Film and it was like the whole joke

1789
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Was that

1790
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Porky was able to rap without

1791
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Stuttering, that's the only thing is that he

1792
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Oh the only thing he can do

1793
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Yeah, was rap without stuttering

1794
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
That was the whole joke and I'm trying to remember that rap

1795
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
And it was

1796
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Seems like this is part of the job

1797
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Ever since the 90s, if you're doing these

1798
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Voices, you're rapping, you have to rap

1799
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
You have to, as soon as they invented that shirt with Taz

1800
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:59,560
And the

1801
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:02,600
I believe like I may have gifted him some modern stuff

1802
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,600
But I think he just goes straight for the vintage

1803
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,600
Like he loves the vintage stuff

1804
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:10,600
So, if you're looking to get Kyle a holiday present this year

1805
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,600
Make sure it is not modern

1806
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,600
Make sure it is from

1807
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,600
Like it has to say 1994 on it or something

1808
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,600
And make sure Eric has not already

1809
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,600
Purchased it on eBay

1810
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,600
If Eric hasn't demolished the Phoenix

1811
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,600
You're in a feeling of war

1812
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,600
It's probably a good two

1813
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,600
Is one more, in terms of like

1814
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,600
Modern influences

1815
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,600
Creeping into

1816
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,600
The characters

1817
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,600
You know, there were a few I was

1818
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,600
Thinking about playing, but I think the one I want to see

1819
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,600
I'm going to give it away what it is, which is

1820
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,600
Hips don't lie

1821
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,600
This is, I don't think it's Magic Mountain

1822
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,600
I think it's another six, it might be Georgia

1823
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,600
Possibly

1824
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,600
Can we see Hips Don't Lie

1825
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,600
Jordan

1826
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,600
The Shakira song

1827
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,600
Oh no

1828
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,600
Oh yeah

1829
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:04,600
Make a rabbit want to speak Spanish

1830
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,600
Make a rabbit want to speak Spanish

1831
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,600
Shake it Lola

1832
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,600
Oh baby when you talk like that

1833
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,600
You make a bunny go mad

1834
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,600
So be wise

1835
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,600
If you want to let people go

1836
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,600
Turn your stupid eyes

1837
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,600
Anywhere I'm tonight

1838
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,600
You know I'm hip don't lie

1839
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,600
This rap no feel this rise

1840
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,600
All the taxes, attention

1841
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,600
When you're eating tough, feel the conga

1842
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,600
Let me see you move like you do in the carrot patch

1843
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,600
Oh baby

1844
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,600
Wait what? Wait

1845
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,600
Let me see you move like you do in the carrot patch

1846
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,600
Oh my god

1847
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,600
Oh okay, cause the rabbits

1848
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,600
Let me see if you'd remember if you did that one

1849
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,600
Yeah

1850
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,600
Let me see the way you move like we do in

1851
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,600
I'm trying to fit some lyrics here

1852
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,600
Uncomfortably, that don't rhyme

1853
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,600
I believe that was Joe Laski

1854
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,600
He was a stand up comic as well as a stand up comedian

1855
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,600
He was in a

1856
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,600
Sitcom called Out of This World

1857
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,600
He was the wacky

1858
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,600
Next door neighbor that were

1859
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,600
That could be me right now

1860
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,600
That's your sitcom part

1861
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,600
But he was also the voice of Plucky Duck

1862
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,600
In Tiny Tunes

1863
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,600
Oh yeah, sure, man, did you grow up with that too?

1864
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,600
I think we're probably all big

1865
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,600
Tiny Tunes

1866
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,600
And eventually he voiced Daffy

1867
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,600
And Bugs

1868
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,600
Talking about

1869
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,600
Don't lie

1870
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,600
That's the weird thing too

1871
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,600
Is that I could do other people's Bugs

1872
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,600
Wait, how does this work?

1873
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,600
Impressions of other people doing

1874
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,600
Right, right

1875
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,600
So talking about hip hop, Billy West

1876
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,600
The voice of Bugs for Space Jam

1877
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:40,600
With Michael Jordan

1878
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,600
On that soundtrack, there is a track on there

1879
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,600
Called Buggin

1880
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,600
Oh yes, I know Buggin

1881
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,600
I do, I swear

1882
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,600
And it is written by

1883
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,600
Sean Carter

1884
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,600
On the album

1885
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,600
AKA Jay-Z

1886
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,600
He did not want to be credited as Jay-Z

1887
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,600
Using his god given name on that one

1888
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,600
Yeah

1889
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,600
Who does Bugs Bunny Bunny?

1890
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,600
I'll give you some time to get more carrots

1891
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,600
Every time I rhyme

1892
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,600
Can a mouse write this?

1893
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,600
I swear to you I know Buggin

1894
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,600
We used to listen to Buggin playing N64

1895
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,600
Really? Of course

1896
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,600
Wow

1897
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,600
Blasting Buggin, eating Cheetos for dinner

1898
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,600
That was the life

1899
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,600
Wow, I haven't thought about Buggin in years

1900
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,600
If you call me right now, it's my ringtone

1901
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,600
No, it's not

1902
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,600
Wait, so what's

1903
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,600
Billy West vs

1904
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,600
Joe Alaska, or like any of them in terms of

1905
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,600
How can you

1906
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,600
Spot the differences?

1907
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,600
For whatever reason, when Billy did that voice

1908
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,600
When he sang on Buggin

1909
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,600
It just sounded to me the most like

1910
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,600
Anyone has ever gotten close to it

1911
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,600
It's just within that song though

1912
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,600
For whatever reason

1913
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,600
I don't know what they did to it

1914
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,600
What they treated his voice

1915
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,600
But there was something so good about his performance

1916
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,600
In that song

1917
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,600
I feel like Bergman was the most accurate

1918
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,600
And came close to

1919
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,600
All the characters

1920
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,600
Across the board

1921
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,600
Like his Daffy is insanely good

1922
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,600
His Yosemite is like

1923
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,600
Amazing

1924
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,600
In his prime, out the gate

1925
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,600
Right when he started

1926
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,600
And then Joe Alaska kind of had his own

1927
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,600
Version of these characters

1928
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,600
But again, what ties them all together for me

1929
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,600
And then there was Greg Burson

1930
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,600
Who did Bugs Bunny in the

1931
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,600
Super Bowl commercials

1932
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,600
Before Space Jam

1933
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,600
So there was a 1992

1934
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,600
Hey Jordan and hey Jordan

1935
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,600
It was the one that was like

1936
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,600
It was like a bunch of jocks

1937
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,600
Antagonizing Bugs

1938
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,600
And then the two years later they did

1939
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,600
A super popular, you know they got my money

1940
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,600
I bought the shoes and the shirt

1941
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,600
They made another Super Bowl commercial

1942
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,600
In 1994

1943
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,600
Where it was Bugs

1944
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,600
And Jordan versus Marvin the Martian

1945
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,600
Because Marvin of course

1946
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,600
Steals all the

1947
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,600
Oh all the Air Jordans on Earth

1948
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,600
He steals them all

1949
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,600
And then two years after that is when Space Jam came out

1950
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,600
Which I think was too late

1951
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,600
I feel like it was two years too late

1952
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,600
Had it come out like literally

1953
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,600
The year after

1954
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,600
I don't know, Joe Pitca was the one who

1955
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,600
Directed those commercials

1956
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,600
And I thought did an

1957
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,600
Amazing job

1958
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,600
You know, bringing those characters

1959
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,600
Into the, you know, it wasn't

1960
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,600
Hips don't lie

1961
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,600
The way you move at the carat edge

1962
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,600
The choreographers of that show

1963
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,600
Are the new Joe Pitca

1964
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,600
I'm telling you

1965
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,600
Unfortunately that will be burned into my memory forever

1966
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,600
Thank you for that

1967
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,600
Can I ask a quick general voice actor

1968
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,600
Question? Cause I know you

1969
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,600
Go very hard, we like all these guys

1970
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,600
Thorol, Ravenscroft and stuff

1971
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,600
Do you have like your, who are your guys?

1972
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,600
Yes, yes

1973
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,600
Definitely, I was gonna say

1974
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,600
Like if it's not Mel Blanc then for me

1975
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,600
It's Don Messick again

1976
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,600
He was like the voice of Papa Smurf

1977
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,600
Scooby Doo

1978
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,600
I believe he did Scrappy Doo as well

1979
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,600
Puppi Power

1980
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,600
Hey Uncle Scoob

1981
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,600
Like it was just such a weird

1982
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,600
Range of other, like he was always

1983
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,600
The kid that if Mel Blanc

1984
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,600
Was like, you know, the main character

1985
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,600
He was the person that Mel Blanc was talking to

1986
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,600
But he had such a nice rich

1987
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,600
Voice as well. He also voiced Hampton

1988
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,600
In Tiny Toons

1989
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,600
Oh gee Plucky

1990
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,600
I don't think we could do that

1991
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,600
We gotta talk to Buster and Babs first

1992
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,600
Yeah, he was Hampton

1993
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,600
And I

1994
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,600
I actually voiced a character

1995
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,600
That he originated

1996
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,600
Doctor Quest on Johnny Quest

1997
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,600
He was the scientist with

1998
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,600
The goatee and the bowl cut

1999
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,600
And the, Johnny, Haji

2000
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,600
We have to stay close to race

2001
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,600
He's there to protect us

2002
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,600
He was this guy, yes

2003
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,600
A really white scientist

2004
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,600
That's all he was

2005
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,600
You're so great at those kind of like

2006
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,600
Stiff, smarmy

2007
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,600
Which seemed like a world of difference

2008
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,600
From the Looney Tunes characters

2009
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,600
But I guess Marvin kind of gets you

2010
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,600
Into that area

2011
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,600
Yeah, that weird like ethereal kind of like

2012
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,600
Classic sounding character

2013
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,600
And again, like bringing it back to Smash

2014
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,600
Right, like we did a lot of that

2015
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,600
Yes, you did the narration of the

2016
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,600
There was this Casino Knights thing

2017
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,600
Was one of my favorite things in the show

2018
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,600
Casino Knights, but Tigor

2019
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,600
Tigor was my favorite

2020
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,600
Because it was basically just the send up of Lion-O

2021
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,600
Yeah, yeah

2022
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,600
That's another booming kind of voice

2023
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,600
Where you know those guys were drinking

2024
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,600
And doing cocaine

2025
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,600
All sorts of things

2026
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,600
You shouldn't be doing while on the job

2027
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,600
He's like an animal

2028
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,600
Adventure kind of character

2029
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,600
Okay, how about this

2030
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,600
I'm afraid you're going to throw a glass at me

2031
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,600
That will have to be the voice

2032
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,600
But I'm also addicted to horse tranks

2033
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,600
Yes, that's my thing

2034
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,600
If you're a half man

2035
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,600
You know, half tiger

2036
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,600
You're going to be doing some heavy stuff

2037
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,600
You would be

2038
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,600
If you never

2039
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,600
I love the show

2040
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,600
You did great, Kyle did great

2041
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,600
The last episode of the show has so much great

2042
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,600
This Casino Knights thing that you narrated

2043
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,600
I love

2044
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,600
You do the voice of Tigor

2045
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,600
But a live action Tigor

2046
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,600
In a scene that's meant to play as dramatic

2047
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,600
On the beach

2048
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,600
And Kyle's skip is doing the worst acting

2049
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,600
The best worst acting you've ever seen

2050
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,600
I just don't know how

2051
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,600
I wish I were on set for

2052
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,600
If there was anything I was ever on set for

2053
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,600
I wish if I had seen that with my own eyes

2054
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,600
Seeing a guy

2055
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,600
In a tiger mascot costume

2056
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,600
Acting all

2057
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,600
It was like golden hour

2058
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,600
Perfectly Dave McCurry

2059
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,600
Overlooking the beach

2060
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,600
Yeah, yeah

2061
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,600
They built this incredible

2062
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,600
It was like our turtles dream

2063
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,600
Of what they would have done

2064
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,600
In live action movies

2065
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,600
Immaculate suit

2066
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,600
Built essentially only for

2067
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,600
Him to say really stilted dialogue

2068
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,600
And not do

2069
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,600
Even though this suit was capable of it

2070
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,600
It's built just to do this

2071
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,600
Hokey scene on the beach

2072
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,600
It was perfect

2073
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,600
And again, it's one of those things

2074
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,600
Where you're like, man

2075
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,600
If that ever had

2076
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,600
Another season or another celebration

2077
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,600
Of that show

2078
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,600
It would have been like a live theme park

2079
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,600
Version of all those

2080
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,600
All those characters in the rides

2081
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,600
You know we would have gone into some theme park territory

2082
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,600
Hips don't lie with those characters

2083
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,600
Yes, we could have

2084
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,600
It's an alternate universe

2085
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,600
An alternate universe Shakira

2086
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,600
Alternate body parts that also

2087
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,600
Don't lie

2088
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,600
A lot of things don't lie

2089
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,600
I know you've got to go, Eric

2090
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,600
One more clip just as a fun little thing on the way out

2091
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,600
And see if you can name

2092
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,600
The voices on this one

2093
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,600
This is Daffy centric

2094
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,600
I think Daffy carries this one pretty well

2095
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,600
I just listened to his birthday song

2096
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,600
This is from Australia

2097
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,600
This is a live show

2098
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,600
That they put all of in like a

2099
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,600
Souvenir video that you could buy

2100
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,600
And I was pretty delighted by this

2101
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,600
A souvenir video you could buy

2102
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,600
Of Daffy's birthday

2103
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,600
Of like everything you could do at the theme park

2104
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,600
Which talking about Warner Brothers stuff

2105
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,600
This was this crazy

2106
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,600
Returns dark ride

2107
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,600
Simulator ride that they filmed on

2108
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,600
The set, like the sets were still up

2109
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,600
And then they ran a camera through it

2110
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,600
So it really does feel like

2111
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,600
Being in a burden, it's like the closest to a burden ride

2112
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,600
Imagine the ride was

2113
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,600
You're having a close

2114
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,600
Conversation with Danny DeVito as the penguin

2115
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,600
And all that purple mouth juice

2116
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,600
Is splashing in your face

2117
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,600
He's on the verge of an orgasm and he's spewing black blood

2118
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,600
That's basically

2119
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,600
That's the ride, the Batman returns experience

2120
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,600
Like what is it? And you put your face through this hole

2121
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,600
And it's Danny DeVito on the other side going

2122
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,600
Waaah, waah, waah, waah

2123
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,600
I'm getting mad here

2124
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,600
I'm gonna fuck the cat

2125
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,600
It's Oswald, Oswald Cobblepot

2126
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,600
And then I'm doing the same

2127
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,600
I'm doing my Sumner Redstone voice

2128
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,600
I don't have a lot of vocal range

2129
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,600
But I think those are two that are good to pair together

2130
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,600
If you have a whole demo reel

2131
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,600
Of just Sumner Redstone

2132
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,600
I believe you got the parts

2133
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,600
I'm the only Sumner Redstone in the biz

2134
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,600
I figured out he's from Boston

2135
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,600
Actually the real voice, I need to get a little Boston in there

2136
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,600
So that's my personal homework

2137
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,600
Hold on, it's Hollywood calling

2138
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,600
You got the part

2139
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,600
By even thinking about it at all

2140
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,600
I'm the only Sumner out there

2141
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,600
The animated Sumner Redstone show that's coming soon

2142
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,600
Little Sumner Adventure

2143
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,600
Little Sumner Rising

2144
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,600
Sumner Babies

2145
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,600
Not all this is a legitimate baby

2146
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,600
Hey, it's my birthday party

2147
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,600
Confusingly, Jordan, I'm sorry

2148
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,600
I have another birthday song that's a rap

2149
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,600
Another one?

2150
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,600
Do you have another birthday file?

2151
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,600
I could not have made this more confusing

2152
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,600
It's a birthday song that you might

2153
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,600
You might know by a certain popular group

2154
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:56,600
Each character has their own birthday song

2155
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,600
Of course

2156
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,600
I say it's me, Vogon, and I'm here to say

2157
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,600
Wait, still not this one, oh no

2158
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,600
It's always a character and they're here to say

2159
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,600
That is how

2160
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,600
That is how a bunch of lame writers

2161
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,600
Thought rap was

2162
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,600
My name is Tweety and I'm here to say

2163
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,600
For so many years

2164
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,600
They were a little out of it

2165
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,600
They were up to their eyes in horse tranks

2166
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,600
If I didn't send it

2167
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,600
Do you also

2168
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,600
Here's an alternate one, do you have a clip called

2169
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,600
This is where bugs lives

2170
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,600
Okay, great, let's do that one

2171
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,600
This also charting the Six Flags

2172
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,600
Bugs advertising evolution

2173
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,600
This you can tell is kind of late 90s

2174
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,600
Early 2000s, they gotta get a little hip

2175
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,600
They gotta

2176
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,600
I don't want to say what it reminds me of

2177
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:42,600
It's an odd song to me

2178
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,600
The second house party movie with Kid and Play

2179
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,600
Exactly, those are the vibes I was getting

2180
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,600
Six Flags is the only one

2181
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,600
With his ride on the ride

2182
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,600
This is where bugs lives

2183
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,600
Let's eat them now

2184
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,600
Ride the rides with mom or dad

2185
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,600
Be great in time you ever had

2186
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,600
This is where bugs lives

2187
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,600
Everyone

2188
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,600
Me and you

2189
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,600
Find so much to ride and do

2190
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,600
This is where bugs lives

2191
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,600
That's still there, Bugs' house

2192
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,600
If you go in there now

2193
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,600
It's like the most

2194
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,600
It's like being on the set of Seven

2195
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,600
It's like

2196
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,600
Yeah, this is definitely a crime scene

2197
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,600
And it's Bugs' house

2198
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,600
And there's like one

2199
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,600
Sofa, like one seat

2200
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,600
One fridge, and then there's like a hole

2201
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,600
Where like actual sunlight comes through

2202
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,600
And I feel like you're in like

2203
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,600
I'm just waiting for like

2204
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,600
I'm waiting for Morgan for you to be like

2205
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,600
Don't open the box, whatever you do

2206
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,600
Do not open the box

2207
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,600
Fill the room with air freshener so they wouldn't be on to the bad smell

2208
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,600
Yeah, yeah

2209
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,600
Smells like dead rabbit in here

2210
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,600
I'll tell you, hips don't lie

2211
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,600
Yeah, I'm telling you man

2212
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,600
Go there now, go there tomorrow

2213
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,600
You'll probably see me there

2214
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,600
You'll see, yeah, see Bugs' weird little room

2215
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,600
We'll have to do an episode on Just the Room

2216
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,600
Why don't we do an episode where we go and film it?

2217
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,600
Yeah, yeah

2218
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,600
That's the next possible

2219
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,600
If there was a sequel to this episode

2220
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,600
We might have to do that

2221
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,600
I mean of course with our phones and not tell anyone

2222
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,600
That we're doing that there, but

2223
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:14,600
I think nobody would

2224
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,600
The full camera crew

2225
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,600
They're not looking out to have an idea

2226
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,600
Like a 50 person shoot, I think

2227
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,600
You could get away with

2228
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,600
Recording an entire podcast in that

2229
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,600
Little Bugs Bunny room

2230
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,600
I think so, maybe that's the next

2231
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,600
That's the only way we can top this is doing it

2232
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,600
In his house, if there's room

2233
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,600
For four people in there

2234
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,600
That I'm not sure about

2235
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,600
If one of the employees kind of tries to figure out what's going on

2236
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,600
We just go, hey, get out of here

2237
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,600
And they go, alright

2238
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,600
Hey, weren't you just vaping in here kid?

2239
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,600
Slip them a 50

2240
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,600
Or a vape cartridge

2241
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,600
And then they'll be on their way

2242
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,600
Live from Pepe LePieu's peak

2243
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:54,600
It is the podcast

2244
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,600
We can't record there, no

2245
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,600
Eric, this has been an absolute blast

2246
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,600
I'm thrilled to say

2247
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,600
Eric Bazza, you survived Podcast the Ride

2248
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,600
I would go again

2249
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,600
In the words of my son

2250
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,600
Can we do this again?

2251
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,600
Oh, that's great

2252
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,600
F you dad, I can't believe you're not letting me ride the mummy twice

2253
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,600
Sorry, Ultra Platinum Podcast

2254
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,600
The Ride, yes only

2255
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,600
Sorry, being the voice of a

2256
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,600
Woody Woodpecker doesn't matter son

2257
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,600
Yeah, the insult to injury

2258
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,600
Is that your son had to be mad for the first

2259
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,600
15, 20 minute escalator ride back to the upper

2260
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,600
It was hell

2261
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,600
It was hell

2262
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,600
But guys, thank you so much for having me on

2263
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,600
I had a great time reminiscing

2264
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,600
And talking about freaking theme parks

2265
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,600
And rides

2266
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:40,600
And again, how they predict the future

2267
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,600
Sometimes

2268
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,600
Like Tom Hanks and Big

2269
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,600
This is a magical garment

2270
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,600
Thank you for bringing it

2271
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,600
I hope some of the magic

2272
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,600
I don't know, unfurls on to us somehow

2273
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,600
Yeah

2274
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,600
Or I lose it in this episode

2275
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,600
And tomorrow they tell me I'm fired

2276
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,600
Hey, remember that fame and fortune

2277
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,600
Contract that you signed the other day

2278
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,600
It's gone

2279
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,600
It got rained on

2280
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,600
Let's exit through the gift shop, is there anything you'd like to plug?

2281
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,600
Just my appearance on this show

2282
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,600
That's it

2283
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,600
Watch this show right now

2284
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,600
God damn it

2285
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,600
And if you just finished listening, send it to your friends

2286
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,600
Oh, wow

2287
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,600
That's a really good plug

2288
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,600
That's not a plug that we do

2289
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,600
That's thoughtful and we should incorporate

2290
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,600
He could have plugged Bugs's house

2291
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,600
He could have done anything, but this is very nice

2292
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,600
That's what Canadians do

2293
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,600
That's right

2294
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,600
The politeness and the sweetness that I appreciate

2295
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,600
The only real way to end it is

2296
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,600
That's all folks

2297
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,600
I was gonna ask

2298
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,600
Oh, jeez

2299
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,600
