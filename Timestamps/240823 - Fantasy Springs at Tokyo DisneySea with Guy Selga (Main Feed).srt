00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Warning, the following podcast may contain

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
alternate universe Michael Eisner

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
jaundiced hamburger buns

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
giving action figures little kisses

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and a brief encounter with a rock legend

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
uh, a fake rock legend

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
all that plus Guy Selga returns to talk

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Tokyo DisneySea's newest expansion

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Fantasy Springs

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
on today's podcast

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Goodbye!

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Welcome to Podcast the Riot

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
a theme park podcast hosted by three men

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
who turn into Sherlock Holmes when it comes to

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
concept art for new theme park lands

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
my dear Watson, Jason Sheridan

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The game is afoot, Holmes

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Is there a third character before I do, Scott?

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yeah, I was gonna say, what the hell do you do with me?

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm not Moriarty, that's the other side of it

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But Moriarty, doesn't he team up with them sometimes

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
in different versions of Sherlock Holmes?

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Ask Mr. Book over here

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah, I know, smarty pants

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What do you think?

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I am not knowledgeable about all the adaptations

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
maybe that fox, was it Fox Kids?

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Was it Fox Kids?

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
There was a future Sherlock Holmes

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Mr. Literary has referred us to Fox Kids

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Fox Kids, yeah

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You've never read a Sherlock Holmes?

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Really?

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I've read a bunch of Sherlock Holmes

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay, but Moriarty never teams up with them in one of them?

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
He's usually a villain, antagonist

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm familiar with that

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There's gotta be one where he teams up with them

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And one where Moriarty

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
stares at a picture to see

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
if the shape of a building resembles

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Is there currently existing cityscape

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
that's just reskinned or repainted?

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
There's gotta be one

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And the Fox Kids one I bet there was an episode like that

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
where he was looking at

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
concept art and he was trying to figure out

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
if they had rethemed one quick service restaurant

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
into a different quick service restaurant

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Because he's a brilliant mind

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
so he could be able to tell just from the art

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I can only go so far, my dear Watson

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We may need to consult

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
with some consortium of dorks

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The Scott Kids one is in the far

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
flung future

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And Scott, you could be

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Mrs. Hudson

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
the landlady

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Does she help them solve mysteries?

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, she comes through

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Mrs. Hudson sometimes accidentally

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
points them in the right direction

67
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Does she take their money?

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Do I get your money?

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Then I'll be the landlady

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Is there another character

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I could intro or guest as

72
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
before I do the intro

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
from this Fox Kids

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Is there a new character that you could find

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
on the Wikipedia?

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Not in this

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
amount of time

78
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Has he been on the Wikipedia?

79
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I just couldn't remember Mrs. Hudson

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm just going to intro our guest

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm not going to give him a Sherlock Holmes character

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But we could add it later too

83
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He's returning to Podcastaride

84
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He's a writer for Touring Plans

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's Guy Selgo, welcome back

86
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Thanks for having me back

87
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's so nice to be back amongst theme park journalists

88
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And you can just

89
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Are you giving us that?

90
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You can assign me one of the Bobby's World characters

91
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's fine too

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You'll just go Fox Kids, that's great

93
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What about Life with Louie, like Louie's dad

94
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Any old cartoon

95
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
they made off of a weird perverted

96
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
comedian in the era

97
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I like that uncle

98
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
from Bobby's World

99
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't remember his name

100
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Not Howard

101
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Generic

102
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I just remembered that

103
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
They have to correct

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
the name all the time

105
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But who was the uncle, the uncle is the guy you want to be

106
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I can't come up with it, I can't think of the name either

107
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Before we get started, I did bring

108
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
a couple of gifts, I'll be quick with this

109
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Hi, thank you

110
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's so nice

111
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Mike and Jason, I just want you to enjoy

112
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
these delicious donuts that I brought you

113
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Whoa

114
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
They gave you a total sugar bomb one

115
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
They called it raspberry bomb

116
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Jason

117
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm giving you a peanut butter and

118
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
jelly donut

119
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Scott

120
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You get no donut

121
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's fine, that is a fine calculation

122
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He likes that

123
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You will receive a cursed item

124
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Oh my god

125
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The opposite of a sweet treat

126
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I will explain why

127
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
There have been several episodes of this podcast

128
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
where you have admitted to not remembering

129
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
the country bear's names

130
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
in the country bear jamboree

131
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yeah, even after the last time we saw you was for country bears

132
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and it's all been out of my head

133
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So you are receiving

134
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
what some say is the worst

135
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
video game ever made, it's Shaq-Fu for the Super Nintendo

136
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Well you say

137
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
punishment and yet

138
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
this art will brighten

139
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
my house, Shaq in a Shaq-Fu

140
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
pose

141
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Even your son will ask daddy

142
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
why is our family cursed

143
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and you will have to explain to him

144
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
No, hardly, our home is protected

145
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
now by an enforcer of justice

146
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes

147
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Wow, wow, from a

148
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
video game reselling place

149
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh this is rad, I might pop this

150
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I got the, you know

151
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm a bit of a gamer, I have a

152
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
SNES combo

153
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
console

154
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
recently purchased

155
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
for Dr. Mario

156
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I have literally never put anything

157
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
in the Super NES slot

158
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
so this might be the debut

159
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Thank you for keeping that particular reader

160
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
alive on my console

161
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Kick it off, I clocked hours

162
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
on Shaq-Fu on Genesis

163
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and it is

164
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
it's pretty odd

165
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
it's very strange

166
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It is a strange game, yeah

167
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Almost like the combination of Shaq and Halloween

168
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
or Shaq and the general

169
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Shaq and essentially any of the Shaq and Soda

170
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Shaq and Soda

171
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And they made a Shaq-Fu sequel

172
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
only a few years ago

173
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Legend reborn

174
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
All the modern consoles and PC

175
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and everything

176
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
How did this not come across my desk?

177
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I think it flopped hard and was very bad

178
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
but that keeps in with the spirit of

179
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
the franchise I suppose

180
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Well and with different endorsements to check

181
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
usually is involved

182
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I think they may have even kickstarted it if I remember correctly

183
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Wow, that's crazy

184
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm dying to see another character name

185
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm scanning Wikipedia

186
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Setra

187
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Kaori

188
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Ryotsu

189
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Where are these donuts from?

190
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Old Ferry is like

191
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I see them mostly in areas with a lot of

192
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Asian restaurants and things

193
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I live near Buena Park

194
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Thank you for coming up here

195
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You live in the greatest city in the world

196
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yes, Bee Park

197
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It only took me 90 minutes to get here

198
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh my god

199
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm sorry

200
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We gotta give you a show then

201
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
We gotta make it worth the drive

202
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Well, hey, good news

203
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
When you get home and you wanna crash

204
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Sherlock Holmes

205
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
in the 22nd century

206
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
is available

207
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
on Tubi

208
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Like all the best stuff

209
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Tubi's so good

210
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I love Tubi

211
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Are you still working on another character?

212
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No

213
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Oh, did I need another character?

214
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
We got a whole hour

215
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We got a whole hour

216
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We have someone who actually knows about

217
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
theme park things

218
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We have to take advantage of that

219
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Guy, you've done a lot

220
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You've traveled a lot lately

221
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You're everywhere lately, I feel like

222
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes, I was at D23

223
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You were texting me, asking me questions

224
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Are people into this?

225
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yes, yes

226
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I guess I accidentally cited you anonymously

227
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
on our recap episode

228
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But Guy is the source for

229
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
was the audience liking all these songs

230
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And specifically

231
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
right before we started recording

232
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
there was some discussion of Mad Tea Party

233
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and was Mad Tea Party working out

234
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
in the room

235
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
People were loving it

236
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
They gave out these wristbands where they

237
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
had a light on it that synced with the music

238
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
during all the songs

239
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
There was a big spectacle, there were lasers

240
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What do you think was the biggest hit

241
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
or even one that you liked a lot?

242
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Because I imagine that music stuff played

243
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
better in the room

244
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And there were some legit big acts here and there

245
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What worked the best?

246
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I think what legitimately

247
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
moved people was the Megan

248
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Trenor singing Feed the Birds

249
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
People were

250
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
sobbing

251
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
in the audience

252
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Which I don't like

253
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's not her vibe is to make people sob

254
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
How dare they put her in that situation

255
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
She was playing against

256
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
type

257
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You're just used to a certain trenor vibe

258
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And she's showing you that she has more range

259
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But in terms of announcements

260
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
In terms of announcements though, people were really into

261
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
the Magic Kingdom Night Time Parade

262
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That seemed to get a huge reaction

263
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Did we even discuss it in the show?

264
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
In a very lengthy episode

265
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What is the selling point with that?

266
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What's exciting about that parade?

267
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I think people are just excited to have a new nighttime parade

268
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It has been a while, right?

269
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Have they not been running one at all

270
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
or just an old one?

271
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
They were doing Main Street Electrical Parade

272
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and then that ended

273
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
before the pandemic, right?

274
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Right, I think

275
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh, so there has not been one since

276
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah

277
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And then

278
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
We recorded forever

279
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
There was a couple big ones we left out

280
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We didn't even talk about Robert Downey Jr.

281
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
being on all the Marvel rides

282
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Oh, that is kind of a bit

283
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That it's not just

284
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Well, that's bad news for anybody for sound-alikes out there

285
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Like anybody who is Pepper

286
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Anybody can swivel the head

287
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That's what you gotta do to make the voice happen

288
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So yeah, I guess he's replacing all

289
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Right? That's what your take is on it?

290
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
He's gonna do all the voices

291
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I wonder if they'll re-record his little

292
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's what I'm wondering

293
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Who knows?

294
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah, I don't know, but I assume that's part of the big Dr. Doom package

295
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
that he signed

296
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
to do the new movies

297
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Well, if we're giving you

298
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
80 million dollars

299
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
More? Is it more?

300
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I tried to guess a big number

301
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and that was still not the number

302
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I bet it's 80 guarantee

303
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And then there's potential for

304
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah, there's like targets

305
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If it goes over a billion

306
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Then we'll toss some more your way

307
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, probably

308
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So yeah, that was in the package

309
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I assume, so now he'll be on

310
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
the rides going forward and maybe the old rides

311
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't know

312
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't know if you caught how they announced it either

313
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But they showed Bob Iger

314
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
on the kooka arm thing

315
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and it was blurred out who was sitting next to him

316
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah

317
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And then they revealed the blur

318
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
People went crazy

319
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This is where we were at a disadvantage

320
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
watching a livestream because when they revealed the blur

321
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I was like, who's that?

322
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
From a cell phone camera

323
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
really far away

324
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and still not a great picture

325
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
up on the screen

326
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I truly was like, is that Stamos from a weird angle?

327
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Or are they showing us?

328
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Is that Michael Eisner?

329
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Imagine if he was doing the voice

330
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Bring him back

331
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It returns

332
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
when we need him the most

333
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't love wearing a suit

334
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
without a big 90's

335
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
blocky tie pattern

336
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
but I guess this suit is cool as well

337
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
If he was still CEO

338
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
that would be certainly an intro for some wonderful

339
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
world of Disney where he's in an Iron Man

340
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
outfit or something

341
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He suits up and then you

342
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
throw the thing like a dummy

343
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
and he lands in bushes

344
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I think we need some work on that take off

345
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Enjoy the show, folks

346
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
We should just write a bunch of new ones

347
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
that would have happened in the last decade

348
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That is pretty good

349
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
For the broadcast premiere of Wish

350
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes, and then like Solo

351
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
what he would have done for Solo

352
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
on Disney

353
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
or on ABC or something

354
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm a Solo writer as well

355
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
He's in line with

356
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Han Solo or something

357
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Are you together? No, he's alone

358
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And then they cut to the actual movie

359
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
and it's like, oh Solo, okay

360
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That would have been a good one

361
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We'll do this off mic

362
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
but this is maybe a whole else world

363
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's a full episode, it's just brainstorming

364
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
When was the last time he did that?

365
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Like two decades ago?

366
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We could fill in two decades worth

367
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
of hypothetical Michael Eisner

368
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
intros

369
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Wish coming out

370
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Mars Needs Moms

371
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We're proud to present the world

372
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
broadcast premiere of Mars Needs Moms

373
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And I Need My Mom

374
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And then she comes and acts

375
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and she's the worst actor

376
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
With a wig or something

377
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That might be a little silly for him to do

378
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Would he be willing to dress up like an old lady?

379
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I don't know, that's a good question

380
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Now Michael

381
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I guess brainstorming

382
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'd like to imagine it

383
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
This is blue sky, so we can sort of

384
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
cast however we want in these scenarios

385
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
If only

386
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Well, maybe that's a future episode

387
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
But yeah, were there any other

388
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
big highlights on the show floor

389
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
like Imagineering Pavilion or anything?

390
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Imagineering Pavilion was really cool

391
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
They did these little mini presentations

392
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
every 15 minutes

393
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
where an Imagineer would come up and talk about

394
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
themed lighting or the floor

395
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
or how they paint something

396
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
or sound design

397
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And you could just walk up and wait

398
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and see it and that was nice

399
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And then they had the Elsa animatronic

400
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
from DisneySea on display

401
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So that was cool to see up close

402
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The movements on the mouth

403
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
looks amazing

404
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And then there was a booth

405
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
which was heavily sponsored by Dolby Atmos

406
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And so you would walk through

407
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and it was just a nice themed environment

408
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
with swooshing banshee sounds

409
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
overhead and then a mighty eekron of course

410
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
to take a picture with

411
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And then a baby eekron

412
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
that was like an 80's Epcot

413
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
figment style puppet thing

414
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So a scientist is like holding

415
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
a little baby eekron

416
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
and he's like, now you're just feeding time?

417
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Is this anything they do

418
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
in Animal Kingdom?

419
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Or that they might do here when it's open here?

420
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I don't know

421
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It sounds great

422
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It sounds similar to the baby raptors

423
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
at the Drask World

424
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Drask Park

425
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
areas at Universal

426
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
with the trainers holding them

427
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Was the baby eekron cute?

428
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It was kind of cute

429
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You believe that though

430
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I do, yeah

431
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
We're all pretty

432
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
horrified by any depiction of Avatar babies

433
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
A little less in the film

434
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
although even still

435
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It didn't prevent me from crying

436
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
in that part of Way of Water

437
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The only film

438
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
that has moved me in the father way

439
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
since becoming a father

440
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But I still

441
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
most depictions

442
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
still a little bit creepy

443
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm trying to remember

444
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
because I saw photos of that

445
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
baby eekron

446
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
They usually just have stuff sitting out

447
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That sounds bad

448
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
They're sitting out in the sun or something

449
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
They have robots and stuff

450
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
or costumes and stuff sitting out there

451
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Then they had the Disney Archives booth

452
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
which this year was cars themed

453
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
not the franchise cars

454
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
but movie cars

455
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
They had a 1964 World's Fair car

456
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
from the Ford Magic Skyway

457
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
They had an old 80's Disneyland parking lot

458
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
which I actually saw on the 5

459
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
when I was driving up to Burbank on Monday

460
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Back to the storage

461
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That's funny

462
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
They had the volume

463
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
from Lucasfilm

464
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
set up, not like a mini one

465
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
the full on thing

466
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You could record a little 10 second scene in it

467
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
after you waited for 2 hours

468
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That was really neat to see up close

469
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and see it shift with the movement of the cameras

470
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Have you posted your scene?

471
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What did you do in the volume?

472
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I did not do it, a friend did

473
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The scene he got was with a stormtrooper

474
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I think he was just like

475
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
let's get out of here

476
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I don't really know what you would do in 10 seconds

477
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It looked cool though

478
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
just to see

479
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I saw somebody post it

480
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I think R2D2 was in it

481
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That's something I would have wanted to know

482
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
was there before so I could have dressed up

483
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
in some ways

484
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
not as a Star Wars character necessarily

485
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
but as a Star Trek character

486
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I was going to say American Graffiti character

487
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yes!

488
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I don't know the names of any of the characters

489
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
in American Graffiti

490
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
No

491
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Just a leather jacket

492
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
or a cardigan with a big letter on it

493
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Jason, real quick

494
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
do you have a cardigan with a big letter on it

495
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
No, I have a number of cardigans

496
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I go back and forth

497
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But not with a big J?

498
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
No, I should

499
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I should look into that

500
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Birthday is coming up

501
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I have a cardigan with a big J on it

502
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And if you want to be a really good friend

503
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
a big J in it

504
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Hell yeah, Burler

505
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Were people high at D23 at all?

506
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I saw people getting drinks

507
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
at the Honda Center

508
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
There was one cocktail

509
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
that was $40 by the way

510
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Really?

511
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That's like Sphere prices

512
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm trying to think

513
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
what else

514
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You skipped the parks panel

515
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You didn't go to the movie thing

516
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
No, I skipped the movies

517
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
No disrespect

518
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I went to the legends a couple of years

519
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's kind of boring

520
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I skipped that every year

521
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But yeah, parks panel

522
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I feel like I got to be there for that

523
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Just as much as theme park nerds in a room

524
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
screaming at stupid stuff

525
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Were you satisfied with the screaming you got today?

526
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What was your feeling coming out of there

527
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
in terms of announcements?

528
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
This is not blue sky

529
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
We're ready to put shovels in the ground

530
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But some of that is so far off

531
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Stuff is going to change

532
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Budgets are going to change

533
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Some movies are going to come out

534
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That's a hit that gets priority

535
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You know it's going to happen

536
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
My expectations are so tempered

537
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That's the right way to be

538
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Did you hoot and holler

539
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
at any one specific announcement?

540
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Did you just feel like it came over your body

541
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
or were you too reserved in the panel?

542
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Of course

543
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I was getting excited for Coco

544
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I think that'll be a cool environment

545
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
to ride through

546
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
If the Avatar boat ride really is Shanghai Pirates

547
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
that's going to be sick

548
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
One giant land dominating

549
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
attraction that's scenery to look at

550
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
if you're not on it

551
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
and then incredible to be on it too

552
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
sounds great

553
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What is your Avatar location guess?

554
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
We won't make you bet

555
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Unless you want to

556
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I just feel like it has to be

557
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Hollywood land

558
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Also with Disneyland Forward

559
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You guys may have said this on your episode

560
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I think we will never hear that name again

561
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
That's a good notion

562
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That was the functional campaign

563
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
to the city

564
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
but it's not a very attractive

565
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
exciting term as a new place

566
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Let's go to Disneyland Forward

567
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I agree with you on Hollywood land

568
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
This is maybe too long of a conversation

569
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
to have on this episode

570
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
but we'll try to do it real quick

571
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's interesting

572
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
If they do third park in Disneyland

573
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
then they get to make a big splashy announcement

574
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I feel like they get to charge more at once

575
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
because it's an extra ticket

576
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
but then they have to build it all at once

577
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
If they just start adding to California Adventure

578
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
in Disneyland they can do it in pieces

579
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
but then it's not quite as splashy

580
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
and I feel like they only slowly

581
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
make money over time

582
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I was trying to go back and forth on

583
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
even if Disneyland Forward turns into more stuff

584
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
or a third park

585
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I don't know

586
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I don't know if you have any insight or guesses

587
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's just a guess but it seems like

588
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
they really want to add capacity to DCA

589
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I see a lot of people online

590
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
are speculating that they're going to replace

591
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Grizzly Peak with Avatar

592
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't think they're going to want to lose all that capacity

593
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I think they want to add

594
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
That's clearly the thing right now

595
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
They're adding to all the parks

596
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
That doesn't make a lot of sense to me

597
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and what does it do to Soarin

598
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
and the flow of everything in general

599
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You've also got the tricky thing

600
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
if you look at that Disneyland Forward plot

601
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
that there's so much more

602
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
on the DCA side

603
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
than the Disneyland

604
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
There's a good amount up there

605
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
but it starts to get a little awkward space way

606
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I think the Disneyland Forward plan

607
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
is a lot better for California Adventure

608
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
than for Disneyland proper

609
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's a three story lot

610
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and a whole gate there

611
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Right

612
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's weird though

613
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
as it stands

614
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
it would be the smallest park

615
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
easily

616
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That's an awkward thing about it

617
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's interesting

618
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and the fact that the only thing they've floated

619
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
as a possibility for over there

620
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
is a mall with a Jockalinsies

621
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm almost in support of that

622
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
over a park in a way

623
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
There are a bunch of new places to drink

624
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
that are fun

625
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yeah, and they could maybe add one ride

626
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You could do a little celestial park

627
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
thing over there

628
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Give it one little experience or something

629
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That's a fun idea

630
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
As a fan of that Burbank plan

631
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
that never came to pass

632
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
there would have been a mall with a great movie ride

633
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
or probably by 1997

634
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
a mall

635
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I guess all that

636
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That's a third park

637
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I feel like that's 15 years away

638
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
and if it's just adding lands

639
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
then maybe we'll get that in 8 years

640
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yeah, I think you're totally right

641
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Not to say too much about how we're

642
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
putting this together

643
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
We are recording this

644
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
We discussed the possibility

645
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
that we hear what the Muppet deal is

646
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
while we're recording

647
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
then we'd have to emergency get it up

648
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
We are

649
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm refreshing Twitter

650
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So far nothing

651
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
John Goodman is trending and I don't know why

652
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I am on my

653
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
theme park Twitter list

654
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
and I do not see any Muppets

655
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
talk at the moment

656
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
This is the morning and I think it's going to be

657
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
released at the end of day

658
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
They want the news cycle to forget

659
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But talking about adding capacity

660
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
to parks

661
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
turning the Muppets and Grand Avenue

662
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
area into a construction site

663
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
you lose multiple

664
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
restaurants, you lose a show

665
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
as opposed to

666
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
everyone mentions the

667
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
animation courtyard

668
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
that would add capacity

669
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
and not take away a show

670
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
in a bunch of restaurants

671
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
That would make the most sense

672
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
But it's more expensive

673
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I don't know

674
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I've heard all the chatter

675
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
and we'll see

676
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
We might have seen by the time we're here

677
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I don't know

678
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It's a scary time

679
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
in America

680
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
for this reason only

681
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
There's one big thing that's going to happen towards the end of this year

682
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
that I'm worried about

683
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
and instead of the Muppets going to close

684
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm so glad this is all we have to worry about

685
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's the only thing I'm worried about

686
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
going forward

687
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
That's all very cool

688
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Do you want to talk

689
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
about what we discussed

690
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You went to Fantasy Springs

691
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
which is the new expansion at

692
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
our beloved Tokyo Disneyland

693
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Tokyo DisneySea

694
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
That's very exciting

695
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
We're very jealous

696
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
As soon as you brought up this topic

697
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I was like, I guess we should talk about it

698
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
even if we didn't go

699
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I still feel like I tried to do it

700
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
with only light spoilers

701
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I watched ride throughs

702
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
but I didn't memorize ride throughs

703
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I still want some

704
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
However, I definitely do want to hear

705
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
what it's like on the ground

706
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and just get a shape of the place

707
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Do you want to start off with the story

708
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
of Fantasy Springs

709
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I don't know it

710
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
This is the official story off of the website

711
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It's four paragraphs long

712
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I know it might take a little bit

713
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
but Mike or Jason, can one of you read the story

714
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You're donating the story

715
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You do it

716
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Okay

717
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'll just do whatever feels right

718
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Let the story guide it

719
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Once upon a time in a land far away

720
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
there was a magical spring

721
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
where a sprite

722
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Is that sprite you think?

723
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's not sprit

724
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You never know

725
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
The spritz

726
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's spirit actually

727
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
The spirit is in the second line

728
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
While the spirit fed beautiful gardens

729
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
in great distances where she encountered enchanted stories

730
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Upon returning home

731
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
the spirit used her powers to sculpt

732
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
stone, branch and bank

733
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
into intricate shapes resembling

734
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
those she met

735
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
As she bubbled and sparkled in pools

736
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
fountains and waterfalls

737
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
the spirit often sang melodies discovered

738
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
on her many journeys

739
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Okay so what do we got here so far

740
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
There's a spirit and she's singing and turning bank into

741
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
A spirit happened to encounter

742
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
many stories that were all

743
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
intellectual property of one company

744
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
and kind of you know

745
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
some of the more popular ones

746
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
and not Mars needs moms

747
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Okay yes good recap

748
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
One day a duchess who loved

749
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
travel and adventure discovered

750
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
the beauty of the springs

751
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Wandering along the rivers and streams of the springs

752
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
the duchess found herself transported

753
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
to magical places

754
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
The duchess loved the enchanted

755
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
springs so much that she built a little

756
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
summer home nearby

757
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
As more of her friends visited

758
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
the duchess built a grand palace to host them all

759
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Even today should you follow

760
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
the water flowing from the springs source

761
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
you would come to fabled kingdoms

762
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
found in storybook tales

763
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Wow

764
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
So like a rich lady

765
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
liked this place so she built a mansion there

766
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Yeah

767
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Interesting

768
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Hopefully no spirits residing in the specific spot

769
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
where I want to build the mansion

770
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Because I was like alright spirit

771
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
and then something kind of like pulled

772
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
something from the ground in a magical way but no like a

773
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
rich lady

774
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Can I read the next paragraph?

775
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Okay let me hear it

776
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Wow so the duchess then encountered

777
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
a very tall man almost a giant

778
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
His name was Shaquille O'Neal

779
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
He was soon after walked into a dojo

780
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
while heading to a charity basketball game

781
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
in Tokyo Japan

782
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
He went to another dimension the second world

783
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
to rescue Nezu from the mummy Setra

784
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Oh wow

785
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It's actually good you brought the game

786
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
because it ties into the mythology

787
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It's all one seamless mythology

788
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
That's cool

789
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So this story of fantasy springs

790
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Do you think that

791
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
visiting the land you will know any of this?

792
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I mean

793
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Do you think this is said

794
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
anywhere in the land or conveyed in any way?

795
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Did you know it before

796
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
or find it out after?

797
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I read it before

798
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Because I saw someone else point out

799
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Have you seen this story? It's absurd

800
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And then visiting there

801
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
This is mentioned nowhere, none of this

802
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Would you say it's more

803
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
or less active

804
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
This is before all of our time

805
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But if we had to compare it to how much

806
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
the story of merry weather

807
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
pleasure was present if you went

808
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
into the 8 tracks club

809
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
But there's no plaques

810
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
There's no plaques saying this story

811
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
So less present because there were plaques there

812
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
But not even a plaque

813
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
This is an online only mythology

814
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
But is the summer home there?

815
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
The summer home is the

816
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
fantasy springs hotel

817
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Because I think it says

818
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
more visitors

819
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
started coming so then she built

820
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
a grand hotel for all her

821
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
friends who are visiting

822
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
So that's how they justify the hotel

823
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And the hotel was very

824
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
grand, some parts of it a little bit grander

825
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Other parts

826
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
There weren't enough wishes to make it

827
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
quite as grand as the most grand

828
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
You know how it goes, you gotta budget these wishes

829
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
The duchess was a little bit down

830
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
on her luck that she didn't have as many

831
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
millions as she normally did

832
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
The duchess isn't always crushing it

833
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So as we go through

834
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
this land, just keep all that in mind

835
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'm sure you've all memorized it already

836
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Remember that duchess

837
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I like that duchess though is an IP now

838
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
of Disney

839
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
She's not duchess from the aristocats

840
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
She's just a duchess

841
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Different duchess

842
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
This land or port

843
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
as they're called in Disney Sea

844
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It's located between

845
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Arabian coast and

846
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Lost River Delta

847
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Which is sort of like far corner of

848
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
the park, it's a long walk

849
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
way past everything

850
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It is a very long walk, a friend told me

851
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
that if you walk from Hotel Mira Costa

852
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
at the main entrance of the park to

853
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Fantasy Springs Hotel, it's the same walk as

854
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
walking from Shinjuku Station to

855
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Harajuku Station

856
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So that's like, I think a mile and a half

857
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Geez, wow

858
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
So it's very long

859
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
The entrance of Fantasy Springs

860
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
actually reminds me a lot of Galaxy's Edge

861
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Because it's these two caves

862
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
that you go through, one is an entrance

863
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and one is an exit

864
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So you're exiting kind of

865
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
this hyper realistic

866
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
lands of the main

867
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Disney Sea into what is essentially

868
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
their fantasy land

869
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Right, okay

870
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
So it kind of exists outside of

871
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Because it is the first area of Disney Sea

872
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
that's not centered around, that doesn't touch

873
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
the main waterway that kind of

874
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
connects all of the ports

875
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
So it almost, you literally do

876
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
enter another world in a way

877
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Yeah, and I was going to say this at the end

878
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
but now's a good time, it does feel

879
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
very disconnected from the rest of the park

880
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And

881
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
you know, in every land

882
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
and all the other ports, you see Mount Prometheus

883
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
and you kind of see each

884
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
land's interpretation of Mount Prometheus

885
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
So in Cape Cod it's very calm, it's a calm

886
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
mountainside, in

887
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Mysterious Island it's an ominous volcano

888
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
You can see

889
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Mount Prometheus from one spot inside

890
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Fantasy Springs, and it's an

891
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
afterthought, you're inside Skull Rock in

892
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
the Peter Pan area, and you just see a

893
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
little glimmer off in the distance of Mount

894
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Prometheus

895
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And that is on purpose, because there's so

896
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
much thought put into all the different

897
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
vantage points in Tokyo Disney

898
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Sea, it's amazing

899
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It's almost like a preview of what that

900
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
disconnected California adventure

901
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
across the street might feel like

902
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Like a park that is

903
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
sort of

904
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
disconnected, where you

905
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
take a weird bridge or a tunnel to get over there

906
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I mean, does it

907
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
does that hurt it at all to you?

908
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Or is it just like, oh interesting, it's just kind of different

909
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It's just interesting and worth pointing out

910
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
The caves to get in serve a practical

911
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
purpose to park ops, because

912
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
it's a backstage road

913
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
that is going over you

914
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I mean, you obviously don't see it

915
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
But yeah, the walkway to get up to

916
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
these caves is also shockingly

917
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
large, I didn't measure

918
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
it out on Google Maps or anything, but it feels as

919
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
big as Disneyland's hub

920
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It is such a far walk to go from

921
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
like Arabian coast to

922
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
the caves to enter Fantasy Springs

923
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And then as you approach

924
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
there's rockwork of

925
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Peter Pan, Anna and Elsa, and Rapunzel

926
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So those are like the three mini lands inside

927
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Fantasy Springs. That's kind of the thing

928
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
around all of Fantasy Springs, is there's rockwork

929
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
of characters from various Disney

930
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
movies. Yeah, and in the hotel

931
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
grounds, there's a whole

932
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
these rocks are all Beauty and the Beast

933
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
characters, and are some of those in the park too

934
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
It's not necessarily characters that are represented

935
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
in the land, but that you'll see

936
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I don't remember, like Cinderella

937
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Cinderella, the Maleficent Dragon

938
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
The Magic Mirror from

939
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Snow White is a hidden

940
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
it's hidden in a waterfall, and every once in a while

941
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
the face will come out. Oh, I think I did see that

942
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It's like rockwork, it's actually kind of creepy at night

943
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Yeah, oh wow

944
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Also, it's exciting that we

945
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
get a bunch more of this great

946
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
rockwork that like, for all

947
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
of the ups and downs or

948
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
complaints or disappointments of

949
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
high highs and then various

950
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
lows of recent Disney stuff

951
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
rocks have been on fire

952
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
everything rockwise

953
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
and this is that dude Zolt Hormay

954
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
again, right? This is Mr.

955
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Fake Rock, yet another

956
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
masterwork from this guy. I chatted with him

957
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
at D23, he lived in Japan for

958
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
three years working on Fantasy Springs

959
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
rockwork, him and his team, so really impressive

960
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Do we know if he's involved

961
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
in the liberty

962
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
demolition of

963
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
the Rivers of America to put up

964
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
rockwork for the new cars? Cause that

965
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
honestly ups the

966
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
anticipation for me if he's doing

967
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
cool rocks. Some new Zolt, if you're getting

968
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
some new Zolt. If it's new Zolt replacing

969
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
the Rivers, I feel like that's it. New Zolt just dropped

970
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
What's he like?

971
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Oh, he was so nice, so cool

972
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
so passionate. He was talking

973
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
to me more about just like living in Japan, he was like

974
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
yeah, and I saw Bob Dylan and they took my phone away

975
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
and he's like really cool

976
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Just random

977
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
That's cool, oh great

978
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
So, the only other thing of note at the entrance

979
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
is a vending machine because

980
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
that's a thing in Japan

981
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
and they're adding more and more of those to the park

982
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
and I just wanted to mention it because all throughout

983
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
the land there is these little

984
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
springs of water flowing through

985
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
and it adds a really nice kinetic

986
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
energy to the land. At night they

987
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
light up and it sparkles among

988
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
the rockwork, so there is a

989
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
flow of water going into this vending

990
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
machine suggesting that the water

991
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
from the springs is like filling up the water bottles

992
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Oh, that's nice

993
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
That's cute. Yeah, the water features

994
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
are really incredible

995
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
It's from the videos alone

996
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Really nice

997
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
It seems obvious, you gotta

998
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
add water because it's Disney Sea, but

999
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
they did it in a nice way

1000
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So, before

1001
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I move on to the three mini lands

1002
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
and just heap endless praise

1003
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I want

1004
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
to talk about the

1005
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
nightmare of accessing

1006
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Fantasy Springs and its rides

1007
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
This is a very American

1008
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
touch

1009
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
It is a Walt Disney World

1010
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
level of frustration

1011
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
to get into this thing

1012
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I don't know, you guys

1013
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
might be like, oh good

1014
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It sounds like a challenge to me

1015
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It's a little Puzzle Walter scale

1016
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Sounds like I can put my Sherlock hat back

1017
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
on to figure this mystery out

1018
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
to figure out how to be efficient

1019
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So, to get into Fantasy Springs you

1020
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
either need a standby pass

1021
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
for one of the lands rides

1022
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
You need a paid priority pass

1023
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
for one of the lands rides

1024
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You need a Fantasy Springs

1025
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
magic ticket

1026
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
You need to be a guest at the

1027
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Fantasy Springs Hotel

1028
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Or you need to have a mobile order

1029
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
from any of the restaurants in the lands

1030
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And all that does is get you in the land

1031
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Or you need one of the special tassels

1032
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
from the Duchess's hat

1033
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Or you need to be

1034
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
one of her tassel

1035
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
You need to be one of the Duchess's gentleman callers

1036
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
To be able to go in

1037
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
You need a handwritten letter from the Duchess

1038
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I seek this gentleman's pleasures

1039
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
this evening

1040
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
So, what is a standby pass

1041
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
you ask

1042
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
A standby pass

1043
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
is like a

1044
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
virtual queue spot for

1045
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Rise of Resistance when it had that

1046
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
or Guardians of the Galaxy or whatever

1047
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
So, you go on the app

1048
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
first thing in the morning when you get in

1049
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
You grab one of these

1050
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You could theoretically grab another

1051
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
standby pass, but they are often out

1052
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
So, here's where this becomes super frustrating

1053
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Tokyo DisneySea, since Fantasy Springs

1054
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
has opened

1055
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
has been opening one hour before

1056
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
their posted opening time

1057
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So, let's say 9 o'clock

1058
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
So, they are actually opening at 8

1059
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
But so many people line up

1060
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
because they're so passionate and there's no annual passes

1061
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So, anyone with a day ticket

1062
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
needs to make the most of their

1063
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
time at the park

1064
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
6.30 a.m., 7 a.m.

1065
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
So, I was like

1066
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
leaving my hotel at 6 a.m. every day

1067
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
to get in line, so I could get into

1068
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
the park and get one of these standby passes

1069
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
So, these run out almost immediately

1070
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
especially for Frozen

1071
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
It's been getting a little

1072
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
better lately, but it's still

1073
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
a nightmare

1074
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Is it on all three of the main rides?

1075
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Yes, so it's on

1076
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
all four of them

1077
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
The Tinkerbell thing?

1078
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
So, the priority

1079
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
access pass, that's like

1080
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
standby

1081
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
but paid

1082
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It's

1083
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
2,000 yen, so I think that's

1084
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
like 17 bucks

1085
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
but also runs out very fast

1086
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
especially for Frozen

1087
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Tinkerbell's busy buggies does not have this

1088
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
That's the only ride that has standby only

1089
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
A Fantasy Springs

1090
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Magic ticket is what you get when you buy

1091
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
one of the super expensive

1092
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Tokyo Disney Resort vacation

1093
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
packages, which is

1094
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
minimum one night

1095
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I actually did do this one night with a friend

1096
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
who was born and raised in Japan

1097
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It was $1,200

1098
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
We stayed at the cheapest hotel, which was

1099
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Toy Story Hotel

1100
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
We got our Fantasy Springs Magic ticket

1101
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
but let me tell you something

1102
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
You can ride all the rides

1103
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
unlimited in the priority access

1104
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
lane in Fantasy Springs

1105
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Guaranteed access anytime you want to the land

1106
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
We did Frozen

1107
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
nine times,

1108
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
you also get an unlimited

1109
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
drink ticket

1110
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Tokyo Disney Resort, known for all these

1111
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
great sugary drinks that change out

1112
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
seasonally, I was pounding these things down

1113
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
So any drink you can get unlimited

1114
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
except for Alcoholic

1115
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So that was great

1116
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
but it was a lot of money

1117
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And then the other two

1118
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
be a guest at Fantasy Springs Hotel

1119
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
that's self-explanatory

1120
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
So that's how you get into Fantasy Springs

1121
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
A lot of people are shut out

1122
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I would just go and observe

1123
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
people trying to get in

1124
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
and they would have like a little QR code

1125
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
like here's how you get into Fantasy Springs

1126
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Bro, it's like 2pm, long gone

1127
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Oh god, oh no

1128
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
This opened in June

1129
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
officially, even when were you there?

1130
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I was there the week after it opened

1131
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Oh well, do we anticipate this

1132
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
getting better anytime soon or is this what it is?

1133
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I've heard it's gotten slightly better

1134
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
but especially for Frozen it's still

1135
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
you need to be there at opening to grab

1136
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
a free standby pass

1137
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Would you see like anybody freak out

1138
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
or was everybody too polite to like

1139
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
scream at somebody about

1140
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
coming all this way and paying all this money?

1141
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I definitely heard tourist cursing

1142
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Okay, tourist

1143
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Tourist being like American

1144
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
The Duchess's ears

1145
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Trying to nap

1146
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
So I was in Disney Sea

1147
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
for two of the days of my vacation

1148
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
and one of the days I did it like a normal

1149
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
guest, I couldn't even get

1150
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Frozen, all I could get was Peter Pan

1151
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Even though I got there an hour and a half

1152
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
early, I still could only get Peter Pan

1153
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I was too late for Frozen

1154
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
This is disheartening to me

1155
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I know it's changed since then

1156
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
but when I was there in 2019

1157
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
after

1158
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I have the least tolerance for all this crap

1159
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
of anybody on this show

1160
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
so to go to Tokyo Disney

1161
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
either of the parks and that it is paper

1162
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
fast passes, my god

1163
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I have time traveled to the glory

1164
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
days of 2002

1165
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
things are

1166
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
normal, we function

1167
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
as a society again

1168
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
made me so happy, so I am

1169
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
disheartened here that they've given

1170
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
into the

1171
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
famous Disney bureaucracy

1172
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
They do have other

1173
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
paid priority access

1174
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
rides like Beauty and the Beast

1175
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
but then they do have their free

1176
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
digital fast pass

1177
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
system, which is

1178
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It's not on every ride

1179
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
but it's on

1180
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
good ones and you can use that

1181
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
When I was there it was a pretty busy day

1182
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
and it was easy to get

1183
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Did they still call it fast pass?

1184
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
It was very weird

1185
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I assume they're going to change this name anytime

1186
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
It was still called 40th anniversary

1187
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
access pass

1188
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
or something like that

1189
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
They found a way to make it a clunkier name

1190
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
It was very clunky

1191
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Oh, go ahead

1192
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Oh, sorry

1193
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Fantasy Springs is split up into three mini lands

1194
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I guess I'll just go through as the order you see them

1195
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
when you enter

1196
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
The first is Rapunzel's Forest

1197
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It's the smallest of the mini lands

1198
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
There is

1199
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Rapunzel's Tower

1200
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It's like a full size tower

1201
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
It's really tall

1202
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Rapunzel animatronic is in it

1203
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I'm telling you

1204
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
This stops people

1205
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
dead in their tracks

1206
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
They stare up in awe

1207
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
as she sings from her

1208
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
tower

1209
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Not even really taking pictures or doing anything

1210
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
They're just mouth agape

1211
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
staring at Rapunzel

1212
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
She looks great

1213
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It's like real hair, real animatronic

1214
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
She's not singing

1215
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
the songs directly from the movie

1216
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
She's very pleasantly

1217
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
singing them

1218
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
There's a very light melody going along with it

1219
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
It's so nice

1220
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
She's going about her day versus doing a performance

1221
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Exactly

1222
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
You're peeping

1223
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
In a good way

1224
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Peeping is a bad connotation

1225
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
You're just peeping on this young girl

1226
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Nicely peeping

1227
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Pleasantly, innocently peeping

1228
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Just a nice little peep

1229
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Then there's the

1230
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Snuggly Duckling restaurant from Tangled

1231
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
And this is

1232
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You think about things where Disney has

1233
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
recreated faithfully

1234
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
This looks straight out of the cartoon

1235
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
They just made it

1236
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
inside and out

1237
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
There's no compromises

1238
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
They changed it up a little to where it's

1239
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
post movie story

1240
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
So inside Rapunzel has made these fun murals

1241
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It's beautiful

1242
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
But everything from the movie is in there

1243
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
The stage with the piano and the fireplace

1244
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
and everything

1245
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
What food do they sell there?

1246
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
The worst hamburgers I've ever had in my life

1247
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I just landed on a Google image

1248
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
right as you said that

1249
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
This looks horrible

1250
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
There's like potato salad or something on the burger

1251
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
There's some kind of slaw

1252
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
And then a gigantic thick slice

1253
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
of bologna

1254
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
It's awful

1255
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Jason, what do you think?

1256
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Bologna and potato salad

1257
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
You hooked my attention

1258
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Are you booking a flight?

1259
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Yeah

1260
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I'm booking a flight

1261
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And I'm booking the

1262
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Toy Story Hotel to get that package

1263
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
And you're making a date

1264
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
with the duchess it seems like

1265
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I am, yeah

1266
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Just looking at the pictures

1267
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
of Snuggly Duckling

1268
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It looks amazing

1269
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
This burger also an alarmingly soft

1270
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
and alarmingly yellow

1271
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
burger

1272
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
What is up with this bun?

1273
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
This is truly

1274
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
nauseating

1275
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Is this the chicken sandwich I'm looking at?

1276
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Yeah, it's either the chicken or the shrimp

1277
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
That looks terrible

1278
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Well, show this guy

1279
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Jason, what do you think?

1280
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
What was that noise?

1281
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I couldn't tell you if it was good or bad

1282
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
That's like when the ghost host comes back

1283
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I'm hearing the Haunted Maid

1284
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Oh the French

1285
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Champagne

1286
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Bologna on the burger

1287
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
It was that startling

1288
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
That's what it was

1289
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
It's not the best

1290
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
But this person could have made this look worse

1291
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
They know what they were doing

1292
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
This looks so bad in the posed photo

1293
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I mean

1294
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
It doesn't look good

1295
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I'm just saying that this looks like

1296
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I think the worst burger of my life was

1297
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Discoveryland in Paris

1298
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So it's interesting that Disney

1299
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
has another

1300
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
entry in the worst burger in the world

1301
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
game

1302
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
You can do worst

1303
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Disney burger Final Four someday

1304
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
That's pretty good

1305
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
There are a lot to choose from

1306
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Even the not actively horrible

1307
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
just the bland unpleasant ones

1308
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
in our Tomorrowland are in the running

1309
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Has anyone had a good hamburger

1310
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
in the parks?

1311
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I'm trying to rethink

1312
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
That's a good listener question

1313
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Anywhere you can leave comments let us know

1314
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Because I'm sure there are

1315
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I don't think you can count

1316
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Guy Fieri is making something over

1317
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
at the observatory

1318
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
This is an in park burger

1319
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Well Guy your job is to be in Disneyland

1320
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
5 days of the week?

1321
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
6? 4?

1322
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
A lot of days

1323
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
But have you ever had a good hamburger

1324
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
in Disneyland proper or Disney California

1325
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
No they used to have a good one

1326
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
at the Grand Californian in the Craftsman's

1327
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Grill

1328
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
They don't have anymore

1329
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
It had pulled pork on it

1330
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
That's long gone

1331
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I don't believe I've ever had a good burger

1332
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Is it truly

1333
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
a barren genre

1334
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
in all of Magic Kingdom type parks?

1335
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Jason what do you think?

1336
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I can't remember

1337
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Growing up my parents

1338
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
dreaded

1339
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
a quick service food

1340
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
at Disney World

1341
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
But he loves that sunny eclipse

1342
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
That's got a toppings bar

1343
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Is the toppings bar still there?

1344
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I'm not sure I heard that Jason

1345
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I think the toppings bar came back

1346
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Finally

1347
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
We're going to have to double check on that

1348
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
We don't want to spread misinformation

1349
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
But do you almost put the toppings

1350
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
in another category

1351
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Separately we have a toppings bar

1352
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I think you are using the toppings

1353
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
to hide the burger

1354
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
You're not so

1355
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
cosmic ray poisoned

1356
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
that you think the burger is good

1357
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I think what's happening is that every time you add

1358
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
another piece of that iceberg lettuce

1359
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
you're thinking ka-ching ka-ching

1360
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I'm saving money or I'm getting a value

1361
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
here

1362
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Another two cents

1363
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And the garbage bag

1364
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
have snacks for back at the room

1365
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
A garbage bag full of free lettuce

1366
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Free lettuce?

1367
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Free lettuce and wet

1368
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
caramelized onions

1369
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Jason checks a bag on his plane full of lettuce

1370
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Wait I found

1371
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
a possibilities

1372
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I don't know if you can speak to any of these guys

1373
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I haven't had any of these

1374
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Sci-fi dine in at Disney's Hollywood Studios

1375
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
or Space 2020

1376
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Those are more

1377
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
a sit down situation

1378
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I think it's got to count

1379
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Sci-fi dine in I think

1380
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I heard the chef

1381
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
from the one burger restaurant

1382
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
at Disney Springs

1383
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Deluxe

1384
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I think he moved over to Sci-fi dine in

1385
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
after that restaurant

1386
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
There's a Kobe beef

1387
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
at Yak and Yeti

1388
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
That's third party

1389
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
that could be good

1390
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I'm sure it is good

1391
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I guess by my previous definition

1392
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
it counts but of course that's going to be

1393
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
better than the tomorrow

1394
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
It's probably like $28 too

1395
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Maybe that's what you put a price on

1396
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Can you get a good burger at a Disney park for under $15?

1397
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
The answer is

1398
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
probably no

1399
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Moving on to Peter Pan's Neverland

1400
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
What about

1401
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Rapunzel ride?

1402
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Sorry

1403
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Rapunzel's Lantern Festival

1404
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
It's a boat ride that goes

1405
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
outside

1406
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It's one of the few

1407
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Tokyo Disneyland, Tokyo Disney

1408
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
rides that actually goes outside

1409
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I've seen videos now of

1410
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
it getting dumped on with rain

1411
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
You think splash mountains

1412
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
outside, big ponders outside, but those

1413
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
move fast

1414
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
This is a very slow moving boat ride

1415
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I'm wondering how that's going to go long term

1416
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
You start off

1417
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
in a boat builder's hut

1418
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
You see boats in various stages

1419
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
of being assembled

1420
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
and then the lanterns being

1421
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
assembled for the lantern festival

1422
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
It's very pleasant and nice

1423
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
You start off

1424
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
You're gently floating past

1425
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Rapunzel's tower

1426
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
She's singing in it, it's so nice

1427
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And then you see Flynn

1428
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
and the horse, which I can't remember his name

1429
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Maximus

1430
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
They're kind of peeking

1431
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
behind a rock and looking at her

1432
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
and looking kind of worried

1433
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
It's a very cool start to the ride

1434
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Then you float through

1435
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Rapunzel's free from the tower

1436
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Animatronic Rapunzel swinging around a tree

1437
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
and Flynn is looking all smug

1438
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Looks great

1439
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Then the next scene is

1440
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Rapunzel's glowing hair, which looks

1441
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
fantastic

1442
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
They nailed this

1443
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Then you go into

1444
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
one of the best scenes

1445
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
in the entire land, it's the actual

1446
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
lantern festival

1447
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
You're circling around the boat

1448
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
It's kind of like the kiss the girl scene

1449
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
The lantern festival ride

1450
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
The lanterns are everywhere

1451
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
They're in your entire peripheral vision

1452
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
It's so nice

1453
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
It seems like a giant room

1454
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
It appears as such

1455
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
It's really big

1456
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Then you go past a couple of the people

1457
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
from the Snuggly Duckling and the ride just ends

1458
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
It just abruptly ends

1459
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
No mother

1460
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Gothel

1461
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
No explanation, it's just a couple of paintings

1462
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
explaining the rest of the story

1463
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
They don't feel the need to fully close out

1464
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
the full Rapunzel tale

1465
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
The ride is a little short

1466
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
but what is there is pretty good

1467
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
It seems, dare I say

1468
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
that parts of this ride

1469
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
look a little bit romantic

1470
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
That lantern room

1471
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
feels very calming

1472
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I wanted to smooch someone

1473
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
very badly on this ride

1474
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
You didn't just start asking around

1475
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
The language barrier

1476
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
That would be weird

1477
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Do you think most romantic

1478
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Disney ride

1479
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
would you say that

1480
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
or do you have a different one

1481
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Do you consider

1482
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
the Bayou part of

1483
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Pirates of the Caribbean romantic

1484
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Jason does I think

1485
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
It's in competition

1486
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
with that I would say

1487
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Okay

1488
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
The Disneyland version

1489
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I'm saying

1490
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I would throw Mexico

1491
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
into the discussion

1492
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
It's obviously

1493
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Blue Bayou opening of Pirates

1494
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
is a superior area

1495
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
but there's a similar dim vibe

1496
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
and those Joe Rodi paintings are very nice

1497
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
and also

1498
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
there's no creeps

1499
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
there's no creeps on a porch

1500
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
which again I think might add to Jason's

1501
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
affection for it

1502
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Jason wants creeps

1503
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
He's just at his house

1504
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
He's just trying to sit on the porch

1505
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
He's looking at June bugs

1506
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
He's not looking at you

1507
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
He's concerned about

1508
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
How's the frog ecosystem around these parts

1509
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Last year when we talked about

1510
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
the grave where I was feeling like

1511
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
the Haunted Mansion tipping you backwards

1512
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
was somewhat romantic

1513
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
That's the only ride that tips you

1514
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I always want to stop there

1515
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
and just take a little break

1516
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Yeah because you can take a nap

1517
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Sometimes you do stop there

1518
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
That's real nice

1519
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I really want to go on this Tangle Ride to see

1520
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
how it stacks up

1521
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Of course if you're opening up to all rides

1522
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
most romantic moment

1523
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
is Optimus Prime

1524
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Even if it's not a romantic love you feel for him

1525
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
It's love

1526
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
It's pure love

1527
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Optimus love

1528
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I don't think that's been said fully

1529
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I think that's a subtext of what you're feeling too

1530
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
He's proud and you wouldn't be so proud if he didn't love you

1531
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Do you think Optimus Prime

1532
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
in the ride has kissable lips?

1533
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Answer the question

1534
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Well I want to answer it correctly

1535
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I don't want to say something flippantly

1536
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
And then he hears this

1537
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
and he's like what I don't have kissable lips

1538
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I love you

1539
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
His lips really get right in your face

1540
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
They really do yeah

1541
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I think that here's the thing

1542
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
and I don't want to offend him

1543
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Obviously they're not human lips so they're going to be

1544
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
metallic and I assume

1545
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
though here's the good thing

1546
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
because he's just been fighting they're very warm

1547
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
because the machine has been heated up

1548
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
So at least when you kiss the metal

1549
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
it's warm

1550
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Hot iron

1551
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Would you rather kiss than cold iron?

1552
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Unless it's scalding

1553
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Unless his lips are scalding

1554
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
That's a big fight

1555
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
That would indicate though that he was created

1556
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
in a bad way that he would

1557
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
overheat

1558
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I think he has just the right amount of heat

1559
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
It doesn't seem like he's got steam coming out of his ears

1560
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
So I think it's a nice

1561
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
80 degree sort of heat

1562
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
75 degree

1563
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Warm enough to let him know he's alive

1564
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
So that would be a nice aspect

1565
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
But obviously I'm a human being

1566
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I like kissing

1567
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
organic lips

1568
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
skin lips

1569
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
My preference is skin lips not metal lips

1570
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
But

1571
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I might also be careful to dance around

1572
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
the distinct possibility that he kisses all of his

1573
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
toys at night

1574
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I have a couple of metal toys

1575
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
But most of them are plastic

1576
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
The movie accurate

1577
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Ninja Turtle toys

1578
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
They are so beautiful

1579
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
We're getting closer to skin lips with those

1580
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Honestly

1581
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I'm not just saying this because we were

1582
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
involved with the official entity

1583
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
If I had to kiss a toy

1584
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
those straight sharks are up there

1585
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Because of that real feel

1586
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Real feel and the mouth is so big

1587
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Even on a 6 inch toy

1588
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
It's almost the size of a human mouth

1589
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
That's what I'm saying

1590
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I'd watch out for those teeth obviously

1591
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
But I think I could stay fully on the outside

1592
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
You would get a lot of teeth

1593
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
when you kissed

1594
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
But sometimes people like that

1595
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I think there's a way to do it without getting any teeth

1596
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
If the requirement is kiss

1597
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I'm not giving any tongue to ripster

1598
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Mattel still listening

1599
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I just bought a toy

1600
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
From the Ninja Turtle line

1601
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
It's called Belly Bomb

1602
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
He's got his big mouth in his stomach

1603
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
He's got so many teeth

1604
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
He's got a tongue though as well

1605
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
He would be good to kiss

1606
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
But it would be scary

1607
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I just showed Jason a picture

1608
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
This is maybe the greatest toy I have ever gotten

1609
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
It's a beautiful toy

1610
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Jason I saw it already

1611
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
You can move his eyeball

1612
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
He does look like he's a little bit

1613
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Aroused in this photo

1614
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
He does

1615
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
There's a part of the room

1616
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Where a character starts getting a blowjob

1617
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
And his eyes kind of roll back

1618
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
It's very much like

1619
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Mike in the room

1620
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I spent a lot of time last night

1621
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Maybe 20 minutes

1622
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Taking different photos of him

1623
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
To see which different moods I could put him in

1624
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
This was before this conversation

1625
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
You were taking last night

1626
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Before this even came up

1627
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Remember the photos

1628
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Of Belly Bomb

1629
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
9.30pm

1630
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I sent these to multiple people I know

1631
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Some of these photos

1632
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
What was an example of what you would say

1633
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
About Belly Bomb

1634
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
In your angle

1635
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
This is a different photo I took of him

1636
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Where he looks scared

1637
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
He's got a gun in one

1638
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
But he has eyeballs on his hands

1639
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Like the Pan's Labyrinth character

1640
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
You would kiss his little eyeball hands

1641
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
If he touched your face

1642
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
A squishy eyeball would go up against it

1643
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
That would be interesting if it wasn't done

1644
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
With any sexual intention

1645
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I wouldn't mind just feeling it

1646
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
But this has got to be a friendly path

1647
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Not seductive

1648
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I'm looking at my serious toy collector

1649
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Group text chain

1650
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
That's kind of a joke

1651
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
That's a jokey title

1652
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I wrote having the eye move

1653
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Gives you so many options

1654
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
And then I sent a couple photos

1655
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Sent it to my friend Luke

1656
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And he just wrote very expressive

1657
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Do you think this is expressive?

1658
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Very expressive

1659
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
He's also Belly Bomb kind of phallic

1660
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Let's be honest

1661
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
He's skin colored

1662
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
One eyeball is kind of on the end of a penis

1663
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Sort of shape

1664
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
But it is maybe the greatest toy

1665
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I ever have

1666
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I also messaged the sculptor of said toy

1667
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Last night

1668
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
He did a great job

1669
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
P.S. Any tips if I were to kiss him?

1670
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
He didn't offer that up

1671
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
He ignored that part of the question

1672
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
What's the next area guy?

1673
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I was going to say

1674
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I also want to move on

1675
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
But I would love if by the end of the episode

1676
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Jason Ort

1677
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Optional guy if you want to name a toy

1678
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
That you would like to kiss

1679
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Everybody think about it

1680
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
That would look like a pressure on our guest

1681
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
So I'm saying optional

1682
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Through the port

1683
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I would love if at the very end

1684
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I could throw to you and you could say a toy

1685
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I already have my answer

1686
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
We'll cover it at the end

1687
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
But for now we'll get back on track

1688
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Peter Pan's Neverland

1689
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
They really did a great job

1690
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
With this land

1691
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
One side you see

1692
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Skull Rock and Captain Hook's ship

1693
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Sitting in a little harbor

1694
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
It looks great

1695
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
It's that thing Disney does really well

1696
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Where it's a little fantastical

1697
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
But also based in reality

1698
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Sure

1699
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
The transitioning to a real 3D environment

1700
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
They really blended that well

1701
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
You can go in Skull Rock and get pictures inside the skull

1702
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
And then there's a little

1703
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Pirate ship in Skull Rock

1704
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Disappeared from Disneyland forever ago

1705
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
And that's the thing my mom pines for

1706
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
She loved it there

1707
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
It came back in Paris

1708
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
And now to have a committed

1709
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Paris is so good

1710
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
And then there's a little cavern

1711
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
With a little treasure chest and waterfall

1712
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
And on Captain Hook's ship

1713
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
There's a little photo op

1714
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
With his hook so you can put your hand in there

1715
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
It's really fun

1716
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
And then on the other side is the actual mountains

1717
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Or I guess volcanoes

1718
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
From the movie that they fly around

1719
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
With a nice pretty fake cloud

1720
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Around them

1721
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
The volcanoes puff out smoke

1722
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
At night again looks really good

1723
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
More volcanoes in this park

1724
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
It's interesting

1725
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
It's like a little other range

1726
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
It sounds cool

1727
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
You can't really see them both at the same time

1728
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I guess I wish you could

1729
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
This was one of those things too

1730
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Visiting Tokyo Disneyland and Sea

1731
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Every year

1732
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Just watching the progress over the last 6 years

1733
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
And that was one of the things you could actually see

1734
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Was those volcanoes

1735
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
And I remember when the scaffolding came down 5 years ago

1736
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I was like oh that's going to be so sick

1737
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
So the main ride

1738
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
The main ride here

1739
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Is Peter Pan's Neverland Adventure

1740
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I'm going to say something

1741
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
So controversial in this room

1742
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
That I debated my entire drive up here

1743
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
If I'm going to say it

1744
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
It's coming out

1745
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
This is a Transformers slash Amazing Spiderman

1746
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Style ride

1747
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I think it is the best one of those kind of rides

1748
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
It's better than these

1749
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Wow

1750
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Crazy

1751
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
It is just so fun and nice

1752
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
And you're flying along

1753
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
With Peter and the gang

1754
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
And battling pirates on their ship

1755
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
And some dude falls in the water

1756
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And he's doing all the poses from the movie

1757
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
And then he takes you and you fly above London

1758
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Above the clouds and lands on the clock

1759
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
It is just so pleasant

1760
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
It's mixed with a ton of

1761
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Really well done physical sets

1762
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
And little things happen in the physical sets

1763
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
That sync up with the movies

1764
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
It's like a really nice mixed media

1765
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Kind of thing

1766
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
3D right

1767
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
The queue

1768
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
You go past their tree

1769
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
That they live in I guess

1770
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I'm not really super familiar with Peter Pan

1771
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I try not to be

1772
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
This is another thing

1773
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
They renamed the lost boys

1774
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
To the lost kids

1775
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I caught that

1776
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Are there female characters

1777
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Or is that just a

1778
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I think there always have been

1779
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I'm actually not 100% sure

1780
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
The guests were

1781
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Members of the lost kids

1782
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
So they wanted to include

1783
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Everyone

1784
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
That's a good interpretation

1785
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
The queue

1786
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
You're in this forest and you see their tree

1787
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
And then you go into their clubhouse

1788
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
And it looks very hand built

1789
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
It's like uneven planks of wood

1790
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Stuff from sunken ships

1791
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
It's so nice

1792
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
And the boat

1793
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
That you ride in on the ride

1794
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Also looks very hand made

1795
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
You know what

1796
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I haven't seen the vehicle until this morning

1797
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Because I was curious

1798
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Because it's not trackless

1799
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
It's more like the rides

1800
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
You're comparing it to

1801
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Which gives it that tighter control

1802
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Probably a little more thrilling

1803
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
It has the

1804
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
High walls so you can't really see

1805
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Outside of the ship

1806
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Sort of directs your vision

1807
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Closes it all in

1808
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Did you feel like there was any difference

1809
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Did you feel like it could do something different

1810
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Than the Transformers Spider-Man ride vehicle

1811
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Or was it pretty much

1812
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I think it was pretty similar

1813
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
It's funny that they've gotten into this genre

1814
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
That they've landed

1815
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
And all these trackless rides

1816
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Now they've landed at what Universal was doing

1817
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
25 years ago

1818
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Can I go back real quick

1819
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
What was the boat

1820
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Was it a Wi-Fi control boat

1821
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Does it turn you or is it just sort of a normal

1822
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Boat in a trough

1823
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Very pleasantly floating you through

1824
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Just another one of those

1825
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
High capacity things

1826
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Pump 2,000 people an hour through there

1827
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I love that they're into boats right now

1828
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I love that we're getting a lot of boats going on

1829
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
No reason to ignore the boat genre

1830
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
So

1831
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Something else about this Peter Pan ride

1832
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Just a weird anomaly when I wrote it

1833
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I was mentioning the standby pass

1834
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
So there's no regular

1835
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Lines on these rides

1836
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Standby pass or you need the access pass

1837
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
So it leads to the situation

1838
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Where they have

1839
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Stopped

1840
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Giving out the standby passes

1841
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
And everything is sold out

1842
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
And so I went to this

1843
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
My return time was like

1844
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
3.30 in the afternoon and I'm going through the queue

1845
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
And there's like nobody in the queue with me

1846
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
And then I'm getting on the ride

1847
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
And it's just me

1848
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
And I have an entire boat to myself

1849
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I have a picture of this on Twitter that I posted

1850
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
And I went

1851
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I'm completely alone because

1852
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
They were still adjusting

1853
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
When they're going to distribute more standby passes

1854
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Because you really have to be on the app

1855
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Refreshing all day

1856
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
And I've heard people really do that

1857
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
As they're walking around everything

1858
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
They're just pulling down to refresh all day

1859
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Sounds good to me

1860
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I know some people like that

1861
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Were in the room with a person like that

1862
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
So yeah that was

1863
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Just an interesting thing that happened to me on there

1864
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Can I bring up this discussion of

1865
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Your assertion

1866
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
It's better than Spider-Man or Transformers

1867
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I think I buy it

1868
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Because I buy that Disney using that technology

1869
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Today would be really

1870
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Strong

1871
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
I feel like what you're up against in this room

1872
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
With that argument is Jason's undying love

1873
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Of Spider-Man, Mike's undying love

1874
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Of the kissable hot metal lips

1875
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Of Optimus Prime

1876
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
And my undying hatred

1877
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Of Peter Pan as a genre

1878
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
And character

1879
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
So all three of us are furious

1880
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
That's why this was so hard

1881
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
But logically

1882
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
It makes total sense

1883
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
To me

1884
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Does it get you excited for

1885
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
If indeed this Avengers

1886
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Infinity defense

1887
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Is going to be in this genre

1888
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Do you think that ends up in the discussion

1889
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Of best one of these attractions

1890
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I'm not a Marvel fan at all

1891
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I've never seen any of these movies

1892
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I'm sure it will be totally fine

1893
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
And people who enjoy that sort of thing

1894
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Will love it

1895
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
You might be a little lost

1896
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
There isn't the emotional pull

1897
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Does the Peter Pan ride fuck you up

1898
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Like Transformers

1899
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
It's like a loving mother

1900
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Cradling you

1901
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I like it for Pan

1902
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
But for that Marvel ride

1903
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I want to get fucked up

1904
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I want to get jostled

1905
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Hardcore

1906
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I don't think that's what they do

1907
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Even an edgier

1908
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
More adult Disney ride

1909
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I just don't think that's their deal

1910
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I mean Matterhorn does

1911
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
But that's kind of accidental

1912
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Unless they want to push massages

1913
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
At the spa in Grand California

1914
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
They can give out cards

1915
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
And really fuck you up

1916
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Is that an experience you've ever done

1917
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
A massage

1918
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
No, my girlfriend has

1919
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
That's something we should review

1920
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
In these days

1921
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
It starts with a T

1922
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Tenya?

1923
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
We've never reviewed the spa

1924
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I was going to guess the name of a Mexican restaurant

1925
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
In my area

1926
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
We could each get a different service

1927
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Like one of us gets a facial

1928
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
One of us gets a massage

1929
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
And one of us gets a pedicure

1930
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Sure

1931
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It'll be like $1500

1932
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Each

1933
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Each $1500

1934
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Guy, let me ask

1935
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
This Peter Pan ride

1936
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Since there's so much footage

1937
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
How did you feel about

1938
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
The CG

1939
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Footage compared to

1940
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Because this is a 2D

1941
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Traditional animated film

1942
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Yeah, I think they did

1943
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
A really good job

1944
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Especially with the faces

1945
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
It's just very

1946
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Colorful

1947
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
But then they also gave it

1948
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
A nice little texture

1949
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
That almost makes it look

1950
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Paper-y

1951
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I watched a panel about this at D23

1952
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
And they showed all the 3D models

1953
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
And they would rotate them

1954
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Does it look like

1955
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
What was the Zelda

1956
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Is Wind Waker the one that has paper

1957
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Cell shaded

1958
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Not as cartoony as that

1959
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
It's a little more muted

1960
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
But it looks great

1961
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I've heard a lot of people say

1962
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
It's a kind of hidden gem of

1963
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Fantasy Springs

1964
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Yeah, really enjoyed that one

1965
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Next

1966
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
To the Peter Pan ride

1967
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Is Lookout Cookout

1968
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
This is just a quick service restaurant

1969
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
That also follows the same theme

1970
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
That looks like it's built by the lost kids

1971
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
The handmade thing

1972
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Just really fun inside

1973
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
I didn't eat here because all they had was

1974
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Baskets of fried

1975
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Shrimp and chicken and stuff

1976
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
It's better than the burger though maybe

1977
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I did get twice

1978
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I got the drink that they have there

1979
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Because I think it's called Peter Pan's

1980
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Fizzy drink

1981
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
And it's the same color as Peter Pan

1982
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
It's green

1983
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
And you drop a little thing in it

1984
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
And it just starts fizzing all over the place

1985
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
And it's delicious

1986
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Which is much needed

1987
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Because the next thing I'm about to talk about

1988
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
In the Peter Pan land

1989
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Is the popcorn cart

1990
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Okay

1991
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Now, the flavor of this popcorn

1992
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Cart, if you're not aware

1993
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
All around the Tokyo

1994
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Disney Resort parks

1995
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
They have flavored popcorn, each one has a different flavor

1996
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Some of which are excellent

1997
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Fantastic

1998
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I dream of the honey

1999
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Popcorn

2000
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Wait, is it by Winnie the Pooh?

2001
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
And the area smells like honey

2002
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
The flavor here

2003
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Is roast beef

2004
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
What?

2005
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I heard about this

2006
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I'm trying not to be hyperbolic here

2007
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
This is

2008
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
One of the worst things

2009
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I've ever put in my mouth

2010
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
It tastes like

2011
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Room temperature marinade

2012
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
That's been left open

2013
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Overnight

2014
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
And then after you chew and swallow

2015
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
It leaves the worst

2016
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Awful, mucky aftertaste

2017
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I've ever experienced in my life

2018
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Gosh

2019
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
It's revolting

2020
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
It's not like

2021
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Oh, blue milk and green milk is so bad

2022
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Let's take a sip and then

2023
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
It is truly awful

2024
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Is the idea

2025
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Also that

2026
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I don't know

2027
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
You hear roast beef and you think of Arby's

2028
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
But then I read a description

2029
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Aromas of roasted meat and gravy

2030
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
They're almost going for more of that

2031
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Old English

2032
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
It establishes neither

2033
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
It's neither English comfort food

2034
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Or Arby's

2035
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
When you post almost anything on Twitter

2036
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
You'll get one or two people in

2037
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Like, fuck you

2038
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
But this one is universally

2039
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
People agreeing with me

2040
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
That's a nightmare

2041
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I actually felt really bad

2042
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Because it's not polite to waste food

2043
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
In Japan

2044
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
And my friend who I was with

2045
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Born and raised in that country

2046
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I can't eat anymore of this

2047
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
And I just saw his face

2048
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
He also hated it

2049
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
And he forced himself to eat the entire thing

2050
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Oh no

2051
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I felt so bad

2052
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Because now that you weren't sharing it

2053
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
He had to have more

2054
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
You were splitting it

2055
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Over the course of six pained hours

2056
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Brutal

2057
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
All right, Mike

2058
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Don't go there and order this

2059
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Unless you want to force feeding

2060
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Because I know it's what you'll do

2061
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Or I will in shame

2062
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Go into a bathroom stall

2063
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
And shove it in my pants

2064
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Or in a different bag

2065
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
And then throw the bag away

2066
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
There'll be some antics for me trying to get rid of it

2067
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Bring it back to America

2068
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
And then you get held up at the airport

2069
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
It's a souvenir for bringing popcorn back

2070
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
To my family I love at home

2071
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
It's like that scene in Dumb and Dumber

2072
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
With Harland Williams

2073
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
With a P

2074
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
They taste it at customs

2075
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
And they're so disgusted

2076
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
They're like just get out of here

2077
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
That reminds me

2078
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
For the last

2079
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I guess eight or ten months

2080
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I've gotten this Tokyo treat

2081
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Mail order box

2082
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
So every month you get a new box

2083
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Of snacks from Japan

2084
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
And 90% of the time

2085
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
It's so fun

2086
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
It's so great

2087
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
There's so many interesting snacks

2088
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Where it's like oh we don't make

2089
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Chips or candy like this

2090
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
We don't have this flavor profile

2091
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
In America every now and then

2092
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
There is one or two snacks

2093
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Where you're like oh I don't

2094
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I can't do this

2095
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Sometimes they're insane

2096
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Over there I remember one time

2097
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
This happened within

2098
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
An hour of each other

2099
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
With some friends

2100
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
My friend puts his money in the vending machine

2101
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
And he's thinking I just really need coffee right now

2102
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Just sees something that looks like coffee

2103
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Hits the button, cracks it open

2104
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Takes a swig, it's corn chowder

2105
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
It's corn chowder

2106
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
With actual corn

2107
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And then me, like not even an hour later

2108
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I'm so thirsty, it's hot

2109
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Okay water, this looks good

2110
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Drink it, take a swig

2111
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Scream in horror

2112
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
It's salty seaweed water

2113
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Oh my god

2114
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
It's just nothing I ever want to consume

2115
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Especially on a hot day

2116
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
So if you knew what you were getting

2117
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Maybe not that

2118
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
You're not going to order seaweed water

2119
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
But if I knew I was getting corn chowder

2120
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Then I'd do, but that disconnect from coffee

2121
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
That is so

2122
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Reviled by that switch out

2123
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
So the other ride in Peter Pan's Neverland

2124
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
This is a pretty big mini

2125
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Land in the land obviously

2126
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
So it's Fairy Tinkerbell's

2127
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Busy Buggies

2128
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
This name I've complained of

2129
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Fairy Tinkerbell

2130
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Why do they do this?

2131
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Why do they explain it?

2132
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I like this clunky name

2133
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I will say I like saying it a lot

2134
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Versus all their clunky names

2135
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
It'll be a good warm up for us to do

2136
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Before we start talking for two hours

2137
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Do it faster, Fairy Tinkerbell's Busy Buggies

2138
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
And then you really get your enunciation down

2139
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
So yeah

2140
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
This is just a cute little

2141
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Kids ride, nothing more

2142
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
What does it do?

2143
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
It's a dark ride

2144
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
But it's outside

2145
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
So a cute thing about it

2146
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Is the cast members working this ride

2147
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Have little fairy wings on the back of their outfits

2148
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
That's cute

2149
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
The aesthetic really is

2150
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Like a little

2151
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
More detailed

2152
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Bugs land

2153
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
So it's the thing Disney

2154
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Loves to do where it's like you're small

2155
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Now

2156
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Slades of grass and a big thimble

2157
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Rides like that

2158
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
So

2159
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
The ride starts out

2160
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
And I don't want to be crude here

2161
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
But I don't know any other way to say this

2162
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
They show you a video

2163
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Of Tinkerbell explaining the story

2164
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
They gave her

2165
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
An absolute dump truck ass

2166
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Okay?

2167
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
She is

2168
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I loved her

2169
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
She is caked up

2170
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
And I was saving this

2171
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Because I also did it in the Peter Pan ride

2172
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Because she's also in there obviously

2173
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Now can I ask this

2174
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Did you go back to the original film

2175
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
And just double check that this wasn't the original

2176
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
The proportions from the original

2177
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
You know I didn't compare them side by side

2178
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
But I feel like I see enough Tinkerbell

2179
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Gifts and that sort

2180
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
To where I don't remember her being that

2181
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Thick

2182
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Now let me ask you this, are you the first one to bring this

2183
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Because recently, I mean there's obviously from the film

2184
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
In Incredibles, there's a discussion

2185
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Of Mrs. Incredible

2186
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
And there's the character in the park and stuff

2187
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Are you maybe the one breaking this news

2188
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
To America

2189
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
In the states

2190
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Have you seen the discourse online

2191
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
I've brought this up to other friends and I've showed them pictures

2192
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
And everyone agrees so far

2193
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
So take a look

2194
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
At the pictures

2195
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
It's in my review that I posted on touring plans if you want to look that up

2196
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
I didn't mention a dump truck ass on touring plans

2197
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
This is podcast the ride though

2198
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
This is the place to do it

2199
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
It is where we tend to fuse

2200
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Theme park conversation and

2201
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Oddly sexually charged

2202
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
For people who claim to be

2203
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
PG rated in every episode

2204
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Banned kids sex energy

2205
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
This podcast the ride

2206
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Sadly

2207
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I'm the only banned kid of the three of us

2208
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
But that is what it is

2209
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
So yeah, you go through this ride

2210
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Where it's just various environments

2211
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Like a snow thing and the idea

2212
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Is your Tinkerbell's friends

2213
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Delivering packages to her various friends

2214
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
In the thing

2215
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
It ends with a mouse

2216
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Named cheese

2217
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Which is

2218
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Is it a new character

2219
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
It's a new character that

2220
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I don't know if they're trying to catch

2221
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Him on as like a new thing

2222
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
But there's no merchandise or anything

2223
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
And I don't really see many people talking

2224
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
So I think it's just a thing

2225
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Okay, mouse named cheese

2226
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Okay, so new characters are Duchess and cheese

2227
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Yeah, and cheese is

2228
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Cute enough and you know

2229
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
It's a big mouse and he moves around and he blinks

2230
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
And you're like, okay, cheese, okay, get off the ride

2231
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Probably don't need to do this ever again

2232
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Would you like a plush of

2233
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Cheese? Is he cuter than Gus

2234
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
From Cinderella? No

2235
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
And he's nowhere, he's not in the same ballpark

2236
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
As Shandu. I was about to say

2237
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
So Shandu, did you go into

2238
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Sinbad though? It's closed for refurbishment

2239
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Until September. I think it's been closed since

2240
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
March or February or something. This is a long

2241
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Refurbishment. Oh yeah, my friend

2242
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Roger was there early in the year and it was one of my

2243
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
First questions and he said, no, long refurbishment

2244
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Damn

2245
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
So

2246
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Not to backtrack Gus, I'm looking

2247
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
At photos of Tinkerbell in

2248
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
All guises and I think maybe

2249
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Tinkerbell is always quietly

2250
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Ahead of dump truck Gus

2251
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I think it's not, what you're

2252
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Saying is not, just if you do the general

2253
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Image, it might

2254
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Also be an effect of what she is wearing

2255
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Which there is, you know, it's sort of

2256
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Like a, almost like

2257
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
It's leaves a little bit

2258
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Which fan out, that might be

2259
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Providing that effect, I don't know

2260
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I don't know, if you're looking

2261
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
At it when I'm looking at it

2262
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
It seems a little consistent

2263
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Throughout all of generations but maybe it's especially

2264
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Played up. Well it's also, it was in 3D

2265
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Well this one was in 3D

2266
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Oh this was on the big easy buggy, sorry, sorry

2267
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
It's a 3D model on a screen

2268
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Before the ride leaves is what it looks like

2269
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Okay, okay

2270
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Well we're going to have to investigate this more

2271
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I guess, so we'll have to

2272
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Bring in experts or something

2273
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
All of a sudden I'm feeling like the Peter Pan

2274
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Franchise isn't as bad as I've been saying

2275
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Oh no, oh no, I've not been giving

2276
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
This franchise enough credit

2277
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I'm off to Neverland

2278
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
I hope your listeners don't get

2279
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Too horny listening to us talk about

2280
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Asses and kissing

2281
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Oh well there's no more

2282
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Men that are

2283
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Roused at the audience than these men

2284
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
That is absolutely

2285
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Their talk, theater of the mind

2286
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Belly bomb

2287
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Kissing men

2288
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Who play with their toys

2289
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
I wonder what this episode just had

2290
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
When they were talking about belly bomb

2291
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
It was before they even got to the dump truck

2292
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
This is, yeah, this is basically

2293
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
An erotic podcast at this point

2294
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I love that belly bomb talk

2295
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Okay we're done with Peter Pan's Neverland

2296
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
On to Frozen Kingdom

2297
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Oh it's called Frozen Kingdom

2298
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
This is

2299
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Is that what the Jurassic Park was called?

2300
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
No, Frozen Empire

2301
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Is Ghostbusters

2302
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
And Fallen Kingdom is Jurassic Park

2303
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

2304
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Frozen Empire

2305
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Frozen Empire

2306
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Fallen Kingdom

2307
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
When's that ride coming?

2308
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I want to go to the Frozen Empire

2309
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
House of Tornites

2310
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
In Florida

2311
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Here? Both

2312
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Do you think they'll do a house

2313
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Because if they're working with Reitman

2314
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Are they going to do a house of like

2315
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
The horrors of being trapped in Studio 8H

2316
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
And you've got your first ever live broadcast

2317
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
And it has to go on at 11.30

2318
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Not because it's ready

2319
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Well the 10 Nightmares of Jimmy Fallon

2320
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Jimmy Fallon Maze

2321
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Jimmy Fallon in Rockefeller Center

2322
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
It's called Jimmy Fallon's

2323
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
To Nightmares

2324
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Do you saw this guy? No

2325
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
There's a legit horror nights maze

2326
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
In Rockefeller Center that's

2327
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
That's themed to Jimmy Fallon's Nightmares

2328
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Wow, okay

2329
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Sounds great

2330
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Oh god, oh no, I gotta talk about

2331
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Apes with Paris Hilton

2332
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Oh god

2333
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I woke up and it's still happening

2334
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Not cool dude

2335
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I gotta do this interview with this puppet band called The Weirdos

2336
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Chris Martin and Coldplay

2337
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Have a puppet band

2338
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
And the audience is going to be so befuddled

2339
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Even I can't convince the audience

2340
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
That this is so good

2341
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
I texted my girlfriend after you mentioned The Weirdos

2342
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Because she's into that kind of music

2343
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
And I'm like, did you know about this?

2344
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
And she was just like, okay

2345
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
That's what our audience said too

2346
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
That's a lot of the responses

2347
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
I'm gonna clean this to my significant other

2348
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
And they wrote back, okay

2349
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Okay, Frozen Kingdom

2350
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
So it's very pretty

2351
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
It's a port with a little

2352
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
With some boats in the water

2353
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
And a bridge leading over into the little town

2354
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
The Arendelle Castle

2355
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
It's all very pretty

2356
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
The restaurant inside the castle

2357
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Is Royal Banquet

2358
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Banquet of Arendelle

2359
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
It looks like

2360
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Inside the castle, like they're preparing

2361
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
For the coronation

2362
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
They have some of the best

2363
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Fake food and fake desserts

2364
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
And fake cheese that I've ever seen

2365
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Like kind of off in the corner with a bunch of plates

2366
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Because I think they mentioned like 10,000 dinner plates

2367
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
They have all the stacks of plates too

2368
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
It looks awesome

2369
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Can I just say, you brought up a Final Four idea

2370
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
I've

2371
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Audience, what do you think of

2372
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
The possibility of the fake food

2373
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
This one's occurred to me

2374
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
It's a great alliteration that I like

2375
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I just haven't had like a ton of ideas of what those are

2376
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
But if you have suggestions

2377
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
If you think that's a good idea

2378
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Because it sounds like this is out of the gate of viable

2379
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
The queue of

2380
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Runaway Railway out here

2381
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Has some pretty good fake treats

2382
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
And they are selling

2383
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
The power limes

2384
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
But there are other things

2385
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
There's like Darkwing Duck

2386
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Like, I don't even know what they call them

2387
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
But they're like peanut butter, they're fake Darkwing Duck peanut butter cups

2388
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
That I want for real

2389
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
That are so enticing to me

2390
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Package wise and the way they look

2391
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
And the popcorn kernels look like Mickey Mouse

2392
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Inside the popcorn machine in that queue

2393
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
So that's definitely on the list

2394
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Some of those things are on the list

2395
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Do you like the idea or do you have suggestions

2396
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
That might help us

2397
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Not give you too many assignments

2398
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Mainly think about what toys you want to kiss

2399
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
But anyway

2400
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
That's important

2401
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
This restaurant instantly became

2402
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Probably my favorite food in the entire park

2403
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Besides Casbah Food Court

2404
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I think that's still my favorite

2405
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
I got this like seafood stew

2406
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Pot pie thing

2407
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
That was delicious

2408
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Tokyo Disney does seafood so well

2409
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
When you think of seafood at Disneyland and Disney World

2410
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
It's just kind of a nightmare

2411
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Especially quick service

2412
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
This was really good

2413
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I fondly recall

2414
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
A lot of my meals from Disney Sea

2415
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Which is pretty rare for even a great theme park

2416
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
That's exciting

2417
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
So now

2418
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
We get to Anna and Elsa's

2419
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Frozen Journey

2420
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Which is the marquee ride

2421
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
My note right here

2422
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Just says holy shit

2423
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
So this ride is

2424
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
One of those rides where

2425
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
They nailed it in every way

2426
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
It's genre defining

2427
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
It's something that everything will be

2428
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Compared against in the future

2429
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
That they do

2430
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
It's every aspect of imagineering

2431
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Flexing as hard as they can

2432
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Impeccable lighting

2433
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Perfect use of sound effects

2434
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Beautiful scenery

2435
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
The scope and scale

2436
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Of these scenes are massive

2437
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
It's like some of these scenes

2438
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
It's like you're in a Costco

2439
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
And it's just fully themed

2440
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
But then there's also still little intimate moments

2441
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Where there's little story beats and stuff

2442
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
The queue is very detailed

2443
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Little moments where it's like

2444
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Olaf walking on the roof

2445
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Of the greenhouse

2446
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Where you see his little footsteps

2447
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Little interactive scenes

2448
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
It's a different vibe than the queue

2449
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Theoretically you could put this

2450
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
In the same attraction umbrella

2451
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
As Frozen Ever After

2452
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
But it seems like

2453
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
It shares elements with it

2454
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
But it's leaps and bounds

2455
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Just turned up to 50

2456
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
The queue is a different vibe

2457
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
There's a lot of paintings

2458
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
It's very stately

2459
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
It's really nice

2460
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Beautiful lighting fixtures

2461
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
And things on shelves

2462
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
The ride itself

2463
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
It starts off with

2464
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
You go by the trolls

2465
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
They're starting off the story

2466
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
They shoot a little magic lightning bolt thing

2467
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
That shows a vision of the kids

2468
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Then you go into another room

2469
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
It's Anna knocking on the door

2470
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
It's the start of

2471
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Do you want to build a snowman scene?

2472
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
The door spins around

2473
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
It's Elsa looking all sad

2474
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
The entire room becomes frozen

2475
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
From her powers

2476
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
The door freezes, shuts

2477
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
That door turntable looks so cool

2478
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
It looks great

2479
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
With the scale

2480
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
The perfect use of the projection

2481
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Mapping on everything

2482
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Let's say this

2483
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
The animatronics are not

2484
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
The weird little glow

2485
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Little illuminators

2486
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
The strange little light up faces

2487
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
We know in Epcot

2488
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
The best animatronics you've ever seen

2489
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
This is actually where

2490
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
It does oddly

2491
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Keep something from the Epcot ride

2492
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Where you're

2493
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
On a boat in this ride

2494
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
But then you stop

2495
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Then you feel yourself turning to the side

2496
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Then you go backwards through another scene

2497
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
There's one thing I wanted to bring up

2498
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
This is not a leisurely boat ride

2499
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
It's not a thrill ride either

2500
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
But you are perfectly

2501
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Synced to what is happening

2502
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Around you

2503
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
The movement is very deliberate

2504
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
So you're going by

2505
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
On a singing

2506
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
In the portrait

2507
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Gallery in the movie

2508
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
But then you enter another room

2509
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
And it's Elsa getting ready for the coronation

2510
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
And then they're singing to each other

2511
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
In the opposite rooms

2512
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
And then again it changes course

2513
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
And then you go through the love is an open door

2514
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Scene

2515
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
So it's kind of jumping around in scenes kind of fast

2516
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
This is so hard to do

2517
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Because boat rides you forgive a lot of like

2518
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Well if I kind of sync up to what's happening

2519
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
That's great, but this is precise

2520
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
While not being specifically controlled

2521
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
In the Shanghai pirates way

2522
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
So then in the next scene

2523
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
This is one of the coolest ones

2524
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
And this is kind of the one everybody's taking pictures and video of on social media

2525
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
So it's after love is an open door

2526
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Anna is asking

2527
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Elsa for permission to get married

2528
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Elsa is pissed

2529
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
And she shoots her angry

2530
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Ice powers

2531
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
And it turns this

2532
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
They're in like a little village

2533
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
And it turns this scene into

2534
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Big ice spikes come out of the ground

2535
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
And these fountains that are

2536
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Projection map water on

2537
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Freeze and they turn sideways and all of a sudden they're frozen

2538
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
And the whole area is freezing

2539
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
All over the place with the projection effects

2540
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
All the characters are terrified now

2541
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
They go from looking normal to being

2542
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Totally terrified by this ice

2543
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Witch that is freezing everything

2544
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
How many animatronics can like change

2545
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Personality mode

2546
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
It's really impressive

2547
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Those spikes

2548
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
That is an aggro moment

2549
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Sound effects like

2550
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
This moment really jumps out

2551
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Even just in a

2552
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Audience shot video

2553
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
It's spectacular

2554
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
The next scene is

2555
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Elsa going up the hill

2556
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
To start her new life

2557
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
In her ice palace

2558
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
And this is when the lighting effects really come into play

2559
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Because with each verse

2560
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
As the

2561
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Song builds up

2562
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
A sweeping light effect

2563
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Changes the sky

2564
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
And then you see the ice palace forming

2565
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
In the background

2566
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
And then Elsa

2567
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Builds the ice bridge in the next scene

2568
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
It's actually similar to Epcot

2569
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
But then you actually go into the ice palace

2570
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
And it's forming all around you

2571
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
With the projection effects

2572
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
But it looks blank when you go into it

2573
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
And then you're backing out

2574
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Cold doesn't bother me anyway

2575
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Perfectly synced door slam shot

2576
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
It's sick

2577
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
That ceiling

2578
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Whatever ride through I was watching

2579
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Somebody was like let me just tilt up here

2580
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
You're in a cathedral

2581
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
It's insane

2582
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
So yeah and then

2583
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Elsa accidentally zaps

2584
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Anna with the ice

2585
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
And that's a crazy one too

2586
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Because again animatronic

2587
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Anna standing there

2588
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
And then all of a sudden zapped with the ice

2589
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
And you see her body illuminate with the ice

2590
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
And then be frozen in place

2591
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
So then

2592
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
You go through the next scene

2593
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
And it's like they're just getting through the story

2594
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
It's like okay now the dude is going to come through

2595
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
The sword and try to kill Elsa

2596
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
And then you get to projected screens on

2597
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Like sails of ships

2598
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
That are wrecked in the ice

2599
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
So then you get to

2600
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Anna and Elsa standing there

2601
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Elsa is frozen in place doing her

2602
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Frozen pose

2603
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
But then it's like the true love

2604
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Cures the thing

2605
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
So you see Anna thaw out

2606
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
And kind of go into place

2607
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
And drop down to the ground

2608
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
And again it's just one of those things like

2609
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
How do animatronics look this good?

2610
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
How do they get the motion to look this good?

2611
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Are these the best animatronics in anything currently?

2612
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Just the number

2613
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
There's individual animatronics that are unbelievable

2614
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
But the fact that this is like

2615
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
So many of them

2616
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Everyone was saying Beauty and the Beast in Tokyo Disneyland

2617
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Was the best

2618
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
But do you even see, did you go on that this time?

2619
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Did these look like better than

2620
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Beauty and the Beast or similar?

2621
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
So on Beauty and the Beast

2622
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
The animatronics don't talk a lot

2623
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
And so on here

2624
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
On Frozen you really get to see

2625
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
The facial animations as well as

2626
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
The body movements

2627
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I just think besides the grand finale

2628
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Of the Beauty and the Beast ride where the beasts

2629
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Change backs into the prince

2630
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
I don't think they'll ever top that

2631
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Like that is jaw dropping

2632
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
But

2633
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Pound for pound there's so many

2634
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Just cool little animatronic moments

2635
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
On this ride and there's so many of them

2636
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
I wonder if learning all this like

2637
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Changing expression stuff

2638
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
That would be a good sign for the Walt Disney

2639
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Robot coming next year

2640
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Because people are very worried

2641
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
That he'll look so creepy

2642
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Trying to recreate what Walt looks like

2643
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Some people are like you don't know what they can do now

2644
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Well I hope it's cool when Elsa comes in

2645
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
And zaps him with ice

2646
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Walt is frozen

2647
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
We finally get to see what that would be like

2648
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
How the whole office freezes

2649
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Oh yeah

2650
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
My pen holder, my scotch

2651
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
This is what I wanted though

2652
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
That would be good

2653
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
George gets frozen in the office over to the right

2654
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
What if the Walt animatronic

2655
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Has the light up face

2656
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Oh sure

2657
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
What if just time constraints

2658
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Yeah they use the Epcot version

2659
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
He looks like a doll face spectro man

2660
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Yeah

2661
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
We'll see

2662
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Hi everyone I'm Walt

2663
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Why do they make him sound like that

2664
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
It just matches the stretch of the face

2665
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
I'm Walt Disney

2666
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
I'm Walt

2667
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Help me

2668
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Wow yeah

2669
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
So yeah and then you go

2670
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
And then everything, the day is saved

2671
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
And then they have a party and Anna and Elsa are skating around

2672
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
The ride's over, amazing ride

2673
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
10 out of 10

2674
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Just worth the price of admission

2675
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Worth the nightmare of getting to the park

2676
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Two hours earlier to try to get into

2677
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
It's just so good

2678
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Do you think top Disney ride, Disney Sea ride

2679
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Or Tokyo Disney in general

2680
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
It's up there

2681
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
I still think 20,000 Leagues is my personal favorite

2682
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Just because it's so unique

2683
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
And just so detailed

2684
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
And you can ride it 500 times and still see something new

2685
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
But yeah

2686
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
The Frozen ride is amazing

2687
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I guess there's also

2688
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
You gotta hope that we

2689
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Get that

2690
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
If we're gonna get

2691
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Assuming that that is a Disneyland

2692
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Forward expansion

2693
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
I hope we get it at this level

2694
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Because like

2695
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Hong Kong's not quite this right

2696
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Yeah I think that's more Epcot

2697
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
I'm guessing

2698
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
That whatever shape Disneyland Forward takes

2699
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
We are seeing the lands now

2700
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
In all the other parks

2701
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
We're seeing like 80% of what we will get

2702
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
In a decade in the other parks

2703
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Happening

2704
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I think so although there's a little bit of disagreement on this

2705
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Let me bring this up really quick

2706
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
I forgot in the Peter Pan zone but since we're talking about

2707
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
The Disneyland Forward stuff

2708
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Something that they've shown a lot

2709
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Is Peter Pan is a possibility of what ends up

2710
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Over there

2711
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
And I forgot a little bit of push back

2712
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
About this possibility from friend of the show

2713
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Van Rovers show

2714
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
And he wanted to get involved in the betting that we've been doing

2715
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Oh interesting

2716
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Van's theory is that they're showing Peter Pan

2717
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Because that's something that makes sense to like

2718
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Well like an Anaheim City Council member

2719
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Knows what Peter Pan is

2720
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
So if they say oh this seems fun Peter Pan will be there

2721
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
But he does not believe that that will be

2722
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Relevant enough of a property

2723
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
He thinks that that is like

2724
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
A placeholder

2725
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Like a lie

2726
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
So then they can put in something like

2727
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Avatar or a property

2728
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
The TBD that will become more important to the company

2729
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Basically he wanted to throw out the bet

2730
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
To us that

2731
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
There won't be a big

2732
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Once we get all of Disneyland Forward

2733
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
That none of that will be Peter Pan

2734
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
What do you guys think of this

2735
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Proposition?

2736
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Well I want to bet that there will be a third part called

2737
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Panland

2738
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Exclusively for Peter Pan

2739
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
I see what he's saying

2740
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I wonder

2741
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Yeah because like Tangled and Frozen make sense

2742
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Because Frozen they're going to make sequels after

2743
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Sequel I don't know if they're going to ever do a

2744
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Tangled sequel

2745
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
So I get that that's more seemingly more

2746
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Relevant

2747
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Was there a Tangled TV show?

2748
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Something like that right? Like a cartoon

2749
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
We don't keep up on that movie

2750
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
We just know the rides

2751
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
But yeah I think you're right

2752
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Is our knee jerk that we will be

2753
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Getting this Peter Pan stuff?

2754
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
I agree with Van actually

2755
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Really? Would anybody take the

2756
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Can I say what the stakes of the bet are?

2757
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
His proposition is that this

2758
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Bet is worth 40 pounds of Dole Whip

2759
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
40 pounds?

2760
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Did they usually serve it

2761
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
By the pound?

2762
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
He looked it up and he

2763
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Found that some I don't know if it's like

2764
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
I don't know if it's just like powder that you make

2765
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
It from or something he found a link to

2766
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Where you can get it in pounds

2767
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
It's about 80 dollars it's not

2768
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
So unreasonable

2769
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
But keep in mind if you could take the other side of it

2770
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
And he's wrong you get 40

2771
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Pounds we all get to split maybe you could get in

2772
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
On this guy if you want

2773
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Anybody have strong feelings about this?

2774
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
I have Dole Whip at

2775
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
They sell individual cups now

2776
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
In the freezer section

2777
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
I don't know but I'm saying you would probably weigh

2778
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Those out easily

2779
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
I don't want to take

2780
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
I agree with him I think there's other

2781
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
You can get in on this

2782
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Van if you're listening

2783
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
You're going to have to share that

2784
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Do you disagree with Van?

2785
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
I don't know I think I do

2786
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I think I do

2787
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I don't want to fucking pan

2788
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Although maybe my opinions are changing in light of

2789
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Recent information however

2790
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
It does seem I don't know it feels like they've said it a lot

2791
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
And if this ride is so I think it's more about that

2792
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
That ride is great than any

2793
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Like property relevance

2794
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I think a lot of that Disneyland forward

2795
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
That initial concept art that wraps around

2796
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
The hotel

2797
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Can look like

2798
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Mountains from Avatar

2799
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Mountains from Pan

2800
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Wakanda

2801
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Afrofuture mountains

2802
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Do you have a knee jerk though?

2803
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
You think we're getting pan in 10 years?

2804
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
I don't think we're getting pan

2805
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Do you think that is a savvy thought

2806
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Of like

2807
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Something that maybe an older city

2808
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Council person will go like oh Peter Pan

2809
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Disney yes

2810
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Am I the only person, am I the least of the

2811
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Treated are going to end up with 40 pounds of

2812
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Dole Whip in probably like

2813
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Maybe over five years because

2814
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
We don't know when they're going to say it

2815
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
It'll be like that Herb Albert cover

2816
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
With the woman in the whip cream

2817
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
With you and Dole Whip

2818
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Or no with us who we get the Dole Whip

2819
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
If you, if there's no

2820
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
If it becomes official that there's no Peter Pan

2821
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Expansion

2822
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Then you all share

2823
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Oh so we'll be in the, people know this reference

2824
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Right this Herb Albert cover with a woman

2825
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
In whip cream from 60 years ago

2826
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Well if you've ever gone to a used record store because it is

2827
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
At every single one

2828
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Yeah well as long as you, that's another

2829
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Part of the bet now you have to recreate that cover

2830
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Okay well if we win though

2831
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
It's like a punishment

2832
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Can I ask something about this Dole Whip

2833
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Does it come in concentrate

2834
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Like do you have to mix it with something

2835
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
The question I had, he sent me a link

2836
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Let me look, I wasn't too careful about this

2837
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I'll try to figure, do you have a knee jerk on this

2838
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
While I look up the

2839
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Oh wait actually he sent, oh geez what he sent is only

2840
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
17 pounds

2841
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
You added 23

2842
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Pounds to that I'm confused at the link

2843
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
It's a box and it appears, it's a very

2844
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Functional box and it apparently has 17

2845
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Pounds of Whip

2846
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Alright well, do you think we're

2847
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Getting Peter Pan that year

2848
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
No I don't think so

2849
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
I think they'll want more relevant

2850
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
New stuff yeah

2851
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
The man on an island

2852
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Pan Island

2853
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
I don't know it's weird that I ended up on

2854
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Pan Island It is weird

2855
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Something is gravitating me towards it right now

2856
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
I don't know what it is The pirate ship and the skull

2857
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Is cool

2858
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
So if it is the full land that is

2859
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Enticing because it feels like a

2860
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Cool

2861
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
I don't know thing to go to

2862
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Well let's just keep in mind then that there might be

2863
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
A Dole Whip party

2864
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
That we all, that everybody is invited to

2865
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
And Guy you'll have to join too

2866
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
And catered by me apparently

2867
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
And if not then you all

2868
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Just watch me eat something I don't really want

2869
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
17 pounds of it

2870
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
We're going to have to do this in like 10

2871
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Sittings

2872
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Citrus based

2873
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Foods famously good for eating

2874
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
A ton of right for the throat

2875
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
And your teeth

2876
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
The enamel on your teeth

2877
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
It's Van's desire

2878
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Not even mine

2879
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
He said you don't have to eat it but you have to accept it

2880
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Those are the rules of Van's bet

2881
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Okay

2882
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
It seems like no matter who wins we all get punished

2883
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Somehow like everybody gets punished

2884
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Depending on just the logistics

2885
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
The sheer hauling big boxes

2886
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Of Dole Whip around

2887
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
And the smell of melted rotting

2888
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Dole Whip too

2889
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Haunting you much like the

2890
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Crocodile

2891
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Haunted hook

2892
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Guy you'll be pining for roast beef

2893
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Popcorn

2894
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Anyways okay what have we missed here

2895
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Yeah so yeah exit frozen

2896
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
On the right hiding the giant

2897
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Show building a big old fjord

2898
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
With water coming out and

2899
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
You know just looks super nice

2900
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
So this leads to the

2901
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Tokyo Disney Sea

2902
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Fantasy Springs Hotel

2903
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
My note to start off this section

2904
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Of my notes ugly

2905
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Yeah

2906
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
I mean the park facing side is alright

2907
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
It's a little odd but then if you see

2908
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
That's what I was looking at if you see all around it

2909
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
It's not that great

2910
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Yeah the park facing side is much better

2911
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
But if you're coming on that

2912
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Monorail from Tokyo Disneyland

2913
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
To the Bayside Station

2914
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
I mean it just looks like a big stucco

2915
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Box with a couple of little flourishes

2916
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
It feels very vague it feels like if you're

2917
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Taking the monorail and you're behind

2918
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Bellagio it's not as nice as in the

2919
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Front

2920
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Yeah I wonder

2921
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
If this got away from them

2922
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Or something cause it doesn't

2923
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Really match the rest of the

2924
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Land it's pretty enough you know

2925
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
But yeah there's 475

2926
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Rooms in this hotel

2927
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
419 rooms in

2928
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
The normal side of the hotel but then there's the

2929
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Grand Chateau with 56

2930
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Rooms so that's like the ultra

2931
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Expensive premium

2932
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Rooms that look into

2933
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
The land do we know how much more expensive

2934
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Than a typical than like

2935
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
I don't know other surrounding hotels

2936
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
So when I go to

2937
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Tokyo Disney and I stay in one of the

2938
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
On-site hotels I try to pay like

2939
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
120 bucks for like the Hilton or the

2940
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Sheraton right I love it that was a Hilton

2941
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
But yeah I like that Hilton really nice yeah

2942
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Really good lounge in there by the way

2943
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Oh yeah yeah yes I liked it

2944
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Breakfast I liked it all there yeah oh yeah I still follow them

2945
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
On Instagram

2946
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Yeah but then

2947
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
You know like Toy Story Hotel that's like

2948
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
You know 300

2949
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
To 400 a night depending on the season

2950
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Pretty expensive right

2951
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
And then this is in like the

2952
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Seven eight nine hundred

2953
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Dollar a night range

2954
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Oh so one night at the Contempor basically

2955
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
You get a theme park

2956
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
But also it's super in demand

2957
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Because it's new and people want to stay in it

2958
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
And people want to get into Fantasy Springs

2959
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
So they want to stay there and get the magic ticket

2960
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Yeah so I didn't stay here so all

2961
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I can really say is what I see from the

2962
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Outside and you know it's nice

2963
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Enough I guess the one thing

2964
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
I heard people complaining about is that

2965
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
It has what looks like a lobby

2966
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
So you think like oh a lobby I want to go

2967
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Relax in here no that's

2968
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
A lounge you need a reservation to get into

2969
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
The reservation is super hard to get other than that

2970
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
No you can't hang out in there

2971
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
So yeah

2972
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
But in front of the hotel

2973
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
This is where most of those

2974
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Character rock work

2975
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Statues are Ariel with the fins

2976
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
And the water splashing up

2977
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Sorcerer Mickey with the

2978
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Brooms dumping the water out

2979
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
That all looks great

2980
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Especially at night when the water like is really

2981
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Bouncing off all the lights and stuff

2982
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
This is where the only

2983
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Gift shop in the entire land is

2984
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Called Fantasy Springs Gifts

2985
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Oh I saw that

2986
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
On the TDR Explorer

2987
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
One of his many videos

2988
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
He's like yeah the main gift shop

2989
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Is in the ground floor of the hotel

2990
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
So it's like in the hotel

2991
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
But you can get into it from

2992
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
In the park

2993
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
I waited an hour in the burning hot sun

2994
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
To get in here

2995
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
To get into the gift shop

2996
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
I think all I bought was a bath bomb

2997
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
For my girlfriend

2998
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I was good with the stuff in there

2999
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
And now it's like all sold out and it's just

3000
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Regular Tokyo Disney merch

3001
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
And nobody knows when it's going to restock or not

3002
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Geez

3003
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
So

3004
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
This hotel

3005
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Is inside the park much like Miracosta

3006
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
And it has an entrance and

3007
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Exit

3008
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
To get into the park

3009
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
So you think that's great

3010
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
This is only open to guests of

3011
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Fantasy Springs Hotel

3012
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
You can't be at a hotel just on the other side

3013
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Right so when I was staying at

3014
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Toy Story Hotel which was directly

3015
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Across the street from it

3016
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
If I contorted my body enough I could look out and see

3017
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
My hotel

3018
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
And I could not exit it at the end of the night

3019
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
But you're at a Disney hotel

3020
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
I don't even let you

3021
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
So it's not like it's Grand Californian and Disney California Adventure

3022
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
I don't know why I said the whole name

3023
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
You can exit through the hotel

3024
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
From the park but not enter

3025
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
No you cannot do either

3026
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
In Tokyo

3027
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
You can't exit through

3028
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
You can enter and exit

3029
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
I think the first two hours of the day they'll let you enter

3030
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
They'll let you enter after the first

3031
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
If you're not staying

3032
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Have you tried this?

3033
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
I always thought you couldn't enter

3034
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
I go in all the time

3035
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
I knew you could enter

3036
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
If you were at the Disneyland

3037
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Hotel

3038
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
But you're saying no you don't even stay there

3039
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
The first couple of hours it's hotel guests only

3040
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
But then after that they'll let you in

3041
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Because there's been so many times

3042
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Where I go to eat at Craftsman

3043
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
That's a great place

3044
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
You've got to walk so far around

3045
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Thank you for that tip

3046
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Another frustrating thing that I've heard from people

3047
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Who have actually stayed in the Fantasy Springs Hotel

3048
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Is that they close that

3049
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Entrance slash exit

3050
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
At 9 o'clock or sometimes 9.15

3051
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Either way

3052
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
If you're doing something else on the other side of the park

3053
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
And you're not making it there in 15 minutes

3054
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
The hotel you paid

3055
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
$900 a night to stay in

3056
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
You cannot exit

3057
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
You have to go all the way to the front of the park

3058
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
To Miracosta to get on the monorail and take it all the way back

3059
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
That's rough

3060
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
It seems like there are some

3061
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
American style

3062
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Operations issues that need to be

3063
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Smoothed over

3064
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
As time goes on

3065
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
And everything is less popular

3066
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Maybe they'll open it up to everyone

3067
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
I don't know, it's just something that they do now

3068
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
That I think is very stupid

3069
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Sounds weird

3070
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
So operational annoyances

3071
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
But this

3072
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
You're raving about most of what we got here

3073
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Yeah, it's just

3074
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Filled with wonderful

3075
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Rides and it's

3076
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Pretty and it adds a ton of

3077
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Capacity to the park

3078
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Which is nice

3079
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
My only criticism

3080
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Is that it feels so disconnected

3081
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
And that's not really a big deal

3082
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
But yeah, it gives Disney Sea

3083
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Their fantasy land

3084
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Yeah, yeah, which is because there's

3085
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Analogs throughout

3086
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
I don't remember the name of the area

3087
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
But where Aquatopia is is kind of like their tomorrow

3088
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
And then they sort of have

3089
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
An adventure land

3090
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
It makes a lot of sense, it's cool

3091
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
And the thing

3092
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
I'm sure I've said this before

3093
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
It's a park that didn't need it

3094
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
It was the greatest theme park I've ever been to

3095
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Regardless

3096
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
And things you're saying are the best ride

3097
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
They're one of the best

3098
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Anywhere, it's pretty mind-boggling

3099
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Massive

3100
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
And the biggest expansion they've ever done

3101
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
And boy it's what

3102
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Just really shows you what they're willing to do

3103
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
With the Oriental Land Company

3104
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
These rides are like 50,000 square feet

3105
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
40,000 square feet, they're gigantic

3106
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
You can see them all when you're staying in the

3107
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Hotels on the off-site ones

3108
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Right, right, is there more

3109
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
I'm so into looking right now at the overhead

3110
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Google map of all these parks

3111
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Is there more room to expand

3112
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
For DisneySea?

3113
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Yeah, there's that corner where they were going to put

3114
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
The Scandinavia port, the original

3115
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Frozen port

3116
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
And they were going to put it in that corner

3117
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
It's still just empty

3118
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
So there's still some room, because I was like, oh this is such a

3119
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Big footprint, I wonder what's even left

3120
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
And then through the

3121
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Where the Toy Story ride is

3122
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
There's like a bus parking lot

3123
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
There that I assume they could

3124
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Oh, I see

3125
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
I had the map up from earlier

3126
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Of course, good, yeah

3127
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
God, they could keep going

3128
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
That is wild

3129
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
If anything were to come

3130
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Here, if we were to get anything

3131
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
In Disneyland forward

3132
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
What would be your pick?

3133
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
It'd have to be Frozen

3134
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
It's just so nice

3135
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Even if they did like a little

3136
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Pleasant Rapunzel

3137
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
There's a free ticket that just

3138
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Was off in the corner somewhere

3139
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Because you know, the ride ending abruptly

3140
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
It's like, okay, whatever, they only have so much money

3141
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
They only have so much space

3142
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
It's like, okay, cut off a couple scenes from this ride

3143
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
It's not a big deal

3144
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
But that's actually

3145
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
What is weird is there's not really any villains

3146
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Either, there's no Mother Gothel

3147
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
In the

3148
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Tangled ride

3149
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
And then really you only see a quick video clip

3150
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Of the bad guy from Frozen

3151
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
It's kind of an animatronic

3152
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
No Hook?

3153
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Yeah, Hook, well that's the only exception

3154
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Hook is on the

3155
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
His funny pirate dudes

3156
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
So I guess maybe just bring the Rapunzel

3157
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
In the tower

3158
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
That would be a priority over the ride

3159
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
It's so cool

3160
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
So you could do that

3161
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
And late at night too, when the park is emptying out

3162
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
And it's closing, you just can hear her

3163
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Kind of gently singing off in the distance

3164
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
It's so nice

3165
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
This is spectacular

3166
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
It's exciting

3167
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
To hear that they're doing stuff

3168
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Of this caliber

3169
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
And you know

3170
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
God willing we get

3171
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Stuff of this high quality

3172
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Over there

3173
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
And if there's a Tinkerbell in there too

3174
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Then nobody complains

3175
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
What if it's just Tinkerbell land and Pan isn't anywhere to be found

3176
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Hell yeah

3177
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
1000%

3178
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Very Tinkerbell's busy land

3179
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
And then it's just Tinkerbell land

3180
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
And Peter Pan is nowhere to be found

3181
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
I think we have fixed everything

3182
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
She can fly, you can do almost all the same story

3183
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
And Pan isn't even involved there

3184
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
And Tee Hollows

3185
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Still hanging out in Disneyland

3186
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
That's true, yeah

3187
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
So there's precedent

3188
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Great, great, well that's the idea

3189
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Also really quick, if anybody put on

3190
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
This episode

3191
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
In confusion and you're a little disappointed

3192
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
I guess you've realized by now this was not an episode

3193
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
About the Fantasy Springs casino

3194
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Outside of Palm Springs

3195
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
So apologies, we will try

3196
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
We will make that a separate episode

3197
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
But since it's relevant right now, you should know

3198
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
That Saturday, September 28th, the Special Events Center

3199
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Will be hosting former eagle Don Felder

3200
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Whoa, Felder

3201
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Felder, they got Felder

3202
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
How'd they pull that off

3203
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
I don't know, it's the hardest booking

3204
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
In the showbiz

3205
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
But they got Felder, so if that

3206
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Fantasy Springs is closer to you than Tokyo

3207
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Keep in mind the Felder expansion

3208
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Is coming for one night only

3209
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
And that's not at a sphere of any kind

3210
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
I don't think it's a regular theater

3211
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
It's at the lead of the flattest named place

3212
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
I was like, that can't be right, it's called the Special Events Center

3213
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
This is unimaginative

3214
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Not Disney level naming

3215
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Oh, and just to payoff guy

3216
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
In the Sherlock Holmes universe

3217
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
You can be Inspector Lestrade

3218
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Oh, thank you, there we go

3219
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
The ally from Scotland Yard

3220
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
In

3221
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
The Sherlock Holmes 22nd century

3222
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
It's Inspector Beth Lestrade

3223
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
A direct descendant

3224
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Of the original

3225
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Inspector Lestrade

3226
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Just in time for the outro

3227
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
To say guy

3228
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Inspector Lestrade Selga

3229
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
You survived, but guessed the right

3230
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Really, thank you for bringing

3231
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
This in-depth report

3232
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
I'm jealous, I wish I could go

3233
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
And it's awesome, you've got to do it pretty

3234
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Frequently

3235
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
If you go to the gift shop, anything you'd like to plug

3236
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Okay, before I plug, Scott

3237
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I brought you a donut

3238
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
I forgive you

3239
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
What a twist

3240
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Wow

3241
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Uh oh, roast beef

3242
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
I'm still cursed

3243
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Bologna on the donut too

3244
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Yeah, just

3245
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Guy Selga on Twitter and Instagram

3246
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
And everything else

3247
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
And then of course, touringplans.com

3248
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Where we help you save time and money in the theme parks

3249

3250
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
And yeah, thanks so much for having me

3251
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
That was a lot of fun, really appreciate it

3252
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Yeah, of course, thanks for doing it

3253
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Thanks for coming from Buena Park

3254
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
And of course, let's

3255
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Let's go

3256
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
One more thing, you said you had the toy, what's the toy?

3257
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Yes, a couple years ago

3258
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
They sold a Babu Frick, a life-size

3259
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Babu Frick in Galaxy's Edge

3260
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
And he has a soft rubbery face

3261
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Because of course his mouth moves

3262
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Because he talks, so I'm going to just

3263
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Plant some nice big wet ones

3264
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Right on his little

3265
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
I think we're all in pretty strong agreement

3266
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
On Babu Frick in general

3267
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
So it's nice to hear that it's a smoochable toy

3268
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
I'm going to go to Jason at the very end

3269
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
But first I will say, as for us

Jason, who you smooching?

3276
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
You know, I'm going to have to go with a classic

3277
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
The Playmates, April O'Neil

3278
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Action figure in the yellow jumpsuit

3279
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
All my hall passes

3280
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Are fictional cartoon characters

3281
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
So continuing that streak

3282
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Her camera turned into a gun

3283
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
And so she can protect you also

3284
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Yeah, she had a

3285
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Full ass gun

3286
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
You can do like gunplay

3287
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Yeah, she

3288
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Is like Geraldo Rivera

3289
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
When he was covering one of the Wars

3290
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
In the Middle East, would not tell

3291
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
The anchor back in America

3292
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
If he was holding, if he had a

3293
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Gun on him or not

3294
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Ooh, is there a

3295
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Is there a Geraldo? I might be changing

3296
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
My answer, any Geraldo action

3297
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Figures out there with real feel

3298
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Mustache tickle action

3299
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
We know some people at Mattel

3300
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
So maybe we can get this done

3301
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Ooh, yes please

3302
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Forever

3303
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Dog

3304
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
