1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever…

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,220
…

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,220
dog.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,120
When your town has made you frown,

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,920
When your square has made you swear,

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,440
When life gives you one more punch,

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,000
You need a doughnut soaked in Captain Grunge.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:29,040
You need a place, a place to stroll with alcohol,

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,180
A place that features part of the Berlin Wall,

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,160
Where steampunk robots sell chocolate snacks,

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,180
A place where you can tattoo your lower back.

12
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,340
So let's go take a walk,

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,840
Let's all go to City Walk Orlando tonight.

14
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,180
Extremely necessary series, exploring the shops, restaurants,

15
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,980
The cosmic wonder, that make up Universal City Walk Orlando.

16
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,740
Welcome to the grand finale of Podcast The Ride,

17
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,280
the City Walk Orlando Saga multiverse of madness.

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,400
Day last.

19
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,160
I'm not going to say a number because I'm not even fully confident which one we're at.

20
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,320
I don't know either.

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,460
But it is.

22
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,880
It's going to have to be the last.

23
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,800
We can't start saying it and then take it back.

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,540
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Mike Carlson.

25
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,020
Hi, I'm here and it has to be the last.

26
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,940
This has to be it.

27
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,260
We have to be done here.

28
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,140
I'm not joking.

29
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,380
There's a lot at play.

30
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,160
I don't know whether we're talking to each other or to certain spirits,

31
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,860
but whatever's out there, let's all get into agreement on this.

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,120
Jason Sheridan, do you agree?

33
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,240
I'd be open to revisiting any number of these.

34
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,800
Jason, how?

35
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,940
How?

36
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,620
It has to be.

37
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,600
Oh my God.

38
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,160
All right.

39
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,380
Well, a break for a little bit.

40
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,460
In fact, I think that's what needs to be addressed at the top.

41
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,620
This is the finale.

42
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,360
We have reached the end of what my wife Erin called a psychotic amount of content.

43
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,080
And I'd like to not hear that word used again about future endeavors.

44
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,340
I believe this is my, I think what we're at, 21 days, 24 episodes.

45
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:39,260
When I say those stats out loud, I hope you will understand why we are taking a sizable break on the main feed after this.

46
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,100
I don't know for how long, but it makes sense, doesn't it?

47
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:43,860
It makes sense.

48
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,680
The only thing that I take some solace in is the fact that now we are really padding out our podcast catalog.

49
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,860
So then when we sell it, when we're in our seventies, much like the recording artists, you know, your Bruce Springsteen's, your Neil Young's are selling their catalog.

50
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,100
We've now padded it out with 24 episodes.

51
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,440
Yep.

52
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,020
It hits one and all.

53
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,120
Hits every one of them.

54
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,300
Perfect episodes over and over.

55
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:14,040
These are all the piano man and we didn't start the fire of in our Billy Joel-esque catalog of all killers.

56
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,540
That's right.

57
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,500
They've all come out in the last 21 days.

58
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,960
This break is news to me.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,590
I was going to start a multi-part saga on the Philadelphia toboggan company starting tomorrow.

60
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,700
Manufacture of early roller coasters and carousels.

61
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,760
Jason, you're welcome to.

62
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:37,920
As long as you're okay to do it with no co-hosts and no engineers or editors besides yourself.

63
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,920
And no microphones.

64
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,460
Oh, okay.

65
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,260
We need to give them a rest too.

66
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,600
They're piping hot.

67
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,480
Just in some sort of padded cell of my own.

68
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,280
Of your own creation.

69
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,620
Maybe where it should stay.

70
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:52,940
Yes.

71
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,480
That's right.

72
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,520
Okay.

73
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,360
So a little break on the main feed, but new episodes will keep coming out on the second gate and club three.

74
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,040
So be sure to subscribe if you haven't already and if you aren't sick of us.

75
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:12,740
On a similar note, what we're doing right now, at least a big old chunk of it, the majority of it, will be available as a video episode.

76
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,500
It will be available exclusively for club three subscribers.

77
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,940
And if everything we have planned works out, you won't want to miss this.

78
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:26,120
And if you're seeing the pointing I'm doing at a camera, then you're already watching the video.

79
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,340
That'll be it.

80
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,000
Check out all this great pointing.

81
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,300
We're pulling you in.

82
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,860
Now I'm doing a pulling gesture.

83
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,180
You'll see all of these gestures if you go to patreon.

84
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:41,280
com slash podcast, the ride and our thanks to West Knapp for helping us out with the video and all the engineering here.

85
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:48,040
One more time, I want to thank Aaron Gardner for the art, Mike Carlson for a fantastic theme song sung beautifully by Zach Reno.

86
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,780
I want to thank all the guests who have been with us through this series.

87
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,520
It might be the best lineup of guests we've ever had, at least all condensed into a short amount of time.

88
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,780
I do just have the regret.

89
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,980
I'd like to say I wish we could have fit in Griffin Newman or Zach Reno.

90
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,080
But hey, they were here in spirit.

91
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:14,960
And of course we have to hold out hope that someday we will finally get Anthony Geo to be on the show a little more frequently.

92
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,800
I would love that.

93
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,540
He's great.

94
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,840
I don't know why it doesn't come together, but fingers crossed we can make this work in the future.

95
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
He's not mad at us.

96
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,760
I know.

97
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,920
It's so many ignored texts.

98
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,340
You have to start assuming some sort of tension.

99
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,940
But luckily there is a guest who did not ignore texts.

100
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,360
He probably wanted to.

101
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,140
Yeah, yeah.

102
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,020
You will wish that he had when all this is said and done.

103
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:56,620
I don't think we're allowed to end one of these without this guest who has not been on podcast the ride in any form since his last Saga finale parking garage episode over four years ago.

104
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:56,900
Wow.

105
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,420
Yeah.

106
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,400
Can you believe that?

107
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,380
Nuts from Doughboys from Get Played.

108
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,500
It's Nick Weiger.

109
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,280
Wow.

110
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,020
Hey, buddy.

111
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,900
Thanks for having me.

112
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,480
What a treat.

113
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,840
Thanks for being here.

114
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,060
What a ride.

115
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:07,900
Oh, boy.

116
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,700
Quite a ride.

117
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:09,400
I.

118
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:09,920
Yeah.

119
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,380
Yeah.

120
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:20,420
You've been you've been listening to some you've been trying to keep up as the avalanche just keeps pouring new snow on top of you every time you think you're going to get up.

121
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,100
No, I am.

122
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:21,600
I am.

123
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:32,680
I've been listening every day to the City Walk Saga and I am Multiverse of Madness and I am four days behind because it's just it's it's a deluge of content, as you know.

124
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,920
And I can't I love the podcast.

125
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:42,560
I'm listening to it with focus, but I don't have like two and a half full hours every day to listen to it.

126
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:46,900
Okay.

127
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,660
I've had this with yeah, Aaron.

128
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,460
My wife was like, I took a break.

129
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,100
I wanted to hear some music on my commute.

130
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,520
Yes, of course.

131
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,780
You'll be hearing me.

132
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,100
You will.

133
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,520
You also have to hear everything that happened before it comes out.

134
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,380
And then maybe after again, you hear my voice all the time.

135
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,040
Everyone, please.

136
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,960
I think everyone could use a break here.

137
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,680
No, it's great what you're doing.

138
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,380
The three of you are heroes.

139
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,240
And I thank you.

140
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:11,960
I.

141
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,660
It's just someone said we were talking before.

142
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,500
The podcast began because, you know, I've been on podcast doughboys with Mike Mitchell.

143
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:25,700
And right now we are doing for whom the bell does much Madness 2024, the turn of champions nine dokiro Taco Bell, which is a month of Taco Bell.

144
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,260
And it's a big pain in the ass.

145
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,180
And we're annoyed and angry and cranky and yelling at each other.

146
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,260
And you said that block of words more coherently and quickly than any.

147
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,120
That was like you were speaking a foreign language.

148
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,500
That was that was amazing.

149
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,960
My eyes rolled back in my head like a men tat from Dune.

150
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:52,580
So but like that is so much less annoying for us than what you are doing to yourselves.

151
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:59,740
So like it really puts into perspective what your sacrifice is as podcasters to give us daily content.

152
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,120
This volume and this quality of work on your part.

153
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,040
Well, I guess, you know, we have to take it.

154
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,820
How could we not?

155
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,540
I wouldn't be polite to not accept this praise.

156
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,120
There's really no other way.

157
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,600
I'd love to bat it off, but it would be rude to break a tiny bit of kayfabe.

158
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:25,860
We've been trying to get this off the ground for years and pandemics and births and strikes and all these things have gotten in the way.

159
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,640
And I have been really happy to do it.

160
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,980
And then we got to go to Orlando, our favorite place to do it.

161
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:38,360
But there's one aspect of it that has, I'd say, not been pleasant and some maybe where our heroism should be mentioned.

162
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,680
And that is the the eating aspect of it.

163
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:41,860
Right.

164
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,760
And I think we're a little bit on your territory now.

165
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,020
And I wanted to compare notes with you.

166
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,800
The food punishment, it's existed in all of these.

167
00:08:51,900 --> 00:09:00,960
But this one, I feel like every episode has had some kind of incident from just an upset stomach to something being disappointing all the way up to food portion.

168
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:07,340
And I guess I'm curious, Nick, about your relationship with.

169
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:08,260
I.

170
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,380
OK, question one.

171
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:09,780
Yes.

172
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:17,200
Your policy about going back to restaurants that have actively made you feel bad for doughboys.

173
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:17,940
Yeah.

174
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,980
Our policy is we will do it.

175
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:23,660
Atta boy!

176
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,920
Jason and I's too.

177
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,240
That's how we feel as well.

178
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,640
Yeah.

179
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,160
All right.

180
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,420
Well, I'm massively outnumbered here.

181
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,880
I think this policy has made me a pariah in our own podcast community.

182
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:46,180
I'm a stuffy elitist, apparently, for not as opposed to because what I've found, the whole thing has reminded me of the Mr.

183
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:52,920
Show sketch, The Devastator, where there is a roller coaster in town that is like that's like killing and drowning people.

184
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,400
And the news reports about we got to get out of here.

185
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,700
I got to protect my family.

186
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:03,560
And then it goes back to the theme park and the people who were just saying I got to get out of here are back in line with thumbs up smiles.

187
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,560
And I that's you guys.

188
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,420
It's the like right up eating pinks and pinks hurting you.

189
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,640
As soon as we have said that pinks is not good.

190
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,740
Back at Toothsome.

191
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,400
I went to Toothsome not even for an episode.

192
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:14,900
No.

193
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,180
Yeah.

194
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,880
But you did.

195
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,020
You did get a milkshake and you made a video.

196
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:24,100
I'm quoting somebody else here, but I saw the comment that the tone of the video in which you say it's fine.

197
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:31,020
It's OK that it felt as if Latte the robot dog had a pistol trained on you just out of frame.

198
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,960
You made a hostage video.

199
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,860
Why are we letting these places hold us hostage?

200
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:41,660
There was a there is a scenario today where I brought like flounder almondine for everyone here from Toothsome.

201
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,300
But they don't I don't think we couldn't get it to go.

202
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,980
You know, this hasn't been said on the show.

203
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:50,800
I believe that flounder almondine is not available on the menu anymore.

204
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,000
Right.

205
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,240
I know.

206
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,340
You look at the menu.

207
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,180
Yeah.

208
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:53,460
Yeah.

209
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:58,300
That terrible burger Jane had was it did not appear to be on the menu anymore.

210
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,200
Are they listening?

211
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,600
I had this like cocoa.

212
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,900
Oh, maybe they're adjusting.

213
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,900
They're listening and taking things off that we didn't like.

214
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,100
Look, we look.

215
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,540
We got to make our peace.

216
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,040
We just got to go up there for dinner when they unlock the pasta menu.

217
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,640
We just need some of that tooth when they unlock.

218
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,720
They take their golden, their copper keys and they put it in the pasta machine and turn them on.

219
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,600
It's like sub keys like the nuclear subs.

220
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:27,180
Yeah.

221
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:27,460
Yeah.

222
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,420
And they unlock it.

223
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:28,680
Yeah.

224
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,720
Was Hunt for Red October the property that introduced the two keys?

225
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,780
Because like I was probably that recently because because Blank Check is covering John McTiernan.

226
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,320
And I was like, is this the first movie that did this?

227
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,040
Because they spend some time explaining the two keys right in it.

228
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,860
Probably because it's a big part of Mission Impossible.

229
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,420
Yes, 100 percent.

230
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:49,860
Yeah.

231
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,140
Yeah.

232
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:56,840
And then that and that already feels like it has a hunt for October just homage built into it with a submarine and with the Russian turning into English.

233
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:57,600
Yeah.

234
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,160
Yeah.

235
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:05,940
It's a anyway that that tangent aside, what y'all are dealing with is not just like shitty chain restaurants, but like the worst version.

236
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:11,940
A lot of these chain restaurants, they're either things that exist like as gimmicks that that are just there to like, you know,

237
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:19,460
like a pool filter, just catch people leaving, like entering or leaving theme parks.

238
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,880
So they're either like their places like Toothsummer, places like Bubba Gump.

239
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:28,100
But you're also dealing with like the extra-grimble sounding Moe's outlet that you all visited.

240
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:34,360
And I mean, and that's one thing that happens because I know that the universal KFC, the universal city walk KFC,

241
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:41,860
we just had our friend Jamie Loftus on the podcast and her experience there was she went there to get a seasonal item.

242
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,640
They have Blackberry Pepsi right now.

243
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,120
And they were all like, what are you talking about?

244
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,660
Like the news hadn't made it there.

245
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,520
Like it's like a frontier outlet that doesn't have isn't a part of the same KFC infrastructure.

246
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:58,840
So like, yeah, you're dealing with really like like the worst of the worst of this already usually pretty mediocre food.

247
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,100
And let's not forget more expensive, more expensive.

248
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:02,600
Absolutely.

249
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,240
There's a premium.

250
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:03,640
Yeah.

251
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,520
It's like the you know, it's like it's like the versions you'll find in an airport or a stadium.

252
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,680
It's the same sort of captive audience.

253
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,820
We don't have to have the same quality level.

254
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,420
The brand is enough to get people here and we can upcharge them.

255
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:21,900
It's weird for something that like I think we've entered into these all of these city walk things going with this.

256
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,540
Well, this is the world stage.

257
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:29,680
This is where you bring your best or you do the best of the best and that they they literally bring their worst.

258
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,240
Yeah, they all.

259
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,020
And we still continue to be surprised by this.

260
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:38,720
And I think if if we were a big if we were to step down and do this ever again,

261
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,080
I think it'll be enough time for us to forget and just get back in line.

262
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,740
Actually, well, I mean, I'll just say let's make that if a win.

263
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,640
Amen, brother.

264
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,460
Thanks for thanks for speaking for some of the audience there.

265
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,720
We're not going to let child rearing chronic health conditions get us down.

266
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,720
If we could find one of the let's just let's crunch some numbers

267
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,820
and find the one of these theme park adjacent malls with the least restaurants.

268
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,520
Yes, I think then I'd be back in because I think we did the one with the most.

269
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,560
And while it led to some surprises like how much we liked Hot Dog Hall of Fame

270
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,860
and Ian Rickabani's glowing feelings about Bubba Gump with his family,

271
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,360
I think most of it was traumatic.

272
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,320
So I think there's more restaurants here than in any of them.

273
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,540
And I felt the weight of it.

274
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,040
Let's just crunch numbers.

275
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,160
Somebody out there.

276
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,300
What's near a theme park with maybe one cafe?

277
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,460
Well, and I'll get an iced tea there just just to throw an idea out there.

278
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,240
And, you know, you could run this by the sector keeper.

279
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,360
But like I think there's maybe a reality where just you, you know,

280
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,880
maybe all of all of the food side is just one special episode.

281
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,220
And then you don't have to worry about like we're going to make sure we have

282
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,900
we get designated meals for everything.

283
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,160
We'll just do a kind of a survey of all of the available food options there.

284
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,820
And then we'll really drill down.

285
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,000
You get down to brass tacks dealing with the individual stores

286
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,880
and the VR experiences and what have you.

287
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,080
Could we also assemble maybe like a Mission Impossible team where, for instance,

288
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,760
we only make Jason eat at all the restaurants and Scott doesn't have to eat.

289
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,560
That's his special power.

290
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,840
This is an area where I'm lacking.

291
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,720
Jason, don't you want to go eat more of this food?

292
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,740
Hmm.

293
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,840
I recently had a doctor tell me I had to change my diet.

294
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,860
But yes, I do.

295
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,580
And I believe.

296
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,860
And after that, you started drinking more soda, correct?

297
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,600
You know, we all need little joys.

298
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,760
I the scientific advances in the zero category like Dr.

299
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,400
Rapper Zero Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.

300
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,620
Good tasting, but they made it a very cumbersome name now.

301
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,440
I feel like those have come a long way.

302
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,920
The zeros are really impressive.

303
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,740
Yeah, I basically just don't drink diet drinks at all anymore.

304
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:04,820
I just go for the zeros and whatever they're doing, whatever alchemy is going on behind the scenes.

305
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,600
Like I feel like you'll have like the I think the Dr.

306
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,180
Pepper Cherry Vanilla Zero.

307
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,480
That one's really hitting.

308
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,380
There's an A&W Cream Soda Zero that Natalie picked up and it's just like we love that one.

309
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,680
That's a go to for us.

310
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:25,660
And the other thing is like I'm also I'm looking specifically for zeros with no caffeine because I'm trying to have caffeine in the afternoon.

311
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,240
So when you hit some of those, I mean, it's really, really satisfying.

312
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,200
But yeah, they've gotten really good.

313
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:30,760
Yeah.

314
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,120
Yeah.

315
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,960
And it's I'm like a two zero a day guy these days.

316
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,340
Wow.

317
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,920
Because I tried Stevia soda for a long time.

318
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,740
It hurts my head.

319
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,580
I can't do it.

320
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,720
But that's the natural one, they claim.

321
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,480
But they asked for Tame, which is a fake one.

322
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,160
Well, it is technically natural, but it hurts my stomach.

323
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,280
Also after the entire Breaking Bad, like she drinks that Stevia shit.

324
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,140
And you're still like, so do I.

325
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,580
I got a lot in common with Lydia.

326
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,080
That's fiction.

327
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,020
That's a fictional show.

328
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,640
That was in it's set a little in the past.

329
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,100
Back then it was Stevia was bad.

330
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:06,320
I will say from listening and editing most of these episodes, I do think my stomach is by far the strongest of the three of us.

331
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:13,220
Jason will eat as much as I will and eat the same stuff, but Jason will generally report a tummy ache, but he will go back.

332
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,100
You don't like things in general.

333
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,420
You will like things the least.

334
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,620
And then you will have tummy ache or puke.

335
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,860
Jason will go and not learn his lesson, but often have a tummy ache.

336
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,040
And then I will once in a while have a tummy ache.

337
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,600
Does that feel right?

338
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
I think that's fair.

339
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:27,940
Yeah.

340
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,560
How did you react physically?

341
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,360
Because when we went and saw our friend, Eva Anderson's immersive beforehand,

342
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,340
we got a pregame meal at a famous director, Gold Tongs Fried Chicken in Gria Town.

343
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,020
We did get a nice meal.

344
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,300
How did your constitution handle that?

345
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,840
Because that was a pretty heavy fried meal.

346
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,060
It was fine.

347
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,440
I don't know.

348
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,920
It was fine.

349
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:50,840
I had like a drink afterward and walking around was helpful because the immersive was we could walk around.

350
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,340
So yeah, if you get the system moving, I feel like it was fine.

351
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,040
Did you have a problem?

352
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,900
Were you secretly in shitting pain while we were walking?

353
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:03,920
I was OK at the event, but I was maybe in not the most comfortable situation afterwards.

354
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:14,880
Because it was that really dense fried chicken with a lot of breading and then some of it was really heavily sauced with a lot of sugary sauces.

355
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,460
It was delicious, but yeah, it was very good.

356
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:27,020
I haven't been to this place, but I feel like you're in a better territory that it is a real restaurant by someone who wanted to open a restaurant.

357
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,540
That's the like it's like Nick.

358
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:42,480
It's completely that like they have universal owns a funnel and they have to put things in the funnel to help like get everybody to shake coins out of people on their way down the funnel.

359
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,740
It's not nobody's desiring to open a good restaurant.

360
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,120
Right.

361
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,220
It's not the point.

362
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:47,820
No.

363
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,240
How many times do you do?

364
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,220
During the week, do you feel like, oh, I'm gonna have a bad shit?

365
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,780
Or show related even specifically show related?

366
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:03,900
I would say it's pretty frequent because we're eating a lot of pretty awful food.

367
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:12,680
And even if it's like I'm enjoying it, it's usually something that's very heavy that I know is going to destroy me.

368
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,560
And then also I'm just like I'm older.

369
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:29,420
Like I've since I'm since I hit 40 basically, I'm just like I like alcohol and sugar and you know, like like desserts and and just like really like heavy carb heavy meals like just really just affect me in a way they didn't used to.

370
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,880
You know, I'm just not a young man anymore.

371
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,460
So I just I feel my body taking a toll.

372
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,180
But it's also like not even just intestinal distress.

373
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,500
Sometimes it's like just like headaches or just like fatigue.

374
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,240
You know what I mean?

375
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:42,980
Yeah, sure.

376
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,380
Yeah.

377
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,560
I also had a little bit of a bag of candy after I went to tooth sums from its sugar.

378
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,680
More candy.

379
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,340
Just a little bit.

380
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,080
How much of the milkshake did you drink?

381
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,460
Half, I would say.

382
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,020
Okay.

383
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,920
There was antics in the bathroom too.

384
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,760
I was trying to wash it out.

385
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,960
So that you could because you had to.

386
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,880
I want to take it home.

387
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,840
The amazing jar again because you could get that on Instagram.

388
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,920
Imagine like, whoa, he got a jar.

389
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,860
Did he go to the jar store for it?

390
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,740
No dessert came in there.

391
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,560
It was too much.

392
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,260
I threw it away.

393
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,460
I threw the whole cup away.

394
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,280
I tried.

395
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:13,640
I waited.

396
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,540
I waited outside the bathroom so no one was in there and I went in there and tried to rinse it off.

397
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:23,760
But the whipped cream was stuck so thoroughly to the side of the plastic glass that it wouldn't easily rinse off.

398
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,800
So only pieces of the whipped cream were like falling off the glass.

399
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,760
And then that doesn't like rinse easily.

400
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,140
You kind of have to scoop that up.

401
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,300
And then I banned a chip like pretty quickly.

402
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,360
I was like, not worth it.

403
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,420
I threw it away and went straight to the sugar.

404
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,640
It's sugar store.

405
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,340
Good for you.

406
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,260
Thank you.

407
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,500
You didn't salvage that.

408
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,600
I ate the cookie and I had like half the shake.

409
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,840
And again, it was fine.

410
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,240
It was fine.

411
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,340
That's a bad.

412
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,400
The praise.

413
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,920
You're singing on a mountain top.

414
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:49,780
Fine.

415
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,500
Fine.

416
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:55,300
That is the pitch of a great review of a meal.

417
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,640
Well, it's nice to commiserate on this point a little bit.

418
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,680
And there's one more thing.

419
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,740
We haven't even checked in with the Sector Keeper to get the official word on what we're doing.

420
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:13,640
But one quick thing before we get to that, we have met a lot of fun, interesting characters while we've been doing this.

421
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:22,680
We've met a lot of different keepers, not just the Sector Keeper has been with us, but also the Level Keeper a couple of times and the Venice Beach Boardwalk Keeper.

422
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,580
The Keepers who introduced themselves the last time Nick was here at the end of the Downtown Disney ordeal.

423
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,540
And it's been nice to meet so many of them.

424
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:41,140
But there's one, something's been nagging at me because there's one Keeper that it feels like we should have met given what they represent.

425
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,080
And that is the City Walk Orlando Keeper.

426
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,280
Why, if that's what we've been doing, why did we never meet this character?

427
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,740
We freed him at the end of the Downtown Disney ordeal.

428
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,540
He was one of the people we freed.

429
00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:00,460
Well, but he also, well, what he actually did though was imply like stuff we had to go do to help him.

430
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,300
And in fact, Wes, I have a clip.

431
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,360
Can you play this clip?

432
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,800
Let's remember what the City Walk Orlando Keeper was about.

433
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,320
Right, right.

434
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,080
Boys, boys, I'm the Keeper of City Walk Orlando.

435
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:17,960
Professor Tootsam is going to murder me unless you say what's different about our voodoo donuts, Menchies, Cinnabon and Fossil.

436
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,420
They're much different from Hollywood's voodoo donuts, Menchies, Cinnabon and Fossil.

437
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:22,780
No, they're not.

438
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,980
Don't let me die, boys.

439
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,700
No, we can't let them die.

440
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,300
It's not there.

441
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:33,060
So what, it's something where I think we've tied up all the loose ends of this pretty neatly.

442
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,480
So why, that's not anything that we did.

443
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,040
We didn't, Professor Tootsam was not going to commit murder.

444
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:43,540
We didn't even talk to this Keeper at all, who does sound kind of familiar.

445
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,480
Yes, a little bit.

446
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,140
Like he makes something familiar about his voice.

447
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:56,920
Well, my hope was that just to like tie everything up into a nice little package that we maybe could just briefly try to summon the City Walk Orlando Keeper.

448
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,040
Oh yeah, sure, sure.

449
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,620
Let's see if we can do it here.

450
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,160
Let's just like close our eyes.

451
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,760
Why don't we read what's on your shirt actually?

452
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,880
Maybe that's a good way to summon him.

453
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,840
There's coffee stains on this.

454
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,600
Oh good.

455
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,480
Okay, so once you get past the coffee stains, then maybe this will be the way to summon him.

456
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,300
Okay.

457
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,560
I love City Walk.

458
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,240
Boys, boys.

459
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:21,820
Hello?

460
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:22,500
Hello.

461
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,260
Quit bothering me, I'm fucking busy.

462
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,380
Oh, and Weiger?

463
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,100
Fuck you, you piece of shit.

464
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,740
Wait a minute.

465
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:31,760
Hey.

466
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:32,740
Hello?

467
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:33,820
Hello?

468
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,620
What?

469
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,300
He's gone?

470
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,340
That was it.

471
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,080
Huh?

472
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,180
Did I even meet this guy?

473
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,640
What does he have against you?

474
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,200
I guess he listens to the show or is it just like, there's bones to pick based off the show

475
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,660
somehow.

476
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,560
Maybe he was freed by both of those fossil locations being closed down.

477
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,320
Oh, that's right.

478
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,140
That's probably what happened.

479
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,420
That would make sense.

480
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:02,200
It really shows you, boy, how time has passed, what the pandemic did.

481
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:08,480
Oh, it's too bad we didn't get to do the full breakdown of fossil alpha and fossil omega.

482
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,800
And with that guy, who seems very pleasant, I think we could have had a blast.

483
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:19,020
Well, it was not meant to be, but we were luckily with the one that we know, the classic

484
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,920
sector keeper, and we ask him now to give us today's assignment.

485
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:32,320
Boys, boys and wigs, your final assignment is phase seven, sector three, parking garages

486
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,920
and fresh eats.

487
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,780
Good luck, boys and wigs.

488
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,720
There you have it.

489
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,260
Wow.

490
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,520
The parking garage.

491
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,420
The parking garage.

492
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,960
We're a little extra and we'll get into that too.

493
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:49,600
We are back here for another parking garage breakdown with you, Nick Weiger.

494
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:57,900
The tradition on the show, you have only been on this show to discuss mall and kind of theme,

495
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,920
but mainly mall adjacent parking garages.

496
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,260
Right.

497
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,040
And we continue the tradition here today.

498
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,220
Yeah, I'm happy for this to be my beat.

499
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,540
I'm fascinated by infrastructure.

500
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,520
And I do feel like parking garages are important because generally most people are going to

501
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,420
be driving to one of these theme parks in America.

502
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,360
There aren't a lot that have like a great, like a train stop that's right next to the

503
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,180
park that just unfortunately isn't a thing that exists in the United States.

504
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,340
And so it is the first part of your day and the last part of your day.

505
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,660
And if that's a frustrating experience, for instance, my brother recently went to see

506
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,920
a Metallica at SoFi and was just like, it was three hours to get out of there.

507
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,360
And so you got to see a concert and you got to see like this band that you love and you're

508
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,160
excited for it.

509
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,100
And the memory that's lasting is trying to exit the facility.

510
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,600
Like you don't want that to be a bad experience.

511
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,200
So when a place really nails it, it's like, okay, it's like you're landing the plane

512
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,980
effectively.

513
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:58,440
So for me, it's an important part of my theme park experience and my mall experience.

514
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,640
If there's a bad parking structure, I might not be going back to that mall as frequently.

515
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,840
Can you think of one off the top of your head?

516
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,840
You know, that's a great question.

517
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:11,980
I think the Century City Mall does not have a great parking structure.

518
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,340
It's pretty frustrating.

519
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,640
And it sucks because they have a great AMC there and they also have an Eataly.

520
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,120
But just as far as actually getting there, it's like, I'd rather just take the bus than

521
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,380
deal with all that nonsense.

522
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,200
What do you think about the, I don't know how much time you spend around there, but

523
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:33,940
I think the, in our backyard Burbank, the Burbank Mall, triple AMC barrage.

524
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,360
Yeah.

525
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,700
I think it, you know, it's like, it can be hard to navigate and figure out, but if you

526
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,780
know, you have to like have what you do when you go there or else you could end up stuck

527
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,200
in some really grim basement.

528
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,960
Now is, would you call that the town center parking or is this, am I thinking something

529
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,320
different?

530
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,860
I mean, it could be.

531
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,740
That is one parking space you can get.

532
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,860
But there's also, there's like seven odd stray garages.

533
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,840
That's one of the AMC theaters is kind of in the garage.

534
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,800
That's bizarre.

535
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:06,080
It's, I could see it being like a source of stress if you don't know how to play it.

536
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:06,360
Right.

537
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:10,020
It's like if you went to Disney and you were totally on your own for parking, there wasn't

538
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,680
like an attendant redirecting you to like Toy Story parking, like one of the adjunct

539
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:13,960
lots.

540
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,760
It was just like, Oh, I don't know where to go.

541
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,260
You know what I mean?

542
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:22,020
And, and that, that is actually that Burbank, that Burbank area does stress me out parking

543
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,600
wise because I just don't know exactly where to go ever.

544
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,500
And if you're like mapping your way over there, you know, it's like, it's not necessarily

545
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,080
going to direct you to where you're going to park and all.

546
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,280
No.

547
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:32,840
Yeah, exactly.

548
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,960
So it's, so it's like, all of a sudden, yeah, I'm parking in like whatever the town center

549
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,960
a lot near like the Ross or whatever, where Marshall's or whatever it is over there.

550
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,060
And I was going to five guys and I got a 15 minute walk ahead of me.

551
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,140
It's not worth reparking at that point.

552
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,520
You can end up at some weird smelly alley around 100%.

553
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:47,900
Yeah.

554
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:48,320
Yeah.

555
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,520
We know what you're talking about.

556
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:49,940
Yeah.

557
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,320
Yeah.

558
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:50,580
Yeah.

559
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,580
I guess here I am like setting up another saga.

560
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,780
I feel like I just walked right into it.

561
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,300
It's a smelly alley.

562
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:57,740
It's a smelly alley.

563
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,800
It's sector 17.

564
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,720
The Batman statue gets its own episode.

565
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,480
Flappers is right there.

566
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,480
We see Leno and then we do live show there.

567
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:05,780
Yeah.

568
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,680
Hey, Carlson, it's a home run.

569
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,120
I've looked into it.

570
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,020
After you take the standup classes there, of course.

571
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,460
Oh yeah.

572
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,900
We're going to go through one, two, three, four.

573
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:19,360
I've looked into what does it take to play Flappers comedy club where Jay Leno plays frequently.

574
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,120
You have to fill out a big questionnaire and it's like, how many TikTok followers you got?

575
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,120
I think it might be a 10.

576
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,740
Maybe I'm wrong.

577
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,460
I'm judging them wrong.

578
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,100
Well, Jay doesn't have a TikTok.

579
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,260
And they still let him.

580
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:29,620
They let him do it.

581
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,040
But he's legacy media.

582
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,640
We aren't getting there.

583
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,520
At this point.

584
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,440
After all of these sagas, have we done as many episodes as Jay Leno did tonight shows?

585
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,040
It's possible.

586
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,160
Have we been on the air longer than Corden was?

587
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,360
God.

588
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,480
No, he was 2014.

589
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,040
It's close though.

590
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,360
We're going to laugh.

591
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,000
Yeah, we're going to laugh.

592
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,980
I think we'll laugh them.

593
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,840
Fingers crossed.

594
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,160
Or we stop just short of him in honor of his body of work.

595
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,240
Well, we could do that too.

596
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:57,540
Yeah.

597
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,760
I wouldn't hate that.

598
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,180
Any pleasant parking garages in the recent past you haven't discussed?

599
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,340
Is there one that sets the standard?

600
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,920
Oh, good question.

601
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,100
I should have come in hot with a great parking experience top of mind.

602
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,700
I don't hate parking at Universal, honestly.

603
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,860
We're not super far from there.

604
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:30,180
I feel like that's generally an okay experience given the volume of traffic they're dealing with.

605
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,700
I feel like when we talked about it in the original saga, it seemed like kind of a frustrating.

606
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,360
Maybe you've changed your tune on it.

607
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:40,740
Maybe something about the way I forget if ET garage was going then.

608
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,500
I think they've streamlined it.

609
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,680
That's what it feels like.

610
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,300
Also, I have not gone back for a day at the park.

611
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:56,220
I went for one, but mostly I've been going for city walk.

612
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:05,800
It might just be the reforms that have taken place because of COVID and everything and all the lockdowns.

613
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,880
That gave them some time to rejigger things.

614
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,960
I feel like it's a little bit better of an experience than it used to be.

615
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,720
Just the presence of a firehouse subs sports you more at ease in those garages.

616
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,840
That better quality of ingredients than Subway.

617
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,400
But I mean, also my experience with-

618
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,080
Wait, hang on a second.

619
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,740
Jason is still saying this after his girlfriend ate a piece of plastic in their-

620
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,600
No, no, she didn't eat it.

621
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,340
She didn't eat it.

622
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,460
We caught it.

623
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,560
No, we found the plastic.

624
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,540
She didn't choke on plastic.

625
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:40,240
She found plastic, AKA firehouse subs rules.

626
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,560
She found it and then wolfed down the sub.

627
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,880
Just as I wolfed down mine a few hours before.

628
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,360
The finest review is ever given any establishment.

629
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,780
I had firehouse subs while I was up there for toothsome.

630
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,460
You went back.

631
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,700
You guys.

632
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,820
I didn't have it the first time for city food.

633
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,840
I didn't have it before for city food.

634
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,260
Jane, collapse.

635
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,240
I ate a meatball.

636
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,280
I ate a meatball sub at Fido.

637
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,280
Who'd have eaten plastic?

638
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,700
No, I took it out so I could take a picture of it for content.

639
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:16,220
I ate a meatball sub, a toothsome shake, and a bag of candy while I was up there within about 45 minutes of each other.

640
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,880
This is just back in line, back in line.

641
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,500
I'll go there tonight.

642
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,160
I hear plastic and sandwich.

643
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,440
That's the end.

644
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,060
I don't go to this place.

645
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,520
Am I crazy?

646
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,040
It's quitter talk.

647
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,060
I'm Frank Grimesing right now.

648
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,480
I am Frank Grimes.

649
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,320
I know that doesn't end anywhere good.

650
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,820
I'm going to take some of this equipment and electrocute myself.

651
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,140
If we aren't careful.

652
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,220
That would be a hell of a finale.

653
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,200
It might be.

654
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,260
It's where the only place.

655
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,400
By the way, it's the only way out of doing this podcast.

656
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,900
Of any podcast.

657
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,360
That's true too.

658
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:53,700
You know what's maybe a better answer than universal?

659
00:31:54,160 --> 00:32:03,560
I kind of feel like, given again how busy it is and the crush of patrons, I think the Grove's parking structure is pretty good.

660
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,940
I think it's not terrible.

661
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,020
I think it's like a decent experience.

662
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:16,760
I think the way they route you at that sort of spiraling, you know, a driveway that takes you to the upper levels is a pretty elegant solution in terms of just like moving traffic.

663
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,360
And I think it's not terrible getting out of there.

664
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,140
And they have a lot of entrances and a lot of exits, which is always a benefit.

665
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:23,500
Sure.

666
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:33,900
So, you know, it's always a thing of like, yeah, you're going to have a better experience parking at a place that has that's just like mostly an empty lot.

667
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,120
Like you go to a Best Buy that's got a huge surface lot.

668
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,720
That's just going to be easier to park at.

669
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,540
But it's kind of a different category than what we're talking about today.

670
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:46,980
And so something like what the guy, not that I want to give Caruso any credit, but like what the Grove does, I think at their scale is pretty good.

671
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,060
Yeah, yeah.

672
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:55,900
And any of these places that are dealing with like a massive amount of, I think it's what's particularly impressive about the universal ones, at least in theater.

673
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,920
Now we don't know in practice.

674
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,760
I'm not sure the level of frustration of the Universal Orlando garages.

675
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:09,980
But they are getting traffic from two theme parks, City Walk, a water park, which is not the third gate, goddammit.

676
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,860
It's a water theme park.

677
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,460
It doesn't count.

678
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,680
But that's but anyway, they can handle tons and tons.

679
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:24,560
I believe that this entire the entire facility down there can hold over twenty thousand cars.

680
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:32,820
Did you guys see some other numbers which may make Universal Orlando the largest parking complex in America?

681
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:33,700
That's wild.

682
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,540
Yeah, yeah.

683
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:42,900
I think that it is maybe slightly knocked out by the West Edmonton Mall, which is a massive mall in Canada with a theme park component.

684
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:52,780
But like one of the garages specifically, and I'm not sure which, apologies, but one of them is, I think, the fifth largest parking garage in the world.

685
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,920
We're dealing well.

686
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,860
Big stats.

687
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,220
Yeah.

688
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,360
Now, that doesn't tell us the whole story.

689
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,560
What we have to figure out is like quality of experience.

690
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:06,720
And this is honestly a little bit tough because unlike the Woodfield Mall, we did not.

691
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:07,780
We did.

692
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:12,360
It wasn't in the cards for you to come out to only go to the parking garage and then leave.

693
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,880
In hindsight, I should have done it.

694
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,620
I should have just come to the parking garage.

695
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,760
It was discussed.

696
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,140
Yeah, we discussed it.

697
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,100
I should have just made that happen.

698
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:20,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

699
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,220
There was discussion.

700
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,440
We would have made you do something.

701
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,140
Join us for a live show or something.

702
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,740
Although, I don't know, maybe it's turning down.

703
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,040
I don't know.

704
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,340
I got in at 11 a.

705
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:31,440
m.

706
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,780
I'm flying out at six.

707
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:39,380
We'd have to put him up in lodging if he stayed.

708
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,960
First flight in, last flight out.

709
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:46,340
He's going to be in lodging, his car in the parking garage.

710
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,740
Yes, his rental car.

711
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,520
Send us a receipt.

712
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:56,480
Look, that Universal Studios store in the airport has that crazy big wraparound screen.

713
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,000
That's enough themed entertainment to last a lifetime.

714
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:06,900
It's like what happens in that Tiny Tunes, where they go to the theme park and then they just take the monorail around.

715
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,180
Well, that'll do it.

716
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,120
That's all I needed.

717
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,020
It can be possible in some places.

718
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,860
But anyway, I think what we really have to judge is quality of experience here.

719
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,060
And it's a little bit tough because, look, we flew in.

720
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,120
We stayed at the hotels.

721
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,600
We were there, yeah.

722
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,060
None of us have parked at this parking garage.

723
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,400
So we have to analyze some other things, some reviews, some statistics.

724
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,820
I think one element to talk about that might help us is price.

725
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,200
This is certainly a factor.

726
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,240
Thirty dollars is what we're dealing with.

727
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,420
Thirty dollars!

728
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,060
Do we have any reaction to that?

729
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,120
Not even in comparison to anything else.

730
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,660
Oh, I was going to compare it to here.

731
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,360
It's thirty-two dollars out here.

732
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,340
That's good.

733
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:48,900
Oh, jeez.

734
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:55,080
Well, then they upcharge you for the horrible tacos, but then you make that money.

735
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,760
You make it back on the parking.

736
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,520
Thirty dollars is kind of the case across the board.

737
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:08,720
I have been in this parking garage as a child and adolescent because, you know, for the first few times,

738
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,680
my family went to Universal Florida.

739
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,180
It was just a flat surface lot.

740
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:13,620
Right.

741
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:20,160
And then they built up this garage as they were opening City Walk and Islands of Adventure.

742
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,640
So it was very exciting to go through this parking garage and hear, live in La Vida Loca.

743
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,540
And like, what is waiting for us?

744
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,900
We saw the previous center.

745
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,520
We're going to see it in person.

746
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,480
You remember live in La Vida Loca.

747
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:41,500
I specifically have a memory of being in this garage and hearing, living La Vida Loca,

748
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:46,040
being on, I'm sure we'll get to it at some of the moving walkways,

749
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:51,020
which are a big element of this garage, unlike all the other ones we've talked about.

750
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,500
Yeah, where you're like, Mother, Mother, I'm about to live La Vida Loca.

751
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,880
We're all going to be living La Vida Loca.

752
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,760
I really like that it's a structure.

753
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,640
And that seems like a positive reform, turning it from a surface lot into a structure,

754
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,940
because that's one thing that drives me nuts from an infrastructure perspective,

755
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,240
is when I'll see an aerial shot of a stadium,

756
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,240
and you'll see the square footage that's occupied by the stadium,

757
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:18,000
and then all the surface parking around it, like outside the Kansas City football stadium or whatever.

758
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,640
And it's like five times as much surface areas for surface parking.

759
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,280
And so you build up, not out.

760
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:27,560
And if you can do that, it's much more efficient.

761
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,940
I agree with you 100%, but I've learned,

762
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,520
so Universal's working on this Epic Universe Park down the road,

763
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,080
and that's going to have a surface lot to begin with.

764
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,080
And I think that's the easiest way to get parking quickly.

765
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,080
And I think down the line, maybe a garage will be coming.

766
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,080
Yeah, that makes sense.

767
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,000
I mean, last time I went to Legoland, which was like 10 years ago,

768
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,900
I remember it all being a surface lot.

769
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,020
I don't know if that's changed or not.

770
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,940
I was there just several days ago, and that is the case.

771
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:02,640
And it is a bummer at the end of the day to now walk all the way.

772
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,560
They're in that, I keep Simpsons referencing,

773
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,800
but they're in that itchy and scratchy land, kind of like, so we're in D.

774
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,220
Yeah.

775
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,160
There's really no thing.

776
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,980
It's like the D Marketers are not really anything.

777
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,480
And yeah, bummer to have to walk a mile or whatever it is after your theme park day.

778
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,420
But yeah, I think you're right, Jason.

779
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:24,920
It's like the sign that phase two of the resort or park has happened

780
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:35,100
that now we're building up, which this thing landed like it's a really impressive parking garage visually, I have to say.

781
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:35,620
Oh my God, it's wild.

782
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,800
Wes, do we have pictures?

783
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,020
Can we pull up some of the photos I sent?

784
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,780
If you look at just like the foliage and then that dome there.

785
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,420
It's very appealing.

786
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,480
Yeah, I think there's an aesthetic.

787
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:52,260
It reminds me of like the big facilities in Jurassic Park where it like scares me a little bit.

788
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,240
It intimidates me.

789
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:59,140
It's like I think a parking garage can like add to the story if you're like, are you scared at the top of your day?

790
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,560
Are you partying like with Liv and Livia Loca?

791
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,580
Do we have Jurassic Park 2?

792
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:04,900
That's another one.

793
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:12,300
I think good landscaping, good foliage is a good, I just really got a Jurassic Park vibe out of here.

794
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,100
It's very similar to Mickey and Friends and Pixar Pals.

795
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,040
It looks like it's decayed a little more from this photo.

796
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,940
But other than that, it looks very similar to the Disneyland parking situation.

797
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,800
Yeah, yeah.

798
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:29,060
Now, while we're still looking at photos, Wes, if we could pull up parking characters one.

799
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,660
And this is where we can learn who is.

800
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,300
So there's two giant lots and you get you split into two different directions.

801
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,360
And so I think that I forget if it's north or south.

802
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,500
Oh, here we go.

803
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:41,860
South.

804
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,380
These are the south characters.

805
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,860
Cat in the Hat, E.

806
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,180
T.

807
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,560
and Spider-Man.

808
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,740
The big three.

809
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

810
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:54,200
When you think universal or things they have at least temporary deals with.

811
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,280
And then parking characters two will show us the others.

812
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,280
King Kong, Jurassic Park and Jaws.

813
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:05,000
So that has a little bit more coherence.

814
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,100
Like it's like the first three are just kind of a grab bag.

815
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,840
But these are all like, OK, these are big scary monster franchises.

816
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,280
Yes.

817
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,260
They'll kill you.

818
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:13,680
Yeah.

819
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:14,820
These three.

820
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,840
I also like that.

821
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,180
Can we pull up the photo?

822
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,280
Remember Jaws.

823
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,580
This is the way that they help you remember where you're supposed to go.

824
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,080
This just leads to the strange phrasing.

825
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,460
Remember Jaws.

826
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,860
Yes, I do.

827
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,960
Like a fallen hero.

828
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,800
Never forget Jaws.

829
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,280
You may have forgotten.

830
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,860
Like a decade, over a decade at this point.

831
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,300
The Jaws ride has been going.

832
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:45,560
It's like the statue of Superman they put up in Batman versus Superman after he's killed.

833
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,480
Someone spray paints a false god on the Jaws.

834
00:40:54,760 --> 00:41:02,060
So, I mean, is South Garage hurt at all in your estimation by the incoherence of the characters?

835
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:07,800
No, because I think those are, you know, it's what I think is good about the characters.

836
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,080
I think the kids will help.

837
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,920
It will help them remember them.

838
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,240
I know E.

839
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,400
T.

840
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,220
, I know Cat in the Hat.

841
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,760
And that seems like it's probably, I'm not a parent, but I imagine that could be a fun thing.

842
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,280
Like, remember we parked in the Spider-Man lot.

843
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,720
You give them a job.

844
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:21,460
Exactly.

845
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:21,700
Yeah.

846
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

847
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:27,320
But also then like this day and age, you're obviously going to take a picture with your smartphone anyway.

848
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,740
So like just that iconography is a little bit cleaner than, you know, I parked in A23 or whatever.

849
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,540
Sure, sure.

850
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,060
And I like the, I remember, honestly, does jog your memory a bit.

851
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,540
It does.

852
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:37,700
Yeah.

853
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,820
Sometimes you go, oh, I'll remember, don't worry.

854
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:52,180
But if you say remember, it's like at the end of Star Trek II when Spock is dying and he puts his hand and he mind melds with McCoy and he says, remember, it's the same thing.

855
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,260
It's the same principle.

856
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,020
It's the same exactly thing.

857
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,700
So now you're mind melding with that sign.

858
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,360
That sign.

859
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:56,760
Yeah.

860
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,360
Sign mind melding.

861
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,020
Yeah.

862
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:04,760
You got to take that smartphone picture because I've definitely gotten lost in Mickey and Friends.

863
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,680
Scott and I got lost once together.

864
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,020
Yeah.

865
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,480
Oh my God.

866
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,640
And it took forever.

867
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,640
And that was really bad.

868
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,420
We actually, yeah.

869
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:22,560
Calling, calling helped because they said, oh, at the time of day that you came in, we were loading on this level in these rows.

870
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:22,880
Yeah.

871
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,280
And it was very helpful.

872
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:35,580
And I believe the Universal Garage has the like blue light, the college campus blue light that you can call for information, not just panic.

873
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:40,460
You know, though there's yeah, I'm sure plenty of panic has occurred in these places, too.

874
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,360
They are giant.

875
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:48,060
They if you like we got to wander, got to the privilege of wandering the parking garage with the level keeper.

876
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:48,520
Oh, yeah.

877
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,180
And the like when you're out on the furthest end, you real like, boy, that was a that was a long walk.

878
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,360
We walked a ton.

879
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:54,960
Yes.

880
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:55,380
Yes.

881
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,980
To try to see everything.

882
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:57,540
Yeah.

883
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:57,880
Yeah.

884
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,440
Really every nook and cranny of it.

885
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,300
Now, actually, you know, why don't we let's look at parking overhead.

886
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:03,860
Yeah.

887
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:07,560
That'll really show you the some of the full weight of it.

888
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:14,240
And this this bridge construct here, you've got two little ones that lead you to one big one.

889
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,880
I think I stole this diagram from something called David's Coin Travels.

890
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,200
Thank you, David.

891
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,140
David and for your travels.

892
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,400
So it's it's huge.

893
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,740
But like you feel like you could get your head around it.

894
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:33,840
This isn't like the Hollywood one where like but which which way did I get like everyone leaving from everything that you can do.

895
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:38,020
At Universal Orlando has to go back this way.

896
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,800
So at least generally, you know what you're doing at the end of the day.

897
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,260
Now, let me ask.

898
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,900
And I don't know if this is just a stray icon on this this diagram.

899
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,040
But is this parking structure that Kat and had an E.

900
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:50,280
T.

901
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:55,920
and Spider-Man lot so vast, the south parking structure that there is an Anteans pretzels located in the middle of it?

902
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,360
That's what it looks like.

903
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,020
That's a good question.

904
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,880
That is exactly what the map is showing.

905
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,440
Yeah, I think that's incorrect.

906
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:11,420
I don't think that just like in the in the pure middle, maybe that's just showing you this is where you have to park to walk very far to get the most expensive and bad Anteans of your life.

907
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:17,120
Because it would probably do business like excited kids at the start of the day or exhausted parents at the end of the day.

908
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,360
It's like, oh, it's getting Anteans.

909
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,000
What if it was a roaming vendor?

910
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,540
That's a great idea for any park.

911
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,460
Yeah, it really is.

912
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:23,900
Yeah.

913
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:30,540
People would definitely take them up on what they do have, though, in the little announcement at the top.

914
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:33,400
We heard parking garages and fresh eats.

915
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,940
Can we look at fresh eats?

916
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:39,060
There is a food stand in this parking garage.

917
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,320
Wow, so it is true.

918
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:40,640
Okay.

919
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,940
It's kind of in the like the bridge area that connects everything.

920
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,860
Got it, because it looks like it's two big structures and then there's kind of a central walkway.

921
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,440
Like they they they they they they meet at a hub.

922
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:51,980
Yes.

923
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,460
And then from there you progress on to the theme park property.

924
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:55,020
Exactly.

925
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,420
And in the hub, they do all the security screening, which is a pretty robust process.

926
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,300
It feels very airport, very TSA.

927
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:05,140
The buses also load out sort of right down that way as well.

928
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,440
Yes, I watched a video about this.

929
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,460
The resort buses are on the bottom floor and ride shares on the top now.

930
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,860
Ride shares now takes up the entire top floor of one.

931
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:22,600
I want to say the south garage, but don't quote me on that, which has always seemed decently efficient when I've done it.

932
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:27,920
So we're actually able to talk food here a little bit, because I had one of the ice pops,

933
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,040
which is the menu that we're looking at right now.

934
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,520
It's gelato pops.

935
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,780
There are several ways you can customize your ice pops.

936
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,340
You can dip it, drizzle it or dredge it.

937
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,180
The mildly confusing through the swamp.

938
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:41,940
What is that?

939
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:46,580
Well, the way OK, the lot of see if everybody likes and approves of this logic.

940
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:52,280
Dipping is like the miles in my local version of it, like a Balboa bar, which is in Norwich County,

941
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:56,200
where you you you dip it in milk chocolate and that stays a hard shell.

942
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,000
And you can then attach other things.

943
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,200
Drizzle it is syrup.

944
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:05,240
Those are the options under drizzle and dredge it is peanuts, Oreos, scram cracker crumbs.

945
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:10,560
So like hard items and candies go under dredge.

946
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:15,940
Maybe this is working for them, but I feel like they fell in love with the alliteration and made it more confusing.

947
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,600
Because I dipping is basically the same as dredging.

948
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,160
It's just the dry ingredients versus wet ingredients.

949
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:29,980
And then and then dip dipping it versus drizzling like I can kind of see some daylight there, but they're still like kind of similar.

950
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,460
I feel like just select toppings and then just like a big list of toppings.

951
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,760
We get the job done the same way.

952
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:40,360
But then again, maybe what this does, these sub menus as they incentivize people to be like, oh, I'll do a dip and a drizzle.

953
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:44,500
You know, maybe people all of a sudden get two sixty nine cent toppings instead of just one.

954
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,540
I mean, I just like that theme park menu board has the word dredge on it.

955
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,380
That's right.

956
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:52,880
I like it.

957
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,320
But it is it is like a it's like a depressing.

958
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,820
Yeah, it doesn't it doesn't sound delicious.

959
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,500
It makes you think so.

960
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,780
I think of Corpse Retrieval.

961
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,380
It doesn't make you think of like many M&Ms.

962
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:03,080
Yeah.

963
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,080
Now, was I not answering my phone?

964
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:11,820
I'm sure I would have liked to try some dredge.

965
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,180
You would have like to dredge something up.

966
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,920
Oh, I would have said, yeah, dredge it all the way.

967
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,440
Dredge me up, boys.

968
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,980
Like a Chicago hot dog.

969
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,260
I want the full garden.

970
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:27,200
This garden is mostly corn syrup in different forms.

971
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:30,240
Yeah, I think you were out of commission for that period.

972
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:38,180
We're saving you a full walk through all of the parking garages, which if you can imagine was a little bit taxing.

973
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:44,720
The I got to say, I liked these pops in a series full of bad and disappointing treats.

974
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:50,500
Maybe I like because I have no previous notions of fresh eats.

975
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,800
You know, I can't.

976
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,760
It's not like I had one once and now I'm going to have the worst fresh eats ever.

977
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:56,800
Like, I don't know.

978
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,400
It's in the parking garage.

979
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,700
So my you know, my guess of the quality is in the basement already.

980
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:06,880
So it really surprised me that it was a pretty solid.

981
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,100
I mean, to get a good dessert in the parking garage.

982
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:14,700
Well, it's so smart because you can either get it right away or like at the end of the night.

983
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,460
Maybe you were regretting I should have gotten some before we left.

984
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:23,660
And then you see it there and then you get a little treat on the way in the car or on the bus or in the like, it's very smart.

985
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:28,300
I'm surprised that Disney doesn't have it because Disney has a bunch of room at Mickey and Friends and Pixar pals.

986
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:32,300
First, I could put something there like there's enough room for something.

987
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:33,900
I'm glad you brought this up.

988
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:37,760
So was fresh eats by the souvenir stand?

989
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:38,720
Yes, it was.

990
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:40,420
Let's see a picture of that too.

991
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:43,280
Can we see West's garage store?

992
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:49,740
Because this is a thing that has I've always associated like it was it's been there for a while.

993
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:55,640
And I'm shocked Disney has not adopted the last minute garage souvenir stand.

994
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,800
They might have carts.

995
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:02,180
They may have carts and maybe for like glow sticks and things kids want at the end of the day.

996
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:05,440
But here, Universal has stacked some of the best items.

997
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:11,340
I own one of that like retro rain hoodie, whatever you want to call it.

998
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:14,060
Yeah, it's really good.

999
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:18,480
And then those fanny packs or the straps say ride the movies.

1000
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:19,300
Those are cool.

1001
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,320
Yeah, I become a big time man bag guy these days.

1002
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:29,160
Basically, a mutual friend, Zacharino, got me into it and I would definitely sport one of those.

1003
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,000
They're very snazzy.

1004
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:30,360
Yeah.

1005
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:36,560
Is that the term that you have you tossed aside fanny pack and any associations with that phrase?

1006
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:40,400
Well, so for instance, this one I brought with me is more of a shoulder bag.

1007
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,460
So, you know, I think it's kind of a catch-all term.

1008
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,740
But, you know, whatever, they're handbags.

1009
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:45,940
I find them very convenient.

1010
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,280
That's a good size.

1011
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,260
That seems like not super cumbersome.

1012
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,200
That's exactly what you need.

1013
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,160
So a good I think a good store.

1014
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,860
I think a good I had a good treat there.

1015
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:57,400
Yeah.

1016
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,100
I haven't found the security to be terribly inconvenient.

1017
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,780
Does anyone have stories that negate?

1018
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,420
Well, no, I don't have anything to negate it.

1019
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,700
But I got there one day and I was taking the bus in.

1020
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:15,180
So I would come in on the bus area and then even at times when there would be like an insane amount of people and I was like, oh, man, this is going to be 45 minutes.

1021
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,580
It was like less than 15.

1022
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,040
It was less than 10 maybe even.

1023
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:22,660
So like they were they had figured out a system to get the funnel people in pretty quickly through security.

1024
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,480
So I was never really like upset with what they had what they were doing.

1025
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,140
I feel like it was pretty efficient.

1026
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:31,200
And then once you get past that, you get moving walkways.

1027
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,380
This is Jason's a big series of walking walkways.

1028
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,420
You can gain some steam if you're running late for something.

1029
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,800
I was at one point you can really like pick up the pace there.

1030
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:45,320
Yeah, I love move ever since I was a kid and was first at an airport.

1031
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,600
I was like, oh, my God, it's like an escalator, but it's flat.

1032
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,000
Yeah.

1033
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:56,340
So I I kind of like internally light up when I see a moving walk.

1034
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:56,980
It's fun.

1035
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,440
I love a moving walkway.

1036
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,520
Do you are you a standard or are you like a fast walker?

1037
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,520
Like what is your general general approach?

1038
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,400
Good question.

1039
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:13,920
I would say a standard, especially if I have luggage to try to navigate luggage on those things isn't exactly easy.

1040
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,000
Yeah, sure.

1041
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,720
I'm not against standing, but I do like to feel like I'm fast.

1042
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,480
It's fun to have the super stride.

1043
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,900
Yeah, yeah, that is fun.

1044
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,560
So that's yeah, but I will stand.

1045
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,600
Sometimes I stand.

1046
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:33,680
So when you're on that moving walkway and you're hearing by Lemos, we're a year later now.

1047
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,020
OK, they wrote it out.

1048
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:37,640
Different living Lovita local.

1049
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,600
I look this up because I'm like, could I be confusing the songs?

1050
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:47,800
And I was like, no, I think one year it was living Lovita local and the next year it was by Lemos.

1051
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,320
And you remember what was this is just to show me.

1052
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,580
OK, because you love moving so strong and you love these theme parks so much.

1053
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,540
You have every detail locked in.

1054
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,240
Yes, because I like that.

1055
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,260
And I didn't like freshman year of high school.

1056
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,100
So I really hone in on the theme park stuff.

1057
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,760
I feel really similar.

1058
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:12,360
I don't think I liked anything that happened to me any day of that year.

1059
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:12,820
Yeah.

1060
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:16,280
And then I went to Universal at the end and I locked in forever.

1061
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,520
And now I do this.

1062
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,320
Yeah.

1063
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:21,640
Me too.

1064
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:26,420
I felt much more less had my sea legs.

1065
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:37,100
Yeah, once you know the ropes a little bit, because because that all that, you know, my understanding is that there was a time when what we what we now call middle school was junior high school.

1066
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,820
And that was like six through ninth grades or something.

1067
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:42,900
And then 10th through 12th was just high school.

1068
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,760
There was a point where they added ninth grade.

1069
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:50,640
I definitely felt like a little too young for the high school kids as a ninth grader.

1070
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:57,060
That might be the biggest age difference you're ever other than like, but if you're a kindergartener, you're not really around the fifth grade.

1071
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,700
Yeah, you're in a different part of the playground.

1072
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:07,760
And it's a little different just being kind of thrown in that pool when you're like 14 and you're like, they're legal adults you're sharing the campus with.

1073
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:08,540
Strange.

1074
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,560
Yeah, absolutely.

1075
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:14,760
That's why you cling to the memories of pop music that was playing at a theme park.

1076
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,360
And then you'll be reliving it in the nursing home.

1077
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:27,740
OK, so the nurses later freshman year, mostly leaning on theme parks and comic books.

1078
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:32,920
Sophomore year, a little more stable junior year and got really got my sea legs.

1079
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,720
Parents divorce finalized.

1080
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,860
We got the shared custody down pat.

1081
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,440
Then 9-11 happens.

1082
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,740
And so we're a little off kilter.

1083
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,260
So but back to theme park.

1084
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,980
It gave you one of your favorite things to do, which is to define your life and everything that's ever happened in relationship to 9-11.

1085
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:49,940
Yeah.

1086
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:51,780
Hey, wait a minute.

1087
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,540
It's set up a lifelong hobby.

1088
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:56,380
And that's what you're going to be telling the nurses.

1089
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:01,060
No, no, no, we have COVID to lean on now.

1090
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:07,360
Because you like your wind ups you like and the date on that March 15th, 2020.

1091
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,520
That's right.

1092
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:11,940
That's true.

1093
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:22,620
So we're just looking at you're just I'm just realizing we're looking into our future and I'm just thinking about like my you know, my my my grandmother, my my late grandmother, Joe R.

1094
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:22,700
P.

1095
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:22,700
I.

1096
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:33,620
who like, you know, was like raised in an orphanage, lived through the World War, you know, lived through like the Spanish food, like lived through like this, the all the civil rights movement, like like a century of turmoil.

1097
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:36,920
And then like she's in her 80s and we're just like sitting down with her at El Torito.

1098
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,280
And it's just like this is what your life ended up as.

1099
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,460
Like that's that's the preview of where I'm going to be.

1100
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:45,400
I'm just going to be like the old guy in the chain restaurant with his loved ones.

1101
00:54:45,420 --> 00:55:02,640
And it's just like like like, oh, yeah, not that I'd be a grandpa, but like like the old old great uncle Nick is, you know, lived through COVID and lived through 9-11, you know, telling them all like I used to make my living coming to places like this.

1102
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,640
Yeah, sure.

1103
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,800
I was talking about that thing again.

1104
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,900
We all make our livings doing this, grandpa.

1105
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,360
That's what the economy is.

1106
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,520
The only job left.

1107
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,060
Your podcast or you drive an Uber.

1108
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,760
Let's order the wagon wheel sampler.

1109
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:23,900
So I feel like we're getting a pretty good impression of the sparking garage, actually.

1110
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:27,260
You know, just from outside, you know, I'm impressed by the size.

1111
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:29,660
The price is not the worst out there.

1112
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,160
Actually, what's Disney now?

1113
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:32,560
Disney, I have the stat.

1114
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:35,040
Disney, I think is 35.

1115
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:36,760
So less than that.

1116
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,360
Concerts are $40 now, like depending.

1117
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:41,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1118
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,760
No, usually, you know, everything's getting NFL games.

1119
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,180
I've heard can be like $100.

1120
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:48,540
Like there's some serious gouging that happens for these huge events.

1121
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:51,520
And I know from, you know, because I am an NBA fan.

1122
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:55,960
I'll go to the Lakers games and I usually take the train to downtown L.

1123
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:56,360
A.

1124
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:01,860
But I know the parking structures there can really gouge, like especially the ones right next to the stadium.

1125
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:03,200
Those can be like 50 bucks.

1126
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:04,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1127
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:04,800
Really right.

1128
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,420
I'm swearing that one.

1129
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,400
I never in L.

1130
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:07,600
A.

1131
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:07,980
live.

1132
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,780
Oh, we've talked about doing that though before.

1133
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,400
That would be.

1134
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,080
Yeah.

1135
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,740
I have no memory of L.

1136
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,100
A.

1137
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:13,920
live is awful.

1138
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,300
Is Tom's Urban still there?

1139
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:19,380
Look, I would love it, but it would also actively discourage you from doing that for your own sanity.

1140
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:19,800
L.

1141
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:19,880
A.

1142
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:20,720
live is awful.

1143
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,600
Yes, you're there more.

1144
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,320
That's OK Times at L.

1145
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:24,380
A.

1146
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:24,600
live.

1147
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:25,380
You know.

1148
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,680
Where have you had OK Times at L.

1149
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:28,780
A.

1150
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:28,900
live?

1151
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,240
Tom's Urban, Yards.

1152
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:31,020
Tom's Urban.

1153
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,400
You've had fun at Tom's Urban?

1154
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,320
I said OK Times.

1155
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,460
OK, I've had the Smashburger.

1156
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,140
What's that Smashburger place they have there?

1157
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:37,940
Is that still there?

1158
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,200
I think it is just a Smashburger.

1159
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,040
Is it called Smashburger?

1160
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:40,960
Yeah, I think it is.

1161
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,560
I crammed that in before a Monday Night Raw once.

1162
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,580
That was an OK Times.

1163
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,300
Gulp it down like a duck or something.

1164
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,500
I'd love to spend three hours talking about it.

1165
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,340
It would be interesting to see by the time you cover L.

1166
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:52,460
A.

1167
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,520
live what the Peacock Theater would be called.

1168
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:54,860
Oh, yeah.

1169
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,740
Because it was the Microsoft Theater and now it's the Peacock Theater.

1170
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,100
Yeah, yeah.

1171
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,620
It will be something else in a few years.

1172
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:00,100
Yeah, we'll see.

1173
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:06,220
And by then, will they fix what I just heard about, which are a glut of typos on the Kobe Bryant statue?

1174
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,320
Oh, yes, yeah.

1175
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,460
How embarrassing.

1176
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:15,160
Yeah, there was a player, Vaughn Wafer, who they spelled his name Vom Wafer.

1177
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:16,680
And then they…

1178
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,760
Is that what a name sounds like?

1179
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,380
Has anyone ever been named Vom?

1180
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,420
That's what we've been doing during this saga, is bombing.

1181
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,960
I think they also misspelled the phrase, Coach's Decision.

1182
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,120
But they left some letters out.

1183
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:36,060
Yeah, and also that actually led me down a rabbit hole because I was looking into how these statues are made.

1184
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:44,140
It's like one of those things where there's this weird cabal where it's like one married couple in Chicago who does the entire world of sports trophies.

1185
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:45,620
Or I mean statues.

1186
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:50,380
So if there's a statue of Lionel Messi somewhere, they'll be like…

1187
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:53,900
They go to this one couple in Chicago and they're the only people who made it.

1188
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,580
And they're the people who made the Kobe statue too.

1189
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:55,980
Oh, wow.

1190
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:59,960
But yeah, it's just like a business that they fully control.

1191
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,480
Yeah.

1192
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:01,640
But not the plaques?

1193
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,580
Are the plaques outsourced to AI or something?

1194
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:05,660
That's a great question.

1195
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,860
Yeah, I mean, I don't know if they're responsible for the plaques themselves.

1196
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:10,580
Great question.

1197
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,900
But all the power is concentrated with these two.

1198
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:13,420
Wow.

1199
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,480
We'll look into that during the LA Live Saga.

1200
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,340
Look, make these decisions.

1201
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,360
Let's get out of this one before we make any decisions about another one.

1202
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:24,800
What's the bowling alley they have there?

1203
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:27,460
Oh, that's a good question.

1204
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,080
It's there and I don't remember.

1205
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,340
Isn't the same one they have at Hollywood?

1206
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,120
Is it one of those?

1207
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,100
I can't remember the name of that chain now.

1208
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:35,680
I don't know.

1209
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,340
I can't remember it so they probably don't have it.

1210
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:38,880
So probably we don't need to go there.

1211
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,760
Oh, I did do the bowling alley with Nick Mundy once.

1212
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:44,420
Yeah, I did do it before, a Monday Night Raw.

1213
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:45,400
What the hell is it called?

1214
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,340
It's like Lane something or it's some sort of…

1215
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:49,780
Lane in the skin.

1216
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,740
Not Bolero?

1217
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:52,340
It's not Bolero.

1218
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:53,160
It's not a Bolero.

1219
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:57,000
It's like Pin Pals, but not that because that's a Simpsons one.

1220
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:58,320
Is it Pins with a Z?

1221
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,460
It might be something like Pins with a Z.

1222
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:01,900
Is it Pins with a Z?

1223
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,540
There are those around.

1224
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,500
There is one of those.

1225
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,140
I can't remember.

1226
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,800
It's a sexier bowling alley than a normal bowling alley.

1227
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:14,220
There was Shaquille's down there, which was Shaq's maybe only good restaurant.

1228
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,540
Maybe his only good business.

1229
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:21,500
But Shaquille's was good and then that place closed and is now a much more generic sounding place.

1230
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,280
It was really good.

1231
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:25,400
Yeah, you had a horrible experience at that Shaq chain.

1232
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,600
At Big Chicken?

1233
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:27,860
Yeah, Big Chicken was gnarly.

1234
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,060
Yeah, dear God.

1235
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,880
Shaq was not on the ball with that one.

1236
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,980
The usual quality standard was not…

1237
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:41,060
Yeah, his Krusty the Clown standard for lending his likeness to products.

1238
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,800
Yeah, proves everything.

1239
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:43,960
He's done it a million times.

1240
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,600
So, all right, we're getting a good impression of this garage, I feel like.

1241
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,720
But what we don't have is enough personal experience.

1242
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:59,700
And not only that, I think this is a failing on our end, Nick, because we didn't force you to come out and experience it yourself.

1243
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:03,180
The first one that you haven't had on the ground experience with.

1244
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:16,840
But it makes you think, what if there was some magical way that you could actually visit the Universal Orlando Parking Garage to walk in the footsteps of Jason on the moving walkway,

1245
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:20,580
hearing Liv and Lovita Loca to relive his happiest memories.

1246
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:26,240
Wow.

1247
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,700
What if I told you there was such a way?

1248
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,320
What?

1249
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,640
We'll see, we'll see.

1250
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:36,140
At this point, it really, this working out now depends on Dr.

1251
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:36,680
Carlson.

1252
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:37,240
Wow.

1253
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:42,660
Well, I have an artifact here that I've been given by a mysterious benefactor.

1254
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,520
Remember, this is a video episode on Club 3, and this is where I don't really be feeling it.

1255
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,960
Scott and Jason, close your eyes.

1256
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,580
It is three layovers.

1257
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:52,080
Scott and Jason, close your eyes real quick.

1258
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,200
It will get you to where you are.

1259
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:53,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1260
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:54,800
It's leaving right now.

1261
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:55,820
We're putting you in a car.

1262
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,760
Jason, close your eyes, close your eyes.

1263
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:58,660
Jason, close your eyes.

1264
01:00:58,680 --> 01:00:59,520
Scott, you close your eyes.

1265
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,620
Weiger can look, because I don't know if he knows what this is.

1266
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:07,700
But I've been given this mysterious artifact here that I believe has transportation powers.

1267
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:10,520
And I'm going to place this in front of you right now.

1268
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,760
I don't recognize it from the sound.

1269
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,540
I actually probably should turn it around.

1270
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:23,060
Or Weiger, if you could turn it around.

1271
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:24,300
Yeah, I'll turn this towards me.

1272
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:27,280
Please call that a handful of bath salts.

1273
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:27,640
All right.

1274
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,340
Should I describe what I'm looking at or do I do a mystery?

1275
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:32,580
Well, no, now we can say, Jason and Scott, open your eyes.

1276
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,240
Oh!

1277
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:39,940
There is a universal epic universe, Kronos, that is sitting in front of us.

1278
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:50,420
This is a model of the main gate of the new park epic universe, which like this series, is all about portals and jump points and gate holes.

1279
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:02,500
Because a bunch of theme park journalists were sent this, and for some reason we were not on the list.

1280
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,880
We were not given this, and we were furious about it, especially me.

1281
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,480
I was very mad that we were not on a mailing list.

1282
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:10,620
But this was given to me, and I really appreciate it.

1283
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,720
And now I finally, this is why, this is why we have it.

1284
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:16,760
Wow, we needed to wait in order to make this happen.

1285
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,960
This is like the Multiverse of Madness' dial of destiny.

1286
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:21,200
Very much so.

1287
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,960
It's called a Kronos.

1288
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,360
Well, that's not the last property that we're going to bring into this.

1289
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:31,380
Because what if I told you that when you touched this Kronos of destiny,

1290
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:41,440
that it will enable the first ever transmultiversal link to an avatar in Orlando?

1291
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,760
I'd say, wow, that's really something.

1292
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:47,140
If there's ever a time for a while.

1293
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:49,560
Well, this is not just science theory.

1294
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:50,740
This is science fact.

1295
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:56,560
We have an avatar waiting in Orlando that should be a match for your DNA.

1296
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:57,320
This avatar's…

1297
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:00,340
Well, only one way to…

1298
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,080
Oh, wait, actually.

1299
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,880
We're going to have to test this to make sure.

1300
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:07,740
Yeah, we have to test it, yeah, to make sure.

1301
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,700
Actually, I have all of his stats.

1302
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:11,940
I have all of the avatar's stats.

1303
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:12,980
Can you just do me a favor?

1304
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,800
Can you just move around a little?

1305
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:15,680
Just move around a little.

1306
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:16,380
Yeah, you would move like…

1307
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:17,660
Just like kind of move around a little.

1308
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:18,780
Move your arms.

1309
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:19,660
Move your arms a little.

1310
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:20,100
Move your arms a little.

1311
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:20,780
Wow.

1312
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,000
Transmultiversal Virusoids.

1313
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:27,280
You've got them.

1314
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,460
Just kidding.

1315
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,560
You're supposed to have them.

1316
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,960
You need them to make it work.

1317
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:33,480
Oh, that's a relief.

1318
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:34,720
It's a fun little thing.

1319
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:39,340
Anyway, it does seem like your DNA is going to be a match to our avatar.

1320
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:43,480
Our avatar's name is Kevin Tully from a band called Telethon.

1321
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:45,020
We brought him up a bunch lately.

1322
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:47,340
We met him when we were down in Orlando.

1323
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:49,020
He volunteered.

1324
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:52,440
He signed up to be part of this groundbreaking avatar program.

1325
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:57,740
And he is waiting to make the link.

1326
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:04,440
So I think what we have to do first is have you put your hands on the chronos.

1327
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,240
Kind of straddle the base of it.

1328
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1329
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:09,160
Just really, yeah, just cup the base of the…

1330
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:12,260
Down at the bottom, below the shaft of the chronos.

1331
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:16,900
Yeah, a lot of people don't pay attention to the base, but you got to make sure it'll work the base.

1332
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:17,380
Yeah, yeah.

1333
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:20,020
If you want to give the tip a little tap, maybe tap the tip.

1334
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:20,180
Yeah, sure.

1335
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,380
I'll give a little tap for good luck.

1336
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:23,000
A lot of people forgot to tap the top.

1337
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:23,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1338
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:24,980
That's a common mistake.

1339
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:26,420
There's feelings in all of the chronos.

1340
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:27,420
So make sure you're doing it.

1341
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:34,380
Okay, so with that, why don't we have you count backwards in Navi, which is of course,

1342
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:37,980
Quixemunea.

1343
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:39,600
Quixemunea.

1344
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:40,540
Quixemunea.

1345
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:41,000
Okay, here we go.

1346
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:41,820
See if we can make the link.

1347
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:49,700
Whoa.

1348
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,280
Whoa, there he is.

1349
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:56,780
I think the link has worked.

1350
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:58,900
It's Kevin Tully, our avatar.

1351
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:01,820
Hello.

1352
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:02,560
Hi.

1353
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:03,160
Hi, Kevin.

1354
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:06,200
Sorry, this is all very surprising to me.

1355
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:08,000
You didn't know it was coming?

1356
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:12,320
Well, I mean, I kind of did, but I didn't know it would feel like this.

1357
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:13,520
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1358
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:16,180
Now that you have all those feelings coursing through your veins.

1359
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:19,220
Well, that's because we touched the tip of the top and cupped the base.

1360
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:23,880
That's also just the general specter of Weiger I think you're dealing with.

1361
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:24,640
Right.

1362
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:30,520
And actually, I could kind of feel sensory vibrations as you were doing that.

1363
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:35,360
It felt a little weird inside my whole body, honestly.

1364
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:39,820
I feel like I'm being possessed by somebody.

1365
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:40,840
Whoa, whoa.

1366
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:45,900
It's different.

1367
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:51,840
It's not a traditional avatar system and it's not a being John Malkovich because you remain alive.

1368
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:56,080
But you guys are now, at least we're starting to form the cosmic bond.

1369
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:08,020
Right, right, exactly.

1370
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:12,740
And I've been really excited to do this.

1371
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:13,040
Yeah.

1372
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:18,040
And it's an honor to be asked to partake.

1373
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:23,420
You know, and it's been great to get to know you guys and become friends with you.

1374
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,580
I'm a fan first and foremost.

1375
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:35,040
And, you know, logistically, concrete parking structure is a really good place to have a FaceTime call on a podcast.

1376
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:35,480
Right.

1377
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:36,280
Perfect.

1378
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,200
A really flawless cell reception.

1379
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:39,000
Yeah.

1380
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:48,580
Most of your labor has been like outsmarting and hiding from universal heavies who are like, you can't be doing this.

1381
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:49,940
You can't be here.

1382
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:51,860
That's correct.

1383
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:57,960
And I do have one trepidation, though, that I haven't vocalized.

1384
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:02,460
And I wanted to be transparent with you guys about what that is.

1385
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:06,400
And I think like now that Weiger's in me.

1386
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:06,800
Yeah.

1387
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:10,680
What if he gets stuck?

1388
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:22,460
What if it's a meet Dave or like, you know, Robert Altman's three women sort of deal and like I become Weiger, Weiger becomes me.

1389
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,600
Yeah, that's that's going to create a lot of complications for both of our lives, I'm sure.

1390
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:32,920
You're going to have like a lot of like phantom Taco Bell diarrhea on a daily basis.

1391
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:33,780
Yeah.

1392
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:37,840
You'll feel like you have to shit out like two or three pounds.

1393
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:38,460
Right.

1394
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:39,780
Cheesy, gritty crunches.

1395
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,700
But you won't get so.

1396
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:47,000
It will probably take me a while to realize that anything's different at all.

1397
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:48,200
If that does happen.

1398
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,860
Yeah, that's fine.

1399
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,800
This is why we thought there would be a DNA match.

1400
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,660
We knew that you would be aligned enough in order to make this happen.

1401
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:59,460
You both have enough sour cream in your stomach that it's a match.

1402
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:00,520
Sour cream lining.

1403
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:01,000
Yes.

1404
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:01,920
You're primed.

1405
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,340
Well, I'm a little lactose intolerant.

1406
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:04,980
So no.

1407
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,920
So maybe that'll be the indicator.

1408
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:07,420
OK.

1409
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,160
Should I should I show you your surroundings?

1410
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:14,700
Yes, you're only in front of the wall as far as people watching this on Club 3 and us know.

1411
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:16,200
So let's see where we are.

1412
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:17,020
Wow.

1413
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,260
You guys were back.

1414
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:18,760
Oh, my gosh.

1415
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:19,180
Beautiful.

1416
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:20,600
We're back at City Walk.

1417
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:24,120
We are by the movie theater where I saw Glisten and the Merry Mission.

1418
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,160
There's Quiet Flight Surf Shop.

1419
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:28,280
The thing we had tons to say about.

1420
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,000
Red Oven pizza.

1421
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,640
And you're oh, my God, you're right at the balcony of the public.

1422
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:35,240
Wow.

1423
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:35,940
Look at that.

1424
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:40,480
One of the only well-reviewed establishments of this entire thing.

1425
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,360
That I feel good mojo from that.

1426
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:44,700
Yeah, that'll do thing.

1427
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,180
Nice things for us on our mission here.

1428
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:47,540
Geez.

1429
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,180
How does it feel temperature wise?

1430
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:50,560
What kind of night are we talking?

1431
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:55,000
Well, it's, you know, probably 78 degrees.

1432
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,480
It was raining a little bit.

1433
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,640
I think it probably still is.

1434
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:03,500
Do you feel raindrops on you, Weiger, right now?

1435
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:05,980
Yeah, I do actually feel mildly damp.

1436
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:06,500
Whoa.

1437
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,100
I see it happening.

1438
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,380
Because there's a roof above you.

1439
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:10,900
Right.

1440
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:16,860
I think what it is is that I was just sort of like because earlier it was raining.

1441
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,580
And so it's probably just some dripping from the rooftop.

1442
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:21,540
Clamminess too.

1443
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,140
Yeah, just a general sort of humidity.

1444
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:26,180
You didn't just spill a Mountain Dew on yourself or something?

1445
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:30,080
I mean, yeah, there was some Kirkland sparkling lime.

1446
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:31,600
But yes, I did spill a little bit.

1447
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:36,460
I was about to make a request of something to get a closer look at.

1448
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:38,260
But why am I driving?

1449
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:39,720
That's not how this works.

1450
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:44,640
It is, I think, time to hand over the controls of our avatar.

1451
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:48,000
If I'm saying it, avatar, oh, there's people walking past you.

1452
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,020
They made it out, OK.

1453
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:51,340
This keeps happening.

1454
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:54,660
You're in a heavily trafficked area.

1455
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:58,560
For the listeners, by the way, there's so many people walking by.

1456
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,020
Oh, yeah.

1457
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:02,220
Not more could be happening right now.

1458
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,620
It's the universal heavies.

1459
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:05,660
Oh, yeah.

1460
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:06,740
Looking for you.

1461
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,180
This is why Jason never wanted to record here.

1462
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:11,780
Close out your tab and get out of there.

1463
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:15,780
I think it's time to cede control to our avatar.

1464
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:18,960
If I'm saying it avatar style, I should really say Kevin Tully.

1465
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:23,720
So I think, Weiger, you should take control of Kevin Tully.

1466
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:27,680
I feel like, I guess because we're so parking structure focused here,

1467
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:29,540
that's the order of the day, right?

1468
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,120
We should kind of just head in that direction.

1469
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,360
Oh, this is a good test because you're essentially there.

1470
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,600
You have to judge based on what you're looking at how to get there.

1471
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:45,300
Well, I'll.

1472
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:49,440
OK, yeah, from looking at the surroundings, I'm guessing it's not in the direction of the Bubba Gump.

1473
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:52,100
And I'm guessing it's not in the direction of that big marquee.

1474
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:57,580
I would maybe maybe head towards that big P sign I see in the distance.

1475
01:10:57,580 --> 01:10:57,980
Oh, smart.

1476
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:59,780
Along with some of their vehicle logos.

1477
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:00,560
It's working.

1478
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:01,180
Oh, it's working.

1479
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:02,880
Wow, there he goes.

1480
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,120
I feel it in your feet.

1481
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:06,600
Whoa, wow.

1482
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:10,080
Please, Nick, let me walk faster than this.

1483
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:12,780
Can we see off to the left to walk faster?

1484
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,260
Yeah, pick up the pace a little bit.

1485
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:14,480
Really quick.

1486
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:15,040
Don't slip.

1487
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:15,880
It looks a little slippery.

1488
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,920
Can you just look off to the left at the signs that show everything that we've gotten to do?

1489
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,660
Wow, guys, take it in.

1490
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:23,320
Hard rock, big fire.

1491
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:25,800
So many memories.

1492
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:26,460
Wow.

1493
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,080
Toothsome.

1494
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:29,540
Every single place that made us sick.

1495
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,380
We're looking at it all at once.

1496
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:31,680
BK Whopper Bar.

1497
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:32,860
BK Whopper Bar.

1498
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:34,960
This is really the only place that could have ended.

1499
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:36,400
Every end is a beginning.

1500
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:37,660
Every beginning is an end.

1501
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:38,600
We're learning.

1502
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:39,580
We are learning.

1503
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:44,200
Actually, can we head away from the parking structure and go back to that Bob Marley tribute for freedom?

1504
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,280
No, no, no.

1505
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:50,880
Thanks for your willingness, though.

1506
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:54,140
OK, now, Nick, you have to choose walking or ramp.

1507
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:57,300
We got to do the ramp as long as it's not you're not going to skid on it.

1508
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:00,640
I don't think I'm going to skid on it.

1509
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:00,860
OK, great.

1510
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,120
I guess we'll find out.

1511
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,480
Yeah, this is the moving walkway, right?

1512
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:04,760
We got to experience this.

1513
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:10,240
Did you know that British people call this a travelator?

1514
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,020
That's a great name.

1515
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,400
I actually did not know that.

1516
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:20,120
Well, I was going to ask if I should walk or stand, but I think my decision has been made.

1517
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:21,500
Yeah, I think you're stuck standing.

1518
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,460
We're right in prime getting out of the park time.

1519
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:24,480
This is perfect time.

1520
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:27,900
Well, this is really the test of is it convenient to get out of here or not.

1521
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:30,020
Kevin, did you know?

1522
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:31,380
Oh, there's the mini golf course.

1523
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,720
It looks so cool at night.

1524
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:34,080
I didn't know how cool it looked at night.

1525
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,300
That robot is awesome.

1526
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,660
How about that?

1527
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:41,760
Whoa, it's some perfect mirror.

1528
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:54,780
Kevin, did you know that on the travelator in the year 2000, I'm sorry, 1999, that you were able to actually hear hit of the time, Living La Vida Loca, as a young Jason Sheridan did?

1529
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,620
No, I didn't know that, Scott.

1530
01:12:58,620 --> 01:12:59,520
Well, it's true.

1531
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:00,260
These very speakers.

1532
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:01,420
I'm happy to hear it.

1533
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1534
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:04,800
Kevin, watch out for the end of the travelator.

1535
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,120
Yeah, watch out, Kevin.

1536
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,780
But also, what music is playing right now?

1537
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:12,520
What is the atmospheric track that's playing to the speakers?

1538
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:14,980
Give me one second.

1539
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:25,460
I'm very impressed with that because I needed to do it.

1540
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:30,020
They were playing when I was up at LA City Walk, Post Malone covering a Hootie and the Blowfish song.

1541
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:30,480
Wow.

1542
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:31,580
I only want to be with you.

1543
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,600
I've heard that cover every time I've been up there.

1544
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:35,060
From the Pokemon soundtrack.

1545
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:35,980
Of course.

1546
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:43,240
I don't have a definitive answer, but it kind of sounds like Dying in Your Arms Tonight, but like a modern version of it.

1547
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,760
Maybe it's a Post Malone cover.

1548
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:45,660
I bet that's what it is.

1549
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:47,220
It does kind of sound like that.

1550
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:51,080
It is what City Walk traffic's in, is covers of not that old of songs.

1551
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,500
All right, should we keep going?

1552
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:54,180
Yeah, let's keep going.

1553
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:55,740
Okay, we won't go to valet.

1554
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:57,100
You didn't valet this morning?

1555
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,460
Wouldn't it be cool if I did?

1556
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:00,340
Oh, it would have been.

1557
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:03,860
Should we walk and not do the moving walkway this time?

1558
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:05,340
I don't want to tell Mike what to do.

1559
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,020
No, actually, that's a good call.

1560
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:09,560
Let's see what the pedestrian experience is like.

1561
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:10,320
Let's compare speeds.

1562
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:12,220
If you can cut through the traffic, don't get bumped.

1563
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:13,220
Yeah, don't get hurt.

1564
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,960
Kevin, while we're walking, I have a question.

1565
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:23,440
You are the only person on this call right now, on this podcast, who actually has parked in the parking garage.

1566
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:25,580
How was your parking experience today?

1567
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:29,760
My parking experience was a little confusing, Scott.

1568
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:30,600
Uh-oh.

1569
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:36,040
I've done this many times, although I don't typically park at CityWalk.

1570
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:39,680
I have secret places I park that I won't tell you about.

1571
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:40,500
Whoa.

1572
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,180
I don't want to miss my spot.

1573
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:47,100
However, today I drove down.

1574
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,900
I kind of missed the exit because I was a little distracted.

1575
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:56,360
And I ended up by Endless Summer Resort, and I had to do a U-turn.

1576
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,180
And it was a little stressful.

1577
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:04,800
But once I was in, I got in free with my Universal Orlando Annual Pass.

1578
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:16,740
And a nice person named Trey helped me get my priority parking pass that I get as a Universal Orlando Annual Pass holder.

1579
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:20,940
And honestly, it was pretty breezy and easy.

1580
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:23,560
Oh, here we go.

1581
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:27,080
We've arrived at probably the biggest crucial juncture point.

1582
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:30,440
We are now looking at what we looked at earlier in the episode.

1583
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:30,900
Oh, wow.

1584
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:32,340
All of the characters.

1585
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:33,440
There's King Kong.

1586
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:34,860
This is your path, Nick.

1587
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:35,440
Previously.

1588
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:36,380
Of North or South.

1589
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:41,640
Still images are now live video I'm seeing through my own eyes.

1590
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:41,900
Yeah.

1591
01:15:42,260 --> 01:15:42,740
Now, is the…

1592
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:45,760
Kevin, did you park at one of these…

1593
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:48,840
Like, did you park at Spider-Man?

1594
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:49,720
Did you park at ET?

1595
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:50,840
Did you park at Jaws?

1596
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:53,500
So glad you asked, Nick.

1597
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:58,500
I parked at Cat in the Hat 361.

1598
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:00,580
I don't want to…

1599
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:03,020
No, Cat in the Hat 361.

1600
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:04,360
No, now I just know it.

1601
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:12,360
So I would say that I wouldn't want to take you on a complete deviation from where your car is.

1602
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:14,900
So yeah, let's head down towards Cat in the Hat.

1603
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,260
Let's see what the experience is like.

1604
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:21,220
Nick, I have $25 cash here.

1605
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:21,780
Wow.

1606
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:28,280
If you'd like to visit the Strange Gift Shop or the Fresh Eats stand.

1607
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:32,760
Nick, you could buy a sleeve of a shirt with $25.

1608
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,080
Nick, can I move?

1609
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:37,920
Can I go forward?

1610
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:39,180
Yes, please, please, go for it.

1611
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:40,040
Please go ahead and move.

1612
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:42,280
I think, though, Fieger, I think you should dredge something up, though, maybe.

1613
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:43,220
Yeah, let's go, let's go.

1614
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:45,060
I mean, how do you feel about getting a sweet treat?

1615
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,380
A sweet treat?

1616
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:47,780
Yeah.

1617
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:48,780
From Fresh Eats?

1618
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:49,260
Yeah.

1619
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,180
There's no line.

1620
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:52,560
Yeah, looks like there's no one queued up there.

1621
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:59,060
Oh, and this is Jason's opportunity, too, because he just got upset that we didn't call him when we went to Fresh Eats to do some dredging.

1622
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:00,500
Oh, boy.

1623
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:01,780
Is this open?

1624
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,260
It's a pretty good question.

1625
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,840
All right, our biggest enemy now is the hours.

1626
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:12,860
Okay, it's the same menu as before.

1627
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:15,140
They still dip it and drizzle it and dredge it.

1628
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:15,340
Wow.

1629
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:16,200
Wow.

1630
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:18,020
Anything look good to you?

1631
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:18,460
What?

1632
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,660
You're going to be tasting it on some level, Nick.

1633
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:26,200
Now, remember, Nick, I'm lactose intolerant.

1634
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:26,700
Right.

1635
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:27,600
Yeah.

1636
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:32,640
No, I definitely don't want to get me and you something that's going to upset your tummy.

1637
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,300
There's those pops waiting to be dredged.

1638
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:38,540
Are any of those pops non-dairy or are they all dairy?

1639
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:39,880
That's a good question.

1640
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:41,080
We could ask.

1641
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:49,760
I bet I bet the July bet the strawberry or mango is potentially non-dairy.

1642
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:53,180
Yeah, I would guess maybe that whole right column, the coconut, too, could all be OK.

1643
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:58,720
But then then I'm wondering what is what it's fun to dredge it with because it feels like a.

1644
01:17:58,760 --> 01:17:59,640
Oh, right.

1645
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:01,620
Yeah, I forgot about the dredging.

1646
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,540
Can you dredge without dipping or drizzling?

1647
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:05,780
Or do you need the money?

1648
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:08,540
Do you need the drizzle drizzle and dip to make the dredge whole?

1649
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:09,200
That's a great.

1650
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:11,780
Yeah, I don't think the dredge is going to hold without the dip or drizzle.

1651
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,880
Well, would a would a would like a mango with a milk chocolate dip?

1652
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:17,560
I mean, that sounds like they could be appealing.

1653
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:21,540
Yeah, but if it lacked the milk, though, milk milk chocolate.

1654
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:22,600
Oh, right, right, right.

1655
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:24,260
So maybe like a caramel syrup.

1656
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:27,380
I don't know how I don't know how much lactose is in milk chocolate.

1657
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,960
No, it's not an issue.

1658
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:30,660
Milk chocolate won't be an issue.

1659
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:33,200
And you know what, Nick, fuck it.

1660
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:34,700
Wow.

1661
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:35,200
You know what?

1662
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:40,860
And Kevin, you'd be participating in the grand saga tradition of destroying your intestines.

1663
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:41,720
Yeah.

1664
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,920
And it's been a while since I did that.

1665
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:44,820
You need to do it.

1666
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:45,860
Refresh the system.

1667
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:46,280
All right.

1668
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:47,140
Wipe it.

1669
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:47,760
All right.

1670
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:48,600
Are we locking it in?

1671
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:49,220
Yeah, let's try it.

1672
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:51,880
Let's try a mango with a with a milk chocolate dip.

1673
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:52,720
Wow.

1674
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,840
And then is there something fun to dredge it in?

1675
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:55,900
Maybe just some sprinkles.

1676
01:18:55,900 --> 01:19:02,680
Do you have do you have any non dairy options here?

1677
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:07,720
Oh, the fruit ice pops are non dairy.

1678
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:08,840
Okay.

1679
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:09,300
Great.

1680
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:13,240
What kinds of fruit ice pops do you have?

1681
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:15,780
One moment.

1682
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:16,280
Yeah.

1683
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:17,560
Yes, I'm here.

1684
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:17,980
Nick.

1685
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:18,540
Yeah.

1686
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:21,860
Can I get a strawberry with lemonade ice pop, please?

1687
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:22,860
That sounds delightful.

1688
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:23,400
Yeah.

1689
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:25,440
Okay.

1690
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:25,960
Hello.

1691
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,120
I'll do a strawberry with lemonade.

1692
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,500
Oh, that's fine.

1693
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:31,520
Blueberries even better.

1694
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:32,980
It's funny.

1695
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:35,440
I think blueberry in my brain.

1696
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:36,580
It's working.

1697
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:37,400
You're melding.

1698
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:38,180
You're learning.

1699
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:42,620
And Kevin, at the end of the transaction, remember to say the orders for me, Nick Weiger.

1700
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:45,720
There's the cash.

1701
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,460
Thank you for getting cash out.

1702
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:49,000
Wow.

1703
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:49,420
Wow.

1704
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:50,240
The harvest cheddar.

1705
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,700
It's like we're touching it.

1706
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,100
Thanks, buddy.

1707
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:56,960
It sounded just like him.

1708
01:19:58,900 --> 01:19:59,740
Wow, it's perfect.

1709
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:01,100
Your brains are fusing.

1710
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:05,120
Now we get to observe a live dipping and dredging process.

1711
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:11,380
The people who are just listening are fascinated and loving it.

1712
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:12,580
Patient about it.

1713
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:15,420
Not writing comments about how they don't like it.

1714
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,080
Yeah.

1715
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:17,940
Don't blame it on me.

1716
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:22,840
You're going at a perfect pace for doing a dredging process.

1717
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,340
I'm sorry.

1718
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:25,940
I forgot to dredge.

1719
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:27,860
Oh, that's okay.

1720
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:29,420
Don't worry about it.

1721
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:29,880
No problem.

1722
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:31,140
It's wrapped.

1723
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:32,060
Thank you.

1724
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:32,980
Oh, okay.

1725
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:35,260
Well, now we've learned the dairy options.

1726
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:43,840
Wait a minute.

1727
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:44,320
You know what?

1728
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:45,440
I know where you are, Kevin.

1729
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:48,000
You're right near the crushed penny machine.

1730
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:48,800
Look at that.

1731
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:50,720
Oh, it looks delicious.

1732
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:52,460
It's only some dust.

1733
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:54,500
It looks like beef tongues.

1734
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:58,620
It also there's like a slight like slant.

1735
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:00,200
It's like there's a droopy.

1736
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:01,800
It's a droopy popsicle.

1737
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:02,640
It's limping.

1738
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,600
It's a little heavier fruit.

1739
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:06,080
Blueberry is definitely not.

1740
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,600
Group area is a denser fruit.

1741
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,700
Yeah, it's a bit frostbitten.

1742
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:17,900
I think maybe they took I think maybe they don't sell very many dairy free options.

1743
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:19,000
Right.

1744
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,940
I don't want to say it.

1745
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:21,980
There's a big vein.

1746
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:22,900
There's a big vein.

1747
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:23,800
It does look pretty.

1748
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:26,540
It's a droopy item with a giant vein.

1749
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:28,400
Very vascular ice pop.

1750
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:29,540
Oh, God.

1751
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:31,260
I hate to say it.

1752
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,860
It looks a little bit diseased.

1753
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,680
Like it might want to go to a practitioner.

1754
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:40,640
Well, you just overnighted to me if you're concerned about it.

1755
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:41,420
Oh, it's in your mouth.

1756
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:41,740
Wow.

1757
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:43,440
It tastes good.

1758
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:44,040
Wow.

1759
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:49,360
Do you both agree on the taste of it?

1760
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:50,140
How's that?

1761
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:51,760
How's that frost on the outside?

1762
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:54,240
Very cold.

1763
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:58,200
Yeah, I would agree.

1764
01:21:58,820 --> 01:22:06,080
It tastes like it has the ice crystals around it kind of tastes like I'm eating paper.

1765
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:07,920
It's really odd.

1766
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:08,660
Yes.

1767
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:09,000
Right.

1768
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:10,160
It's gritty.

1769
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,620
That's how I'll describe it.

1770
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:12,920
Nick, do you agree?

1771
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:14,780
I mean, you're inside of me.

1772
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:18,740
Yeah, it's kind of like licking the surface of that planet at the end of The Last Jedi.

1773
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,320
It's just a bunch of stray crystals.

1774
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:23,380
Crate?

1775
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:24,260
Yeah, of course, Crate.

1776
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:27,360
It is Crate-esque for sure.

1777
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:33,160
This is about a two out of 10.

1778
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:34,880
Oh, that's too bad.

1779
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:35,720
Yeah.

1780
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:37,540
Wait, can we put it in terms of forks?

1781
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:38,500
Are we allowed to do that?

1782
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,960
Yeah, no, we absolutely can.

1783
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:44,240
That translates to one forker and the one out of five doughboy scale.

1784
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:45,100
That's pretty bad.

1785
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:46,820
I had a good experience with fresh eats.

1786
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:48,980
That seems like the opposite of fresh eats.

1787
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,460
That's the issue.

1788
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:55,340
It's like there was the, like you were saying, the non-dairy pop was trapped in the deep

1789
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:55,640
freeze.

1790
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:56,540
You don't get the drizzle.

1791
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:57,620
You don't get the dredge.

1792
01:22:57,620 --> 01:22:58,520
You don't get the dip.

1793
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:00,700
And so you're missing out on a big part of the experience.

1794
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:02,300
And it's super freezer burned.

1795
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:05,380
It's hard to fuck up a simple ice pop.

1796
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:06,640
This is so bad.

1797
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,640
I am not that picky.

1798
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,840
Well, this has been a failure of the Avatar program thus far.

1799
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:14,920
No, you don't have to keep eating it.

1800
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:15,820
Can I pitch it?

1801
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,820
Yeah, I feel free to pitch it.

1802
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:18,240
Wait a minute.

1803
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:21,320
Now I think we should, like Mike Carlson decide how you dispose of it.

1804
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:25,540
Mike, what is a reasonable way to dispose of a treat at City Walk that you don't want

1805
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:25,900
to finish?

1806
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,620
Make sure that no employees are watching.

1807
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:32,400
And then as soon as all their eyes are averted, you find the nearest receptacle.

1808
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,780
And I don't even see the garbage.

1809
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:39,740
But I mean, it doesn't appear to be just put it in with the minion wands and run.

1810
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:43,780
No trash cans.

1811
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:45,040
This is something we're learning.

1812
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:46,520
No trash cans.

1813
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:49,280
Oh, oh, oh, that's surprising.

1814
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,060
Just think of quick braille.

1815
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,180
So the old souvenir shop minions.

1816
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:56,840
Hey, I can't move.

1817
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:57,740
Yeah.

1818
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,840
For some reason, I've stopped here.

1819
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:09,220
I'm going to try to will myself away from looking at Kevin the minion.

1820
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:13,040
I think I broke I've had a psychic break.

1821
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:13,840
There we go.

1822
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:15,640
Oh, my gosh.

1823
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:16,440
Sorry about that, Kevin.

1824
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:17,540
Wow.

1825
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:18,680
Scooby Doo there.

1826
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:19,700
Kind of like.

1827
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:23,300
Scooby Doo looks like he ate a sour candy.

1828
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:24,340
Oh, I see a trash can.

1829
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:25,080
There is a trash can.

1830
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:25,740
OK, OK.

1831
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:26,800
And it's sent.

1832
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:28,040
But it's the other way.

1833
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:30,500
Aren't you now going towards the other parking garages?

1834
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,040
It's a it's a worthwhile detour.

1835
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:35,380
How's it looking there?

1836
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:36,060
Drop it.

1837
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:36,280
Yeah.

1838
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,040
OK, great.

1839
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:37,620
OK, OK.

1840
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:39,780
And I don't think anyone's thrown into the garbage.

1841
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:40,800
Oh, and look at this.

1842
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:42,160
The coin machines.

1843
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:42,680
We are.

1844
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:45,400
This has been a running theme through the podcast.

1845
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:46,420
We've discussed you.

1846
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:47,280
Maybe you've heard some of this, Nick.

1847
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:47,840
That's right.

1848
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:48,220
Yes.

1849
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:53,840
Whether or not your own actual penny goes into these machines and there's a place to

1850
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:54,440
put in your penny.

1851
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:59,140
And there's the credit card where you will get all four pennies in theory.

1852
01:24:59,140 --> 01:24:59,860
This is a fake one.

1853
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:00,820
This is one of those fake ones.

1854
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:01,620
This is this is bullshit.

1855
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:02,240
Oh, yeah.

1856
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:03,820
Kevin, can you just don't attract security?

1857
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:05,540
But can you like punch it or something?

1858
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:06,880
Oh, wait.

1859
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:07,460
Oh, wow.

1860
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:08,940
Oh, he's doing it.

1861
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:11,680
Oh, rejected the dollar bill.

1862
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:15,260
You know, it's maybe better that way.

1863
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:15,560
We go.

1864
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:16,400
Oh, OK.

1865
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:16,820
OK.

1866
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,180
Well, why are you looking like you're here?

1867
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,480
I think you just get them.

1868
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:22,900
Oh, OK.

1869
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:25,300
Oh, should we see which one I get?

1870
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:26,860
You get four for one dollar.

1871
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:28,700
Oh, we'll find out.

1872
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:30,220
Another one dollar each.

1873
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:30,560
Yeah.

1874
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:32,580
I don't think it's working.

1875
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:36,160
That might have been not enough money and I don't have any more.

1876
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:38,540
Wait, it's starting to get harder to do.

1877
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:42,120
That means I'm feeling more resistance with the crank here on my end.

1878
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:43,520
So it is life cranking.

1879
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:43,980
Oh, there it is.

1880
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:44,700
There we go.

1881
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:45,340
Whoa.

1882
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:45,800
Wow.

1883
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:46,760
Which one do we get?

1884
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:51,220
It's it's Woody's Woodpecker's friend.

1885
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:52,520
Only Jason can know.

1886
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:53,600
Only Jason knows these.

1887
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:56,460
Oh, that's his old mustachioed friend.

1888
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:57,980
Let me look this up.

1889
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:01,760
I just we all love it.

1890
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:05,080
That's what every kid's excited to get in the year 2024.

1891
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:06,740
Is it is his name?

1892
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:08,720
Walter Lance.

1893
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:11,840
Well, that's the guy who created the creator.

1894
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:14,060
It's a good guess, though.

1895
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:15,740
Of course, Woody's friend.

1896
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:17,360
Walter Lance.

1897
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,180
They share.

1898
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:22,560
Goodbye, Woody.

1899
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:24,440
Oh, Nick, I'm sorry.

1900
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:25,240
I should have.

1901
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:27,640
There's a lot of time.

1902
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:28,860
It'd be nice to do my own.

1903
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:32,640
But one of these seems to be just the Despicable Me logo.

1904
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:36,360
So these aren't necessarily the most exciting fake pennies, right?

1905
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:36,860
The logo.

1906
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:37,320
Yeah.

1907
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:38,500
If you had to pick one, Nick.

1908
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:40,260
Well, you got grew there.

1909
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:41,400
That's kind of fun.

1910
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:42,920
Agnes is pretty good.

1911
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:47,240
I mean, of course, I'd want the one with the minions, but this one feels like this is designed

1912
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:49,000
to build parents out of dollar bills.

1913
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:51,500
You're going to keep turning them until you get one of the minions.

1914
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,820
And in theory, you can select which one you want.

1915
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,580
And it is not super explanatory.

1916
01:26:57,580 --> 01:26:59,120
There's another dollar going into the machine.

1917
01:26:59,140 --> 01:26:59,980
You found another dollar.

1918
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:01,880
All right.

1919
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:03,700
Wait, how do you select which one you're going to get?

1920
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,640
You kind of turn beforehand.

1921
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:06,340
OK.

1922
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:06,820
Oh, wait.

1923
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:07,740
I think.

1924
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:08,580
Oh, OK.

1925
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:09,200
OK.

1926
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:10,280
Well, too late.

1927
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:10,920
Too late.

1928
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:11,940
You put your dollar in.

1929
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:12,840
It's OK.

1930
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:13,340
I did.

1931
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,220
And it's rejecting it continuously.

1932
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:16,220
OK.

1933
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:18,980
If there's one more try doesn't work.

1934
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:20,400
It took it.

1935
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:21,060
It took it.

1936
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:22,040
OK, OK, OK.

1937
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,140
How do I?

1938
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:27,380
Oh, I think I'm doing it wrong.

1939
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:33,100
No, I think you're doing it great because I think you just turned a little bit more and then I think you're both doing it great together.

1940
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:34,100
That's right.

1941
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:34,500
That's right.

1942
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,300
I didn't I didn't do it right.

1943
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:38,200
And it gave me this one.

1944
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:39,320
I didn't get the select.

1945
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:41,560
That wasn't the one that was selected either.

1946
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:42,300
Yeah, no, it wasn't.

1947
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:43,520
That one was on Agnes.

1948
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:43,920
Oh, boy.

1949
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,400
That's really that's really confusing.

1950
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:46,640
There's only one thing to do.

1951
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:47,980
Throw that away.

1952
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:50,460
Chuck it.

1953
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:51,020
Chuck it.

1954
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:52,040
OK.

1955
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:53,540
That's waiting for any listeners.

1956
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:56,700
It might still be there on the Despicable Me machine in the garage.

1957
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:01,960
By the way, the answer to the earlier question, Wally Walrus, Wally Walrus.

1958
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:04,180
I thought that was a human man.

1959
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,720
No, it is a Walrus.

1960
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,600
Walrus is not Walter Lance.

1961
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:10,380
Wow.

1962
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:17,840
Another big it's another reason I knew your DNA would match is that neither Kevin nor Nick knows the name Wally Walrus.

1963
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:18,580
Yeah.

1964
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:20,800
Is it time to start walking to the garage?

1965
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:21,580
I think so.

1966
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:23,020
Let's let's head to the space.

1967
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:23,520
All right.

1968
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:25,440
Past the Duff Beer cans.

1969
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:28,540
We've gotten doses of characters and fun and treats.

1970
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:31,120
The treats didn't work out, but we played the lottery.

1971
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:35,900
And now I really can't believe how bad that ice pop was.

1972
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:37,840
Yeah, I'm I'm really I can't either.

1973
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:38,420
Yeah.

1974
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:39,220
Unfortunate.

1975
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:40,500
I can't get that taste out of my mouth.

1976
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,040
Well, it's fine.

1977
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:45,920
Jason is buying a plane ticket to go have that specific ice pop tomorrow.

1978
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:47,700
Nick threw away.

1979
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:49,600
It might still be there.

1980
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:51,040
I can fish it out.

1981
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,400
I won't have to pay for a new one.

1982
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,720
That's on Kevin's dime.

1983
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:57,800
I'm looking up pictures of a late life Walter Lance.

1984
01:28:58,260 --> 01:28:59,400
Thank you very much.

1985
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:01,300
Late in life.

1986
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:03,980
Larry, Google Walter Lance dying.

1987
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:05,420
Oh, wait, are we doing it?

1988
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:05,900
Are we getting on?

1989
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:06,480
Yeah.

1990
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:07,940
We're at a crossroads.

1991
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:08,600
OK.

1992
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:12,140
You want travel later or walk?

1993
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:17,400
We got to do travel later because it looks like we can get some some if we want to get some speed, we might have the potential to do so.

1994
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:21,500
If we want to push past this family, I'm going to need I'm going to need to delay a bit.

1995
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:22,180
Yeah, I know.

1996
01:29:22,580 --> 01:29:23,280
Oh, yeah.

1997
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,140
Build up some room.

1998
01:29:24,220 --> 01:29:24,440
Yeah.

1999
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:25,300
Yeah, please.

2000
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:26,060
Oh, wow.

2001
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:26,980
Look at that.

2002
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:27,240
Wow.

2003
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:28,600
It's like you're flying.

2004
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,640
Just it's like huge Navi strides.

2005
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:33,300
I have a 10 foot frame.

2006
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,360
Do you finally feel alive again?

2007
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:42,040
Well, everything you were saying about your body and the food and the drinking and that it weighs you down, it's all gone now.

2008
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:42,420
Yeah.

2009
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:44,040
Live and powerful.

2010
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:45,000
Oh, my God.

2011
01:29:45,020 --> 01:29:46,280
That was exhilarating.

2012
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:47,680
Like a prime shack.

2013
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:51,360
I can hear in the distance upside inside.

2014
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:52,880
Yeah.

2015
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,000
Living the Vita Loka.

2016
01:29:56,660 --> 01:29:57,140
Wow.

2017
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:57,700
There it is.

2018
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,240
The Bubba Gump Tower.

2019
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:00,960
We're pretty far away at this point.

2020
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:01,340
OK.

2021
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:02,800
Now we have to find our way.

2022
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:03,560
There's the gate.

2023
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:04,220
Oh, my gosh.

2024
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:06,240
We're getting all the way to the outside.

2025
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:10,960
We have to, I guess, find our way properly to your car.

2026
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:13,480
You remember what we do?

2027
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:16,680
Yeah, you were you were in the cat in the hat, of course.

2028
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:22,160
And you were in space 231, 316.

2029
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:26,600
No, it's glitching.

2030
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:28,540
We're losing it.

2031
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,240
I had the three and the one in there.

2032
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:31,180
Just in the wrong order.

2033
01:30:31,420 --> 01:30:31,980
Again, correctly.

2034
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:32,200
All right.

2035
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:36,080
The thing is, both of you are wrong.

2036
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:42,200
Oh, three, three, six, one, three, six, one.

2037
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:43,940
I transpose you the numbers.

2038
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:50,840
Do you want me to use my Kevin knowledge to find my car or should I go to three, 16?

2039
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:52,240
No, no, no, no.

2040
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:55,180
You're late in Kevin knowledge.

2041
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,020
This feels so weird.

2042
01:30:57,260 --> 01:30:58,220
It kind of hurts.

2043
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:00,260
Well, it proves that you're still in there.

2044
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:05,480
Yeah, hasn't boxed you out and he's not going to take over your brain and being John Malkovich

2045
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:05,920
out.

2046
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:08,400
I'm not going to be a meat day.

2047
01:31:08,780 --> 01:31:10,200
No, that's that's important.

2048
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:12,840
You got to retain you in there as we get towards work.

2049
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:14,400
We're recording this around dinner time.

2050
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:19,140
Kevin, are you starting to feel like you like desperately crave a Wendy's hamburger or something?

2051
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:22,180
Like, what kind of meal does Wiger want right now?

2052
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:24,360
Since we're approaching, you know, five or six.

2053
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:25,800
Yeah, I mean, we're not far.

2054
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,540
We're not far from an in and out burger.

2055
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:29,840
I mean, I might be tempted to have something like that, though.

2056
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:32,700
Obviously, that's not something you could easily acquire in the Orlando area.

2057
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:32,880
Right.

2058
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:33,500
That's true.

2059
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:37,720
But if we if we have to we're done recording, you stay linked for the rest of your life.

2060
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:42,640
Kevin could experience it and a longing that could not be satisfied.

2061
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:46,340
The West Coast exclusive in and out burger.

2062
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:46,740
All right.

2063
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:47,460
You're at a crossroads.

2064
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:48,760
I noticed as well here.

2065
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:49,540
Which one?

2066
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:56,120
Well, no, I'm just kind of waiting because this is the last last real glimpse you might

2067
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:57,240
get of CityWalk.

2068
01:31:57,660 --> 01:31:58,100
Wow.

2069
01:31:58,300 --> 01:31:59,420
This is kind of emotional.

2070
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:00,080
The big dome.

2071
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,300
This is where we came from.

2072
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:02,940
This is where we say goodbye.

2073
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:06,760
Gosh, we have to later in the show, we have to say goodbye to the Sectorkeeper.

2074
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:11,660
And right now we have to say goodbye to this place that has been our home for 21 days.

2075
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:16,340
I really, though, I will say from this experience, I'm really getting a sense of how much ground

2076
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:17,320
Kevin has covered.

2077
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:17,920
Yeah.

2078
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:21,980
You've gotten a lot of steps in just moving from CityWalk proper to where you are.

2079
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:23,420
He's showing us where he started.

2080
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:23,840
Yeah.

2081
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,880
You've got a lot of steps in, Nick.

2082
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:27,320
That you're right.

2083
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:28,780
I'm thinking about it all wrong.

2084
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:29,740
He's learning.

2085
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:30,500
He's learning.

2086
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:31,280
He's learning.

2087
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:32,480
Double steps.

2088
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:35,340
You know, two men equal double steps.

2089
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:39,840
And that means we're getting shredded in the cabin.

2090
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:40,700
Damn.

2091
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:41,280
Yeah.

2092
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:41,800
That's great.

2093
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,760
Apple Watch is going to be very happy about that.

2094
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:44,800
Yeah, it counts for both.

2095
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:45,680
Tell the Apple Watch it counts for both.

2096
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:52,460
I think that everything is so honestly just such a like a great clear signage and clear

2097
01:32:52,460 --> 01:32:53,780
places to go.

2098
01:32:56,920 --> 01:33:00,680
I would even say of any of the theme parks I've ever gone to, this one just seems like

2099
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:01,680
the most straightforward.

2100
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,800
All of this was put together in such a straightforward way.

2101
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:05,220
Yes.

2102
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:08,000
And I was very impressed with it while we were walking around.

2103
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:09,840
Is it our best parking garage?

2104
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:11,780
Wow.

2105
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:12,340
Wow.

2106
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:13,020
Could be.

2107
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:14,860
Well, here's the thing.

2108
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:15,700
Here's what I'll say.

2109
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:16,120
Yeah.

2110
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:21,480
Is that I still miss the chaos of Universal Hollywood.

2111
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:25,180
There's something more fun still to me to this day.

2112
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:26,160
About the mystery.

2113
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:28,740
To not quite knowing where I'm going to walk out.

2114
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:29,680
And it's happened to me.

2115
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:30,880
It happened to me a few days ago.

2116
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:32,360
It happened to me a couple of weeks ago.

2117
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:37,060
And this certainly Orlando, efficient makes the most sense.

2118
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:40,100
I have to give it the blue ribbon for efficiency.

2119
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:40,540
Sure.

2120
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:42,120
But what does my heart say?

2121
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:44,920
My heart says I want to park Universal LA more.

2122
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:46,560
Yeah, I can understand that.

2123
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:47,980
I want to be in that parking garage.

2124
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:50,020
There's a couple of different ones that are all over the place.

2125
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:50,960
I don't know.

2126
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:51,740
There's something about it.

2127
01:33:51,820 --> 01:33:52,260
I like better.

2128
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:53,280
I hate to say that.

2129
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:56,780
I don't want to put it down, Orlando, but I like LA better.

2130
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:58,240
That's just my feeling.

2131
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:09,020
impressed by this.

2132
01:34:09,820 --> 01:34:13,280
This feels like it's very well designed and very straightforward.

2133
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:18,100
A lot of signposting, a lot of clarity in terms of where you're supposed to go, provided

2134
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:21,680
you can remember your own space number, which we failed to do.

2135
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:24,080
But here's the thing.

2136
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:29,100
There is one specific design feature of the Mickey and Friends parking structure that

2137
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:36,840
I really like, which is that the escalators go directly from your level to the ground

2138
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:37,940
and vice versa.

2139
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:42,880
It's just really efficient because if you're parked on level four, there's no reason you

2140
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,900
would ever need to go to level two or level three.

2141
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:47,380
You can just go directly from the ground to level four.

2142
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:57,740
I don't quite see anything on that level as of yet from the Universal Orlando structure.

2143
01:34:58,400 --> 01:34:59,220
All the minions are great.

2144
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:02,360
We're looking at some minions on a bus right now, and that is a hoot.

2145
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:05,660
Why don't we see what it's like to get to the car?

2146
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,160
I think that will help you decide.

2147
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:10,140
I was going to say, let's not speak too soon, guys.

2148
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:14,960
Let's not compliment the parking garage until we get to the actual height.

2149
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:15,380
Fair enough.

2150
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:17,220
Well, forward, gentlemen.

2151
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:19,040
Let's forward.

2152
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:19,500
Yeah, let's go forward.

2153
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:19,900
All right.

2154
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:20,480
Here we go.

2155
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:26,040
Now, this is confusing because it says Cat in the Hat is that way, but that's a one-way

2156
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:26,700
travelator.

2157
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:28,280
It's going the other way now.

2158
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:30,100
It makes it look like I'm going to ET.

2159
01:35:30,940 --> 01:35:33,300
I hope that's the way you need to go.

2160
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:34,100
I'll knock points off of that.

2161
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:34,460
All right.

2162
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:36,480
The Brits are…

2163
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:38,300
Yeah, let's travel it.

2164
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:40,340
…

2165
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:39,920
linguistic quirks.

2166
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:50,000
Because if you call an elevator a lift, wouldn't you call a moving walkway like a this way,

2167
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:50,820
then, or something?

2168
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:54,220
Would you have it be a little bit straightforward and folksy?

2169
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:55,560
A standy stroll.

2170
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:56,640
Yeah, a standy stroll.

2171
01:35:56,820 --> 01:35:57,380
Yeah, 100%.

2172
01:35:57,380 --> 01:35:59,800
That's perfect, but you call it the travelator.

2173
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,560
No, that's clunky in the same way that elevator is.

2174
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:04,140
It sounds more American.

2175
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:04,820
Right.

2176
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:05,520
Very true.

2177
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:05,960
What is that?

2178
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:08,180
This is a volcano base sign above you, Kevin?

2179
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:09,840
That's right.

2180
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,820
The third water theme park.

2181
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:13,900
That's right.

2182
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:14,520
Volcano Bay.

2183
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:17,240
Well, actually, the first water theme park in existence.

2184
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,240
Are they going to do that?

2185
01:36:23,260 --> 01:36:25,820
There's all this talk of adding to all the other parks.

2186
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:26,400
Who cares?

2187
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:27,280
I want rides.

2188
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:30,120
I want rides too, but I want water rides.

2189
01:36:30,220 --> 01:36:32,640
I bet they could use a fresh eat stand.

2190
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:34,680
I think they could, yeah.

2191
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:36,120
That kid has a lot of beads.

2192
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:36,480
I wonder what…

2193
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:39,060
Is there a Mardi Gras situation happening?

2194
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:39,840
Oh, really?

2195
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:40,300
Okay.

2196
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,980
How's the Mardi Gras vibes there?

2197
01:36:43,740 --> 01:36:44,980
Mardi Gras vibes are good.

2198
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:49,080
They replace all of the music in the park with Zydeco music,

2199
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:55,000
which is kind of fun, but also some of the original atmosphere is lost,

2200
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,320
I will say, because everything is just pumping Zydeco music.

2201
01:36:58,500 --> 01:36:59,180
But it's cool.

2202
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:02,940
They have floats go by, and then you can throw beads from the floats

2203
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:06,460
if you sign up, which is an experience I've never done, but I'd like to.

2204
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:09,340
You can be on the floats and throw beads?

2205
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:11,640
Yeah, you can be on the float.

2206
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:12,780
Have you ever done that?

2207
01:37:12,820 --> 01:37:13,900
I have not done it.

2208
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:16,880
Don't you think you would have hurt by now if I had done that?

2209
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:19,280
You said something a couple weeks ago I never heard.

2210
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:23,480
So there's still mysteries that have not been reveled.

2211
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:26,220
But they do a version of this at Universal Orlando,

2212
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,520
but it's got to be like a sanitized Mardi Gras, right?

2213
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:31,420
It's not like people aren't flashing the parade.

2214
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:33,960
No, I don't think anyone's putting them on the glass.

2215
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:40,840
Well, the minions flash, but we don't understand their anatomy.

2216
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:42,340
We don't know we're looking at nudity.

2217
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:43,480
So it doesn't feel dirty.

2218
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,000
Because they don't want beads.

2219
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:46,540
They just want banana.

2220
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:47,020
Right.

2221
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:48,540
What about Toon Lagoon though?

2222
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:51,060
There's probably some saucy comic strip characters.

2223
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:52,380
One of the, like Mrs.

2224
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:53,440
Lockhorn maybe?

2225
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:56,700
I guess is Blondie perhaps?

2226
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:57,080
I don't know.

2227
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:57,860
Andy Capp's wife?

2228
01:37:58,400 --> 01:37:58,540
Dagwood?

2229
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:01,340
Yeah, do Blondie and Dagwood have an arrangement?

2230
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:02,440
Yes.

2231
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:04,320
Well, they have an arrangement only for you.

2232
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:09,220
If you entered the cartoon world, you feel that you could get in a couple.

2233
01:38:09,380 --> 01:38:10,620
They've been waiting for you to be cartoonized.

2234
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:12,140
Jason, you're a real man.

2235
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:14,880
Dagwood, he just focuses on his sandwiches.

2236
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,200
He doesn't even look at me anymore.

2237
01:38:18,340 --> 01:38:21,320
You're a man who loves me and a sandwich equally.

2238
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,540
You maintain the interests.

2239
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:24,340
You do both.

2240
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:25,480
Balance them.

2241
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:29,200
Now, with all the smoke rising near the Bubba Gump, is that normal?

2242
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:35,380
Yeah, I was going to say it looks a little bit like a disaster's happened.

2243
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:37,680
I'm glad I got out of there if that's the case.

2244
01:38:37,820 --> 01:38:45,800
But I think it might just be fog or it doesn't seem to be, it seems to be atmospheric, not so much pumped in or anything.

2245
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:48,100
I think it's coming from the weather.

2246
01:38:48,420 --> 01:38:51,420
Is it possible that it's just they've been making so much shrimp?

2247
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:59,180
There's such a demand for shrimp today that the ovens are overloaded and they're just billowing steam and smoke?

2248
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:01,500
Because of the over the over?

2249
01:39:02,380 --> 01:39:06,100
I'd say it's not only possible, but likely that that's what's happened.

2250
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:06,320
Sure.

2251
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:10,860
Well, I think that's post the side because we have terrible reviews to every restaurant except Bubba Gump.

2252
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:14,100
So now Posty and Riccobani, the line is way out the door.

2253
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:14,520
Right, right, right.

2254
01:39:14,620 --> 01:39:15,760
You were saying it happened earlier.

2255
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:18,120
Could it be the smoke from big fire?

2256
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:19,740
They're always talking about their fire.

2257
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:21,200
They have a big fire at Big Fire.

2258
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:22,460
It might be Big Fire.

2259
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:26,620
That was probably the best place we all eat at.

2260
01:39:26,620 --> 01:39:27,740
Yeah, yes, it was.

2261
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:28,540
Yeah, yeah.

2262
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:32,700
If you have serious review, that is the one and loser meal of the trip.

2263
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:36,180
I think has to be let's give the official award to the Flounder Almondine.

2264
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:36,740
Yeah.

2265
01:39:36,860 --> 01:39:37,220
Thank you.

2266
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:38,280
It sounded awful.

2267
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:44,700
It was also a real headache for you to get that documentary of you getting it.

2268
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:44,940
Yeah.

2269
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:45,480
Oh, yeah.

2270
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:45,820
Yeah.

2271
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:53,160
That being said, if they want to put it back on the menu either coast, I'll try it again and I'll take it to go and I'll wait even longer to eat it.

2272
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:54,720
Well, should we start heading to the car?

2273
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:55,900
Yeah, let's see if we can make it there.

2274
01:39:55,900 --> 01:39:57,440
Let's head on over to space 361.

2275
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:58,580
Is it on this level?

2276
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:00,660
Yes.

2277
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:01,620
OK.

2278
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:02,220
All right.

2279
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:02,920
OK.

2280
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:04,040
Wow.

2281
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:04,980
Literally the last.

2282
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:06,500
Oh, it's in the you're in the last row.

2283
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:06,720
Wow.

2284
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:08,100
You really went all the way.

2285
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:08,900
Mm hmm.

2286
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:12,320
Yeah, I think I know how this works.

2287
01:40:12,580 --> 01:40:15,440
You got to wonder if the cat that moved in.

2288
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:16,100
What did you say?

2289
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:16,600
What?

2290
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:18,720
The cat that had moved the car.

2291
01:40:18,860 --> 01:40:20,760
That's the kind of mischief you would make.

2292
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:26,340
He could have moved it to 361 or 360.

2293
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:31,800
The cat in the hat knows not to fuck with Kevin Tully from the band Telethon, man.

2294
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:34,220
How dare you even suggest that?

2295
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:35,200
Fair enough.

2296
01:40:35,540 --> 01:40:35,840
So lutely.

2297
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:37,660
Plus, yeah, I'm sure you didn't give the keys to him.

2298
01:40:37,660 --> 01:40:39,240
He would have had to hotwire it.

2299
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:44,100
Well, now we got a crowd of like a lot of people trying to park right now.

2300
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:44,600
Do you?

2301
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:44,920
Does it?

2302
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:45,500
What's the air?

2303
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:46,240
What's the vibe?

2304
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:47,140
Does it feel chill?

2305
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:48,120
Does it feel stressful?

2306
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:49,360
That's, I guess, a big question.

2307
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:56,900
Well, it does feel like a weird amount of people are leaving right now, which is funny

2308
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:59,080
because the parks don't close till nine.

2309
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:01,720
So I guess this is just how it is.

2310
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:05,400
I never park at City Walk, and so I don't ever do this.

2311
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:09,080
I don't know if this is normal or if it's busy or if it's not.

2312
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:10,020
That's Mardi Gras.

2313
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:10,960
Learning this together.

2314
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:14,520
Maybe also if you got young kids, this is about the time when they're tuckered out.

2315
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:16,540
Yeah.

2316
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,320
Not everyone can do it full day at the park.

2317
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,480
It's a little late, too, for the young kids.

2318
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:21,180
Yeah.

2319
01:41:21,780 --> 01:41:23,380
How do you get over there?

2320
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:24,700
I think this is my…

2321
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:26,940
Oh, no.

2322
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:27,800
Turbulence.

2323
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:30,780
I think this is my road.

2324
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:31,920
Wow, wow.

2325
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:32,540
We made it.

2326
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:33,760
I guess we'll find out.

2327
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:34,840
Good job, Nick.

2328
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:38,560
You navigated us all the way in an environment you've never been in.

2329
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:40,000
Yeah, I did my best.

2330
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:43,660
It's disorienting, but now it also kind of just feels natural.

2331
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:49,560
Nick, Kevin, just remember to make sure to get the license plate and the car registration

2332
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:55,660
on camera so you make sure we're at the right location.

2333
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:59,020
And your vehicle identification number, too, the VIN.

2334
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:02,400
Yeah, and mailing address on registration.

2335
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:08,020
Now, Nick, I drive a blue Subaru Crosstrek.

2336
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:09,760
Blue Subaru Crosstrek.

2337
01:42:10,580 --> 01:42:11,320
Got it.

2338
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:12,100
Okay.

2339
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:14,160
So we all need to find it together.

2340
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:15,300
I think we do, yeah.

2341
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:16,060
I'm just going to keep…

2342
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,640
I mean, I can't stop.

2343
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:20,600
Nick's power is too strong.

2344
01:42:20,820 --> 01:42:21,560
I'm locomoting.

2345
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:24,360
I can't stop until you tell me to stop.

2346
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,400
Now, I'm having some trouble…

2347
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:27,460
Oh, Jesus.

2348
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:28,360
Uh-oh.

2349
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:30,220
Someone's honking aggressively.

2350
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:31,720
I hope you're okay.

2351
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:33,660
Is that it here?

2352
01:42:33,660 --> 01:42:34,080
I am having…

2353
01:42:34,460 --> 01:42:39,860
It's fairly dark, the lighting here, so I'm having trouble perceiving color all that clearly.

2354
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:42,000
I kind of see dark cars and white cars.

2355
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:46,280
All right, just start trying the different car doors that you can imagine.

2356
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:47,600
Yeah, just start grabbing.

2357
01:42:47,780 --> 01:42:48,800
Guys, I see it.

2358
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:49,480
I see it.

2359
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:49,900
Oh, great.

2360
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:51,220
It's in our frame right now.

2361
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:51,620
Whoa.

2362
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:51,920
And it's…

2363
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:52,580
Oh, no.

2364
01:42:52,620 --> 01:42:53,420
Connection's breaking.

2365
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:54,820
We're losing the connection.

2366
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:55,480
Let me help you.

2367
01:42:55,480 --> 01:42:56,620
We have to make it to the end.

2368
01:42:56,620 --> 01:42:57,160
This is right before the car.

2369
01:42:57,320 --> 01:43:00,040
We need to get to the car before the phone cramps out.

2370
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:03,940
With your last ounces of strength, Nick, get us to this Subaru.

2371
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:05,500
I think that's it.

2372
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:06,800
Oh, we're here.

2373
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:07,240
What?

2374
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:07,680
Is that it?

2375
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:08,160
Yes, there it is.

2376
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:09,080
It's the Subaru logo.

2377
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:10,440
This has to be it.

2378
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:11,220
Yay.

2379
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:17,220
No, you, Nick Wires, successfully navigated your way to a Subaru car.

2380
01:43:17,220 --> 01:43:17,800
There's the cat in the hat.

2381
01:43:17,820 --> 01:43:19,020
The track you've never been in.

2382
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:19,460
Wow.

2383
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:20,520
And there's the cat.

2384
01:43:20,860 --> 01:43:21,280
Wow.

2385
01:43:21,340 --> 01:43:23,200
That was pretty smooth, I'd have to say.

2386
01:43:23,220 --> 01:43:23,660
Yeah.

2387
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:24,240
Wow.

2388
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:25,480
There it is.

2389
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:26,220
Whoa.

2390
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:29,040
You got a great car, Nick.

2391
01:43:29,860 --> 01:43:30,900
So, congratulations.

2392
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:31,600
Thank you.

2393
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:31,960
Yeah.

2394
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:39,680
Kevin, this has been an incredible experience sharing your brain and body and looking into

2395
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:40,320
your inner self.

2396
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:43,240
I realize you probably have some plugs you'd like to share.

2397
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:45,600
Thank you so much.

All of our music is free on there.

2402
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:50,160
Go listen.

2403
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:50,900
Wow.

2404
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:51,660
All free.

2405
01:43:51,940 --> 01:43:52,140
Geez.

2406
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:52,760
Check that out.

2407
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:53,420
That's fantastic.

2411
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:59,520
Kevin, we can't thank you enough for doing this, for participating in this grand experiment,

2412
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:05,980
the first ever successful iteration of the Trans Multiversal Avatar program.

2413
01:44:05,980 --> 01:44:11,600
Your bravery has saved the entire City Walk Orlando saga.

2414
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:15,820
We couldn't have closed it out without you, so we thank you for participating in this

2415
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:16,560
grand experiment.

2416
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:19,240
It's all thanks to Nick Weiger.

2417
01:44:19,380 --> 01:44:26,080
No, it's thanks to you, Kevin, and to go from being, that's actually my avatar.

2418
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:28,280
What is nonsense?

2419
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:29,160
I'm sorry.

2420
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:30,760
Get out of the fucking way.

2421
01:44:33,800 --> 01:44:34,240
All right.

2422
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:35,060
Well, you better split.

2423
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:37,560
Why don't you tap that tip one more time, Nick, and we'll…

2424
01:44:38,700 --> 01:44:39,000
Wow.

2425
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:41,660
The connection has gone away.

2426
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:42,720
Geez.

2427
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:43,360
Oh my God.

2428
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:44,240
How do you feel, Nick?

2429
01:44:44,420 --> 01:44:48,320
I feel somehow more alive than I've ever been.

2430
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:54,020
Just being able to occupy someone else's frame to share their soul for a brief moment.

2431
01:44:54,140 --> 01:44:59,020
It really hammered home what it means to be alive, but also to have my own independent

2432
01:44:59,020 --> 01:44:59,460
psyche.

2433
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:00,660
Wow.

2434
01:45:00,980 --> 01:45:03,500
What a beautiful message to end this thing on.

2435
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:06,120
Also, I feel generally a little humid.

2436
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:09,040
Yeah, that's going to happen.

2437
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:10,300
We could have picked a better time to do…

2438
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:11,700
Oh, and look at this.

2439
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:13,120
Speaking of feeling alive.

2440
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:15,360
Wow, it's Walter Lantz himself.

2441
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:17,660
It's late in life, Walter Lantz.

2442
01:45:17,780 --> 01:45:21,360
With all of the creations that Jason can name, such as…

2443
01:45:22,420 --> 01:45:26,720
Woody Woodpecker, Wally Walrus.

2444
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:27,900
Yeah.

2445
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:28,340
Chilly Willy.

2446
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:29,280
Look at Chilly Willy up there.

2447
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:31,820
Chilly Willy, Not Mickey.

2448
01:45:31,820 --> 01:45:33,980
Yeah, Not Mickey the Panda.

2449
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:35,220
Not Mickey the Panda.

2450
01:45:35,540 --> 01:45:38,420
Does the fish that Chilly Willy is fishing for count as a character or…?

2451
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:45,040
Is that the one from American Dad?

2452
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:48,720
He created that character from American Dad.

2453
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:53,580
He gave the gift of it to Seth MacFarlane right before he died, like Kubrick giving

2454
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:55,060
AI to Spielberg.

2455
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:55,440
See ya.

2456
01:45:55,660 --> 01:45:56,080
Absolutely.

2457
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:59,380
Well, this is, as you said, Jason, it's late in life, Walter Lantz.

2458
01:45:59,380 --> 01:46:02,440
Yeah, it's late in life, and we have to remember, our days are numbered, much like Mr.

2459
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:02,960
Lantz.

2460
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:03,360
Yeah.

2461
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:07,180
And we have to remember these moments and hold on to them, these moments where we feel

2462
01:46:07,180 --> 01:46:11,120
so alive, where we get to inhabit a body across the entire multiverse.

2463
01:46:16,780 --> 01:46:18,480
And maybe we all will.

2464
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:22,740
I know we've all been beaten down by this, but that was such a fun little portal.

2465
01:46:23,060 --> 01:46:23,640
I don't know.

2466
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:25,480
Some of that negativity is melting away.

2467
01:46:25,660 --> 01:46:26,900
I'm feeling pretty good, guys.

2468
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:27,720
Yeah, I think so.

2469
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:28,840
I feel the same way.

2470
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:29,400
Yeah.

2471
01:46:29,700 --> 01:46:30,640
I feel, yeah.

2472
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:34,560
Not good enough to start a new saga anytime in the near future.

2473
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:39,840
No, but good enough you can put away a plate of flour and a big milkshake with a slice

2474
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:41,600
of cake on top, right?

2475
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:42,820
Amen, brother.

2476
01:46:43,060 --> 01:46:44,840
Let's all get a toothsome right now.

2477
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:45,780
Okay, fine.

2478
01:46:45,820 --> 01:46:46,800
All is forgiven.

2479
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:48,760
But wait a minute.

2480
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:50,700
It's appearing.

2481
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:51,780
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2482
01:46:51,820 --> 01:46:53,020
Something just happened to me.

2483
01:46:53,020 --> 01:46:57,880
Like something just got sent through the multiverse into my body.

2484
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:04,040
And let's just say for the sake of cleanliness, not through my butt.

2485
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:06,340
I swear it didn't come through my butt.

2486
01:47:06,340 --> 01:47:08,020
It just ended up on my person.

2487
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:13,020
But you know, I know it just felt like you failed in getting the collectible coin that

2488
01:47:13,020 --> 01:47:15,660
you wanted, but look what was just sent to us.

2489
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:18,160
The three minion coin.

2490
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:18,920
Wow, look at that.

2491
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:20,400
The three minion coin.

2492
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:20,860
Wow.

2493
01:47:20,860 --> 01:47:25,560
And we give it to you, Nick Weiger, for being the finale guest that we needed.

2494
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:27,760
How's the quality on that?

2495
01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:32,920
This is, I mean, this is a real piece of shit, but this is the thinnest piece of metal I've

2496
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:33,820
ever seen in my life.

2497
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:36,700
But this is a true token of appreciation.

2498
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:41,240
I genuinely, I really appreciate y'all going all the way to bring this to me.

2499
01:47:41,300 --> 01:47:41,820
This is great.

2500
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:42,820
I will treasure this.

2501
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:43,900
Wow, wow, wonderful.

2502
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:47,440
Well, and you better because that's your only payment for appearing on the show.

2503
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:47,960
Yeah, that's fair.

2504
01:47:48,260 --> 01:47:50,560
But it's worth 51 cents, keep in mind.

2505
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:51,100
Or more?

2506
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:51,740
Was it a dollar?

2507
01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:52,640
It was a dollar.

2508
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:53,740
Well, there we go.

2509
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:55,960
Hey, it's getting more valuable every second.

2510
01:47:55,980 --> 01:47:57,500
Yeah, it's currency in Orlando.

2511
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:02,480
Well, with that, I'm so happy to say, Nick Weiger, you survived the City Walk Orlando

2512
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:04,680
Saga multiverse of madness.

2513
01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:07,960
We couldn't have asked for a better guest and a sillier thing to do here at the end.

2514
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:08,660
This is so fun.

2515
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:12,120
Let's exit through the plug Kronos.

2516
01:48:12,220 --> 01:48:13,820
Is there anything you would like to plug?

2517
01:48:13,980 --> 01:48:16,020
You actually do have something I want to plug.

2518
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:20,540
And you know, since we did something special for Club 3, I had something in mind for a

2519
01:48:20,540 --> 01:48:22,860
future Club 3 episode.

2520
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:27,960
So let me just kind of just lay all my cards out on the table.

2521
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:37,480
Literally Cruella DeVille, Doc, Christopher Robin, Bachel, Gaston, Gaston again, the

2522
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:39,800
Queen, Judy Hopps, Gumbo Pot.

2523
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:40,760
What is that?

2524
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:42,280
And Winnie the Pooh.

2525
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:47,020
Mike Carlson, Club 3, I want to challenge you to a match of Disney Lorcanas.

2526
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:48,260
Holy shit.

2527
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:50,060
Oh my God.

2528
01:48:50,060 --> 01:48:51,640
The challenge has been laid out.

2529
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:52,880
Oh my God.

2530
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:54,440
It's going to be awful audio content.

2531
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:57,280
It'll be an unlistenable card game we don't understand.

2532
01:48:57,880 --> 01:49:00,320
I think you two can play the card game.

2533
01:49:00,540 --> 01:49:03,820
Scott and I can do color commentary like it's a World Series.

2534
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:04,880
Okay, all right.

2535
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:07,620
Nick has dropped the Gumbo Pot.

2536
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:11,360
While no participant knows what the Gumbo Pot is or where it comes from.

2537
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:15,120
And we have to assume it has a great power against Winnie the Pooh.

2538
01:49:15,260 --> 01:49:19,480
It removes one damage from each up to two chosen characters.

2539
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:24,180
Oh, and Judy Hopps is here like all cops.

2540
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:27,820
She has begun opening fire on Winnie the Pooh.

2541
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:31,780
Just pumping AR rounds into him.

2542
01:49:33,500 --> 01:49:35,000
Don't ask questions, shoot him.

2543
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:36,920
What's there coming out of him?

2544
01:49:37,300 --> 01:49:38,660
Stuffing, not blood.

2545
01:49:38,980 --> 01:49:39,920
He's a vile.

2546
01:49:40,420 --> 01:49:43,060
101 Dalmatians are coming right forward.

2547
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:45,280
She's switched it to full auto.

2548
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:51,620
Actually, I do have a Rise of the Floodborne expansion pack deck that is sealed.

2549
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:52,260
Rise of the Floodborne?

2550
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:54,580
If we want to unbox that here.

2551
01:49:55,460 --> 01:49:57,920
This is one of their expansion packs.

2552
01:49:58,360 --> 01:49:59,200
Yeah, the Floodborne.

2553
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:00,800
I have not bought Floodborne yet.

2554
01:50:00,940 --> 01:50:01,720
I just have the first round.

2555
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:02,420
Do you want to do the honor?

2556
01:50:02,580 --> 01:50:03,660
You want to open your pack?

2557
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:04,220
Yeah, sure.

2558
01:50:04,340 --> 01:50:06,040
Let's do the whole thing here.

2559
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:08,380
This is a good test for how it'll play.

2560
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:10,320
So you'll get to hear the crinkle of the card.

2561
01:50:10,460 --> 01:50:11,100
People love that.

2562
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:11,940
People love it.

2563
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:12,960
They actually do.

2564
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:13,880
I'm going to take a sip of my tea.

2565
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:14,860
It's ASMR.

2566
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:20,160
We have a Legend of the Sword and the Stone right here.

2567
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:20,840
That looks like a…

2568
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:21,960
We're right on live.

2569
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,500
These are some regular cards.

2570
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:24,520
These are not rare.

2571
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:25,280
Right.

2572
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,040
Is it Raya?

2573
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:27,160
Is that Raya?

2574
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:29,380
Raya from Raya and the Last Dragon.

2575
01:50:29,380 --> 01:50:30,820
What's the app for the famous people to hook up?

2576
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:31,480
Is that Raya?

2577
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:34,120
Well, here is a card for that app.

2578
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:35,460
Representing an app, not a character.

2579
01:50:35,580 --> 01:50:36,260
What a pull, Jason.

2580
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:39,060
Enchantress from what?

2581
01:50:39,080 --> 01:50:40,580
Ooh, a little risque for Mike.

2582
01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:41,600
Wouldn't you say, Jason?

2583
01:50:41,620 --> 01:50:42,300
I don't like that.

2584
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:43,660
I would say so.

2585
01:50:43,860 --> 01:50:46,580
He's pushing that card away with a lot of force.

2586
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:49,120
There's a popsicle.

2587
01:50:49,300 --> 01:50:51,500
Is that from some sort of dog movie?

2588
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:53,840
Which one is that?

2589
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,360
It's an item at Fresh Eats, I believe.

2590
01:50:59,760 --> 01:50:59,960
Okay.

2591
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:01,040
Painting the roses red.

2592
01:51:01,060 --> 01:51:02,800
Of course, that's from Alice in Wonderland.

2593
01:51:02,820 --> 01:51:07,300
Some of these cards, Jason, I'm determining are concepts and activities, not characters.

2594
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:13,960
Again, these are all pretty regular cards.

2595
01:51:14,180 --> 01:51:17,200
That's a great underpowered Hercules we've got there.

2596
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:19,300
Mike might kind of undercut the whole thing,

2597
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:21,340
said he's not impressed by any of these cards.

2598
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:22,820
Well, they're good cards so far.

2599
01:51:23,060 --> 01:51:25,460
I'm looking for rarity also.

2600
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:29,560
The rarities are the big ticket items and they're also sometimes the most powerful cards.

2601
01:51:29,900 --> 01:51:30,980
This is the sword and the stone.

2602
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:34,960
Now we're getting a little rarer, but it's not anything crazy yet.

2603
01:51:35,340 --> 01:51:35,680
Pacha.

2604
01:51:36,220 --> 01:51:37,320
What's that character's name?

2605
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:38,320
Pacha.

2606
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:42,820
Pacha from the Embers New Groove.

2607
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:43,700
He dropped Pacha.

2608
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:45,080
Pacha is down.

2609
01:51:45,260 --> 01:51:46,020
We've got to drop Pacha.

2610
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:48,280
Pacha is unplayable, covered in stains.

2611
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:48,740
Yeah.

2612
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:50,320
We got Tiana here.

2613
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:50,840
This is regular.

2614
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:51,900
This is Tiana, True Princess.

2615
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:54,440
Is this Patrick Warburton's character or is this a different character?

2616
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:54,960
Could be.

2617
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:55,700
Could be.

2618
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:56,040
Okay.

2619
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:57,560
Now we have some more rare card.

2620
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:59,180
Here's a couple rarer cards here.

2621
01:52:00,220 --> 01:52:01,180
Merlin Shapeshifter.

2622
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,040
Oh, that's fun.

2623
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:03,060
That's pretty fun.

2624
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:05,160
We've got a Merlin pull.

2625
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:06,500
We've got another.

2626
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:11,500
We've got another Raya or Raya card and that's a rarer card.

2627
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:13,700
That's a leader of heart.

2628
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:14,240
It says.

2629
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:17,780
I'm not sure how I feel about there being the same characters having multiple

2630
01:52:17,780 --> 01:52:21,200
rarities that like, like, like I get two different guest stones here.

2631
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:23,760
And to me as a player, I'm just a little confused by that.

2632
01:52:24,180 --> 01:52:25,280
I know how I feel about it.

2633
01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:25,820
Bored.

2634
01:52:28,360 --> 01:52:31,980
And then we have here the last one you have Binding Contract, which I

2635
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:33,180
think is from Little Mermaid.

2636
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:34,820
Oh, that's, that's, I like that.

2637
01:52:34,820 --> 01:52:35,280
Cool.

2638
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:35,880
Wait a minute.

2639
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:36,340
It's a cool idea.

2640
01:52:36,380 --> 01:52:37,580
Look at the text on that.

2641
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:37,920
Yeah.

2642
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:46,740
The podcast, the ride boys have to do another saga within the next three calendar

2643
01:52:46,740 --> 01:52:47,060
years.

2644
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:47,640
Wait a minute.

2645
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:48,260
Oh boy.

2646
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:48,860
What the fuck?

2647
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:52,740
Well, I did sell, I wanted to be a real boy.

2648
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:56,080
So I did make an agreement with Ursula.

2649
01:52:56,140 --> 01:52:57,140
Oh yeah, sure.

2650
01:52:57,340 --> 01:52:59,120
I thought you looked a little less stiff today.

2651
01:52:59,120 --> 01:52:59,420
Yeah.

2652
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:01,900
What is that other card you have in your hand?

2653
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:03,660
It looks like the piece of a puzzle.

2654
01:53:03,660 --> 01:53:05,840
It's just sort of, it's a QR code for the game.

2655
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:08,560
Oh, it's a QR code on how to play the game.

2656
01:53:08,860 --> 01:53:10,220
It's the rules of the game.

2657
01:53:10,540 --> 01:53:11,320
It's the rules of the game.

2658
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:12,100
So there you go.

2659
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:14,700
I think an okay pull, an okay pull.

2660
01:53:14,780 --> 01:53:15,860
You didn't get anything mega rare.

2661
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:18,480
You didn't get anything crazy, but it's a pretty good pull.

2662
01:53:18,660 --> 01:53:20,980
I brought some surplus sleeves so we can make sure these things

2663
01:53:20,980 --> 01:53:22,460
don't get damaged in transit.

2664
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:24,420
You do need to, where do you pick up your sleeves?

2665
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:25,480
Cause I need some sleeves.

2666
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:28,680
Shout out to, and this is not in your neighborhood, but shout out to it's

2667
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:30,540
game time over on the West side.

2668
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:31,800
Great card store there.

2669
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:36,500
And shout out to Brett, uh, who reassured me that Lorcona is for all ages.

2670
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:38,640
So it's okay for me to buy.

2671
01:53:41,380 --> 01:53:44,880
And he said that while you were grabbing him by the shirt collar saying,

2672
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:46,580
is this okay for me?

2673
01:53:47,460 --> 01:53:50,600
Having borrowed a child to bring in, to make it more acceptable.

2674
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,760
You asked for a kid off Craig's list.

2675
01:53:53,860 --> 01:53:58,540
Look, I've eaten his at Chuck E cheese as an unaccompanied adult for a, uh, for

2676
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:01,240
content, so buying Disney Lorcona cards is nothing.

2677
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:05,380
Parts about having a kid is not getting the Chuck E cheese side eye.

2678
01:54:05,420 --> 01:54:07,640
And yeah, it's been great.

2679
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:11,640
Um, but then you don't get two numbered stamps on your hand.

2680
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:13,960
The kid gets one and you get one.

2681
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:17,960
I don't know if they're still using that system they used 20 years ago.

2682
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:22,140
Well, they still have it technically, but they don't seem to put a lot of care into it.

2683
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:24,560
That's my review of the kit check system.

2684
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:27,100
Um, well, this was fantastic.

2685
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:27,980
Thank you for closing it.

2686
01:54:28,020 --> 01:54:29,620
And what a, what a seed that you've planted.

2687
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:30,360
We'll figure out.

2688
01:54:30,360 --> 01:54:31,440
I got to put together.

2689
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:32,580
You got to make this happen.

2690
01:54:32,660 --> 01:54:33,060
Yeah.

2691
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:35,340
All this Walter Lans talk reminds me.

2692
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:36,960
We got to do that.

2693
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:38,560
Woody Woodpecker episode.

2694
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:40,680
So much about.

2695
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:43,980
Oh, I don't remember anything before the saga.

2696
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:45,740
We did talk about doing a walk.

2697
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:46,980
But I think, you know what?

2698
01:54:47,180 --> 01:54:48,120
I think it's not a Woody Woodpecker.

2699
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:50,740
I think we could do what he would pick her, but I think first we should do

2700
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:56,340
Walter Lans in his later years episode specifically about the man over 60, when

2701
01:54:56,340 --> 01:54:58,800
he was over 60, so nothing he did before 60.

2702
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Well, this is the.

2703
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,440
I also have real quick.

2704
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:02,840
I have an announcement to make.

2705
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:05,840
Uh, uh, well, I got a piece of information that has been confirmed.

2706
01:55:06,220 --> 01:55:09,320
You could smoke a cigarette in cigars in Orlando.

2707
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:10,120
Wow.

2708
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:13,820
So just to confirm it, you could smoke in cigars.

2709
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:14,300
Thank God.

2710
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:16,700
This guy's got the fallen brother.

2711
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:17,280
Wow.

2712
01:55:17,540 --> 01:55:17,580
Wow.

2713
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:20,080
Cigarettes with a Z were allowed in cigars.

2714
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:20,840
That's correct.

2715
01:55:20,980 --> 01:55:21,560
Well, this is it.

2716
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:22,780
We're tying up all the loose ends.

2717
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:26,900
Oh, and, and it has been confirmed by more than one person that city walk used

2718
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:31,320
to be the party destination versus a downtown Disney.

2719
01:55:31,380 --> 01:55:33,580
It was pretty good.

2720
01:55:33,660 --> 01:55:37,580
I found a lot of this is more than one source is back this up.

2721
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:38,940
I would say at least three to four.

2722
01:55:38,980 --> 01:55:42,660
Well, it's been confirmed by a lot of people on Twitter that people's parents

2723
01:55:42,660 --> 01:55:47,400
certainly can't name more than two Jimmy Buffett songs very often.

2724
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:49,880
Well, who, I mean, this is not a random sample.

2725
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:54,160
I don't think we need a full parents are the generation that would and should

2726
01:55:54,160 --> 01:55:56,020
know his music more than any other.

2727
01:55:56,020 --> 01:55:59,160
Well, we just asked this recently, so we don't have a full picture.

2728
01:55:59,380 --> 01:55:59,440
Yes.

2729
01:55:59,700 --> 01:56:03,140
Results are still the next saga will reveal the results of this.

2730
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:08,300
And, and most of our audience did not know the song black balloon.

2731
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:11,980
Yeah, but don't even, you should not have brought this up at the end of this

2732
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:16,920
episode, Joe, you really made a fucking mistake here because that, that anger

2733
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:18,220
in your voice is real.

2734
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:20,060
It's primal real primal anger.

2735
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:20,680
Yes.

2736
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:25,480
We needed a clip of the song in the no, no, we recreated the conditions.

2737
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:26,780
We needed a clip.

2738
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:31,240
Mike, the conditions were you saying the song, the title black balloon.

2739
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:32,300
I didn't know it.

2740
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:33,200
You said, what do you mean?

2741
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:34,180
You don't know black balloon.

2742
01:56:34,340 --> 01:56:35,740
I didn't get to hear the song.

2743
01:56:36,020 --> 01:56:38,640
Thus neither did the listeners, the same exact condition.

2744
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:40,140
It was a valid thing to do.

2745
01:56:40,340 --> 01:56:40,960
We did not agree on this.

2746
01:56:41,260 --> 01:56:41,940
We did not agree on this.

2747
01:56:42,020 --> 01:56:43,560
We'll be settled in the next saga as well.

2748
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:47,360
In the time it's taken, Nick has packed up all of the cards and we've already

2749
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:51,300
let him go and we should let Jason give one more thing.

2750
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:53,680
Uh, did, was there a stone?

2751
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:55,580
It was the coin.

2752
01:56:55,720 --> 01:56:56,840
It was the coin.

2753
01:56:56,840 --> 01:56:58,460
It was in front of me all along.

2754
01:56:58,620 --> 01:56:59,120
That's right.

2755
01:56:59,120 --> 01:57:00,480
It's the Liger gets to go home with it.

2756
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:05,480
And now we will leave you Nick and we will, uh, leave the video portion of this.

2757
01:57:05,580 --> 01:57:09,240
We're going to turn the cameras off so that we can check in with the sector

2758
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:12,300
keeper and find out what we do now.

2759
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:15,540
Because honestly, I don't know how this ends.

2760
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:19,260
And now we find out boys, boys.

2761
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:20,420
Hey, all right.

2762
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:21,200
Oh, good.

2763
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:21,880
We found you.

2764
01:57:21,940 --> 01:57:22,520
Oh my God.

2765
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:23,940
We're, we're at the end.

2766
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:24,580
We've done it all.

2767
01:57:24,620 --> 01:57:26,480
We've talked about the parking garages.

2768
01:57:26,660 --> 01:57:26,880
Yes.

2769
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:27,760
Thank you, Mr.

2770
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:28,480
Weger.

2771
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:29,840
Yeah, did a great job.

2772
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:34,240
And now we can finally figure out how we can seal up this rift.

2773
01:57:34,260 --> 01:57:38,920
And I know time is of the essence, but, uh, and the clock's ticking away, but I

2774
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:42,360
still really quick want to ask you sector keeper, do you know the

2775
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:44,360
goo goo dolls song, black balloon?

2776
01:57:46,860 --> 01:57:47,820
Black balloon.

2777
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:48,960
Doesn't sound like he does.

2778
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:50,780
Mike was younger though.

2779
01:57:50,780 --> 01:57:52,780
He must've missed that part of the.

2780
01:57:52,780 --> 01:57:53,580
It's pretty mixed.

2781
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:58,840
Now sector keeper, you can't just tell us the solution to this all was friendship.

2782
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:01,560
Cause that was your excuse last time.

2783
01:58:01,640 --> 01:58:01,840
Okay.

2784
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:05,220
We got to get this thing figured out, seal up that rift so we can be done with this.

2785
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:08,560
So I don't know where do we go and how do we get there?

2786
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:09,560
Is there a jump point?

2787
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:10,360
Is there a portal?

2788
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:11,280
What do we do now?

2789
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:13,560
Well, there's a way, but we haven't discussed it yet.

2790
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:14,120
Okay.

2791
01:58:14,220 --> 01:58:16,100
A different means of travel.

2792
01:58:16,940 --> 01:58:17,900
A star gate.

2793
01:58:17,900 --> 01:58:19,200
Hold on.

2794
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:20,800
Star gates are in place.

2795
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:21,420
Star gates are in place.

2796
01:58:21,460 --> 01:58:22,660
I'm used to it by now.

2797
01:58:22,700 --> 01:58:23,700
Let's just get in there.

2798
01:58:23,740 --> 01:58:24,600
Let's get this done.

2799
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:27,960
Scott, you hold Mike's hand.

2800
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:29,540
Mike, you hold my little hand.

2801
01:58:29,860 --> 01:58:29,980
Okay.

2802
01:58:30,020 --> 01:58:30,700
Oh yeah, it is a little.

2803
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:34,540
All your hands are so clammy from malnutrition, but it's okay.

2804
01:58:34,580 --> 01:58:35,240
We'll do it.

2805
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:36,260
Let's go.

2806
01:58:36,780 --> 01:58:40,820
And we're here.

2807
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:41,320
Yes.

2808
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:41,900
Oh wow.

2809
01:58:42,020 --> 01:58:42,240
Whoa.

2810
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:43,740
I know this place.

2811
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:44,980
Yeah, but it's CityWalk.

2812
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:45,580
Of course you know.

2813
01:58:45,580 --> 01:58:45,840
It's different.

2814
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:47,040
Yes, obviously it's CityWalk.

2815
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,520
It's a CityWalk.

2816
01:58:49,220 --> 01:58:52,300
Well, I guess it makes sense that it would end all here where it all began.

2817
01:58:52,540 --> 01:58:53,440
Hollywood, baby.

2818
01:58:54,020 --> 01:58:54,140
Yeah.

2819
01:58:54,140 --> 01:58:55,420
Jason, what are you trying to say?

2820
01:58:55,560 --> 01:58:57,940
It's not our CityWalk.

2821
01:58:58,180 --> 01:58:59,420
Look, there's wizards.

2822
01:58:59,580 --> 01:59:01,900
There's Chode Maroney's Sausage Kingdom.

2823
01:59:02,300 --> 01:59:02,620
That's right.

2824
01:59:02,700 --> 01:59:04,000
It's not Antejitos.

2825
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:06,220
It's Camacho's Cantina.

2826
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:08,220
It's not Abercrombie and Finch.

2827
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:09,760
It's Sam Goody.

2828
01:59:09,960 --> 01:59:10,460
That's right.

2829
01:59:10,740 --> 01:59:10,820
Fitch.

2830
01:59:10,980 --> 01:59:11,500
It's Abercrombie and Fitch.

2831
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:12,040
And it's not.

2832
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:13,360
It was never Finch, I guess.

2833
01:59:13,540 --> 01:59:14,720
You're learning, boys.

2834
01:59:14,820 --> 01:59:15,440
You're learning.

2835
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:20,720
And they haven't yet put up the sign that says John Lovett's Comedy Club and then

2836
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:22,280
taken away the John Lovett's part.

2837
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:25,080
And then it just says Comedy Club, even though there isn't a comedy club.

2838
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:26,080
None of that is here.

2839
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:29,480
What kind of weird fucked up CityWalk is this?

2840
01:59:29,620 --> 01:59:32,200
Look how fresh the paint is on the Johnny Rockets sign.

2841
01:59:32,300 --> 01:59:33,200
It's beautiful.

2842
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:36,540
Students are going into the UCLA Extension class.

2843
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:38,600
Yes, the UCLA is finally thriving.

2844
01:59:38,780 --> 01:59:39,480
It was true.

2845
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:40,100
Wait a minute.

2846
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:44,180
We're in the CityWalk of the early to mid 90s.

2847
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:44,640
Wow.

2848
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:46,480
What else do you see?

2849
01:59:49,620 --> 01:59:51,500
The dancing fountains, of course.

2850
01:59:51,980 --> 01:59:52,760
Listen closely.

2851
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:54,660
What do you hear in the distance?

2852
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:56,420
Hey, Stevie.

2853
01:59:56,780 --> 01:59:57,920
Where do you want to eat, bud?

2854
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:00,000
Dad, I want to go on eat tea again.

2855
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,400
I want to see Botanicus.

2856
02:00:02,280 --> 02:00:03,480
Stevie, come on.

2857
02:00:03,480 --> 02:00:04,540
We left the park.

2858
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:06,140
We're at CityWalk now.

2859
02:00:06,140 --> 02:00:07,340
We need to eat dinner.

2860
02:00:07,980 --> 02:00:09,620
I don't want to eat dinner.

2861
02:00:09,860 --> 02:00:10,740
I want to go over there.

2862
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:12,120
I want to play in that fountain.

2863
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:14,020
Oh, my God.

2864
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:17,080
That's you, Sector Keeper, and your family.

2865
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:18,160
That's right, Michael.

2866
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:20,820
That's me, little Stevie Keppner,

2867
02:00:21,260 --> 02:00:23,840
mere minutes before I contracted the staph infection

2868
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:25,520
that turned me into a ghost.

2869
02:00:25,700 --> 02:00:26,300
Wait a minute.

2870
02:00:26,340 --> 02:00:28,060
So you brought us back to the moment

2871
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:29,100
before you went into the fountain.

2872
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:29,560
Why?

2873
02:00:30,180 --> 02:00:32,760
Boys, you know why.

2874
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:36,580
You want us to stop it from ever happening?

2875
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:38,640
That is right.

2876
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:40,440
Guys, if that's what we got to do,

2877
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:41,560
then that's what we got to do.

2878
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:43,140
We have to get into that fountain,

2879
02:00:43,140 --> 02:00:44,740
stop him from getting the infection.

2880
02:00:44,940 --> 02:00:46,840
We got to save the Sector Keeper's life.

2881
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:49,640
If we stop that little kid from running into the fountain,

2882
02:00:49,820 --> 02:00:52,120
the Sector Keeper we know will never have existed.

2883
02:00:52,580 --> 02:00:54,260
Our friend will be erased forever.

2884
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:56,600
Wait, but Sector Keeper.

2885
02:00:56,740 --> 02:00:57,440
Call me Stevie.

2886
02:00:58,400 --> 02:00:58,840
Or Steve.

2887
02:00:59,120 --> 02:00:59,660
Sorry, Stevie.

2888
02:00:59,740 --> 02:01:00,600
I'm still getting used to it.

2889
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:02,100
Stevie, is Mike right?

2890
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:03,480
Is that going to erase you?

2891
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:04,320
That can't be right.

2892
02:01:04,760 --> 02:01:05,860
No, no, Scott.

2893
02:01:05,900 --> 02:01:06,800
That is right.

2894
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:10,720
I need to die so that young me can live.

2895
02:01:11,580 --> 02:01:13,120
Stevie, why do you want this?

2896
02:01:13,140 --> 02:01:15,300
Weren't we having fun going to church,

2897
02:01:15,460 --> 02:01:16,420
horsing around?

2898
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:18,160
It's been fun with you all,

2899
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:20,340
but it hasn't been great otherwise.

2900
02:01:21,020 --> 02:01:23,720
I had an abusive cricket wireless internship.

2901
02:01:24,260 --> 02:01:27,880
I developed a vape addiction that led to a cigarette addiction.

2902
02:01:28,620 --> 02:01:31,760
I won a billion dollar powerball that ended up being a curse

2903
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:35,120
worse than all of these sagas and ordeals combined.

2904
02:01:35,660 --> 02:01:38,240
Extended family of ghosts hounding me every day

2905
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:40,380
for cash that I don't even have anymore.

2906
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:42,360
I need to be honest.

2907
02:01:43,460 --> 02:01:47,160
It's all led to me never knowing my real family.

2908
02:01:47,860 --> 02:01:48,920
Okay, hey, bud, bud,

2909
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:50,880
we need to choose what we're having for dinner.

2910
02:01:51,340 --> 02:01:53,100
Tony Romans or Bubba Gump?

2911
02:01:54,180 --> 02:01:56,260
Uh, I choose…

2912
02:01:58,240 --> 02:01:59,760
I want to be human again.

2913
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:03,260
I want to pet the Boston Dynamics dog at Dr.

2914
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:03,960
Toothsums.

2915
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:05,520
I want to grow older.

2916
02:02:05,880 --> 02:02:08,620
I want to have the experience Mike has where

2917
02:02:08,620 --> 02:02:12,500
people are surprised by his age because of how youthful he seems.

2918
02:02:13,140 --> 02:02:14,520
It is nice when that happens.

2919
02:02:14,740 --> 02:02:18,900
But don't worry, I'll grow up and become the human being

2920
02:02:18,900 --> 02:02:20,760
I always was meant to be.

2921
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:22,480
I'll live a full life,

2922
02:02:23,420 --> 02:02:26,200
but I'll have no memory of our adventures together.

2923
02:02:26,860 --> 02:02:29,280
And I'll also have no memory of anything you've said

2924
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:31,080
about the various Starbucks locations.

2925
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:33,720
You won't remember us?

2926
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:37,260
No, Jason, but you three will remember me,

2927
02:02:37,720 --> 02:02:42,440
and you, the listener, will remember me too.

2928
02:02:43,140 --> 02:02:44,560
There has to be some other way.

2929
02:02:44,900 --> 02:02:46,360
This just doesn't seem necessary.

2930
02:02:46,780 --> 02:02:48,140
I'm afraid it is, Scott.

2931
02:02:48,580 --> 02:02:51,660
In fact, it's extremely necessary.

2932
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:55,340
I choose Bubba Gump.

2933
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:58,160
Okay, let's go put our names in.

2934
02:02:58,620 --> 02:02:59,640
We're running out of time.

2935
02:02:59,700 --> 02:03:01,220
It's gonna happen in a matter of minutes.

2936
02:03:01,780 --> 02:03:03,080
Okay, what do we do?

2937
02:03:03,160 --> 02:03:03,780
What do we do?

2938
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:04,120
Do we have the water?

2939
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:05,500
Where's the water valve?

2940
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:06,540
Should we tackle?

2941
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:07,900
We can't tackle a child.

2942
02:03:08,140 --> 02:03:09,580
No, no, you can't tackle me.

2943
02:03:09,680 --> 02:03:11,780
There's still some security guards here.

2944
02:03:11,780 --> 02:03:12,840
What do we do?

2945
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:13,800
Don't wait until the mid-90s.

2946
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:15,100
You can't just tackle a child.

2947
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:16,820
What if we go in the fountain?

2948
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:17,880
Oh, that's right.

2949
02:03:18,220 --> 02:03:19,000
We can get in there,

2950
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,560
dominate the entire space with our large adult bodies.

2951
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:23,520
Yes, yes, three adults' bodies.

2952
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:24,940
Then no kids can fit.

2953
02:03:25,200 --> 02:03:27,680
Boys, boys, you've learned, you've learned.

2954
02:03:27,880 --> 02:03:30,100
You need to use your three adult bodies.

2955
02:03:30,540 --> 02:03:32,120
Hey, Stevie, where are you going?

2956
02:03:32,300 --> 02:03:33,520
I'm just gonna go play in the water.

2957
02:03:33,540 --> 02:03:34,740
It'll be fine.

2958
02:03:35,700 --> 02:03:37,880
Okay, well, just make sure I can see you

2959
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:38,960
while I'm at the host stand.

2960
02:03:39,680 --> 02:03:41,860
Hey, mister, don't take off that bandaid.

2961
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:43,040
You don't want to get that cut wet.

2962
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:44,660
Boys, boys, act now.

2963
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:46,140
I'm about to run into the fountain.

2964
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:48,820
Before you go, though, check your bodies.

2965
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:50,220
Any cuts or wounds?

2966
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:51,020
That's right.

2967
02:03:51,060 --> 02:03:51,880
Oh, we can't get staff.

2968
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:52,620
Okay, okay.

2969
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:53,680
No, no, I'm good.

2970
02:03:53,860 --> 02:03:54,440
I don't think so.

2971
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:54,700
Yeah, I'm good.

2972
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:55,560
Jason, too.

2973
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:55,980
All right.

2974
02:03:56,220 --> 02:03:56,700
Get some scrapes.

2975
02:03:56,780 --> 02:03:57,700
We're gonna be staff-free.

2976
02:03:57,720 --> 02:03:58,520
But they're scabbed?

2977
02:03:58,720 --> 02:04:00,900
No, they are scabbed.

2978
02:04:00,940 --> 02:04:01,680
You're good, then.

2979
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:02,320
Okay.

2980
02:04:02,500 --> 02:04:03,520
Okay, scabs are fine.

2981
02:04:03,580 --> 02:04:05,040
Okay, now we know the rules of this.

2982
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:06,920
I'm about to get soaked.

2983
02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:08,380
This stupid bandaid.

2984
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:09,520
I've been wearing it all day.

2985
02:04:09,640 --> 02:04:10,620
I'm ripping it off.

2986
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:12,560
I'm gonna let my cut breathe.

2987
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:16,100
You guys, sometimes it feels like this podcast

2988
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:17,680
is a pointless, silly endeavor.

2989
02:04:18,340 --> 02:04:21,000
But I think all of it has been leading up to this moment.

2990
02:04:21,480 --> 02:04:24,040
Let's go run around in that fountain meant for children

2991
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:25,360
and save a life.

2992
02:04:25,700 --> 02:04:26,360
Let's go!

2993
02:04:26,460 --> 02:04:27,340
Yeah, let's go!

2994
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:28,220
Let's go!

2995
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:30,740
Boys, boys, yes, you're doing it.

2996
02:04:30,860 --> 02:04:31,900
I, I, look at me.

2997
02:04:31,940 --> 02:04:33,640
I'm, I'm not going in.

2998
02:04:33,820 --> 02:04:34,880
I'm getting bored.

2999
02:04:35,260 --> 02:04:36,680
Now I'm distracted.

3000
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:39,980
Boys, boys, I'm running away.

3001
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,940
I'm, I'm giving a big hug to Shrimp Louie.

3002
02:04:44,680 --> 02:04:47,100
And now my mom and dad.

3003
02:04:47,420 --> 02:04:48,660
Oh, what happened, Stevie?

3004
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:50,800
I thought you wanted to go splash around.

3005
02:04:51,380 --> 02:04:55,340
I did, but then I saw these three creeps and uh,

3006
02:04:55,340 --> 02:04:58,600
oh, can I have one of those red ice cream smoothies?

3007
02:04:58,820 --> 02:05:00,180
Sure, of course you can.

3008
02:05:00,340 --> 02:05:01,880
Says there's no alcohol in them.

3009
02:05:03,060 --> 02:05:04,540
Boys, boys, you did it.

3010
02:05:04,540 --> 02:05:06,080
Thank you, thank you.

3011
02:05:06,080 --> 02:05:07,200
We did it.

3012
02:05:07,240 --> 02:05:07,980
We did what you wanted.

3013
02:05:08,100 --> 02:05:09,580
Without a beginning, there's an end.

3014
02:05:09,620 --> 02:05:11,620
What was once dry is now wet.

3015
02:05:12,540 --> 02:05:13,260
That's true.

3016
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:14,220
Wow, you're right.

3017
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:16,260
Everything you said does make sense.

3018
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:18,280
Wait a minute, but, but look at you.

3019
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:19,760
Sector keeper, you're fading away.

3020
02:05:20,480 --> 02:05:21,280
You're getting weak.

3021
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:26,080
No, no, boys, you've given me strength more than ever before.

3022
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:30,700
And now I give you strength to let me go.

3023
02:05:31,860 --> 02:05:33,280
Sector keeper, no, no, don't go.

3024
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:33,940
Let him go.

3025
02:05:33,940 --> 02:05:35,680
No, he needs to.

3026
02:05:36,080 --> 02:05:37,360
Goodbye, Stevie.

3027
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:39,180
Goodbye.

3028
02:05:40,060 --> 02:05:41,460
We're going to miss you.

3029
02:05:42,220 --> 02:05:43,400
Good luck, sector keeper.

3030
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:46,020
Goodbye.

3031
02:05:46,740 --> 02:05:51,700

Wow.

3036
02:06:11,100 --> 02:06:11,840
Are we back?

Yeah, we're back.

Do you think this is the right place?

3058

Yeah, I do.

3059
02:08:05,260 --> 02:08:05,980
Let's try it.

3060
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:10,700
Hello, can I help you gentlemen?

3061
02:08:11,320 --> 02:08:11,580
Yeah.

3062
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:14,160
Hi, weird question.

3063
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:16,560
Are you Stevie Kepner?

3064
02:08:17,660 --> 02:08:19,240
Yeah, I'm Dr.

3065
02:08:19,420 --> 02:08:19,960
Steven Kepner.

3066
02:08:19,980 --> 02:08:20,720
What do you ask?

3067
02:08:21,800 --> 02:08:23,300
It's kind of hard to explain.

3068
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:26,140
Sorry, do I know you guys?

3069
02:08:26,620 --> 02:08:32,940
Not exactly, but you're a lot like someone we knew, kind of a fallen brother.

3070
02:08:32,940 --> 02:08:34,580
Blah blah blah blah.

3071
02:08:34,580 --> 02:08:37,380
Sorry, my three sons are being quite the handful right now.

3072
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:40,360
Boys, boys, calm down please.

3073
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:41,640
Thank you.

3074
02:08:42,100 --> 02:08:43,940
Can I help you guys with anything or?

3075
02:08:44,780 --> 02:08:47,420
No, that was everything we needed.

3076
02:08:48,860 --> 02:08:50,220
It was good to see you.

3077
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:51,500
Yeah, really good.

3078
02:08:53,020 --> 02:08:54,060
Oh, okay.

3079
02:08:54,220 --> 02:08:57,600
All right, well nice meeting and talking to you wherever you guys are.

3080
02:08:58,340 --> 02:08:59,220
Take care.

3081
02:09:02,300 --> 02:09:06,820
Michael, you too, Michael, let Jason eat his cookies and milk in peace please.

3082
02:09:07,320 --> 02:09:08,640
Jason, finish your cookies and milk.

3083
02:09:09,100 --> 02:09:10,460
Mike, you had a dessert.

3084
02:09:10,620 --> 02:09:12,120
You wanted a bowl full of sprinkles.

3085
02:09:13,120 --> 02:09:16,640
And Scott, Scott, did you throw up on the rug over here?

3086
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:20,160
Now, why did I tell you about eating hamburgers and sushi at the same time, bud?
