1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,360
Hey guys, before the episode starts,

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,900
we have a quick little announcement.

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,320
We wanted you on the second gate to be the first to know.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,280
Mike, would you like to explain what's going on?

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,320
I guess so.

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,640
Folks, if you know what San Diego Comic-Con is,

7
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,080
it's the largest, what, Jason, what is it?

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,440
The pop culture convention?

9
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,280
What do they call it now?

10
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,100
The pop culture event?

11
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,880
Yeah, the pop culture event of the year.

12
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,720
It's a giant.

13
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,560
You've never heard of it.

14
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,400
You've never heard of it.

15
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,560
100,000 people go to San Diego,

16
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,480
clog up the streets,

17
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,320
and they have fun going to different panels.

18
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,440
Get yelled at by people with religious signs.

19
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,280
You're all selling this so hard.

20
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,440
Here's the thing, I'm describing

21
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,660
what my favorite time of the year,

22
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,900
I'm so excited to go,

23
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,640
and I'm extra excited this year

24
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,160
because we are going down and doing something there

25
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,680
at the official convention.

26
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,240
Podcast The Ride is hosting a panel

27
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,280
in conjunction with Mattel, the real Mattel Company.

28
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,600
We're actually working with Mattel.

29
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,040
We are working with Mattel.

30
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,840
We went to Mattel for a meeting.

31
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,480
No joke, and we are going to be doing a show

32
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,360
with the topic of the street sharks.

33
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,200
They're back.

34
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,360
They're back, 30th anniversary street sharks.

35
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,680
Podcast The Ride, ex-street sharks, ex-Mattel.

36
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,280
It's happening at Comic-Con.

37
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,400
We can't say exactly the day and time yet,

38
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,640
but that will come out within a week or so.

39
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,240
So just keep it peeled,

40
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,920
so you'll catch it through our media.

41
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,240
We'll make sure you know about it.

42
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,320
But if you're already going to Comic-Con,

43
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,480
just know, be on the lookout,

44
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,560
because we might pop up as might Slammoo.

45
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,400
We will pop up.

46
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,220
Around every corner.

47
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,060
And Slammoo will pop up.

48
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,220
With our big action, our fast action fists.

49
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,780
Our jaws will be moving when we talk about it

50
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,900
on this live podcast, essentially, we're doing.

51
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,940
But yes, if you're going to Comic-Con,

52
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,620
Comic-Con is sold out, but there's still ways to go.

53
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,980
So if you're thinking about it,

54
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,660
let's get on it right now,

55
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,260
because you want to see us chat

56
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,100
about all the different sharks and all the mythology.

57
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,300
Mike, will you personally check your way,

58
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,860
check the listener's way in to get them in there?

59
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,700
I'm putting a lot on you,

60
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,540
That is hard to do.

61
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,300
What's the kind of thing you'd like to do?

62
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,020
It is a thing I'd like to do,

63
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,620
but yes, I don't think I can personally get you in,

64
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,780
is really, is the situation.

65
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,100
But I believe you, in your own personal life,

66
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,580
should look for shenanigans, how you could get in.

67
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,940
And I think that would be possible.

68
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,580
So if you're in San Diego.

69
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,420
But yeah, you need a badge.

70
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,100
You're going to the con already.

71
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,780
You do need a badge to attend whatever this is.

72
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,340
So just in case you think it's like a separate,

73
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,740
it's just like, you have to be going already.

74
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,580
Yes.

75
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,400
And don't go down there.

76
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,480
Get out and sanction our tomfoolery.

77
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,240
Yes, sanction our tomfoolery and come see us

78
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,200
at the official Street Sharks panel,

79
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,320
podcast the ride, X-Metal,

80
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,680
a Comic-Con exclusive presentation in just a few weeks.

81
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,080
We hope to see you down there.

82
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,880
Five, four, three, two, one.

83
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,400
Welcome to the second, second gate,

84
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,720
exclusive PTR post office here on podcast,

85
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,200
the ride, the second gate.

86
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,680
Like I said, second, just enough to make that confusing.

87
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,360
I'm Scott Gardner, it's Mike Carlson.

88
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,940
Yes, I am the second introduction on the show today.

89
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,940
My name is Mike Carlson and I am a second place in the,

90
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,540
let's see, treat race in general,

91
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,220
as far as having treats, I would say.

92
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,100
Okay, yeah, I guess so.

93
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,540
Yeah, the second of the treat loving boys.

94
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,780
I'm the silver medalist.

95
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,100
I'm a distant third.

96
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,940
Yeah.

97
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,820
Jason Sheridan's number one.

98
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,020
Thank you, yes.

99
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,980
Gold medal winner, Jason Sheridan.

100
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,500
Yeah, gold medal winner.

101
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,540
Yeah, hey, we got a ton of great questions,

102
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,140
which makes me glad we're doing it in this way

103
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,340
and keeping everybody off of Twitter slash X

104
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,940
as much as possible, plus longer.

105
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,300
I mean, as much as I would love that,

106
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,340
like only the best of the best pay

107
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,620
for that extra space on X.

108
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,780
And I'd love to get questions from those people.

109
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,620
Yeah.

110
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,380
If we exclusively got questions from blue checkers,

111
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,100
I think we'd be in great shape.

112
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,220
Blue, yeah, blue checkers that don't know anything about us

113
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,240
but are hardcore Disney fans.

114
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,180
Yeah, yeah.

115
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,380
It would just be, you'd start to parse it,

116
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,940
the paragraphs and paragraphs that you unravel

117
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,740
and then like, wait, why are they, there's no question.

118
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,580
They're just telling us why AI is coming for us

119
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,460
and our jobs and why he's glad that it is.

120
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,620
Yeah, there'll be a lot of that.

121
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,580
There'll be a lot of guys named like Brer Brandon there

122
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,420
with like a cartoon of themselves dressed

123
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,660
in a song of the south clothes.

124
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,220
Briar Patch Bob has a lot of points he wants to get across.

125
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,380
Yeah, so we would be fielding those questions.

126
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,460
I don't know that we want to do that.

127
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,460
Do you think we can still turn it around?

128
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,380
I mean, it looks bad.

129
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,660
The Tiana sign is up and the tower is up

130
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,580
and they're starting to run it.

131
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,620
But I think if we put our minds to it,

132
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,700
we could still flip it back.

133
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,540
Yeah.

134
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,360
I really think we could.

135
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,100
Six months and it's back, you know, six months.

136
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,940
This is such a failure.

137
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,500
They'll realize the mistake they make

138
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,380
when they realize that they went woke

139
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,060
and then step two went broke.

140
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,820
They're keeping all those animatronics around.

141
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,660
Yeah.

142
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,980
They're still dressed themselves and I'm right back out.

143
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,020
Communicore Hall is actually for festivals.

144
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,460
That's why it looks like an empty hallway

145
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,500
at an abandoned school.

146
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,340
Okay.

147
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,340
You don't understand it.

148
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,180
Okay.

149
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,220
I mean, for me, for me personally,

150
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,940
I think that a hectic park like Epcot,

151
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,380
you need like a break.

152
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,140
You need like some space to like take a breather.

153
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,700
But you know, if you just want it to be full of stuff to do

154
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,580
then that's fine, it's your prerogative.

155
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,380
Yeah, Epcot, it takes Disney like a year

156
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,860
to like finish the lawn of the Haunted Mansion.

157
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,760
But that's because they're putting every blade of grass

158
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,260
in one per day.

159
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,340
Okay, do you understand that?

160
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,940
They're taking the care and the time

161
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,500
on like Universal who just like built a whole park

162
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,460
in like two years.

163
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,380
Just kind of rushed job to just like spooged it out.

164
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,500
And is that what you want?

165
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,140
Do you want to just, do you want a company

166
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,380
that's just spraying its seed

167
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,160
or that's planting it carefully?

168
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,740
Like they want to get you pregnant.

169
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,780
And that's Disney.

170
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,620
Yeah.

171
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,920
Well, that'll be, that'll come soon.

172
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,640
That's not this episode though.

173
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,480
No, no.

174
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,320
This is a different vibe today.

175
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

176
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,400
And I feel like I should tell you guys at the top

177
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,360
that this is a real post office episode.

178
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,200
I had the thought.

179
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,280
I'm not launching any sort of prank or surprise attack

180
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,860
other than trying to hijack this

181
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,720
for just a couple of minutes to talk about my experience

182
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,320
seeing Kenny G live.

183
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,760
Oh, that's this over here.

184
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,600
Do you mind?

185
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,420
No, please.

186
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,260
Can I have a minute?

187
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,800
I don't want to like keep the listeners waiting.

188
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,720
Okay, yeah, go ahead.

189
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
I also wanted to bring it up

190
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,640
because it kind of closes the loop on something

191
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,640
that came up at the very end of the city walk

192
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,120
Orlando saga.

193
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,160
We were talking about the kind of cursed sub city walk

194
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,160
LA shopping, dining destination, LA live.

195
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,000
And you were defending it for some reason, Mike.

196
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,880
And Weiger said, when have you ever had a good time there?

197
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,640
Now I am happy to say.

198
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,480
Really?

199
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,960
The answer is seeing Kenny G at Club Novo.

200
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,360
This was a hell of a time.

201
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,240
And Club Novo is at LA live.

202
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,840
Club Novo, yes, Club Novo is at LA live.

203
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,840
Every concert venue there changes names every six months.

204
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,480
Microsoft Theater became Peacock Theater

205
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,040
and will be something else again in six months.

206
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,960
I wondered if it would be like boring.

207
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,560
I wondered if this would be sort of like a patience test

208
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,960
of a concert to get through.

209
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,860
Instead what I encountered was with the possible exception

210
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,240
of Corey Feldman and the Angels,

211
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,140
the most fascinating concert I've ever been to.

212
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,200
We didn't really know what to expect.

213
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,960
This was a birthday gift for Erin.

214
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,760
Because she, look, her Kenny G affection goes back to,

215
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,320
she was like a easy listening radio,

216
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,320
Coast 103.5, John Cicada, Peter Cetera.

217
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,760
So I knew this would be a big hit.

218
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,360
I've been dying on the hill that there is good Kenny G

219
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,280
in the early 80s, just like fun,

220
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,520
enjoyable little funk jams, right?

221
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,800
Even though I've said that,

222
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,840
I knew that this was not gonna be a concert of that.

223
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,960
I knew this was not gonna be like early 80s funk show.

224
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,060
And here's what I didn't expect was innovation.

225
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,440
And that's why I'm bringing it up.

226
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,200
Things that I've never expected to see in a concert

227
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,880
that break the concert form in ways

228
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,620
that completely caught me off guard.

229
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,920
Including very beginning, all the house lights are on,

230
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,040
I'm just talking to Erin, I was fielding a text

231
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,320
and then all of a sudden I look up and he's just there.

232
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,920
They didn't do an introduction, they didn't dim anything.

233
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,200
And not even on the stage,

234
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,200
he's on a little box down below the stage,

235
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
which was very close.

236
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,600
This is not that big of a venue

237
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,960
and for not too much expense, we were in the sixth row.

238
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,840
Yeah, we were doing it up for Kenny G

239
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,240
and suddenly just right there, it was crazy.

240
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,920
Like bigger than the Copperfield Theater in MGM Grand?

241
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,320
Ooh, that I'm not sure.

242
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,640
I don't have a good sense of-

243
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,960
Cause that's a pretty small room relatively.

244
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,600
It's got a second, like a balcony level.

245
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,800
Probably more seats then than that.

246
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,000
Which will factor into what happens in the store.

247
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,600
But yeah, just suddenly there,

248
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,360
just playing, no introduction, caught everybody off guard.

249
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,040
Stopping only to take a breath

250
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,760
and then sometimes look at us and make faces like,

251
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,520
yeah, it's me, no big deal, sorry.

252
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,680
I don't mean to put you out, hey, I'm just glad you're here.

253
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,560
And that's the vibe through the whole thing

254
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,640
is this very like, just casual like,

255
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,640
and he'll just like stop and just chat for a long time,

256
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,720
tell you about stuff on his mind,

257
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,040
music education he'll talk about for a while,

258
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,280
just to keep going with innovation though.

259
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,680
Here's the main, let me just drive right to it.

260
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,840
The main thing I wanted to talk about,

261
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,880
something I've never seen in a concert before,

262
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,480
he did a raffle.

263
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,360
It was a raffle as if like a high school fundraiser.

264
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,560
Church carnival.

265
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,560
Yes, yeah.

266
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,080
Just suddenly midway through the show,

267
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,840
all right, everybody, tickets out, let's do the drawing.

268
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,160
All right, who do we have?

269
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,360
30B and then everybody's gotta like go fishing

270
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,800
for the tickets.

271
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,520
Like, what is it, what do you mean?

272
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,040
And we'd never heard about the raffle.

273
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,280
We got in kind of right before it started.

274
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,400
So like raffle and for what?

275
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,040
Raffle, it goes to somebody up in the balcony

276
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,600
and he's like, okay, get down here quick.

277
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,560
And then they're like shuffling around

278
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,880
and taking their time.

279
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,640
And then he gets impatient with how long it's taking them

280
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,440
to come down from the balcony,

281
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,160
which is like, well then why did you do a raffle

282
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,640
if you knew it was possible for people up in the balcony

283
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,120
to get it and they don't know the venue,

284
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,600
they don't know where the exit doors are and everything.

285
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,200
So then he's got a vamp and he just complains

286
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,400
about how long it's taking.

287
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,520
And then it's the winner of the raffle

288
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,720
is a seven-year-old girl who clearly has no idea

289
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,880
who he is brought there by the dad,

290
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,480
who's also there, who's really enraptured,

291
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,280
but the girl is pretty bored, but trying to be polite

292
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:57,120
as she is sac serenaded by him two inches from her face.

293
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,240
And I'm like, was that the prize?

294
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,800
I guess that must be the prize,

295
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,480
is getting like a personal, like a little romantic moment,

296
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,920
even though it's going to a seven-year-old girl,

297
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,360
which made it very strange.

298
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,320
But then no, the prize is a saxophone.

299
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,880
You win a saxophone.

300
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,840
A normal saxophone or a straightened saxophone?

301
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,760
The straightened saxophone, his style of saxophone,

302
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,880
which then on the way out the door,

303
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,600
there is a sign that says Kenny G Saxophones for sale,

304
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,520
$1,000.

305
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,680
Wow.

306
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,080
So you could go to the merch booth and get a t-shirt

307
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,640
or you could pay $1,000 and get one of his saxophones

308
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,280
made by him, made to his specifications.

309
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,120
Did you look this up?

310
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,680
Is it like- Oh no, I don't know.

311
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,800
You have to assume there's an online component, right?

312
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,640
Well, I would think so,

313
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,280
because like many different musicians have a deal

314
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,680
with like Fender or they have a deal with Gibson

315
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,800
and they have their own signature instruments.

316
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,720
Okay, sure.

317
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,040
Jimmy Chamberlain, I forget which,

318
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,120
I was just watching a Long Rick Beato interview

319
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,720
with Jimmy Chamberlain and he has a deal

320
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,480
with some drum company and they have like signature stuff.

321
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,920
I watched a Long Rick Beato video yesterday.

322
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,080
The Jimmy Chamberlain video is awesome, honestly.

323
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,120
He's really like a smart guy about drums

324
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,480
and I've learned a lot is what I'm saying.

325
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,440
But yes, this is a common thing with famous musicians.

326
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,840
Are you starting a drum career then?

327
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,560
Are you gonna buy some Chamberlain drums?

328
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,720
I'm an amateur drummer for a long time.

329
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,520
So yeah, maybe I buy some Jimmy Chamberlain.

330
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,840
He's a guy with a lot of drums though.

331
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,440
I'm not a big, like having.

332
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,760
Yeah, you better master the three.

333
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,320
10 cymbals or anything.

334
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't do that.

335
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,720
I need like two.

336
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,120
Like a crash and a ride.

337
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,280
Okay, sure. That's all I really need.

338
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,520
You don't need all the trickery that Jimmy Chamberlain does.

339
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,840
Yeah, no. Yeah, it's just kind of for show.

340
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,680
He's too smart.

341
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,160
But Kenny, okay, KennyGSaxophones.com.

342
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm finding this in.

343
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,480
Oh, thank you for filling this in.

344
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,640
I'm so curious.

345
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,960
Okay, this looks like a fake website.

346
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,640
This doesn't look real.

347
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,480
This looks.

348
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,420
Wait, wait, when you turned it around,

349
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,320
I was like, are you showing me Google?

350
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,960
Because it's just mostly white.

351
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,920
Well, this is KennyGSaxophones.com.

352
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,800
It's mostly white.

353
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,200
It looks like I'm Googling KennyGSaxophones.

354
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,920
Yeah, it looks like Google Translate.

355
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,760
Right.

356
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,120
Mixed with Google Images.

357
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,880
Why is this website so bad?

358
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,840
That when I, in the concert,

359
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,240
the sign was just like a, just black on white,

360
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,720
just a paper sign.

361
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,360
Why isn't he dressing this up more?

362
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,000
Wow, he must be just doing this out of his house.

363
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,840
Okay, wait.

364
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,980
The main office is in Muncie, Indiana.

365
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,380
Uh-huh.

366
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,540
KennyGSaxophones are owned and sold worldwide

367
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,500
by ANK Global Enterprises, Inc.,

368
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,580
a California corporation.

369
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,260
Owners are KennyG and Ruben Allen,

370
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,340
managing partners of ANK.

371
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,180
Okay.

372
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,340
This is $3,895.

373
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,660
Copper Tenor Demo.

374
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,900
That's the price you're seeing is.

375
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,340
Well, let me see if there's a regular.

376
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,060
I don't know what they were selling for 1,000,

377
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,900
but that's a steal.

378
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,540
Maybe he's like, well, you paid for the concert,

379
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,660
so I should cut you a deal.

380
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,500
Perhaps.

381
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,900
But there's probably a range, I would imagine.

382
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,860
I'm just so curious why this,

383
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,220
I feel like any of us could easily redesign his website

384
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,060
in a matter of minutes.

385
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,060
Yeah, of course, it would be 10 minutes.

386
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,420
The soprano sax is the type of sax he plays

387
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,660
that's the straight sax.

388
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,500
Okay, yeah.

389
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,580
This is too grand, though.

390
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,220
Geez.

391
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,260
I didn't know what a deal,

392
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,340
and especially to get it for free.

393
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,940
What I don't understand is,

394
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,960
is that girl an aspiring saxophone player?

395
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,900
Did people only enter if they want to be saxophone players?

396
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,460
Did they not know what the raffle was for?

397
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,740
Probably that.

398
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,580
Yeah, probably that.

399
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,700
I mean, it was all disorganized enough,

400
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,300
yeah, that would be my guess.

401
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,180
So then is it like an opportunity to flip it?

402
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,140
Now you can go on eBay and say there's a reel,

403
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,660
and there's a picture of me getting it from him

404
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,380
so you know that it's reputable.

405
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,340
What's the plan here?

406
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,620
Why is there this?

407
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,700
Why does he stop a concert to do this?

408
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,380
Well, it's a little convenient,

409
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,140
isn't it, that a little girl gets the saxophone

410
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,780
after he's talking about music in schools?

411
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,100
Well, it wasn't right after,

412
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,400
though it was a big component of the concert.

413
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,200
Right, if it's a big component,

414
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,160
though isn't that a little too coincidental?

415
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,880
You think this is a plant?

416
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,520
I'm just saying, I brought up Copperfield,

417
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,440
so maybe that's why I have plants on the brain,

418
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,040
but that's pretty wild that a little girl wins a saxophone

419
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,040
after he's made a big point about music in schools.

420
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,440
What are the chances that a little girl

421
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,120
had a Kenny G concert in 2024?

422
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,360
And why is there a little girl

423
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,520
at a Kenny G concert in 2024, huh?

424
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,160
I don't know, I'm just saying it's a little convenient.

425
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,880
You've cracked all this apart for me.

426
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,160
I don't know what to think anymore.

427
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,760
It's a little convenient.

428
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,480
Well, and do you think that Kenny G

429
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,760
might be the kind of performer

430
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,960
who relies on weird little tricks and plants

431
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,320
to make sure that he gets all of the audience pops

432
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,000
that he needs?

433
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,840
Maybe, you were there, though, I wasn't there.

434
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,240
My favorite innovation, though,

435
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,600
something, you know, Mike, you're a big concert goer,

436
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,000
I think you're used to the performer

437
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,360
pumping up the audience and trying to make that energy last

438
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,600
and like, do we want more?

439
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,840
Do you want more?

440
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,120
In this case, he maybe was sensing

441
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,000
an audience energy lag,

442
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,280
and he said, everybody doing good?

443
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,240
Do you wanna keep going?

444
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,160
If you're not into it, if you're feeling like you wanna be,

445
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,200
just go ahead and take off, I really don't care.

446
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,400
Not gonna make fun of you or anything.

447
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,960
Just like, feel free, door's right there.

448
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,880
Hope I gave you a good time,

449
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,560
but if you're, look, it's Sunday night,

450
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,560
everybody's got a lot to do.

451
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,120
Tomorrow's a work day, you got a lot to do, right?

452
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,520
Just feel, go ahead, it's fine.

453
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,800
Like, what is, have you ever seen that before in a concert?

454
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,480
The same thing as like, in the middle of like,

455
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,360
the third encore at a Springsteen show,

456
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,120
where he's like, do you wanna go home?

457
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,400
And people go, no, like, it's technically the same sentiment.

458
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,880
It's just delivered in a much different way.

459
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,960
It's definitely like, designed to make people go,

460
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,680
no, I don't wanna go home, let's keep going here.

461
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,800
In this case, he answered the question for us.

462
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,840
He kind of, he just assumed, gave us an out,

463
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,040
which was nice, and then he just kinda kept talking

464
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,680
for a while, and he's like, I'm excited to get home,

465
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,240
because, you know, I live here, I live in LA,

466
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,000
so I get to go sleep in my own bed.

467
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,520
And I'm like, boy, I can count the times

468
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,320
that I've done a show, and then gotten to go home

469
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,760
and sleep in my own bed.

470
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,640
How many times have I, what have I gotta do?

471
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,400
Like, one, two, three, four, five, six,

472
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,040
maybe like 12, not more than 12 times,

473
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,120
definitely not more than 12 times.

474
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,320
Anyway, so, feel free to go.

475
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,160
What is this monologue?

476
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,160
It just cuts.

477
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,400
He's really off the top of his head, it feels like.

478
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,800
Yeah, like close to just like, you know,

479
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,160
well, let me see, if I get back, then like, I can,

480
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,880
before I left, I got that fancy goat cheese.

481
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,640
That's probably still good, so I could get back

482
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,800
and have a little bit of that.

483
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,840
And I got those crostinis, that'll be,

484
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,960
I think I teavote 60 minutes, so I can pull 60 minutes.

485
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,680
Just like inner monologue.

486
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,280
Then all of it culminates in, like, where does all this go?

487
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,240
How do you close out a wide-ranging, bizarre set like that?

488
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,280
Well, only one place, obviously,

489
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,680
which is My Heart Will Go On.

490
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,480
That's the big showstopper, which he starts,

491
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,360
do, do, do, and in three notes,

492
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,080
everybody loses their fucking shit, screaming,

493
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,920
now it's Springsteen Energy.

494
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,160
All of a sudden, do, do, My Heart Will Go On,

495
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,840
except for the person in front of us,

496
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,760
who, keep in mind, this is the fifth row,

497
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,040
she is holding up her phone at her own face height,

498
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,320
typing on her phone, using a little pen.

499
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,160
I'll tell you this, watching her typing

500
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,920
with a little stylus on your phone,

501
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,880
slows everything down.

502
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,680
It's much more inconvenient to do it that way.

503
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,320
And then I'm like, the font's big enough,

504
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,440
I can see what she's doing, what is she doing?

505
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,000
Just a big text exchange that's saying, like,

506
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,840
do you have Zell?

507
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,120
You ever heard of Zell?

508
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,040
Well, Zell is this new thing that you can do

509
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,040
through your bank, and it's a lot like Venmo,

510
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,920
where I'm reading this giant paragraph,

511
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,280
just explaining the basics of what Zell is,

512
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,280
which she's just doing in front of her face,

513
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,400
ignoring the concert that she's presumably

514
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,160
paying this person back for.

515
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,360
This scene was just so bizarre.

516
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,560
All this just to say, there's a little bit of crossover

517
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,200
in that I know he does the Epcot thing,

518
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,800
the eat to the beat.

519
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,960
I gotta tell listeners, go see what he,

520
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,160
because you don't know what you're gonna get.

521
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,080
You don't know if you're gonna get 10 minutes

522
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,640
of hotel recommendations or credit cards

523
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,880
you might consider using.

524
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,880
You don't know what genres of music,

525
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,360
if he'll just suddenly play the Jaws theme on the saxophone.

526
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,760
There's no way to predict what is gonna happen.

527
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,800
Maybe at eat to the beat, he keeps it really local.

528
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,680
He's like, I'm staying at the Boardwalk this time.

529
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,720
Stayed at the Yacht Club last year.

530
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,080
Think I'd like them both equally.

531
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,160
Or you know what he would do is just fish for the,

532
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,320
what's the one that's kind of like old seaside style,

533
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,160
turn of the century?

534
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,760
No, not Yacht Club, no.

535
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,760
Oh, Beach, oh, Boardwalk.

536
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,160
Yeah, Boardwalk, no, it's the Beach Boardwalk Hotel.

537
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,680
It's called the Beach Boardwalk Hotel.

538
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,760
We have to look up,

539
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,320
I'm sure there's plenty of YouTube of him doing these.

540
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,640
I think he does them a lot.

541
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,160
And what I heard from a friend of the show, Kevin Tully,

542
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,760
was he went to see this and he's like,

543
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,680
I've never seen a performer use the space more.

544
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,480
Nobody's walked more in any concert I've ever seen.

545
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,480
Nobody's gotten more steps.

546
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,200
Which I actually thought that the step count

547
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,040
was kind of low.

548
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,960
It was my only disappointment from the LA Live show.

549
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,560
So anyways, check him out.

550
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,440
Go freak the fuck out when he does My Heart Will Go On.

551
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,040
Okay, now that you've done that,

552
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,920
let me reveal that I do have Madame with me

553
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,600
and this is secretly the, no, I'm just kidding.

554
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,800
You had me for a second.

555
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,640
Yeah, I thought.

556
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,040
But I was like, that's a casual way to bring that out.

557
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,840
No, I want you to think of it as Chekhov's Madame.

558
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,560
Where like, I could bring out Madame at any time.

559
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,320
So I want everyone to be nervous

560
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,680
every time we record an episode.

561
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,840
I mean, I am.

562
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,520
I'm nervous about the name being said.

563
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,240
But I also just occupied a bunch of time

564
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,080
to talk about Kenny G. Sure.

565
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,720
So I say, if you have an interest

566
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,080
that you want to wedge into the show,

567
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,200
just come to the show with your wedge.

568
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,440
Just start doing it.

569
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,520
Carve out the space.

570
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,240
Oh, well, I would probably say that.

571
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,680
Do you know about Zell?

572
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,320
It's like Venmo, but it's run by the bank.

573
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,160
Tell me more.

574
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,680
Type me more.

575
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,120
Get out as a stylist and explain the full history of Zell.

576
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,400
I've got a stylist pen right here,

577
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,560
magnetically attached to my iPad.

578
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,800
Did you guys know also that Kenny G. claims credit

579
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,640
for denting the Frappuccino?

580
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,480
No.

581
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
He was an early Starbucks investor.

582
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,320
Really?

583
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,920
And he, enough to where he can easily contact Howard Schultz

584
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,680
was like, yeah, I kept calling him and saying like,

585
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,480
hey, I got this place Coffee Bean near me

586
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,640
and they got lines out the door.

587
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,320
They do these things that are a little more like milkshakes.

588
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,440
You might want to consider doing something like that.

589
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,280
And you hear that and you're like,

590
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,480
well, that's bullshit.

591
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
That's gotta be bullshit.

592
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,760
But apparently somebody reached out to Starbucks for comment

593
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,720
and they were like, hey, we love Kenny, an early investor.

594
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,720
He really helped us out.

595
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,560
And guess what?

596
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,240
Kenny G. did consult on the Frappuccino.

597
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,440
Thanks for everything, Kenny.

598
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,280
Wow.

599
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,800
So that's not bullshit.

600
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,640
Wow.

601
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,880
That sounds more like Coffee Bean invented the Frappuccino.

602
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,720
Yes, yeah, yeah.

603
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,200
Kenny G. invented the idea of stealing from Coffee Bean

604
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,600
and giving it to Starbucks.

605
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,440
Wow.

606
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,280
An innovator.

607
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,520
As I said, that was the case that I made.

608
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,720
A concert innovator, a coffee innovator.

609
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,560
Thanks, Kenny.

610
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,400
Thanks for a good time.

611
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,240
Thank you, Kenny.

612
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,440
So questions?

613
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
I have one right here.

614
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,200
Blair asks, if Mike Scott and Jason animatronics

615
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,440
were added to an existing ride, Johnny Depp style,

616
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,440
which ride would it be and where in it

617
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,120
would you want your animatronic placed?

618
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,840
Yeah, that's a very good question.

619
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,440
So in this universe, is it our universe

620
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,040
where most of the guests will be confused

621
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,960
or is it a world where they know who we are?

622
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,800
Here's what I'll say.

623
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,280
My answer is going to be that I'm gonna be tastefully placed

624
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,640
in a ride, not as a show piece.

625
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,880
You don't want the focus on you?

626
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,520
Well, it'll be so confusing to the audience, I suppose.

627
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,120
If Jason is sitting in a rocking chair

628
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,920
at the end of a ride in such a prominent way

629
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,000
like the Johnny Depp pirates in Disneyland,

630
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,560
that would be so good, but who is this guy?

631
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,120
I don't understand why he's here.

632
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,720
Now, pirates is a good answer in general

633
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,000
because we could be a pirate, no problem.

634
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,880
You could sneak in there easily, yeah.

635
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,160
Yeah, but it's not the number one place

636
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,880
I think I would want it to be.

637
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,840
Even though I've had some maybe gripes

638
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,520
about Rise of the Resistance,

639
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,200
I think you could put me in Rise of the Resistance.

640
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Well, I know that you want your friends to be in there.

641
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,040
I do, of course.

642
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,800
And who's a better friend than yourself?

643
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,040
That's exactly right.

644
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,040
So at the very least, I would then say,

645
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,000
at least I'm on Rise of the Resistance.

646
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,520
So I think it would be between,

647
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,960
Finn and I would be kind of behind that crate

648
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,440
that you can kind of not see it,

649
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,480
but I would be more prominent maybe.

650
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,320
You could see me a little bit closer.

651
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,160
Great, yeah.

652
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,320
And I'm yelling to Finn,

653
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,240
Finn, come here, come closer or whatever.

654
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,280
I can't, I don't have a full body.

655
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,760
Right.

656
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,560
Be like, no, no, it's okay, don't worry about it.

657
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,160
And I guess I would have a Stormtrooper outfit on as well

658
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,320
like I was in disguise before this.

659
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,720
Sure.

660
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,360
Or we could have it where I'm hanging out

661
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,320
up on that bridge with Kylo and General Hux.

662
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,160
Yeah.

663
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,120
So I could be at one of the consoles or something.

664
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,360
So I could be in the Chekhov or Mr. Sulu,

665
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,920
my jumping franchise is here,

666
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,640
but the Sulu or Mr. Chekhov,

667
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,960
or Lieutenant Commander Data position on the bridge.

668
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,360
And then we could just add something

669
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,000
where I would turn around and go,

670
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,960
they're here, just a quick little thing.

671
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,800
Get them.

672
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,800
Get them, or oh, watch out, something like that.

673
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,480
Again, I don't wanna draw focus.

674
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,840
It shouldn't be about me.

675
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,880
You guys can answer however you want, but.

676
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,240
You'd rather just blend in.

677
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,720
You'd just rather have it be an Easter egg.

678
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,560
Right.

679
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,480
You could help plot justify.

680
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,880
You could say, the cannons are down, sir.

681
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,960
Oh yeah, the cannons are down again, maybe forever.

682
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,320
Some people already have disputed my assertion

683
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,760
that those cannons are down forever,

684
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,280
but I hope I'm wrong.

685
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,160
But they're down certainly today.

686
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,680
They're not working.

687
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,720
They would be impressive if they were working.

688
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,000
Did that guy talk more than Kylo?

689
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,640
We really stopped for a while to listen to that guy.

690
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,320
You could hear him, he's still talking.

691
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,880
Like the ride vehicle seemed like it was about to leave,

692
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,440
but then it kept coming back, like, oh, he's still going.

693
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,280
Yeah.

694
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,100
You would jerk forward.

695
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,600
Wait, a tiny bit more.

696
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,840
Can we go into Dexter Jetsters after this?

697
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,920
Can we go out for a space shake, Kylo?

698
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,800
If we could add a couple of things there,

699
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,360
maybe as people are pulling away,

700
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,320
so it's a little bit of an Easter egg,

701
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,400
and I would say something about a prequel character I like,

702
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,120
but you'd have to be sort of like an eagle-eared listener,

703
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,240
a theme park goer to really notice

704
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,320
that I've slipped in some sort of a little prequel reference

705
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,240
or talking about Zabolba or Team Toppa Galeys,

706
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,520
one of my favorite podracers.

707
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,080
So, yeah, I like-

708
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,920
Oh, your favorite.

709
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,920
It's that hard to choose a favorite podracer.

710
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,720
Juan Sandage, Team Toppa Galeys,

711
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,160
any of the famous podracers that are famous to me.

712
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,840
So I think that's where I would choose.

713
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,480
If there was an Avengers or X-Men ride with robots,

714
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,500
I would probably go right there, but there's not.

715
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,720
So throw me in Rise of the Resistance.

716
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,000
Sure, yeah.

717
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,160
You got a thought, Jason?

718
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,000
I do.

719
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,720
Well, my original thought,

720
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,960
and this is probably recency bias,

721
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,760
and obviously I haven't written Tiana's in Florida yet,

722
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,080
but I like how much,

723
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,280
so I don't wanna give my full thoughts

724
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,280
because I haven't written it,

725
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,760
but I like how many scenes there are

726
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,200
of fun-loving animals playing instruments.

727
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,000
So I think I'd like to be placed

728
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,760
like next to one of those guys.

729
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,600
Oh, sure.

730
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,200
Next to a big frog

731
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,440
or mixed in with the band.

732
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,560
Wait, so there's a band of animals

733
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,880
and then there's just a guy next to them?

734
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,200
Yeah, exactly.

735
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,840
That is the reaction I wanna produce.

736
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,440
You want people to be whizzing by and go,

737
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,600
wait, is that a human?

738
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,080
Get off, go like, oh, that drop was so cool.

739
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,800
Did you see the animatron?

740
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,640
Yeah.

741
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,000
Hey, was there a guy just in the middle of that?

742
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,680
It's like, yeah, I kinda saw that.

743
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,800
There was just a guy in there.

744
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,040
Are you, do you wanna be,

745
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,520
did you say you wanna be playing an instrument

746
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,680
or do you wanna be more like that little baby bear

747
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,240
on Country Bears where he's just kinda sitting?

748
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,320
Oh, either would be great.

749
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,160
Okay.

750
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,000
You know, I'm just happy to be there.

751
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,360
But you don't wanna be a critter.

752
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,920
You wanna just be a person.

753
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,680
I'll let the professionals make that decision.

754
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,520
I think you should just be a person.

755
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,600
I think I should just be a person.

756
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,440
Yeah.

757
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,360
My other answer,

758
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,880
kinda inspired by Mike talking about pirates,

759
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,720
Disneyland Pirates starts,

760
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,040
you kinda go through the bayou

761
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,880
and there's a little shack.

762
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,720
Oh, oh.

763
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,600
With an old timer sitting there,

764
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,120
sitting in a rocking chair.

765
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,640
I would like to be next to him,

766
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,920
also in a rocking chair.

767
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,320
Same outfit?

768
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,160
Same outfit?

769
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,160
Yeah, same outfit.

770
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,320
And again, like provoking the same reaction

771
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,440
of just like, hey, was there a guy?

772
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,280
Yeah, but that fits a lot.

773
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,320
When you get off.

774
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,920
That fits really well though.

775
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,560
Does he have a friend now?

776
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,480
I think people would go,

777
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,600
oh yeah, that guy's always been there.

778
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,440
That seems right to me.

779
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,280
Yeah, that's his friend.

780
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,120
That seems right to me.

781
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,520
That's his friend or that's his son.

782
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,880
Too normal, you're saying?

783
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,920
No, I'm not saying it's wrong.

784
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,840
I'm just saying, certainly on Tiana's,

785
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,040
they're gonna go, well, why was that guy there?

786
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,720
But this version, they're gonna go,

787
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,120
oh, there's two guys in rocking chairs.

788
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,840
Oh yeah, I think that's always been there.

789
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,680
I'm pretty sure.

790
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,520
It's copacetic, yeah.

791
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,640
Yeah, that guy looks like he belongs here on the shack.

792
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,200
All right, so there's a little more of a blend in.

793
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,040
That's a more of a blend in.

794
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,360
Stand out or blend in.

795
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,200
Scott?

796
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,040
I think I thought of it.

797
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,480
This is awesome.

798
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,920
Maybe in the blend in territory

799
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,360
or the has this always been their territory.

800
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,840
Hall of Presidents.

801
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,960
You could sneak somebody into Hall of Presidents real easy.

802
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,680
And I, in fact, did this video a long time ago

803
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,000
where I dubbed over the president's announcement

804
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,920
and with all of these fake names.

805
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,640
And I'm like, all right, you put me in there.

806
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,280
Maybe, I don't think I'm powdered wig.

807
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,120
I think I'm one of the,

808
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,160
I feel like that 1800s zone of like

809
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,480
Rutherford B. Hayes, James Garfields,

810
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,000
where like, who are all these guys?

811
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,240
So give me a beard, actually, but have it be me.

812
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,760
I can't really grow a beard.

813
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,400
Not a big, thick president beard, definitely.

814
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,120
But make me a beard president and just all of a sudden,

815
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,240
between numbers 18 and 19, whatever,

816
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,880
just suddenly in there like Russell Trunk.

817
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,040
And then it keeps going to a regular one.

818
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,920
And then you just see who knows the presidents

819
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,440
in history enough to know that there was,

820
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,760
there a Russell Trunk?

821
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,960
I don't remember President Russell Trunk.

822
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,920
Maybe impeached?

823
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,720
Maybe was he, was he the one who died

824
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,680
cause he got sick?

825
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,760
Cause he did, he did a speech in the cold.

826
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,480
Maybe Russell Trunk was only president

827
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,920
for four days or something.

828
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,440
And then he got like kicked by a mule.

829
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,480
Ended up in a permanent coma.

830
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,800
And then you can't really let a guy in a perma coma

831
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,480
be the president for, you know,

832
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,360
you probably want to slide somebody else in there.

833
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,520
So is your animatronic then,

834
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,040
are you dressed in a powdered wig?

835
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,880
And like, is it an old?

836
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,720
No, I was saying, I think I'm an 1800s guy.

837
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,040
Cause that's where you can blend in president wise.

838
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,800
People, if you try to name the presidents,

839
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,440
you might get like seven through

840
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,800
before you start forgetting.

841
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,640
Who we had to order.

842
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,000
But that middle, it's that reconstruction post Lincoln zone.

843
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,880
The names don't stand out as much.

844
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,680
They all look exactly the same.

845
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,840
They all look like the angriest men who've ever lived.

846
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,560
So I think you could really easily slip in Russell Trunk.

847
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,840
Okay, that's good.

848
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,240
Yeah, so then yeah, hopefully you would record the dialogue.

849
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,240
Like little talk.

850
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,880
Not all of them, some of them just nod.

851
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,040
Guys, the vast, vast majority of them just nod.

852
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,880
What are you talking about?

853
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,840
No, I know you're right.

854
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,800
Let's think about that.

855
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,000
All right, and now for a solo.

856
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,960
Okay.

857
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,800
Harry Truman.

858
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,200
They, none of them talk.

859
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:01,200
But yeah, if you, I would take, I'd do like a, hey, hi.

860
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,040
Just a quick interjection.

861
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,480
What up?

862
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,520
Russell Trunk.

863
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,920
How's it hanging?

864
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,480
All right, well here's a good real quick.

865
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,800
The last question then.

866
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,920
What is sort of the thing that your robot does

867
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,360
when it's announced?

868
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,720
Because you know, they do sort of like,

869
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,360
they'll do a nod or they'll do certain things.

870
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,400
Most of them don't do anything like so flashy,

871
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,880
but you could do anything.

872
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,560
Would you do a little salute?

873
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,680
Would you do a little like okay symbol?

874
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,160
I mean, I guess that's a white supremacist thing,

875
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,000
so don't do that.

876
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,400
But, you know.

877
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,760
I'd love to represent drinking in it for myself

878
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,080
and for many of our great drinker presidents.

879
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,440
And I may be like holding the martini glass

880
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,160
kinda with all the fingers out, with pinky out.

881
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,040
Just do, if I could like keep it down to my side,

882
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,160
like there's a chair in front of me so you can't see it,

883
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,200
then I'd bring it up and just do a little like hello.

884
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,080
Like yeah, I'm still standing, but not for long.

885
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,200
Uh huh.

886
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,200
People would love that.

887
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,160
That's a little fun injected into there.

888
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,880
Maybe Russell Trunk, President Russell Trunk

889
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,160
died of liver failure.

890
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,400
He was the first president to drink himself to death.

891
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,240
He was, yeah.

892
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,080
So you all have big like red cheeks.

893
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,640
I buried him on the south lawn.

894
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,480
You have like big red cheeks or something too.

895
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,320
Yeah, that's fine.

896
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,680
You'll look like Foster Brooks.

897
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,920
Sure, then you'd see me from all the way,

898
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,040
you could put me all the way in the back and I'd still pop.

899
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,600
Okay, well that's good.

900
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,320
Those are good robots.

901
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,640
I got one.

902
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,880
Jeremy Ayala, please do a best theme park toilets episode.

903
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,640
I need to know where the good boys

904
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,040
like to take the kids to the pool.

905
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,000
We've talked about, I feel like it's been a contender

906
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,880
for being a Final Four is some kind of,

907
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,480
and I think Disneyland's the only one

908
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,880
that we could speak to with expertise.

909
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,080
And something that we encountered with this though

910
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,720
in the planning is that our experience

911
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,520
of what is a good Disneyland bathroom is limited

912
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,760
because the women's restroom is an entire other area.

913
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,280
And I think that we would need a female perspective

914
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,720
in order to properly cover this area.

915
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,200
And now we've all got significant others

916
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,840
who've been on the show.

917
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,120
I think it's maybe, I've also encountered,

918
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,240
it's felt a little weird to me to go like,

919
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,320
hey, you're a girl, come do the girl toilets with us.

920
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,840
It is a weird request,

921
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,600
even though we have many friends do the show.

922
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,680
It's like, do you wanna come on and talk about pooping?

923
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,960
That's a hard question.

924
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,800
I guess-

925
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,720
There might be somebody who is like

926
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,560
trying for this. I'm sure there's somebody

927
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,800
who wants to, but you can't, it's not a thing you DM.

928
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,840
I'm not DMing that to somebody.

929
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,880
We have to do it in a way where someone

930
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,640
is gonna have to hear this or hear us say it

931
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,720
on a different episode and have to volunteer.

932
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,400
It has to be somebody who wants to volunteer.

933
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,720
There has to be a little bit of like pre-chat

934
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,000
in order to get this to happen.

935
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,280
And they have to hear it in a non,

936
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,680
like not, I was gonna say, it's not gonna be aggressive,

937
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,600
but they have to hear it in a non-pointed way

938
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,720
where they're being asked directly.

939
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,400
They have to offer up that they wanna talk about that.

940
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,360
Yeah, yeah.

941
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:07,360
But I hope that you appreciate our inclusive perspective,

942
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,440
that we need the female perspective.

943
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,280
Right.

944
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,240
And only then can we talk about

945
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,640
where we like to poop and pee.

946
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,880
We've certainly talked about this, by the way.

947
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,560
I haven't answered, we have answers

948
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,680
and we've said it on the show, so it's not like-

949
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,520
This is another reason that it's,

950
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,800
I've held back from really pushing this

951
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,600
as a competition, as a final four brackets sort of topic,

952
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,720
because I don't like something

953
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,720
where there's an easy, handy winner.

954
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,560
Yeah.

955
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,400
And I think that you got it,

956
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,320
because I know everybody,

957
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,240
we've talked about it plenty of times before.

958
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,040
It's that little hidden enchanted tiki room bathroom,

959
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,720
or the McCarthy Circle bathrooms

960
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,400
where the doors go all the way to the bottom.

961
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,240
Floor, yeah.

962
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,120
And that's not gonna be an interesting competition,

963
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,800
unless you pull those out. We know the winner.

964
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,200
Maybe you gotta put in some kind of rules

965
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,400
in order to like, it can only be this kind of bathroom,

966
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,480
or that kind of bathroom that's more regular.

967
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,320
Yeah.

968
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,840
Like single stalls don't count or something.

969
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,200
Yeah, we could add, yes,

970
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,640
we could add or subtract things from the contest,

971
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,280
but yeah, as far as we've said that,

972
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,960
but yeah, there's a couple easy answers.

973
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,080
Let's take easy ones out.

974
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,400
If you're just putting like, kind of like,

975
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,200
basics, like, you know,

976
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,440
because there's some that are like, always bedlam, right?

977
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,560
And then others where, actually,

978
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,160
I tend to find that one is a little quieter,

979
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,440
and maybe I'll go out of my way to do that one.

980
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,840
Well, you go to like, Grand Californian,

981
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,600
and you go to one of those sort of,

982
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,440
it's like kind of outdoor.

983
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,080
Let's talk parks, though.

984
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,440
Yeah, specifically parks. I think you're in the park.

985
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,400
You gotta go now. Okay, it has to be in the park.

986
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,040
You wanna go before you get in line.

987
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,680
Yeah, let's do that. It has to be in the park.

988
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,520
Okay, yeah.

989
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,920
Let's take a little bit of fancy out of it.

990
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,760
Okay, okay.

991
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,760
Because I think, you know what I find is not too bad,

992
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,160
even though it's near Fantasyland,

993
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,120
I think that the Alice in Wonderland bathrooms,

994
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,040
which are kind of adjacent to Matterhorn,

995
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,960
are usually a little okay,

996
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,920
because I think it's not in the,

997
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,360
if you're in the thick of a land,

998
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,720
if it's bathrooms between lots of rides,

999
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,160
those are all gonna be mobbed.

1000
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,760
But if it's out of the way,

1001
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,080
then people might not know about them,

1002
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,240
or they need to step away from the activity

1003
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,320
to go over there.

1004
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,840
Yeah, that's an odd path to take.

1005
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,160
And it's got a lot of ledges and planters outside.

1006
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,720
It's good areas for if you're with a party,

1007
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,320
like, oh, I don't have to go, I'll just wait out here.

1008
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,200
They got somewhere to go, yes, yeah.

1009
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,600
They won't be avoiding strollers and people all the time.

1010
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,120
Yeah, that's just one knee jerk,

1011
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,320
but do you guys have any others?

1012
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,320
I do.

1013
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,440
Okay, this is a thing I've noted.

1014
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,640
There's two reasons for it.

1015
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,320
Back by, okay, Paradise Gardens Park

1016
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,520
in California Adventure by the Pizza and Pasta place,

1017
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,000
there is still a bathroom there

1018
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,000
with elaborate tile work of Route 66 scenes,

1019
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,200
which is interesting going like,

1020
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,200
oh, it's still like this from 2001.

1021
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,920
It's still very California themed.

1022
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,240
Sometimes bathrooms are a little like pocket

1023
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,000
where they have not done a full renovation,

1024
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
or an old theme might remain.

1025
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,960
But the other thing about that,

1026
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,280
and it's a thing I noticed a lot at Islands of Adventure,

1027
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,040
the bathrooms that have been there since the beginning,

1028
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:28,120
the 1999 to 2001 period had massive bathrooms,

1029
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,840
like tons in bedrooms,

1030
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,440
tons of urinals and stalls and everything.

1031
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,160
Compare that to the Avengers campus bathrooms,

1032
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,760
which are barely open.

1033
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,000
There's barely any toilets in there.

1034
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,840
I'm not super familiar, is that true?

1035
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,880
Huh, I guess I don't know it off the top of my head.

1036
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,720
I don't know that I've gone there.

1037
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,680
It's just a thing I noticed, like normal,

1038
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,600
I guess Galaxy's Edge has pretty large restrooms,

1039
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,840
but it was just a thing I noticed at Islands,

1040
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,680
and this popped into my head at California Adventures once,

1041
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,080
like man, the bathrooms are really big

1042
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,320
at the start of the new century.

1043
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,880
But not as much anymore.

1044
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,040
But not as much anymore,

1045
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,720
because they want to use all the space for other things.

1046
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,400
Yeah, I guess when California Adventures are open,

1047
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,200
so we gotta kill as much of the square footage as we can.

1048
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,960
All right, everybody gets like 10 square feet to yourself.

1049
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,920
Every stall is 10 square feet wide.

1050
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,920
You know what, I kinda like the Galaxy's Edge bathroom,

1051
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,960
the one near the Savvy's Workshop or the Robot Place.

1052
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,160
I kinda like that one.

1053
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,720
That's kind of open, it kind of feels big,

1054
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,880
because a lot of the bathrooms I don't like at Disneyland,

1055
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,320
they also are small, and they're kind of dark.

1056
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,000
That one feels like you got a lot of room in there,

1057
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,880
especially by the sink area,

1058
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,320
and I like the theming of it too.

1059
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,800
I don't like the other bathroom as much,

1060
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,960
it's closer to like the plush and the rise of resistance.

1061
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,880
Yeah, it's more cramped.

1062
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,760
It's more cramped, but you do kind of get,

1063
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,480
it's kind of, yeah, you got breathing room

1064
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,560
in that bathroom.

1065
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,480
Sure, sure.

1066
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,800
And you aren't mad at the bathroom

1067
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,680
because your friends aren't in it?

1068
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,520
I'm mad at everywhere in Galaxy's Edge

1069
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,960
because my friends aren't in it.

1070
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,560
Everywhere there should be my friends.

1071
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,800
I wanna be able to take a shit next to Luke.

1072
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,760
That's easy, you don't need any sort of

1073
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,440
visual representation of him.

1074
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,920
We know that they've AI'd his voice,

1075
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,720
they've got every soundbite that Mark Hamill's ever said,

1076
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,920
now take those samples and make,

1077
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,880
let me hear what it sounds like

1078
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,920
when he's struggling with his shit.

1079
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,400
You want the Jar Jar to be saying,

1080
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,480
like the toilet paper's out over here,

1081
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,760
can you help me out?

1082
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,960
Yes, if we could have dialogue from the movie,

1083
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,480
I mean, with Luke, you could probably just use

1084
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,240
the same dialogue when he's making the Death Star run,

1085
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,680
and it would probably line up perfectly.

1086
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,040
I want Leia to have run out of toilet paper

1087
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,640
and that she needs some from me,

1088
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,280
and she says, help me, you're my only hope.

1089
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,240
Sure, yeah.

1090
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,640
Yes.

1091
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,160
Well, where are the,

1092
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,600
look, that's an easy way they could get the friends

1093
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,800
in the Galaxy's Edge.

1094
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,600
That's just audio, that's just dialogue.

1095
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,800
You don't have to build a robot necessarily.

1096
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,800
So they can start there.

1097
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,920
They can start there with Dexter Jutster.

1098
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,720
I don't like that Luke and Leia aren't,

1099
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,760
are you sure they aren't in there?

1100
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,440
Have you been to the toilets?

1101
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,120
You can have Jango Fett just say,

1102
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,800
help me out over here.

1103
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,080
That's easy enough.

1104
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,600
Yeah, it should be a collection of Sam Clitz

1105
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,480
from the movie that would make sense

1106
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,640
being said in a bathroom.

1107
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,880
So not changed at all, yeah.

1108
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,200
Not changed at all, no.

1109
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,040
Right.

1110
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,720
So like you have, like Obi-Wan say,

1111
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,560
you have the higher ground or something,

1112
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,360
like just placed in there,

1113
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,880
and then I don't know if that makes a lot of sense.

1114
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,840
What's the big Yoda inspirational,

1115
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,280
there is no try?

1116
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,400
Do or do not, there is no try.

1117
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,440
I mean that's applicable to making a difficult ship.

1118
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,560
Can you cut it where it's a quicker,

1119
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,520
so it goes doo doo or not?

1120
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,920
There is no, and then like.

1121
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,160
I'll allow it.

1122
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,000
Okay, because that's.

1123
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,840
I think technology would allow that to happen, yeah.

1124
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,960
Yeah, doo doo.

1125
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,800
And then you could have,

1126
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,360
oh you could have Greedo saying McClunky.

1127
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,520
Like you could have like a noise

1128
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,480
that he went to the bathroom,

1129
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,320
and then he goes.

1130
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,280
You could have Greedo saying McClunky.

1131
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,120
Yeah.

1132
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,040
Also something sorely lacking in the parks, yes.

1133
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,880
Yeah.

1134
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,360
No representation of McClunky.

1135
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,840
Dylan Lee, he says you're put in charge of parks

1136
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,280
and told you have to level one land,

1137
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,840
example, adventure land, on each coast,

1138
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,400
but you can replace it with any theme of your choosing

1139
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,160
as long as it's not a revamped aversion of the old land.

1140
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,000
This is a big one.

1141
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,080
What do you choose and why?

1142
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,920
So you got it.

1143
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,880
Jason looks concerned here,

1144
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,160
because we've, this is recently.

1145
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,000
Oh no, I'm thinking.

1146
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,840
We've been talking.

1147
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,800
Recently we've been talking.

1148
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,640
I've, of course, brought the missile launcher out.

1149
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,760
Yeah, people seem to like the missile launcher.

1150
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,600
People like.

1151
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,440
You really like, you corner us with that possibility.

1152
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,040
So this is, you know, I think,

1153
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,360
I assume this is talking Disney

1154
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,480
because we would be here all day

1155
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,040
if we were doing the Universal Parks,

1156
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,280
but maybe not, I don't know.

1157
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,400
Because like we've already,

1158
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,560
I've already pointed that missile launcher at Toon Lagoon

1159
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,320
and Marvel Super Hero Island too many times.

1160
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,400
I don't want to make Jason upset anymore.

1161
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,000
Do you want to though make this a missile launcher thing?

1162
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,920
Just put that on top?

1163
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,960
Because you got to level the land somehow, so.

1164
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,120
Yeah, well luckily we can get the missile launcher out.

1165
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,960
Is that what you're saying?

1166
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1167
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,200
If you could just, if you could nuke the lands for us,

1168
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,040
that'd be great.

1169
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,840
But we have to decide, don't we?

1170
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,680
Yes, you have to decide.

1171
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,480
I mean, look, there's the easy answer

1172
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,680
in California Adventure is Hollywood Land goes away.

1173
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,880
Hollywood Land is the easiest one to get rid of.

1174
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,480
And could be almost anything, huh?

1175
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,560
And then it could be almost anything.

1176
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,120
And like the thing is, again,

1177
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,040
it's like I know what modern Disney does,

1178
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,520
so they're going to just want to make a land

1179
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,960
based on one of the things they own.

1180
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,520
But if I'm in charge,

1181
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,440
if I have the keys,

1182
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,200
like what do I want more than anything?

1183
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,040
And that answer,

1184
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,280
and we've talked a little bit about this,

1185
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,800
is some kind of elaborate candy land.

1186
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,080
I want a land full of candy.

1187
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,440
It doesn't have to be the board game candy, candy land,

1188
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,240
but it needs to be like you're walking

1189
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,560
into a modern version of like a Willy Wonka's

1190
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,040
chocolate factory,

1191
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:10,600
or like a Willy Wonka's like terraformed island

1192
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,440
where he's growing all of his candy.

1193
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,320
So just because Hollywood Land

1194
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,720
is like my least favorite part,

1195
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,200
and I'm talking about where Monsters Inc. is,

1196
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,360
and I'm talking about where,

1197
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,680
I like Turtle Talk with Crush,

1198
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,840
and I like Monsters Inc. fine,

1199
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,160
but that stuff is all,

1200
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,600
it all feels tired to me.

1201
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,480
The theater feels tired to me now

1202
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,920
because it's nothing going on there.

1203
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,080
That's why it's tired.

1204
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,440
So it might not blend so well,

1205
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,800
but I would like to put a candy land of some kind in here

1206
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,240
with, and it doesn't have to be a big E ticket,

1207
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,280
but I want like a dark ride where you go through like,

1208
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,560
let's say like,

1209
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,160
I mean, it's hard not to get to the Willy Wonka comparison,

1210
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,880
but if you're like, say like gum,

1211
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,960
like you're going to the gumdrop fairy,

1212
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,760
and you're like taking gumdrops and bringing them back

1213
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,600
because you have to package gumdrops

1214
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,800
and give them all to the children.

1215
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,760
Like I want like big suckers.

1216
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,600
I want sort of-

1217
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,280
You have to package gumdrops?

1218
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,120
You have to package them,

1219
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,400
but like let's make them a fantastical thing

1220
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,240
where like you go to the center of the earth

1221
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,280
to get gumdrops.

1222
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,200
One of the crusts in the center of the earth.

1223
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,680
Those are like gems that you mine.

1224
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,920
Exactly, like the seven dwarfs.

1225
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,280
That's a perfect example, yes.

1226
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,440
Okay, you don't realize that all candy is not,

1227
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,240
candy isn't manufactured and just artificial ingredients.

1228
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,200
Candy has to be harvested from the center of the earth.

1229
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,760
So some sort of drill machine that takes you down.

1230
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,600
Some sort of candy-

1231
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,880
To grab gumdrops.

1232
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,280
Exactly, and then there's like a bad guy there

1233
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,160
and he's trying to stop you

1234
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,280
because he's trying to use gumdrops for like evil gumdrops.

1235
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,240
Let's say that gumdrops could like also be like

1236
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,680
fossil fuels if you burn them and they're bad or something.

1237
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,600
He's trying to use them for like evil,

1238
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,560
but we just want to give candy to the kids.

1239
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,200
So we're in a little vehicle.

1240
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,840
I don't know, I didn't say flush out the ride,

1241
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,640
but here we are flushing out the ride

1242
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,080
where you have to take the gumdrops back.

1243
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,760
And then like all the kids are there.

1244
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,280
So now there's going to be a lot of fun candy

1245
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,040
they sell in this land as well.

1246
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,360
That's going to be a big thing too.

1247
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,320
I would hope.

1248
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,240
There's going to be a lot of selling of candy

1249
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,040
and then there'll be a sort of,

1250
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,760
we can leave the theater there even

1251
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,120
and have some sort of a big sort of candy review

1252
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,800
with like dancing suckers and like different,

1253
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,880
like people dressed as Laffy Taffy

1254
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,080
and they have like long arms and stuff

1255
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,400
and mostly original songs,

1256
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,800
but there will be like,

1257
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,720
we will do a little Candy Man, of course.

1258
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,240
You will do the song Sweet Gingerbread Man.

1259
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,160
We'll do all the different like sort of sweets based songs.

1260
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,560
Of course you will do Sweet Gingerbread Man.

1261
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,520
No need to explain what Sweet Gingerbread Man is.

1262
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,040
Well, it's another song that Sammy Davis Jr. sings.

1263
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,000
God, I had a feeling.

1264
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,320
He does a cover of Candy Man.

1265
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,160
That's how I knew.

1266
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,920
He does a cover of Sweet Gingerbread Man.

1267
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,160
The reason I know the song is because my mom,

1268
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,720
Bobby Sherman does a cover or does a version of it

1269
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,680
and this is how it got on my radar first.

1270
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,880
This is your mom's insistence on making sure

1271
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,960
that you, her son, likes Bobby Sherman.

1272
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,880
It comes up once a week.

1273
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,520
She warped you permanently.

1274
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,200
Yeah, so I think a fun candy land

1275
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,200
in that area would be awesome

1276
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,960
and I'm happy to elaborate on it more.

1277
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,880
This says both coasts.

1278
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,400
I don't think we have time to do both coasts,

1279
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,720
but if you gentlemen wanna go here.

1280
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,640
Geez.

1281
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,040
Okay, no, but it can't be a redo

1282
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,040
because I was gonna say blow up Pixar Pier,

1283
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,400
build a new Pixar land from scratch.

1284
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,080
That can't work.

1285
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:27,900
That can't work.

1286
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:28,740
Wasn't that different though?

1287
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:29,580
If none of it's a place.

1288
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,400
Well, what's the land then?

1289
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,880
Is it specific to a Pixar movie

1290
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,480
or are you saying general Pixar?

1291
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,840
No, it's not to a specific movie.

1292
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,560
Okay, that's the same thing then.

1293
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:44,560
E-Ticket, Toy Story, E-Ticket, Upper Wally.

1294
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,320
I guess I really like Turning Red,

1295
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,720
but I was gonna say I think they hit their high mark

1296
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,640
with Up and Wally.

1297
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,120
Yeah.

1298
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:56,960
Oh, show.

1299
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,200
Okay, so it sounds like that's not,

1300
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,040
we can't do that.

1301
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,440
Yeah, no, I can't do that.

1302
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,360
I don't know, can't you?

1303
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,400
Because those aren't there.

1304
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,840
You wanna blow up the lagoon.

1305
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,320
That's a move is to not have a lagoon anymore

1306
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,160
and to fill in that space with rides.

1307
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,760
Well, no, I want the lagoon.

1308
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,600
I just meant the.

1309
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,920
It sounds like he wants the exact same land

1310
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,320
except he wants like a Wally ride.

1311
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,640
I want it better.

1312
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,480
I want it.

1313
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,600
I think that's acceptable.

1314
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,080
No, I'm ruling it's not.

1315
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:19,900
Oh, okay.

1316
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,120
I'm saying it's not.

1317
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,200
I would want to actually, you know what I would,

1318
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:28,280
I would wanna blow up Toy Story land in Hollywood studios

1319
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,200
and then build like a real like,

1320
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,880
not Toy Story, but again, my other interest is toys.

1321
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,440
So if like we really went hard on like a generic

1322
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,960
like you've shrunk down land, it's an indoor land

1323
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,800
and you're like on the floor of a bedroom

1324
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,040
or in a toy store on a shelf.

1325
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,600
I don't want the Toy Story IP.

1326
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,920
I want it to be sort of generic, you've shrunk down

1327
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,760
and now we're all toys in this land.

1328
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,040
You've gone to like the Don Draper.

1329
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,960
Like what is the idea of toys?

1330
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,760
What is the idea of candy?

1331
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,600
Exactly.

1332
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,200
So Scott, do you have an answer for this?

1333
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,040
Well, all right.

1334
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:03,880
I was gonna say it feels obvious

1335
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,880
to blow up part of Tomorrowland,

1336
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,520
but we've talked about that a lot.

1337
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,000
And both coasts makes me go to Main Street USA.

1338
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,760
What if there was no more Main Street USA?

1339
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,200
But I don't have any.

1340
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,680
I just wanted to see what Jason would do if I said that.

1341
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,240
Well, the Hollywood studios upset him.

1342
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,960
You're pouting like you had a sour sucker.

1343
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,280
Yeah, for Mike's candy land.

1344
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,920
You can out all sorts of suckers in my candy land.

1345
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,200
What would be better than Main Street USA?

1346
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,480
If you replaced, yeah, that's a good question.

1347
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,360
I mean, it's like Islands of Adventure

1348
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,680
has a Main Street USA.

1349
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,440
They all kind of have Main Street.

1350
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,840
That is sort of just like the template now

1351
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,280
if you're doing a big park is to have a Main Street.

1352
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,120
Yeah, yeah.

1353
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,640
Well, look, Springfield's gonna be up for grabs.

1354
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,840
Let's Springfield, wait a minute.

1355
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:49,800
Now let's use, all right,

1356
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,040
we're gonna turn Main Street into,

1357
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,280
how do you say out loud where Family Guy takes place?

1358
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,120
Quahog?

1359
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:56,960
Cohog?

1360
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,000
Cohog, yeah.

1361
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,320
Cohogger.

1362
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,160
I think everybody.

1363
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,840
And you know what, just paint it,

1364
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,920
don't even blow it up, just paint it cartoon colors

1365
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,720
and then all of our pals are poking out the windows.

1366
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,280
Yeah, Quagmire Mayor Adam West

1367
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,480
is welcoming you to Disneyland.

1368
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,920
That's good.

1369
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,760
What have you?

1370
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,580
I think no complaints there.

1371
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,760
I think everybody's happy if,

1372
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,640
I mean, sure, people like Main Street USA,

1373
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,480
but people love Family Guy.

1374
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,600
That's true, that's true.

1375
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,480
It is surprising Family Guy's not somewhere.

1376
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,200
And then daily performances of the theme song

1377
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,360
outside the castle. Oh yeah, sure.

1378
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,160
I was gonna say just replace Main Street USA

1379
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,920
with like a ride to get into the park.

1380
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,760
Sure.

1381
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,600
No Main Street.

1382
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,720
Well, you could do like kind of Seven Seas Lagoon,

1383
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,160
like you gotta get on a big boat

1384
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,880
just to take you from here to there.

1385
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:44,720
Yeah. Yeah.

1386
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,440
There was also, you know, there was this weird promotion

1387
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,240
where they did like an Olympic-sized pool

1388
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:49,720
all the way down Main Street.

1389
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,680
Just do that all the time.

1390
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,800
If you wanna get into the park, you gotta swim for it.

1391
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,640
Yeah, that's good.

1392
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,480
That's, yeah.

1393
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,300
Get in the pool.

1394
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,140
No, it's not heated.

1395
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:57,960
Go.

1396
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:58,880
More effort, yes.

1397
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,000
That's what I think.

1398
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,340
I have one here.

1399
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,040
Cody Holmes says,

1400
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,920
this is a comedy podcast about theme parks.

1401
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,960
We hear a lot about your favorite theme things,

1402
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,800
but what's some comedy you're really digging right now

1403
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,640
you could turn us all on to?

1404
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,960
I, well, certainly the John Bellini show

1405
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,200
that you worked on, Scott.

1406
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,120
Oh, thanks.

1407
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,160
Connor O'Malley has a new special on YouTube

1408
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,680
that is really funny.

1409
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,880
Joe Pera is on tour right now.

1410
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,440
My college classmate, Joe Pera, he's always very funny.

1411
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,720
Oh, I know that.

1412
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,720
And then we were talking the other day,

1413
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,680
guys you worked with on the Bellini show,

1414
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:44,600
Jeremy and Rajat, Jeremy Levick and Rajat Suresh

1415
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,840
are so funny.

1416
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:50,080
They make these very funny, very weird videos.

1417
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,000
Oh, and they've done so,

1418
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,680
I don't even describe some of these

1419
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,320
because some of them are so odd,

1420
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,360
even just explaining the premise.

1421
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,920
They're some of the best in the DIY game.

1422
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,760
Yeah.

1423
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,720
I was gonna say the show Family Guy,

1424
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,560
just wanna give them a show.

1425
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,760
I was gonna say Family Guy 2.

1426
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,680
Wow, wow, okay.

1427
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,520
Nice.

1428
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,360
The same thing, yeah.

1429
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,920
It's been going for a little while.

1430
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,720
Also, not to beat up on Mike for all his,

1431
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:18,080
you know, old-timey references.

1432
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:21,360
I've been watching a lot of episodes of,

1433
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,800
Scott, do you know the show The Mothers-in-Law?

1434
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:25,640
No.

1435
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:26,480
Okay.

1436
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,320
This is available.

1437
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,160
This is beating up on me and all.

1438
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,840
On a lot of streaming services.

1439
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,560
This was a two-season TV show

1440
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:38,440
that would air between Bonanza

1441
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,880
and the Wonderful World of Disney.

1442
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,080
It is produced and mostly directed by Desi Arnaz.

1443
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,440
Whoa.

1444
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,760
And it stars Eve Arden and Kay Ballard.

1445
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,600
Of course.

1446
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:56,480
And they, they, they're adult children,

1447
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,360
they are neighbors who are kind of friends,

1448
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,000
but also kind at each other's throats.

1449
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,800
And they're adult children get married to each other,

1450
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,320
so they become the mother-in-laws.

1451
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,440
And it is a very funny, I think it's very funny,

1452
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,400
it is so cheap.

1453
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:18,400
It is like the cheapest late 60s crapped-out TV show.

1454
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:23,720
One of the husband's changes at season two,

1455
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,040
because they said the only way we'll renew this,

1456
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:31,040
we renew this, is if everyone takes the same money

1457
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,560
and the one actor was like, no.

1458
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,520
So they just replaced him.

1459
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,440
No.

1460
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:39,520
And the daughter on the show,

1461
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,520
Debra Wally, was in a lot of those Bikini Beach movies.

1462
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:50,200
She's in an Elvis movie as Elvis's love and trust,

1463
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,040
one of his movies.

1464
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:56,080
And it's just, I just think it's just such an oddball show.

1465
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,920
Desi, of course, makes cameos in it.

1466
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,000
Of course, yeah.

1467
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,680
I think he better.

1468
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,680
If he's on the set, just go to the other side,

1469
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,760
go in front of the cameras.

1470
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,760
My daughter seems to like the song Cuban Pete,

1471
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,800
I'll say that when I play that for her.

1472
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,520
Oh, that's fun.

1473
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,600
Haven't you learned anything

1474
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,480
from your Bobby Sherman upbringing?

1475
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,120
You're starting the cycle again.

1476
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,600
I'm not forcing her to learn about him.

1477
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,760
It's just coming up on random sometimes,

1478
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,200
because that's what my algorithm knows I want.

1479
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,920
That's what it plays for her sometimes.

1480
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,600
We're taking our time with these questions.

1481
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,440
These are great questions.

1482
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,400
We got so many great questions that, in fact,

1483
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,640
we're gonna split this batch

1484
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,720
into a whole other PTR Post Office episode.

1485
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,320
So if we didn't get to your question in this one,

1486
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,640
we will get to it in the next one.

1487
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,640
And if we don't get to it in that one,

1488
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,040
it's gone forever.

1489
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,920
It's toast, de-atomized.

1490
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,160
So a lot of pressure's on in that other episode.

1491
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,200
Nick Cherry says,

1492
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,640
"'What's the one unbuilt, rumored ride, theme parkland

1493
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,760
"'that never happened that you most wish

1494
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,600
"'would have come to fruition?''

1495
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,760
I mean, there's so many of that.

1496
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,560
Westcott is the easy answer, I think.

1497
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,880
Because when I think of Disney World,

1498
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,680
we've talked Disney World versus Disneyland,

1499
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:10,480
and really what I miss from Disney World the most

1500
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,400
is World Showcase and Epcot Center,

1501
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,760
and then the hotels, Disney World hotels,

1502
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,480
and the bubble itself.

1503
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,920
But Westcott, really, you're like,

1504
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,880
oh, God, Westcott, really?

1505
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,840
I think if I had to pick anything,

1506
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,320
that would be the thing.

1507
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,480
And that's never coming back,

1508
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,240
and there's no way they'll ever do that,

1509
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,080
I don't think.

1510
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,360
I don't know that, I can't imagine it having worked,

1511
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:37,840
but boy, I think a lot about what is Los Angeles like

1512
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,360
if Port Disney is in the beach.

1513
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,880
Oh, that's fascinating, yeah.

1514
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,840
Because if that was anywhere close to Disney Sea,

1515
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,120
and I don't think it would have been,

1516
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,280
because I think budget cuts would have made sure

1517
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,160
it was not as cool, but that's such a strange area.

1518
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:54,400
And I, you know, when I've been there for, you know,

1519
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,560
Shacktoberfest, and I imagine, like, yeah.

1520
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,800
Oh, yeah, that's right, yeah.

1521
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,640
Not coming back.

1522
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,240
Oh, the Shack branding.

1523
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,400
It's back to Dark Harbor.

1524
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,120
Wow, is this the first product?

1525
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:04,960
Shack's over, yeah.

1526
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,440
It's not Shack this year.

1527
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,280
But he does have an immersive experience in Vegas.

1528
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,760
Oh, yes, you told us this not in an episode, correct?

1529
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,600
Right, yeah.

1530
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,960
Yeah, and what's the deal with that?

1531
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,960
I forget already.

1532
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,240
But it looks like you could just have brunch,

1533
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,240
and then you go into a room with colors, so.

1534
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,920
Well, so my future answer, not unbuilt,

1535
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,040
but for, you know, what attraction I miss the most

1536
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,840
will be when that goes under.

1537
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,680
Yeah, yeah.

1538
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,880
And then it'll be, so that's the answer in five years.

1539
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,240
Shack's fun house.

1540
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,440
Okay, okay.

1541
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,360
If Long Beach had an extra Disneyland that felt like 1990

1542
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,200
and was full of crystals and stuff,

1543
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,680
and there wasn't California Adventure potentially,

1544
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,600
maybe it's all, probably everything's worse.

1545
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,960
I'd say everything's worse and less convenient,

1546
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,040
and we're all, like, now the 710 is jammed

1547
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,400
as we go to this theme park that's rusted away

1548
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,280
and smells bad, because it's by the sea.

1549
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,120
Yeah.

1550
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,240
But still, even that, I just want to know.

1551
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,320
What would it be like?

1552
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,240
I also, I know we already talked Star Wars.

1553
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,800
That Star Wars coaster that seemed impossible to build

1554
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,880
haunts me a little bit.

1555
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,920
With the different storyline.

1556
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,760
With the, like, three different paths,

1557
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,960
and you move up in the swamp with Yoda,

1558
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,480
like, that almost feels like I made it up in my head.

1559
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,200
That's like a dream that I had or something.

1560
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,200
That's an answer is blow up Main Street,

1561
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,120
so you gotta have the space to put that in.

1562
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:22,960
Oh, God, yeah.

1563
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,120
Sure.

1564
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:27,920
I was gonna say the, I don't know where exactly

1565
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,600
it was gonna go, somewhere in the Middle East,

1566
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,120
but there was all that concept art from Marvel.

1567
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,600
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1568
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,160
With, like, Spider-Man and Green Goblin,

1569
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,680
like, actual buildings.

1570
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,320
Yeah, like, there was a, like, one of the pieces of art,

1571
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,240
we've talked about this before,

1572
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,840
had, like, Times Square in chaos

1573
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,120
with, like, Doc Ock's tentacles coming out

1574
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,440
of one of the buildings, and that felt closer,

1575
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,880
that felt more like a, not realistic,

1576
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,760
but it was not necessarily comic book,

1577
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,520
but it split the difference between being,

1578
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,400
sort of, realism with the movies.

1579
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,840
Pop party, yeah.

1580
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,760
Right, versus, like, it's either one way

1581
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,920
where it's, like, all, like, comic book stuff

1582
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,080
in Islands of Adventure, or now it's, like,

1583
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,000
it needs to feel like a college campus

1584
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,520
or, like, a circuit city to be real.

1585
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,320
It's a repurposed office park factory.

1586
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:19,320
Yeah, where it's, like, that actually,

1587
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:24,040
that's a good way to, like, make a very impressive-looking,

1588
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:29,040
like, exterior for a land involving superheroes.

1589
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:32,920
Like, that feels right to me, those pictures.

1590
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,440
So that would have been a satisfying way

1591
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,800
to, like, make a cool thing where you're like,

1592
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,360
oh my god, I'm in Times Square and there's shit going down.

1593
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,040
Yeah, yeah.

1594
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,040
So I agree with that.

1595
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,080
I'm gonna toss this in just so that a funny word

1596
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:43,920
gets said at the end.

1597
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:44,760
Please, yeah.

1598
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,280
This is from Gina Boliega.

1599
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,160
This one is from Mike.

1600
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,320
Did you ever hear of a Chuck E. Cheese-esque place

1601
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:52,960
in the Chicago suburb, Libertyville, called Chimpies?

1602
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,680
It had a Rock of Fire explosion band and everything.

1603
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,680
Oh, wow, Chimpies.

1604
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,000
No, I don't know Chimpies.

1605
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,680
Chimpies.

1606
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,280
I looked it up.

1607
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,240
Chimpies does seem to, yeah, it is just literally Rock of Fire.

1608
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:03,740
Right.

1609
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,240
It's just the same band.

1610
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,480
Chimpies Pizza Safari.

1611
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,000
Wow.

1612
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,480
Again, this year, we have found so many,

1613
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,840
the lineup of animatronic bands has just expanded

1614
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,680
and expanded.

1615
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,400
I'm reading how it, all right, closed in 2005.

1616
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,080
The show was in poor condition with the deteriorating

1617
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:25,840
cuss words and mechanical issues.

1618
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,840
And they just put like Safari outfits on them.

1619
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:31,440
All right, same band, but they're wearing camouflage

1620
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,040
and they're falling apart.

1621
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,400
And Billy Bob's jaw might snap off.

1622
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,040
I really wish I could see Chimpies.

1623
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,200
I wish I knew Chimpies.

1624
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:38,840
I'm sorry.

1625
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,240
Yeah, yeah.

1626
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,120
She also said also you guys should

1627
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,080
do an Ed DeBevix episode.

1628
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,040
Oh, yeah.

1629
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:45,560
Sure.

1630
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,200
I mean, that's, you know Ed DeBevix?

1631
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,440
I forget the deal with it.

1632
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,280
It's like Dick's Last Resort.

1633
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,520
Yeah, they're mean to you.

1634
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:51,800
Oh, OK.

1635
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:52,760
They're mean to you.

1636
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,200
We haven't really done any of these.

1637
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,200
We haven't done one of the mean to you chains.

1638
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,160
Yeah.

1639
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,360
Requires some traveling.

1640
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,160
We don't have a lot of those in Los Angeles

1641
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,960
because we're nice to each other here.

1642
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,920
Los Angeles is a place of love.

1643
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,880
Dick's closed in San Diego, but it is still in Las Vegas.

1644
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,440
It's in the Excalibur.

1645
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,920
And they'll still like.

1646
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,400
Yes, that awful looking face is peering out of a castle town.

1647
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,760
I'll have a dilapidated castle town.

1648
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,960
It's very unpleasant, Dick's Last Resort.

1649
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,640
And up until maybe still in Las Vegas, I don't know,

1650
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,040
the joke would just be like, hey, you're gay.

1651
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,560
The joke oftentimes when you would go into Dick's Last

1652
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,560
Resort was like, the mean waiter would call you gay.

1653
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,680
And you're like, oh, OK.

1654
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,280
It's 2015.

1655
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,440
OK.

1656
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,360
This is interesting.

1657
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,360
So not in the comedy recommendations

1658
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:42,080
is the recent material of Dick's Last Resort.

1659
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,880
Is the wait staff at Dick's Last Resort, yeah.

1660
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,280
OK, good.

1661
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,680
Well, hey, thank you for all these.

1662
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:47,600
We'll do another batch.

1663
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,480
But for now, you survived podcast The Ride.

is available on 2B, the Roku channel, and Zumo Play.

1672
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,680
Yeah, I've been watching it on Zumo,

1673
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,760
because then you see all the weird ads

1674
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,240
for what else is on Zumo.

1675
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,800
What is Zumo Play?

1676
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,480
Zumo is a streaming app that is co-owned by like two

1677
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,720
of the cable giants.

1678
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:26,000
And I don't quite understand why.

1679
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Well, they'll own Disneyland soon enough.

1680
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:29,800
They're going to buy.

1681
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,120
The theme parks have been splintered off, sold to Zumo.

1682
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,840
It's Zumo land now.

1683
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,880
Yeah, it's Zumo time.

1684
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:37,680
Zumo time.
