1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,800
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the second gate,

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,880
which is just behind the trees from Podcast the Ride,

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,760
the main feed.

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,560
It's right over there behind that set of trees.

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm Scott Gardner, Jason Sheridan's here, hi.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,760
Yeah, yeah, you can kind of see it if you squint.

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,800
Not too far.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,280
You're in the Patreon swamp, Mike Carlson, hi.

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,480
The Patreon swamp.

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,560
What a place to be.

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,920
That's a good thing, Kermit loves it.

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,760
Yeah, that's true.

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,480
Swamp's not a bad place necessarily,

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,800
you just think about it like that.

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,840
So happy there.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,520
Disney World was built on a swamp, it's good.

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,480
Swamp is good.

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,080
Yeah, yeah, let's destigmatize swamps.

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,400
No, we're happy to be here,

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,440
very happy to be talking about this special,

22
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,320
one of the most delightful specials put out by Disney

23
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,360
or the Muppets, two wonderful entities coming together.

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,400
That's right.

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,440
Just as we are coming together with a titan of,

26
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,440
well not quite podcasting, but weird DIY media,

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,040
by which I mean the George Lucas talk show

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,880
and also from his New York live improv show,

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,600
Rat Scraps, it's Patrick Kotner, hi.

30
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,760
Hey guys, how are you?

31
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,600
Hello, we're fine.

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,000
The titan of weird, I like that.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,840
Oh yeah.

34
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,160
That's where I stopped it, yeah.

35
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,560
What is the, I mean the George Lucas talk show,

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,160
it's like I wanted to call it a podcast,

37
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,440
but I know it's not that.

38
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,320
It's a live stream, it's an experience.

39
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,160
It sure is.

40
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,440
I think that's maybe the best way.

41
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,680
We had so much fun, I enjoyed doing that

42
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,400
with you guys so much.

43
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,080
You guys stayed a while.

44
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,240
Yeah, yeah, I even like, I had to go to bed,

45
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,800
I had a hard out to take care of my kid.

46
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,480
I had to bail just for pure,

47
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,600
like I am screwed in the morning if I don't,

48
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,560
but I didn't wanna go,

49
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,020
cause then by the end we're,

50
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,440
boy it gets loose, we're hanging out,

51
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,640
we got candles and sunglasses.

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,920
I think Mike left for like an hour.

53
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,160
I made a pizza, I put McGruff in the chair

54
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,680
and then I came back and McGruff came to life

55
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,840
for the last like 20 minutes.

56
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,160
Well we got Irishmen.

57
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,000
That's true.

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,840
Yeah.

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,200
Oh right, right, right, right.

60
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,680
Were we watching it that night?

61
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,440
You guys were watching, Tom Sharpling had messaged

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,280
and thrown you the curve ball

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,360
that you had to watch the Irishmen in the background.

64
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,640
Which he had threatened to do at some point,

65
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,480
like I have the right to do this to you guys at any point.

66
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,360
Tom had donated, we always gave the option to the viewers

67
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,920
that if they donated a certain amount of money

68
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,680
to some charity that we were doing,

69
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,320
that they could have an Irishman

70
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,100
that we would have to watch on the show

71
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,080
and they could, we told Tom he could use it at any time.

72
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,600
So I remember how much it was, but it was a lot of money

73
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,480
and he like held onto it for a year

74
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,960
and just happened to throw it all out that night.

75
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,080
Wow, wild.

76
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,440
It was crazy and fun and that's archived,

77
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,560
that's up on YouTube, you can watch that.

78
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,160
Which the quick sell of the George Lucas talk show,

79
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,520
I guess if people haven't seen,

80
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,520
I think we've got a lot of fans in common

81
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,560
so we're happy to have you here.

82
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,800
But you know, but it's you and what's his name, Watto?

83
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,640
Yep.

84
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,120
And George Lucas is a former, is a retired.

85
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,800
He's a filmmaker, he made a couple movies,

86
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,880
it's been a while though, but yeah.

87
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,760
And George hosts a talk show,

88
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,480
it's just like you're watching, you know,

89
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,320
Jimmy Fallon or Jimmy Kimmel or whatever,

90
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,720
except this happens to be hosted by a 75 year old,

91
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,880
retired billionaire filmmaker named George Lucas.

92
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,560
Who we learned knew a lot about Disney and classic animation

93
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,760
and the origins of Donald Duck and how he's a comic strips.

94
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,600
Over the years.

95
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,840
He loves Donald Duck.

96
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,680
Carl Barks, he loves Carl Barks.

97
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,880
His comic strips are really important.

98
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,800
Yeah, Clarence Duckie Nash, is that his name?

99
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,160
Used to be the voice of Donald.

100
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,040
Yeah, yeah, George, big Donald Duck guy.

101
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,480
Anyways, it's a talk show.

102
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,560
We talked to guests.

103
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,720
We've, you know, we've had Weird Al was on

104
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,000
and like John Ham's been on and Amy Mann's been on

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,600
and just a lot of insane people who, Whoopi Goldberg,

106
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,360
who like should not have been on the show, you know?

107
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,800
Like there's no reason why they should be there,

108
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,640
but they're there.

109
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,520
It's very fun.

110
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,200
It's very silly.

111
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,040
It's all on YouTube.

112
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,880
You guys, people can go watch if they want.

113
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,160
Yeah, yeah, so much fun.

114
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,240
We really enjoyed doing it.

115
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,320
And you're here in Los Angeles

116
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,200
doing the George Lucas talk show live,

117
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,800
which we're at Dynasty Typewriter

118
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,120
where we've been so excited for that.

119
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,280
It's in the future, I think, from when this is coming out,

120
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,200
but it's sold out, correct?

121
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,360
Sure.

122
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,520
Is it coming out this week?

123
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,360
Yeah.

124
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,200
Okay.

125
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,040
Yes, yeah.

126
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,720
I mean, listen, you can buy live stream tickets still.

127
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,560
Wonderful.

128
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,000
Dynastytypewriter.com slash GLTS,

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,960
you pick up those live streams.

130
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,120
We're doing two shows,

131
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,600
two different sets of guests.

132
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,440
I told you guys who the guests were.

133
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,280
Uh-huh, yes, we know, yeah, yeah.

134
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,120
You can vouch pretty good.

135
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,960
Pretty good, yeah, yeah.

136
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,800
Pretty good.

137
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,640
Pretty good.

138
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,480
Uh-huh.

139
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,320
So maybe, yeah, encouraged.

140
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,160
So yeah, go get those tickets if you want.

141
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,320
I wonder if you do have a, okay,

142
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,640
so you can't send people that way, that's great.

143
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,800
But we're also, we have you here

144
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,840
during your Los Angeles trip

145
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,320
for what you said was your first in-person recording.

146
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,160
It's crazy.

147
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,360
In years, I can't believe it's that.

148
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,200
That's great.

149
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,040
Yeah, first in-person, non-George Lucas,

150
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,360
like just podcast recording.

151
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,880
I haven't done one since pre-pandemic, so this is...

152
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,720
Geez, great.

153
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,480
I'm having to like stare at people.

154
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,240
Like you see me looking around the room right now

155
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,320
and it's just weird having to make eye contact.

156
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,280
Yeah, and we're spread out, we aren't in a window.

157
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,680
There's a little bit of distance between us

158
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,280
as opposed to between windows.

159
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,120
Sure, sure, sure.

160
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,760
It's a different deal.

161
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,840
I don't know if all podcasts are happening

162
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,520
in a garage that has occasional plane and bird

163
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,160
and car noise, but it's, you know, it keeps it breezy.

164
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,000
It's just a backyard hang.

165
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,640
And in this case, what could be breezier

166
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,720
than talking about the Muppets at Walt Disney World,

167
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,600
a delightful special.

168
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,760
Actually though, before we get to that,

169
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,800
which it's such a fun special to talk about,

170
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,480
but I really liked our back and forth about

171
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,920
what to discuss on the show,

172
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,640
because you were very clear that like

173
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,080
anything within either Muppets or Star Wars

174
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,800
and the list that you sent,

175
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,640
any one of them would have been fantastic

176
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,880
and will be in the future.

177
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,160
Like the topics just cut so deep.

178
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,800
And I guess, what am I asking here?

179
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,480
Do you wanna like vouch for any of them in particular

180
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,960
that we should do or you wanna do in the future

181
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,400
or just give any love to?

182
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,240
Let me pull up the slides.

183
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,360
I need to reference this out loud.

184
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,200
Yeah.

185
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,680
While you have a microphone and people-

186
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,320
I'm trying to remember how many I gave you,

187
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,720
but okay, oh my God, I gave you a lot.

188
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,360
Okay, so also, well it's funny,

189
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,320
cause you're talking to, you know,

190
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,560
we talk to people who love the parks

191
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,120
and then they give you things, you know,

192
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,320
attraction ideas that are great,

193
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,760
but they don't cut as deep as-

194
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,920
I love Disneyland so much.

195
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,520
I wanna do Space Mountain.

196
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,640
You're like, uh, snooze.

197
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
Yeah.

198
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,800
Not a real fan, we say.

199
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,680
You walked in the garage and you barely sat down

200
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,560
before you were name dropping Dexter Jester, you know.

201
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,400
Yeah.

202
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,920
I mean, let's say like Star Wars and the Muppets are my two,

203
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,000
those are two big things in my life, you know?

204
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,760
Two things that I've liked for a very long time.

205
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,240
So of course, MGM, Hollywood Studios was like my,

206
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,080
that was my place.

207
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,800
Like that was the place I loved the most.

208
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,600
God, yeah, both in their prime.

209
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,440
Absolutely.

210
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,840
And they're still, yeah, they're like-

211
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
They're still kinda there.

212
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

213
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,920
Before everything had to be,

214
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,160
nothing had to be rebooted yet.

215
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,640
They were still pretty close to the original,

216
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,640
very present.

217
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,320
Muppet stage show, they're like,

218
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,840
they're all, besides Muppet Vision 3D,

219
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,680
they're all around in so many different ways.

220
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,680
Big Muppets?

221
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,800
Yeah, big scary Muppets, big gangly Muppets.

222
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,840
Those are weird.

223
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,200
Yeah, they're weird, but I kinda like them.

224
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,040
Absolutely.

225
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,560
It's funny seeing like Kermit with like human proportions.

226
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,200
You know, where you're like, there's a guy in that suit,

227
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,800
his arms are so wide.

228
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,800
It's also the juxtaposition of like celebrity hand prints

229
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
and cement, which will come up later,

230
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,760
and a walk around Dick Tracy and giant Muppets,

231
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,080
like, just delightful.

232
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,680
And then like the dinosaurs and,

233
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,480
oh my God, what an assortment.

234
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,120
It is like the very, very early MGM studios

235
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,120
is like you shook an older millennial's brain.

236
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,720
Like you try to read their brain signals

237
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,480
and you're just getting clips of memories.

238
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,320
And it ruled.

239
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,160
Yeah.

240
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,000
That's the best.

241
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,840
Absolutely.

242
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,800
So all right, so I said Muppets of Walt Disney World,

243
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,320
which is what we're here for.

244
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,040
I said any canceled MGM Muppet stuff.

245
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,480
So like the idea is that they wanted to do

246
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,600
the great movie ride that was gonna be Muppetized.

247
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,400
I said Star Wars Launch Bay, which is fine.

248
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,240
It's interesting.

249
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,120
Sure, it would be to meditate on it for a while

250
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,560
and you can get something out of.

251
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,120
I said the hand prints outside great movie ride

252
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,400
because I was there when R.L. Stine did his.

253
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,240
Wow.

254
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,960
Which I've never seen out.

255
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,640
So I imagine they just have like a store room

256
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,920
with a bunch of.

257
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,760
Yeah, I don't know that they,

258
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,640
yeah, I think they, to get people there

259
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,200
and then they'd keep them out for a couple of weeks

260
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,880
or if they heard the person was coming,

261
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,720
they'd like, get it.

262
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,560
Yeah, yeah.

263
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,120
Well, there was a very brief Goosebumps stuff

264
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,440
at MGM studios.

265
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,560
It was probably right around then.

266
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,400
Yeah.

267
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,320
Yeah, that was 98, 99, probably somewhere around there.

268
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,400
And he put his hands in there

269
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,360
and then they just like, oh great.

270
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,000
And then he left and they picked it up

271
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,840
and just put it right backstage.

272
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,680
Yes.

273
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,520
Yes.

274
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,320
Mine was Jody Sweden from Full House.

275
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,160
Wow.

276
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,000
Wow.

277
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,840
In print, yeah, that's pretty,

278
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,000
and I love Full House by that point.

279
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,600
Was that during Full House?

280
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,440
Yeah.

281
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,280
Yeah.

282
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,100
Oh wow.

283
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,840
And I forget if they had done the official TGIF trip

284
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,680
or not. Sure.

285
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,680
But right around then.

286
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,920
That's pretty cool.

287
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,920
I said the great moments in American history,

288
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,720
the like window show with the Muppets.

289
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,560
Yes.

290
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,400
Yeah, we never done that.

291
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,240
Which is a great show.

292
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,160
Yeah.

293
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,240
I said the Meet the Muppets show

294
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,320
which is the one with the walk around characters

295
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,480
that was gone pretty quick.

296
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,320
Yes.

297
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,200
It was there for like a year maybe or something.

298
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,280
Too many tears.

299
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,120
Yeah.

300
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,940
Yeah.

301
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,280
He screams at Big Biggie.

302
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,520
I said the Bunsen and Beaker mobile labs.

303
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,360
Oh yeah.

304
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,180
Oh yeah.

305
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,020
That was there for a little bit.

306
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,860
Also doing.

307
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,480
Is that around a little ever?

308
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,320
I don't think so.

309
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,280
I haven't seen it in a while,

310
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,840
but stuff has been popping up that like robot

311
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,480
that like roams around tomorrow in his back.

312
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,120
So I feel like sometimes they have stuff in storage

313
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,120
that just pops out once in a while.

314
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,120
But I don't think they've had that mobile labs in a while.

315
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,880
I said any Galaxy's Edge stuff really.

316
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,280
The Galaxy's Edge comic book, which is wild.

317
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,120
Have you guys read that?

318
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,960
No.

319
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,560
They like try to tie it in to the thing

320
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,700
and like make it feel like this is the real world.

321
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,400
But then, you know,

322
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,240
also make a lot of the background characters

323
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,320
just look like cast members.

324
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,240
It's like very, very weird.

325
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,920
That's strange.

326
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,800
The art of Galaxy's Edge comic book,

327
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,040
or the art of a Galaxy's Edge book

328
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,800
that's just going through all the concept art.

329
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,520
Those weird busts that were in MGM.

330
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,040
Yes, yes.

331
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,680
Of like TV legends.

332
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,920
And by the way, if you're just running around,

333
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,920
not that far from where we're recording,

334
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,240
you might actually enjoy this.

335
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,840
There are two places where those were,

336
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,720
because that was the thing with the TV Academy.

337
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,560
Oh yeah.

338
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,280
And we're near the TV Academy,

339
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,240
which is like a little courtyard with a big Emmy.

340
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,880
It's in North Hollywood and they have the same bus.

341
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,800
It's like a big courtyard with all the,

342
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,920
so it's like, it's, you know,

343
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,680
Lucy and Carol Burnett.

344
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,760
Yeah, yeah, that kind of people.

345
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,920
It's behind the Jimmy Johns.

346
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,440
It's not on the main drag.

347
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,080
It's behind the Jimmy Johns.

348
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,520
And I think across the street from Vape Depot.

349
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,360
Yeah.

350
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,720
You can get, I for sure have posted a photo

351
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,840
of a Vape Depot through the Emmy Globe.

352
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,680
Yeah.

353
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,080
If you hit the Dave's Hot Chicken

354
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,880
that used to be the Arby's, keep going.

355
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,720
Okay, okay.

356
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,560
Good time, good time.

357
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,120
And those, and with those busts,

358
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,920
I don't think they put this in in Florida.

359
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,600
The North Hollywood one has Chuck Lorre.

360
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,440
Oh.

361
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,200
And his plaque is one of those big rants

362
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,520
that he goes on. Oh no.

363
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,480
On his like title cards.

364
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,800
So you can go see a Chuck Lorre.

365
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,680
I don't think in either one can you now see a Bill Cosby.

366
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,520
That makes sense.

367
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
I believe Bill has been. Yeah.

368
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,360
Right.

369
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,200
Ripped out of.

370
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,400
I said the Drew Carey show, the like sound thing

371
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,240
that was at MGM.

372
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,920
Oh, you have that one?

373
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,760
Oh wow.

374
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,600
Yeah.

375
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,640
Yeah.

376
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,480
In Prenseys I put barely remember it,

377
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,880
but I remember it being weird.

378
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,360
That was all I remembered.

379
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,600
Extremely weird.

380
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,400
Blackout by narrow audio.

381
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,240
Yeah.

382
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,480
The Figment comic book.

383
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,120
And then the old Star Tours pre-ride video.

384
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,960
Wow.

385
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,480
The one where they just like took the masks

386
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,200
from like the Ewok movies and.

387
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,040
Yeah.

388
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,880
Put it in there.

389
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,400
Oh, which I love the camera with the multiple.

390
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,240
Yeah, that's great.

391
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,800
Oh my God, the best.

392
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,280
Geez, well you cut deep.

393
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,200
You cut deep with Disney, MGM studios especially

394
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,960
with Star Wars and with Muppets.

395
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,600
And I think we landed at the right thing.

396
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,760
Which is what a, is it the, you know,

397
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,320
maybe not better than Muppet Vision 3D,

398
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,040
but it's one of the best collisions I would say

399
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,800
of Muppets and Disney.

400
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,640
Yeah.

401
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,760
I mean, they feel like such, they go together so well.

402
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,600
You know what I mean?

403
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,280
Like I always think of one when I think of the other

404
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,240
just cause they were made basically at the same time.

405
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,720
So like the puppets all look the same.

406
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,560
You know, like it's like.

407
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,400
Yes.

408
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,200
They weren't of different time period.

409
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,800
The vibe is right for every, it's right for the park.

410
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,440
It's right for the Muppets.

411
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,800
There's only two guest stars, but they're pretty notable.

412
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,260
This is again, for millennials, just put this on.

413
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,400
It's like a thunder shirt, not a scared dog.

414
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,360
Like this is just like catnip.

415
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,320
You just relax, you calm down.

416
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,960
Your friends are all here.

417
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,800
They sound correct.

418
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,640
They sound right.

419
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,920
They sound right.

420
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,360
They're making jokes that you would think like,

421
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,320
is that a weird old vaudeville reference?

422
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,160
But I'm allowing it because it's a bunch of puppets.

423
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,200
My favorite puppet friends saying it,

424
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,520
my favorite Muppet friends.

425
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,360
Yeah.

426
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,920
And I mean this gets dark.

427
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,640
This is the last time they quote sound right.

428
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,460
Unquote.

429
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,300
Right.

430
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,140
Well, yes.

431
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,640
It should be noted this aired May 6th, 1990 on NBC

432
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,260
on the magical world of Disney.

433
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,380
This is before they were fully in a relationship

434
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,320
and owned ABC.

435
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,800
May 16th, 1990, Jim Henson passes away 10 days later.

436
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
Insane.

437
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,960
So crazy.

438
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,120
So this is the last film.

439
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,800
Well, no, Muppet Vision 3D comes out later.

440
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,640
Yeah.

441
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,460
Right.

442
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,660
But like the one of the last Jim Henson pieces

443
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,960
also aired two days after Jim Henson was on Arsenio Hall,

444
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,440
which was his last appearance just as him.

445
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,880
And then I didn't know this, the day Jim Henson died,

446
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,280
so right around there, on the same day,

447
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,280
they aired a special called Sing Sesame Street Remembers Joe

448
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,920
Raposo, who's a tribute special to the Sesame Street composer.

449
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,960
And Jim is in it being interviewed.

450
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,280
So the day he died, you could watch this thing that's

451
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,240
about the sad premature death of another Muppet legend.

452
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,960
What a time.

453
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,120
It's also the same day Sammy Davis Jr. died.

454
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,620
Wow.

455
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,120
Wow.

456
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,800
Isn't that crazy?

457
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,040
Geez.

458
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,360
That's a wild day.

459
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,120
You think that celebrities only die together now,

460
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,200
because people on Twitter are weird and loud about it

461
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
and make art where they're like holding hands.

462
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,700
Right.

463
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,640
Why weirdly walking into heaven together?

464
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,960
Or if they have figures, they do a funeral with the figures now.

465
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,280
That's a common thing.

466
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:06,960
It is?

467
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,520
Oh, yeah.

468
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,920
No.

469
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,680
Where has that been done?

470
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,960
On the Facebook groups I'm on?

471
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,460
Yeah.

472
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:12,960
Yeah.

473
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,460
Yeah.

474
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,960
Yeah.

475
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,040
I'll tie Griffin Newman and I will share them sometimes

476
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,240
when someone has passed away, but they have a figure.

477
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,840
You have to say one.

478
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,520
Who has been figured?

479
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,760
I mean, the closest one, and it's very sad,

480
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,160
but obviously we're making fun of the idea of the memorial

481
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,120
is Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther figure.

482
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,880
Oh, no.

483
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,840
Just like in a funeral.

484
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,440
People are like in RIP.

485
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,480
And I'm like, you set this up, man.

486
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,880
This is pretty weird.

487
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,960
Well, here's what I need to do is get this action

488
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,720
figure in a little box or whatever.

489
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,360
It is.

490
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,320
Jeez, that's weird.

491
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,280
Are there figures standing around them?

492
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,280
Yeah.

493
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,800
People from there, or can the Smurfs come?

494
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,520
Who gets to go to the funeral?

495
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,520
It's usually with, from what I've seen, it's usually in the universe.

496
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,040
I mean, there's a Stan Lee figure, and when Stan Lee died,

497
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,000
it was all of the Marvel heroes standing around Stan Lee,

498
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,440
and the people posed them perfectly.

499
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,960
Thanks to deep fake technology, it will be like Stan never died.

500
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,440
Well, that's a hole.

501
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,760
We could do a whole hour and a half of a new contract

502
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,320
that will allow Stan Lee to continue cameoing in Marvel films and TV.

503
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,880
I have a theory that Tom Cruise is developing the best AI

504
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,320
with the best deep fake so that there will never not be Tom Cruise movies.

505
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,040
Is that just because you got fooled by that deep fake of Tom Cruise?

506
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,600
I did get fooled by that deep fake.

507
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,080
I did.

508
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,720
I admittedly won that Proclinent Singer.

509
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,280
I'm just wondering what your rationale was for Tom being the one.

510
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,560
I'm thinking about Maverick, and looking at him getting old

511
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,040
in the Mission Impossible trailer, I'm like,

512
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,040
what if there are Tom Cruise movies forever?

513
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,040
And the Stan Lee news.

514
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,480
I bet my thinking would be that Tom is actually

515
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,200
investing in things to keep him alive.

516
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,080
That too.

517
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,200
I would think he's doing it.

518
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,880
He told me to be mutually exclusive.

519
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,680
I guess that's true.

520
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,920
But Tom's such a practical effects guy.

521
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,640
He would want to be doing the teenage blood, blood replacement,

522
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,440
all the different things.

523
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,280
Cloning himself and putting his old brain, a rejuvenated old brain

524
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,360
into the new body.

525
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,920
I think he's looking at all that stuff.

526
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,320
Yeah.

527
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,120
So yeah, perhaps part of it is the looking into if with enough G's,

528
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,280
if he keeps climbing and climbing, can he find heaven?

529
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,760
Sure.

530
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,240
Got a camera up there, keep filming his movies in heaven.

531
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,800
I found it, found the place.

532
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,080
All the everyone you remember and love is here.

533
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,200
I'm with them.

534
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,280
So Fred stares in my movies now.

535
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,880
Yeah.

536
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,600
Marilyn Monroe.

537
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,400
Sorry, Jeremy.

538
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,240
Heaven does come to me.

539
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,720
It feels like the upping from we're shooting a movie in space.

540
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,360
You know?

541
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
And he goes, hey, guys, guess what?

542
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,360
2028.

543
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,960
First movie ever shot in heaven.

544
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,360
And we're doing it.

545
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:56,880
It's not.

546
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,440
Everyone could have done it.

547
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,360
Everyone was just quitters.

548
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,080
Everyone who ever died was a quitter.

549
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,560
And then Tom Cruise figured it out.

550
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,080
Yeah.

551
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,440
And then he does a mea culpa because like, you know what?

552
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,400
It was a Christian god.

553
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
It's sorry.

554
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,840
Sorry.

555
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,600
That's on me.

556
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,520
I'm strong enough to admit when I was wrong.

557
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,320
I met God.

558
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,320
I shook his hand.

559
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,080
Great handshake.

560
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,000
Great handshake.

561
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,760
Right in the eyes.

562
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,120
Hey, but I'm also partying with Elrond.

563
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,920
So I have it both ways.

564
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,040
Who is in heaven?

565
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,400
Yeah, Elrond's in heaven.

566
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,640
God forgave Elrond.

567
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,800
And if he can do that, he'll forgive all of you.

568
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,920
It is wild that he's now the one who comes out looking better

569
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,720
in that Matt Lauer interview.

570
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,440
Oh, yeah, right.

571
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,240
What are you saying?

572
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,360
How crazy is being?

573
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,280
Yeah.

574
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,120
You can never.

575
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,280
No, it can't be worse.

576
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,480
If it's choose your fighter, you choose Tom.

577
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,840
This also context.

578
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,800
OK, so I think everybody's very fond of the Muppets Family

579
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,120
Christmas special.

580
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,280
Mike and I talked about it with the Doughboys.

581
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,720
Done a couple of years before this.

582
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,480
I think the Muppets really shine in specials.

583
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,240
There's great films, of course, also.

584
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,280
But the specials are just it just

585
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,000
feels like a perfect format for them.

586
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,440
And just Muppets special content around this time.

587
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,320
The same year.

588
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,840
I don't think I knew this was all the same year.

589
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,080
This special, Muppets at Disney World.

590
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,560
Miss Piggy and other Muppets appear in the Disneyland 35th

591
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,880
anniversary special.

592
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,280
They're really good one that's Filmic with Ernest and C-3PO

593
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,960
and Tony Danza and all that.

594
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,840
The Muppet babies are in Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue,

595
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,880
anti-drug special.

596
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,040
They're in the Earth Day special.

597
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,040
That insane thing that is what it's Ghostbusters and Doc

598
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,920
Brown and E.T. and Nathan Thurman.

599
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,440
But it's not Ghostbusters.

600
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,200
Yes, because it only knows Egon's brother.

601
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,160
That's right.

602
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
Isn't it Elon?

603
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,280
It might be Elon Spangler.

604
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,160
It's something like the head of the EPA or something like that.

605
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,560
There's some lawyers who bought houses off Ghostbusters.

606
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,400
If you guys have not talked about that, you should absolutely.

607
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,240
I don't know how we haven't.

608
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,240
Yeah, what a...

609
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,520
I mean, that's I don't know how we're so excited about our

610
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,520
multiverses.

611
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,200
We've already when the Earth Day special has already occurred.

612
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,720
Yeah, really?

613
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,080
Anyway, that and then well, and then horribly at the end of the year,

614
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,720
they ended up making the Muppets celebrate Jim Henson because he passed away.

615
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,080
Right. A good special as is the Joe Raposo one.

616
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,440
I mean, this was just a peak time.

617
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,880
All great stuff. All things everybody should watch.

618
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,680
That's a benefit of YouTube is that like, boy, these things were not

619
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,320
they were all like if you didn't have the tape of it off.

620
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,200
Yeah, really?

621
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,760
This might disappear forever.

622
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,760
I mean, that's how I saw this was I think my grandma had it on tape.

623
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,200
Wow. And she just taped it when it was on.

624
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,560
She just happened to keep the VHS.

625
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,920
And then I saw it when I was a kid and like stole it from her house

626
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,960
and like burned it to DVD so I could have it.

627
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,280
Like, it was just great.

628
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:58,800
Yeah. Wow.

629
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,960
So you really perceive you.

630
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,160
You have this one. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

631
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,000
It's pretty special. It's really good.

632
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,480
I mean, any we love any just the gangs

633
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,880
going to Disney World like TGIF did.

634
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,160
But what gang would you rather see go to Disney World?

635
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,200
Yeah, it's so much fun.

636
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,240
It's also it's fascinating how it like

637
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,160
the special ends in your you really feel like they're like welcome to the family.

638
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,080
We're here. We're all together.

639
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,200
Finally. And it's like, oh, guys, wait like six months.

640
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,480
Wait a minute. Very ominous.

641
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,840
Beyond the death of and the death causes everything to fall apart.

642
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,400
And then hearing yours, I don't think it was clear at the time.

643
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,520
But now Frank Oz is very much it was the deal that killed him.

644
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,800
So the grimace thing.

645
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,720
So seeing Mickey say that is like,

646
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,120
it's as it hits different now, as the kids say.

647
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,840
Pretty strange. Yeah, yeah, it is.

648
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,440
It like I was I haven't I've seen pieces.

649
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,560
I never watched all of it.

650
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:03,440
But yeah, it feels like it feels so there's so much effort into it, too,

651
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,920
versus just a normal like ad.

652
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,320
Everything we talk about as far as movie, it's all ads.

653
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,720
But you do go, well, there's a lot of effort here.

654
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,600
There's like loads of sets I've never seen before.

655
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,720
And then, yes, ends on an ominous note,

656
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,280
which I'm sure they didn't assume would be the case when they made it.

657
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,080
Yeah. But a visual we like casual polo Mickey.

658
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,000
Yes. Oh, my God.

659
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,400
Yes. Casual polo Mickey in his office.

660
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,520
When the the moment when you're building to the moment, we're at the door.

661
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,320
What's going to happen when the door opens?

662
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,200
And I watched it with Aaron had never seen it and the reveal that, oh, my God,

663
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,280
it's animated Mickey interacting with the puppet muppets.

664
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,360
And that's what I call it.

665
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,280
Everyone should call him that puppet.

666
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,560
It's more proper term.

667
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,640
But then also like, oh, my God, not just it's Mickey.

668
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,720
Oh, my God, it's casual 90s.

669
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,840
So let me ask you this, Scott.

670
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,840
We've had the debate about hyperspace hoopla when Mickey shows up at the end.

671
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,680
And it's shocking.

672
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,560
And you're very excited about this Mickey reveal, even though it's Disney World.

673
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,800
Would you be happier about the end of the hyperspace hoopla

674
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,040
if he was wearing his polo shirt and it was like 90s polo shirt Mickey?

675
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,040
I think so. I think that would do it for me more.

676
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,560
I mean, look, in this case, it's the mixing of the mediums.

677
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,120
This is an ongoing discussion we've had on the show.

678
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,400
We are you familiar with these with these Star Wars Park oddities?

679
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,840
Are you familiar with something they did called hyperspace hoopla?

680
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,520
Is that the Space Mountain overlay?

681
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,840
That's no, no, that's the Star Wars.

682
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,400
Yeah, Star Wars dance show during Star Wars weekends.

683
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,680
Like a few years ago. Yes, yes, yes.

684
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,160
I know exactly what it is. Yeah, OK, good.

685
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,800
Yeah. What the?

686
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,240
I think what's the name of the host?

687
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,000
There's two hosts. Sagan Ali.

688
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,960
So that's something. Yeah.

689
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,400
Same host for a few years.

690
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,480
And, you know, yeah, like like if you want to see Darth Maul twerk.

691
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,960
Yeah, this is where it would be.

692
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,480
And everybody do it in style. Sure.

693
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,520
Yeah, I knew you were troubled when you walked in stuff like that.

694
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,560
And then at the end of one year, which is the best year,

695
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,320
Mickey comes out and dances at the very end and he's in a Jedi outfit

696
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,320
and the audience loses their mind.

697
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,680
And I got I get it.

698
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,360
I was watching and I got excited, too.

699
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,360
And I think Jason and I agreed that it was good.

700
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,960
And Scott was like, it's not that weird. He's at Disney World. Sure.

701
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,200
This was my yeah, this and it was built up because you were very like,

702
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,080
and then wait until you see.

703
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,600
And then Mickey came out and I was like, so so what is it?

704
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,440
Like I didn't know that was. Yeah. Yeah.

705
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,120
If they were doing it at Circuit City, it would be there.

706
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,360
You go. Yeah.

707
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,240
That's what I'm saying.

708
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,520
If it was a place where I don't expect to see Mickey Mouse, but I think to you

709
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,160
got to remember. Oh, my God.

710
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,840
That'd be the weirdest place of all.

711
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,480
Yeah. April Fool's.

712
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,400
Are they switching like Fallon and Kimmel?

713
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,240
I think it's early days of the kind of lightweight character costumes

714
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,840
like the Mickey. He's like, he blinks.

715
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,840
Oh, I don't know. Yeah, he blinks. Oh, no, it's good.

716
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,760
I don't like the blink in the mouth moving.

717
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,040
It's it's too much.

718
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,320
Oh, I'm pro blinking.

719
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:00,600
The costumes are just kind of like, like a green man suit now,

720
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,880
like their arms and legs and it's like a guy.

721
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,240
You can tell it's a guy. Yeah.

722
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,520
Which takes sometimes takes away the fun a little. Sure.

723
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,680
But I'm sure it makes it easier to break dance.

724
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,440
Probably. Yeah.

725
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,520
And it comes out, it's like, oh, I just want to feel this moment.

726
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,480
And Mickey like puts his hands up in the air and he kind of does like one of these

727
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,720
and his eyes keep blinking and the people are losing their minds.

728
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,000
Also, keep in mind that if you like the show, you are like worked up

729
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,360
into a lather at this point by the end of 20, 25 minutes.

730
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:34,200
You're seeing all the all the Star Wars characters dancing to pop music.

731
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,800
Yeah. So I guess you you would be very excited if you also just liked

732
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,480
the whole show, which I do.

733
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,600
Was that the last year?

734
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,480
I think I believe it was. Yeah.

735
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,360
So like for there's continuity through the shows, too. Yes.

736
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,040
So it all builds to like Mickey comes out, does a fun dance.

737
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,680
And it's like, anyway, you're not going to see this for a while.

738
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,920
I mean, here's all those songs you mentioned sound far too modern

739
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,880
for it not to be the last show. You know what I mean?

740
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,320
Like, well, that was that was the gimmick. Yeah.

741
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,520
It was always sort of modern.

742
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,960
But from a Star Wars brand perspective.

743
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,480
Oh, well, because they started where they're like, yeah, we're not.

744
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,320
No, I know. And that's that's when it was all over.

745
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,360
Sadly, that's when the fun was over.

746
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,360
It's like I it's like I threw you the ball and you ran with it

747
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,680
into the across the field, into the hoopla zone.

748
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,480
You're like, now it's a hoopla episode.

749
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,120
The characters were snig and hoopla.

750
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,280
Yeah, I was trying to remember.

751
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,160
It was like it because it had to be a tortured rhyme.

752
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,680
Yeah. Yeah. Hoopla. Snig. Snig.

753
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,920
Yeah. Snig. Yeah.

754
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,520
It's one of the ruttles, too.

755
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,480
Yeah. Yeah.

756
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,280
It does feel a piece of some of the things in the Muppets.

757
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,560
And I'm not talking about the Muppets dancing modern music.

758
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm talking about like stuff that they would like, you know,

759
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,120
really nitpick on nowadays where it's like they're walking down

760
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,200
Hollywood Boulevard and then suddenly Miss Piki is that big Thunder Mountain.

761
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,000
Yeah. Geography is all over the place. Yeah. Yeah.

762
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,920
No, it's it's it's really insane.

763
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,320
The well, let me here.

764
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,800
Let's just let's let's go to the top because, well, there's big stars.

765
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,080
We got to bring into this beyond the Muppets, beyond Mickey.

766
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,440
And I want to go to the first one who we see,

767
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,480
which is that, of course, this being the magical world of Disney,

768
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:19,240
that you get an appearance from from the big dog, Michael Eisner.

769
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,480
Michael Eisner introduces the special.

770
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,440
He's in the Grand Floridian with Fozzie and another boy.

771
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,400
A common thing with Muppet Family Christmas.

772
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,440
Yeah. He's mom. I love Fozzie's mom.

773
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,000
I think he really used two appearances of her. Maybe.

774
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,480
I think so. Muppet Christmas Carol.

775
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,240
She's just this Fezzi wig.

776
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,200
OK, OK. OK.

777
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,720
She may have been like a runner on the Muppet show once.

778
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,160
Think now? I don't think so.

779
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,960
I don't know. I only know that from a wiki.

780
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,000
I don't. I have maybe a collection of it myself.

781
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,640
So I can vouch for it.

782
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,400
But the but huge roles in both of these specials.

783
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,600
And you know, I'm relaxed when she's around.

784
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,480
That's why I'm so I feel taken care of when Mrs.

785
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,400
Fozzie is around, yeah, because especially because of that holiday.

786
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,600
She makes me feel so welcome because she brought the Fraggles, Sesame Street

787
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,920
and the Muppets together.

788
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,880
And I assume she would welcome me in.

789
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,320
Oh, yeah, she'd love if you showed up.

790
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,040
Yeah, the more the more the more the merrier.

791
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,920
And the merrier. Watch out for the icy patch.

792
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,320
The her official name, Emily Bayer.

793
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,400
So I'm almost boy.

794
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,760
I mean, Emily bears around Michael Eisner's around.

795
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,680
Has everyone seen the outtakes?

796
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,600
Just yeah. OK, OK.

797
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,120
And I feel like probably a lot of the listeners have seen the outtakes too.

798
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,480
But, you know, I don't think anyone will complain about

799
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,680
so great standard Michael Eisner intro.

800
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,000
The I mean, the regular stuff is really fun that he gets like

801
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,560
what it's like a wardrobe fix, like in a bunch of Muppets Russian.

802
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,640
Yeah. Tear his suit apart.

803
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,320
Fozzie spills something on Fozzie.

804
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,240
Fozzie takes a ball, like hits him with butter on a butter night,

805
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,000
like rubs butter on his sleeve in there.

806
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,160
And really involved in there.

807
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,200
The way they shoot it, it makes like it makes it look like Fozzie did it on purpose.

808
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,560
Yeah. Which I don't think they meant to have that.

809
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,240
But I like the idea that Fozzie was just like, I'm going to fuck his suit up.

810
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,080
Yeah. Yeah. Funny.

811
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,880
He might have. Well, because he's like, you know, he's pranking him.

812
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,120
Yeah. Yeah. He's still pretty young.

813
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,280
It's looks real young in this.

814
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,800
No. Hello. Oh, not a hello.

815
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,600
Yes. Yeah. Having been through every hello to make the Michael Eisner

816
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,480
hello montage, although there's I found more.

817
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,360
I mean, one of these days I got to do around three.

818
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,680
That's how many there are.

819
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,440
But yeah, this one didn't work.

820
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,800
Not a hello.

821
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,240
But lots of fun stuff anyway.

822
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,000
Here is the the outtakes, which is a great montage in general,

823
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,760
because you see how much fun they're having, how much they stay in character

824
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,040
and keep it up and kind of needle each other.

825
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,840
It's the real show.

826
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,080
It's the edge of your show and never more clear than in this Michael Eisner sequence.

827
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,640
That bears in usually, but I appreciate this, Mr.

828
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,480
Eisner, such a beautiful room.

829
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,120
It's very nice. Yes.

830
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,560
I love it. Oh, welcome, everyone.

831
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,160
I'm in the lobby of the gland.

832
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,760
I'm sorry. Gland, gland, Floridian.

833
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,120
Well, we could change the name.

834
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,840
Could I request a room with a cave?

835
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,800
Oh, my God. I'm going to die right here.

836
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,600
Welcome, everyone.

837
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,640
I'm in the lobby of the gland, gland, gland, gland.

838
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,040
This is wonderful.

839
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,840
Thank you for letting us stay here. Third take.

840
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,840
Well, bears don't usually get to get one place like this.

841
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,200
Thanks a lot. Oh, great.

842
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Welcome, everyone.

843
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,000
I'm in the lobby of the grand Floridian.

844
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,200
Oh,

845
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,760
OK, who else can we get?

846
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,080
Pazzy, you're just killing it.

847
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,280
Yeah, just killing it.

848
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,360
Do it ad libbing.

849
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,960
Different intro every time.

850
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,320
Did I? Maybe I said this once already that there's a little tonight show

851
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,640
where Kermit hosts a tonight show. You've seen this episode.

852
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,600
Can I tell you something? Sure. Go ahead.

853
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,600
If you go look and see who uploaded that on YouTube.

854
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,120
Is it you? It's Connor Ratliff.

855
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,240
Oh, wow.

856
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,360
Who I gave the video to and then he has like a million views.

857
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,480
And I'm like, I'm so mad.

858
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,560
Oh, my God.

859
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,320
The source of the stories.

860
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,200
That's crazy.

861
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,320
Yeah. It's of events to you.

862
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,760
Yeah. I watch this like less than a year ago.

863
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,880
It's great. But and this is going to sound like I'm shitting on Henson.

864
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,640
I'm not. Yeah.

865
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,520
Henson is fun. Yes.

866
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:25,320
But Oz is like next level improviser fast on his feet.

867
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,360
And like he obviously has more fun characters,

868
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,120
but Henson feels a little lost in places doing an hour or whatever.

869
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,360
It was still an hour. It was not 90 minutes.

870
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,600
Was it 90? Wow. That's that long ago.

871
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,000
Yeah. It's a 90 minutes. It's long.

872
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,840
And I get it that he has to be out there the whole time.

873
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,160
But you go, whoa, he's a next level improviser as far as like he's got

874
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,720
so many funny moments that are seemingly just off the cuff.

875
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,360
It's really a shame he doesn't he hasn't directed a movie in a long time.

876
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,760
I think death at a funeral maybe is the last one beyond like documentary stuff.

877
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,880
I also like going back and seeing stuff and like he's got a little role in like

878
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,480
American werewolf. Yeah. And he's funny. He's in Knives Out.

879
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,920
Yes. He's in Knives Out.

880
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,440
You go like, hey, you've been in more stuff.

881
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,760
I know. Like he's in so much stuff.

882
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,640
I was trying to remember. Yeah.

883
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,560
It's a lot of land of stuff. Oh, sure.

884
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,680
Sure. Sure. Yeah.

885
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,440
God, what a like magical person to be running around.

886
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,560
I know. Like great filmmaking of that time.

887
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,240
We can add this in too. Yeah.

888
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,760
To say nothing of Yoda. Maybe one of the best careers.

889
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,480
You know what I mean? Just like when you add it all up.

890
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,840
Oh, yeah. Oh, wow.

891
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,880
It's there's so many separate disparate things that like add up to.

892
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,520
Yes. So much of American culture.

893
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,600
Did he direct the score?

894
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,600
Yes. Marlon Brando appeared.

895
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,160
He could be why. Well, because he called Brando called him Miss Piggy to be disrespectful to him.

896
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,400
Brando refused to take any direction from him.

897
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,920
So they made De Niro wear an earpiece and Oz would tell him what to tell Brando through

898
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,480
the earpiece because Brando kept calling him Miss Piggy.

899
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:00,320
I'm sorry. And they gave us a making of show of the Godfather and not the score.

900
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,600
This is what I want to get actors playing old weird Brando and Frank Oz.

901
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,600
Who else is in the score?

902
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,960
Ed Norton. Ed Norton.

903
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,680
It was like, yeah, like three generations of the coolest dramatic actors.

904
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:18,000
Yeah. And then it was Frank Oz directing and Brando was being a weirdo.

905
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,200
Oh, being a Brando.

906
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,760
Well, yeah. In top form, they're so funny.

907
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,200
That's so great. Then, I mean, we'll meet star number two, but let me just go through the story

908
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:37,600
of it a little bit. The launching point being that Kermit has brought his Muppet friends to his

909
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:46,640
hometown, which is Paradise Swamp, which is full of various frogs that he knew growing up, kind of

910
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:53,600
a backwards weird place that is having a frog festival and bug fry. He thinks that this will

911
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:00,320
be a lot of fun for the gang, but they're sort of weirded out by all the froggy-ness, not the

912
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:07,680
place for that. You know, Miss Piggy is kind of sheltered and with her handyman. Who is that?

913
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,320
Beauregard.

914
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,520
Oh, Beauregard.

915
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,640
Yeah. He's the janitor.

916
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,520
He's around still.

917
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,320
Oh, that's okay. And then becomes in this, for these purposes.

918
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,680
Like her assistant.

919
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:25,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right-hand man. So kind of like crazy swamp frog sequence.

920
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,680
I like Robin too. I think I'm on record liking Robin.

921
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,840
Robin is a... I didn't even realize until a couple years ago that Robin was controversial

922
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:39,520
because I always liked Robin, but apparently that is not necessarily the most popular opinion.

923
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,080
He's kind of not to the same level, but like Bean Bunny, who I know you guys have talked about

924
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:50,000
before who's in Muppet 3D. Bean was sort of like the cute addition that they brought in.

925
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,960
And Robin was sort of like the proto Bean, a lot of people say, where he was also just

926
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,080
cute and sang cute songs and didn't have much going on beyond that.

927
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,720
But I was... There's some bigger Muppet fans than I that I've talked to and they go,

928
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,440
hate Robin. And I go, really?

929
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,800
Robin is Tiny Tim and he's so empathetic and charming.

930
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,120
I agree. I didn't realize this existed.

931
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,240
Now I'll say this and I want to get this on record. Muppet Christmas Carol.

932
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,520
My least favorite Muppet movie.

933
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:21,840
What?

934
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,480
Whoa.

935
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,840
That's Jason's favorite, right?

936
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,640
The bottom.

937
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,520
You're putting Muppet Treasure Island ahead of it?

938
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,000
Yeah.

939
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,560
It's not funny.

940
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,600
Muppets in space?

941
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,720
Muppet Christmas Carol, not funny.

942
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,800
It's the Christmas Carol. There are funny movies.

943
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
I'm not into Amy. That's not what I'm here for though.

944
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,240
I think Gonzo's... I think all that stuff, there's some of it through it.

945
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,920
There's a little too much sentimentality for me.

946
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,640
Like I like that.

947
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,880
But I want to laugh and I don't really laugh that much with Christmas Carol.

948
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,480
There's the song that's only in some of the versions that's this like heartbreaker of his mom.

949
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:50,980
Yeah.

950
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,960
Is that like too cloying for you or something?

951
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,520
Yeah.

952
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,960
Saddest song ever written. Yeah.

953
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,800
Fast forward through that scene on the VHS.

954
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,960
Well, everyone, by the way, anyone who says anything negative about anything Muppet related

955
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,720
is stepping in it. You're stepping in it.

956
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,040
That's fine.

957
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,120
I probably have somehow without realizing it.

958
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,520
I think there's any slightly negative...

959
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,480
Well, you know what I was about to say?

960
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,160
I have not actually watched Muppets in space, which we've therefore ranked ahead of.

961
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:16,720
Yes.

962
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,760
So and...

963
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,560
But also to be fair.

964
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,760
What do you have to say about having not seen it?

965
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,280
I have no previous bias against Muppets in space.

966
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,000
Any...

967
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,640
I'll say this.

968
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,040
Yeah.

969
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,200
I was seven when Muppets from space came out.

970
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,680
Okay. So that might be the prime age for it.

971
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,720
Lead it to certain ways.

972
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,280
Sure.

973
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,040
And you know, before people come for me, I have Muppet Bonafita.

974
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,120
I own a Beauregard bust.

975
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,640
So don't come for me, guys. Okay?

976
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,480
What is your opinion on Walter?

977
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,800
I don't dislike Walter.

978
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,600
I don't either.

979
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,920
I wish they figured out what to do with Walter.

980
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,400
Yeah.

981
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,000
And I think there's a very funny line in Muppets Most Wanted, which is the second

982
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,520
after the Seagull movie where he runs away and someone...

983
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,720
I think it's Pepe has a line where he says,

984
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,840
didn't we just spend the entire last movie making him a part of the group?

985
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,440
And then Robin comes in and says, at the expense of other beloved characters.

986
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,480
And I sort of feel that way about Walter where I'm like,

987
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,160
you got to find that second beat for him.

988
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,280
You're going to do all this.

989
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:17,760
Yeah.

990
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,560
And turn around.

991
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:18,880
Yeah.

992
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,120
Yeah.

993
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,440
Yeah.

994
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,320
I'm going to throw Muppet under the bus if we're doing that.

995
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,480
I'm curious, will I get any hate on this?

996
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,800
Because Sesame Street's been more present in my house with a young child.

997
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,080
And we really like...

998
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,840
Even newer Sesame Street characters we like a lot,

999
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,760
but there's one who's not really around anymore.

1000
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,720
I do not care for Baby Bear.

1001
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,220
Sure.

1002
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,160
That might be harsh because that's a cute character.

1003
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,120
But are there Baby Bear stands out there?

1004
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,720
Am I wrong on Baby Bear?

1005
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,320
What do I know about Baby Bear?

1006
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,520
I think I know what he looks like.

1007
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,000
Any kind of...

1008
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,960
He puts a lot of W's in...

1009
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,200
He has a cutesy way of speaking.

1010
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:57,600
Yeah.

1011
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:57,840
Yeah.

1012
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,240
Yeah.

1013
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:58,960
Just not my...

1014
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,520
I don't know.

1015
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,480
Doesn't do it for me.

1016
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,280
I think that's the one thing about him that's positive is

1017
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,640
if kids have a speech impediment.

1018
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,360
It was a helpful thing to be like,

1019
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,560
Oh, Baby Bear, he's like me.

1020
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,120
No, Scott, you shouldn't.

1021
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,240
Scott, big mistake, Scott.

1022
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:10,740
Yeah.

1023
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,520
Sounds like you're really...

1024
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,020
I didn't say that.

1025
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,280
And it's possible to dislike the timbre of the voice without the mispronunciation.

1026
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:17,840
Sure, sure.

1027
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,560
This is not for the register, you see.

1028
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,320
The guy who played that does not work on the show anymore.

1029
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,200
So that is why.

1030
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,360
Well, and I think I've caught that he did other things like that

1031
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,960
because I didn't really like this character, Murray.

1032
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,080
Yeah, that's also him.

1033
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,880
Yeah.

1034
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,680
And that was that a...

1035
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,160
You probably know this, that was a not a good exit.

1036
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,120
That's a dramatic...

1037
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,560
I believe it was a dramatic exit.

1038
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,560
Yeah, I don't know all the details, but he was like head writer and director

1039
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,000
and performed with it for a while.

1040
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,520
I don't think it was as bad as some of the other exits, but I don't think it was...

1041
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,080
Bad exit.

1042
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,480
I mean, we're looking at with this 1990 special is teetering.

1043
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,600
It's like right before, boy, is it nothing but drama.

1044
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,080
It's never fully been course corrected.

1045
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:58,960
And with all of these, the bad Steve Whitmire and Frank Oz doesn't feel good about anything.

1046
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,440
Yeah.

1047
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,200
This guy you're describing and...

1048
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,800
Dave Goles is the one guy who's still there.

1049
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,520
Still here.

1050
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,320
Right, right, right.

1051
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,600
Gonzo himself.

1052
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,840
Who's Gonzo and who else in this is it?

1053
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,040
Bunsen, Honeydew.

1054
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,680
That might be...

1055
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,640
Beauregard.

1056
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,440
He's Beauregard.

1057
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,160
That's him.

1058
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,600
Who is your favorite Muppet?

1059
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,640
Can you give us just some of your basic favorite stuff from Muppets?

1060
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,320
I'm not really a main guy.

1061
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,240
Like I like Gonzo, I like Fozzie.

1062
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,920
Those are like my two main favorite guys.

1063
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,280
But you're a deeper Muppet fan.

1064
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,040
I'm a New Zealand guy.

1065
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,320
Oh, interesting.

1066
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,280
I'm a crazy hairy guy.

1067
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,720
I'm a sweet chef guy.

1068
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,200
I'm like a Sweetums guy, you know?

1069
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,560
Okay, got it.

1070
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,680
Dr. Teeth.

1071
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,600
But like Gonzo is probably the top of the main group.

1072
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,960
The weirdest of the...

1073
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,840
Yeah.

1074
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,120
Do you go hard for Sesame Street too or just Muppets in general?

1075
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,880
I do like Sesame Street a lot.

1076
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,080
I interned there for a year.

1077
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,800
Oh, wow.

1078
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,520
And I went there a couple of times when I was a kid, which was cool.

1079
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:59,520
Because I wanted to work in that world for a while.

1080
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,000
But yeah, Muppet was always more of my thing.

1081
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,500
Sure.

1082
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,080
But I stand the street.

1083
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,040
Yeah, any good encounters?

1084
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,200
Any like, oh, I got a good moment with so-and-so?

1085
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,360
So I was there the last time as of today that Frank Oz performed on Sesame Street.

1086
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:15,860
Whoa.

1087
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,360
Not wild.

1088
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:17,860
Yes.

1089
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,680
It is wild.

1090
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,120
He did a song with Grover.

1091
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,920
They brought him in for like two days because he's very expensive now.

1092
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,880
And they're not like flowing with cash over there.

1093
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,000
It's been half an hour now with a lot of reuse.

1094
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,560
For sure.

1095
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,040
And they shoot like-

1096
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,080
These sequences are in every episode.

1097
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,720
Yeah, they shoot like two weeks a year or something like that.

1098
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,760
Disney does not own them.

1099
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,320
It's crazy.

1100
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,040
Is that real?

1101
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,840
Yeah.

1102
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,560
It's not a lot.

1103
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,360
But yeah, he did a Grover song and then they did like a Boardwalk Empire parody

1104
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,680
and a Downton Abbey parody.

1105
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,180
Wow.

1106
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:48,720
And those were in him?

1107
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,280
Yeah.

1108
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,960
Whoa, he was in just the regular sketches?

1109
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,200
Yeah.

1110
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,680
Oh, geez.

1111
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,640
I gotta look this up.

1112
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,200
Geez.

1113
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,360
I was there like right before a lot, like the guy who was playing Elmo, he left after,

1114
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,200
like right after I was there.

1115
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,760
The guy who played Big Bird like basically retired after I was there.

1116
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,240
The guy who played The Count like died the year after I was there.

1117
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,120
Like it was just like-

1118
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,840
Oh, geez.

1119
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,520
It was just like the end of an era.

1120
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,000
Wow.

1121
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,400
You know?

1122
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:08,800
Wow.

1123
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,840
That's pretty wild.

1124
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,320
Yeah.

1125
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,600
It was, I lucked out.

1126
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,960
Do they all have ponytails?

1127
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,080
Not anymore.

1128
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,560
I mean, they're all 80 now, so not anymore.

1129
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:17,840
May have.

1130
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,320
Yeah, yeah.

1131
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,120
At the point they did.

1132
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,680
George Carlin had a ponytail up until he was old, right?

1133
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,640
That's true.

1134
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,400
It's some old elderly ponytails.

1135
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:24,900
Yeah.

1136
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,240
Wow, that's wild.

1137
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,600
Okay, so we're in the swamp.

1138
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,960
We're hanging out with frogs.

1139
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,600
The gang's not really feeling it.

1140
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:38,640
And then a little bit of information quietly comes out, which is that just beyond a set

1141
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,200
of trees in the swamp is Disney World.

1142
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,040
And if they want to pop into Disney World quick, then they should probably get back

1143
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,240
for the bug fry.

1144
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,560
How great is this?

1145
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,920
What a great tie together.

1146
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,120
The Disney World is swamp and the Kermit is front.

1147
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,520
So now, important pieces of canon.

1148
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,960
Kermit the Frog grew up in Orlando, Florida.

1149
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,840
Yeah.

1150
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,600
When you're in the Muppet movie.

1151
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,160
I guess that's Orlando.

1152
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,600
The camera pulls out a little bit more in the Muppet movie when he's on the log.

1153
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,840
You see the ball in the background or whatever.

1154
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,160
You see the Florida Project.

1155
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,920
Yeah, he's on the outskirts.

1156
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,880
Well, and that's another thing that being next door.

1157
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,680
Okay, because we've recently come across another bit of mythology, which is the

1158
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:27,360
backstory of Mickey's Toon Town, which is that Toon Town was there first in the

1159
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,400
fictional mythology.

1160
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,040
In Anaheim.

1161
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,840
In Anaheim.

1162
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,080
And so then Walt is looking for a place to build his dream park and Mickey says,

1163
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,680
there's a big bunch of land right next to this little town that we made.

1164
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,520
Maybe you could build your theme park here.

1165
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,920
So Disneyland exists because we're going next to Mickey and friends.

1166
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:51,600
Maybe coincidentally, Disney World is built right next to where Kermit grew up.

1167
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:58,240
So fictionally, the Disney company's habit is to move in and do a lot of building,

1168
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:04,320
create a lot of hubbub around these gentle characters who are in their employ.

1169
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,280
Ultimately, it's kind of an odd.

1170
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:07,600
Yeah.

1171
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:15,360
I mean, they give them a leg up, but also it can't be good for the swamp, for the pollution

1172
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,440
levels, for the quality of life.

1173
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:17,920
Oh yeah.

1174
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,560
Oh my God.

1175
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,600
Drives the rates up.

1176
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,680
It's amazing they can afford it.

1177
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,640
They must be off the grid.

1178
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,880
They aren't plugged into the power lines or anything.

1179
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,920
No, it's not dissimilar to In It's a Wonderful Life when George Bailey tells his old friend,

1180
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,440
well, there's that empty factory on the outside of town.

1181
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,520
Whole town was started out of work when that closed.

1182
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,440
You're as a father-in-law, could get it for cheap.

1183
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,800
Hard luck tales.

1184
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,400
It just makes you wonder what the other...

1185
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:50,080
Does the Tokyo Disney site exist because Duffy and friends had a little village?

1186
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,680
I think that's absolutely right.

1187
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,320
Yeah.

1188
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:57,040
And if we like, all right, well, these bears, they're so nice, they'll shut up.

1189
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,760
Even though they were coming to town and they made the work for us.

1190
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,160
The Wuzzles were right outside of Disneyland Paris.

1191
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:02,720
Oh yeah.

1192
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,920
That's a game of the Wuzzles.

1193
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,320
They moved down river.

1194
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,200
They didn't want to be...

1195
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,640
We don't want to be anywhere near any of this.

1196
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,040
Yeah, very strange.

1197
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,400
But I love this.

1198
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,600
So Kermit's the Floridian, we know that now.

1199
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,400
And the gang leaves, they all go to Disney World.

1200
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,520
But nobody's got money.

1201
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,040
This wasn't the plan to get in.

1202
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,480
They have no way to get in.

1203
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,160
The solution becomes to just break in.

1204
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:30,720
Yeah.

1205
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,480
They do break the law.

1206
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,240
Animal buzz...

1207
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,480
Like the animal is in the wrong here.

1208
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:36,960
Yeah.

1209
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,440
Sure.

1210
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,080
I mean, you know, the stuffy security guard who we're about to get to, I'm not, you know,

1211
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,760
you're not rooting for him.

1212
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,720
Although maybe, I don't know.

1213
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,200
Well.

1214
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,120
But yeah, being who he is.

1215
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:47,680
Jason is.

1216
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,320
But animal, you know, yeah, there is a breaking and entering.

1217
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,440
Can I ask a question?

1218
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,440
And maybe I missed this now that I'm thinking about it.

1219
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,920
Does Kermit says that he left his wallet back in the swamp or something?

1220
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,800
Is Kermit lying to the security guard?

1221
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,840
Or did he have a wallet?

1222
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,280
He doesn't wear pants.

1223
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:05,760
Well, right.

1224
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,200
That's like an old get.

1225
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,600
It's like when you pull out the pockets and a fly falls.

1226
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,320
But I guess what I'm saying is...

1227
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,280
I left my wallet at home.

1228
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,720
I'm saying Kermit is usually such...

1229
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,880
I mean, I know he sometimes gets into little things, but is Kermit being genuine?

1230
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,720
Because it feels like Kermit would want to pay.

1231
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,120
I think he's gotten riled up, you know, and he's so excited about going to Disney that

1232
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,880
you're like, we're going in no matter what.

1233
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,040
Yeah.

1234
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,080
Maybe that's my guess.

1235
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:26,320
Okay.

1236
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,520
Because sometimes he gets a little like a raw, raw, raw, you know, sure.

1237
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,000
Doing this.

1238
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,760
Come on, guys, we're going to make it happen, you know.

1239
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,800
But you don't understand what I'm saying.

1240
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,520
I'm just wondering now that I'm thinking about the scene.

1241
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,000
Yeah.

1242
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,760
Well, I think he's a little dismayed because no one cared about the swamp.

1243
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,320
Right.

1244
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,560
But I was wondering, maybe Kermit does have 40 tickets or his money back in a wallet

1245
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,240
somewhere and he meant to pay.

1246
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:46,880
Yeah, I think so.

1247
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,840
I can't give him his word.

1248
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,960
I trust Kermit.

1249
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,520
Do you think he gets the Florida state discount?

1250
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,360
Even though he doesn't live there anymore?

1251
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,240
His whole family does?

1252
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,080
Yeah, I think he does.

1253
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:56,320
Yeah.

1254
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:56,560
Okay.

1255
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,200
I would hope.

1256
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,000
Yeah, yeah.

1257
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,520
He would probably get more perks being...

1258
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,000
Right.

1259
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,880
He might...

1260
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,960
They might technically be residents of the Reedy Creek improvement district.

1261
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,520
I was going to say, I was wondering how Kermit's family is affected by what Governor DeSantis

1262
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,440
is revoking the rights of the district.

1263
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,520
Our taxes are going up how much?

1264
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,240
Yeah.

1265
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:16,480
Yeah.

1266
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,120
There's a great joke, by the way, at the very, very top where they're walking through the

1267
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:27,200
swamp and Bunsen Honeydew says that Beaker is using the Muppet Labs anti-poison ivy cream.

1268
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,200
Makes you break out in spots and itch like the Dickens, but you don't get poison ivy.

1269
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,720
Like that is such a good joke right at the top of the show.

1270
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,680
That's sharp.

1271
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,160
Geez.

1272
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,840
I mean, it's all very funny.

1273
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,480
It's great.

1274
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:47,280
And then it's especially taken into next gear when you meet the security guard who is, of course,

1275
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:57,200
Officer Quentin Fitzwaller as portrayed by Uncle Martin himself from our favorite film,

1276
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:57,760
Clifford.

1277
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,880
Charles Grodin is in this special.

1278
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,920
Oh my God.

1279
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,280
And something I just put together, this is actually his first interaction with the Clifford

1280
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,720
because Clifford, the Muppet, shows up in the special.

1281
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,440
Clifford.

1282
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,080
So this is the first Charles Grodin Clifford collaboration.

1283
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,280
The eventual band leader.

1284
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,760
This is Clifford's first appearance.

1285
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,640
He was on this show called the Jim Henson Hour, which was a year or two before this.

1286
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,160
This is getting real in the weeds, guys, but I guess this is why we're here.

1287
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,000
This is the only time, his whole thing was they're like, he's in the new band.

1288
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,600
He's like the new band guy.

1289
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,760
He's the music guy, the cool guy.

1290
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,680
But this is the only time he plays with the Electric Mayhem is in the special.

1291
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,520
That's what confused me was that grouping.

1292
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:39,840
Yeah.

1293
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,600
So he's sitting in with them.

1294
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,080
I guess.

1295
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:42,560
For a tour, right?

1296
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,600
Yeah.

1297
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,160
Interesting.

1298
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:45,760
I mean, yeah, why not?

1299
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,720
It's Michael McDonald being in Steely Dan for a little bit.

1300
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:49,200
Yeah.

1301
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,440
Before he kind of takes a behind the scenes on Muppets tonight.

1302
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:53,840
Right.

1303
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,080
Yeah.

1304
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,280
Oh, he's the host.

1305
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:55,760
Oh, he is.

1306
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,240
No, no, no.

1307
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:56,640
He's very...

1308
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,600
Kermit goes behind the scenes.

1309
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,320
Kermit goes behind the scenes.

1310
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:58,880
Oh, that's right.

1311
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,760
Yeah, yeah, totally.

1312
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,680
But oh my God, you get Grodin.

1313
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,680
Grodin's in this with Muppets again.

1314
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,440
And after great Muppet caper.

1315
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,280
This is post-Muppet caper.

1316
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,720
Yeah, that was like 81.

1317
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,680
So his second...

1318
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,760
What a sport to come back.

1319
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,000
Liked the Muppet experience enough, I guess.

1320
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,240
It's hard to imagine him liking anything, but as close as...

1321
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,120
For sure.

1322
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,000
I imagine they just flew his family down to Disney.

1323
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,160
Sure.

1324
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:24,880
You know what I mean?

1325
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,160
It's probably one of those like, come on down, bring everybody, hang out for two weeks.

1326
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,000
Well, he's also in the family by this point because I was on the IMDB.

1327
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:39,360
And just looking at this, boy, any actor would be jealous of this stretch in an IMDB chronologically.

1328
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:44,640
Midnight run, cranium command, Muppets in Walt Disney World.

1329
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,840
Oh my God.

1330
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,600
One of the great stints.

1331
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,720
Legendary, yeah.

1332
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:53,680
Geez, with probably Clifford being filmed in there at some point.

1333
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,160
That's right.

1334
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,240
It sat on the shelf for a while.

1335
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,800
Yeah, might have been exactly in that zone.

1336
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,280
Boy, and it's wonderful.

1337
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,280
And there's fun.

1338
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,800
This is, I think, a lot of the is a Muppet project good or not is who are those guests

1339
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,160
who you know that they're going to have?

1340
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,720
Are they committed in full tilt and fun?

1341
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,160
Or are they phoning it in a little bit?

1342
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,720
Or are they convinced this person is hot, so we'll put them in?

1343
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,480
But Groden's exactly what you want, where he's a real actor.

1344
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,600
He's going for it too.

1345
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,000
He's very funny.

1346
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,720
He had some line that made me laugh out loud and I don't remember what it was and I should have wrote it down.

1347
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,320
He was like mugging to the camera and really going for it.

1348
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:38,880
He's got a funny joke about he lost the 700 keys to Epcot, but he found 100 of them.

1349
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,380
Oh yeah.

1350
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,480
That's great.

1351
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,840
So they break in, he's after them, and that's the dramatic thrust of this.

1352
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,240
But otherwise you get to just run around Disney World with the Muppets.

1353
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,760
Animal commits more crimes.

1354
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,240
He steals ice cream and breaks an ice cream.

1355
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,760
That's another thing where that would not fly now.

1356
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,320
We cannot have our character breaking the Disney rules.

1357
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,280
Oh yeah.

1358
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,120
They push over a giant turnstile.

1359
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,960
Even easier with those magic band things.

1360
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,560
They're so skinny you could kick them right in.

1361
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,520
A child could push those over.

1362
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,960
It's not even a turnstile anymore.

1363
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,440
It's not.

1364
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,240
It's just a pole.

1365
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:16,960
It's a stanchion.

1366
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,520
Oh yeah.

1367
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,160
It's a jump.

1368
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,600
Another thing they wouldn't do is say the stuff wrong.

1369
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,360
Much like what we talked about with TGIF where I'm looking at the quote,

1370
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,120
and there's that ocean thing over there.

1371
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,440
I think they mean the living seas, but I'm not super confident.

1372
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,360
And a lot of pointing to, somewhere in there, Star Tours is over this way,

1373
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,000
and they are not in the park that Star Tours is in.

1374
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,080
They're near Big Thunder Mountain or something like that.

1375
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,360
Like it's very far away.

1376
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:45,600
They're in Magic Kingdom, and in Magic Kingdom that ride is not in that park.

1377
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,200
However, love it.

1378
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:47,760
Love it.

1379
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,240
We're so slavish to mythologies at this point.

1380
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,760
I love the casual slapdash nature of it.

1381
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,880
Everybody relax.

1382
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:00,080
Like we said, this breaking news of we're disrupting the galaxy's edge continuity,

1383
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,680
and the new characters are going in.

1384
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,960
I don't care.

1385
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,520
I remotely break all of them.

1386
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,120
I want Jefferson Starship playing in there.

1387
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:09,760
Oh yeah.

1388
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,760
And we have, and I don't want to get a derail,

1389
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,360
but they mentioned Halyx in the Star Wars presentation.

1390
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,080
That was something.

1391
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:21,680
I mean, it occurred to me that that did come in a big chain of events from us.

1392
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,720
I learned about Halyx from this executive who, and I told it to you guys,

1393
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,640
and that documentary got made, and now Scott Trowbridge is talking about it

1394
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,840
with Tony Baxter at a big Star Wars event.

1395
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:37,440
I'm like, this is a butterfly effect.

1396
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:37,760
Yeah.

1397
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,640
And that's stemming from us, which is pretty fun to think about.

1398
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:45,040
That doesn't feel, that feels like that has to go past some approvals to get on stage.

1399
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,000
Made the slide.

1400
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,600
It's not a Comic Con presentation.

1401
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,560
It's an official Disney presentation.

1402
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,200
Yeah.

1403
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:56,400
So it is interesting that that's there with the head of Imagineering mentioning it.

1404
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,280
Before they can get to it, because they're like,

1405
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,120
we're going to step through it chronologically.

1406
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:04,960
And before Star Tours, let's give a little nod to Halyx.

1407
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,960
And it's, yeah, it's not Star Wars, so they didn't have to say it either.

1408
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,360
No.

1409
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,840
It's not like all this interesting part of Star Wars' history.

1410
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,400
It's not.

1411
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,520
I think it is now though.

1412
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,560
I think he made it official.

1413
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,000
But that's what I'm saying.

1414
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,880
It's by Scott Trowbridge deigning it so.

1415
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:19,360
I think it is.

1416
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,400
It's very interesting.

1417
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,920
So excited that this conversation is happening right now.

1418
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,200
They're all there.

1419
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,880
They're downloading their Patreon episodes.

1420
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,720
They're like, oh my gosh, the best.

1421
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,200
Yeah.

1422
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,160
You're saying Scott is?

1423
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,200
Yeah.

1424
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,240
Hey, Scott, how are you?

1425
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,440
They don't like to acknowledge us.

1426
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,920
We've been waiting for the phones, Disney.

1427
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,640
We've begged and pleaded for it to be involved.

1428
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:38,960
Yeah.

1429
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,320
No, it's radio silence.

1430
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,760
If they call, here's a question.

1431
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:42,000
Yeah.

1432
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,200
They call you guys, right?

1433
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,360
They say we're bringing back Halyx.

1434
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:45,840
Uh huh.

1435
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,280
Okay. Unfortunately, no one else wants to be in the band.

1436
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,320
Will you guys do it?

1437
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,360
What a question.

1438
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,960
I'm saying you got to learn the instruments.

1439
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:55,840
You got to learn this.

1440
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,720
Yeah, full on.

1441
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,200
No problem.

1442
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:57,680
Okay.

1443
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,560
I'll figure it out.

1444
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,320
I just wanted it on the record.

1445
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:00,640
Yeah.

1446
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,440
Just, okay.

1447
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:07,840
My keyboard skills are so rudimentary, but I will Tom Cruise style just like hyper dose

1448
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:08,720
in three months.

1449
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,600
I'll get there.

1450
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,960
Give me the Marvel.

1451
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,600
Me and Mike will do the Marvel HGH regimen.

1452
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,440
I don't know that we have to do that, but I guess we will.

1453
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,080
Yeah, we will.

1454
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,240
Halyx is jacked.

1455
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:20,740
Yeah.

1456
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,640
Jason's going to do that rope route.

1457
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,720
Jason's going to be the one swinging around on that rope.

1458
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,040
Yeah.

1459
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,400
Oh, because he likes heights.

1460
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,200
Oh, I love it.

1461
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:27,520
Yeah.

1462
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,600
Yeah. It's happening.

1463
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,960
We are Halyx 2.0.

1464
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,680
So crazy stuff.

1465
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:33,920
All right.

1466
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,360
So we're watching, I mean, love when narrative goes away and you're just watching characters

1467
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,160
go on rides.

1468
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,320
And that's what you get with things like watching just Miss Piggy's going to go on Big Thunder

1469
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,040
Mountain.

1470
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,960
That's breezy and fun, but unlike when the full house gang goes on Big Thunder Mountain,

1471
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,000
you're like, wait a minute.

1472
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,600
There are logistics here.

1473
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,160
How is this puppet going on this?

1474
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:54,960
What's going on?

1475
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,960
They are crouched down and this is not safe or they had to find a new way to make it safe.

1476
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,800
This is logistically complex.

1477
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,200
And do you know the behind the scenes thing about this?

1478
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:05,760
No.

1479
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,520
Frank Oz says not doing it.

1480
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,320
Whoa.

1481
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:08,960
Not doing it.

1482
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,080
Not going on.

1483
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:14,080
So Dave Goals, I guess, goes on and puppeteers Piggy for all those things.

1484
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:14,720
Yeah.

1485
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,760
I don't know how they do that.

1486
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,480
Frank Oz doesn't want to do it because he's scared of roller coasters.

1487
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,160
He says he gets motion sickness.

1488
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:20,640
OK.

1489
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:20,880
Yeah.

1490
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,680
So it's maybe not even.

1491
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,000
Which Ben being like, I mean, that's a horrible position.

1492
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,800
Oh, yeah.

1493
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,360
Super weird.

1494
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:29,200
But every time I was flipping through the Muppet Wiki page for this today,

1495
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,400
and every time they mention it, it's like in heavy quotes where they're like,

1496
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,040
we're not really sure if he really did it or if he just didn't want to do this.

1497
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:35,840
Oh, you're right.

1498
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,160
Sure.

1499
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:36,400
Yeah.

1500
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,480
That's wild, though.

1501
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:38,980
Yeah.

1502
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:44,480
And that's maybe the most complex staging in this.

1503
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:49,680
The other one probably that Gonzo and Camilla are on,

1504
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:55,040
but their story is that they kind of run off and they don't care about the rides and stuff.

1505
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,120
They're going to weird sewers.

1506
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:57,920
Mm hmm.

1507
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,200
Uh, where the laundry.

1508
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,000
Laundry.

1509
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,800
Yeah, the laundry.

1510
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,800
So they are going up a conveyor belt with a bunch of loose laundry.

1511
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,200
Great.

1512
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,120
So they get so they're really on that thing and hidden by laundry, which is pretty fun.

1513
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:09,840
Mm hmm.

1514
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,000
Yeah.

1515
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,720
But that's a set.

1516
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:11,840
Right?

1517
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,320
Oh, yeah.

1518
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,440
I think that's a set.

1519
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:13,920
It's got to be.

1520
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:14,720
Right.

1521
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,120
Yeah.

1522
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,400
I didn't even I hadn't even thought about it.

1523
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:16,640
Yeah.

1524
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,440
Yeah, totally.

1525
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,960
That is a great get.

1526
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,760
I mean, it starts with him sticking his head in a trash can and going like,

1527
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,560
oh, look, it's one of Epcot's empty cup exhibit.

1528
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:29,680
And yeah, they're just walking through dirty pipe rooms and the laundry.

1529
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:34,000
Again, stuff Disney would never admit that there's like, oh, yeah, there's really gross.

1530
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,560
Yeah.

1531
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,720
It's rooms underneath all this.

1532
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,840
It's so fun.

1533
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,960
And it's perfect Gonzo and Camilla business.

1534
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:41,520
Yeah.

1535
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:41,920
Yeah.

1536
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,160
Yeah.

1537
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,160
Um, I want to say I like piggies eyes when she's on the roller coaster,

1538
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,320
because they like change her eyes out, which is really funny to make them like

1539
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,160
surprised or excited or scared.

1540
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:56,560
Anything of that nature when she's full of rage running through Central Park and Muppets take me.

1541
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,040
Oh, yeah.

1542
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:57,520
Yeah.

1543
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,040
And that's like a grown pit.

1544
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,120
That's like a adult in a piggy.

1545
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:02,320
Yeah.

1546
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:02,720
Yeah.

1547
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,320
Launching and strange.

1548
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:04,640
Yeah.

1549
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:04,880
Yeah.

1550
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,760
So funny.

1551
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,720
Very relatable moment with Rolf where he's like

1552
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,760
crippled by the tyranny of too many choices.

1553
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,120
Or he's like, there's so much here.

1554
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,000
I don't know what to do.

1555
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,000
We've been there were Ralph.

1556
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,200
Another favorite moment.

1557
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,760
Beaker gets a lot of fun stuff.

1558
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,160
He gets a bucket stuck on his head for most of this.

1559
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,360
They then put a wig on.

1560
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,960
But the Swedish chef has a taco stand, which I was a big Swedish chef kid.

1561
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,840
So then on top of that, on top of the funny, just him selling tacos,

1562
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,440
Lutefisk tacos.

1563
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:38,880
Lutefisk tacos.

1564
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:44,000
And then Buns and Honeydew walks up and says tacos in the strangest way.

1565
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,040
He says, oh, one of your tacos, please.

1566
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,200
Like, it's so odd.

1567
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,760
I didn't I don't have this clip prepared, but just rather than just mentioning it,

1568
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,920
I don't know where it's going to land exactly, but I just wanted to get a little blast of the song

1569
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,920
that the electric mayhem does, which is rocking all over the world.

1570
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:13,600
If you don't speak the same language as me, but when we rock together we will really be.

1571
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,160
One, two, three, four.

1572
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,840
One big family.

1573
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,640
Rock and rollin' around the world.

1574
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,720
Rock and rollin' around the world.

1575
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,520
Rock and rollin' around the world.

1576
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,440
So fun.

1577
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,320
Love their logo.

1578
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,120
I mean, it already I was almost wondering if this was a cover.

1579
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,320
This is a similar song.

1580
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,080
It's very ELO.

1581
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:38,320
It's like a sound like of an ELO song.

1582
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,160
Is that called rockin' all over the world?

1583
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:47,200
But this song's technically no, wait, it's also sort of like ROCK in the USA a little bit.

1584
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:54,880
I think the way the ELO is rocking all over this world, this is rock and rolling around the world.

1585
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,600
There's a Springsteen song called Rockin' All Over the World.

1586
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,760
But it's not that.

1587
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,400
I think this is an original notion.

1588
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,680
A lot of people want to.

1589
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,960
Oh, and it's not.

1590
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:05,360
Wait.

1591
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,040
Then there's all over.

1592
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,920
I think maybe think of John Fogerty rocking all over the world.

1593
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,480
Oh, it's a Springsteen as a cover of Fogerty.

1594
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,600
Fogerty, an ELO in Xanadu, one of my favorite films, does all over the world.

1595
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:23,280
It would be so funny if they did a cover of a song from Xanadu in the special.

1596
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,080
Oh, boy.

1597
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,120
That's my vote.

1598
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:30,400
That thing that goes around of replacing, like, give me a Xanadu, Muppet Xanadu.

1599
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,680
I don't know the market for it.

1600
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,160
No, it's this garage right here.

1601
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:41,920
It does feel like a time where we would get like a direct to streaming series of like Xanadu.

1602
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,200
Xanadu.

1603
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,240
Yeah, oh, sure.

1604
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:44,720
Why not?

1605
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,200
Yes.

1606
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,000
They made a TV show out of the man who fell.

1607
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,320
Here's the Xanadu is back and here's the twist.

1608
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,680
It's boring and too long.

1609
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,200
Do you want eight hours of Xanadu?

1610
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,600
And it looks much worse.

1611
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,920
But then there's like one performance.

1612
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,560
It's like, did you see Matthew Good in Xanadu?

1613
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,000
Really great.

1614
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,320
Xanadu Requiem.

1615
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:10,640
Yeah, yeah.

1616
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:12,640
Fine.

1617
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,120
I want it.

1618
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:19,680
I also really like when the weirds when almost subliminally the small world dolls

1619
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:23,600
Muppetized small world dolls show up and briefly sing.

1620
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,880
It's a small world.

1621
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,960
Yeah, kind of demented manner.

1622
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,440
It's like something bad happened to them.

1623
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:34,000
I should say some of those shots in that song maybe don't stand the test of time.

1624
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,360
There's Janice dressed up as a geisha.

1625
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:37,840
Oh, yeah.

1626
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,080
I just played that.

1627
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1628
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:48,720
I think Zoot's got a full sombrero and like some odd juxtaposition of characters and yeah.

1629
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,120
Drogues.

1630
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1631
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,200
Yeah, yeah.

1632
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,520
But yeah, World Showcase was a disaster waiting to happen for anything that filmed there.

1633
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:00,560
Yeah, Disney coasted on the existence of World Showcase for 20 years.

1634
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:00,800
Yeah.

1635
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,320
Like, and everyone's welcome.

1636
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:02,480
Sure.

1637
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,520
World Showcase.

1638
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,320
Sure.

1639
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,520
Well, our job is done.

1640
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:06,560
Great.

1641
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,360
Yes.

1642
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,360
Set up diverse.

1643
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:13,280
It is kind of crazy how everyone has like a pretty solid story in it, though.

1644
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:13,760
You know what I mean?

1645
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,360
Like everyone gets a lot to do.

1646
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:15,920
For sure.

1647
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:16,400
Yeah.

1648
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:16,640
Yeah.

1649
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,840
And doing a movie.

1650
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,920
We haven't even talked about like Statler and Waldorf yet.

1651
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,320
Oh boy.

1652
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,760
They sing an old timey song to an old lady.

1653
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:24,160
It's great.

1654
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,040
To an old lady.

1655
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,240
Human old lady.

1656
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:26,880
It's yeah.

1657
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:27,280
Delight.

1658
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,240
It's really cute.

1659
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,600
Rolf too has a really funny story.

1660
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:35,200
Like he they get him into the dog.

1661
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,720
They're like, hey, you're not supposed to be.

1662
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,600
They like take him into the dog like hotel.

1663
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:46,000
And then he does a number with a bunch of dog puppets, which I always like dog.

1664
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:46,560
I don't know.

1665
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,080
A lot of those dog puppets were cute.

1666
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:51,280
The one was like snuggling Rolf during the song.

1667
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,400
That was a cute number.

1668
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,920
What does he say when they like catch me?

1669
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,200
He's like, I have no owner.

1670
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,120
I'm my own free dog or whatever.

1671
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:57,680
Like that.

1672
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,480
Yeah.

1673
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:04,560
There's funny because that part is the start of Rolf's storyline is like subtle advertising

1674
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:08,000
for the ability to put your dog in a place at Disney World.

1675
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:08,480
Yeah.

1676
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,840
Which I'm sure it was, but it is pretty it's pretty low key.

1677
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:12,160
Yeah.

1678
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,680
Like, does that still exist?

1679
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,120
Well, you have no idea.

1680
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,200
They have built a massive facility.

1681
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,880
I only know about this because Beijing Mr. Morrow did a video about it,

1682
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,120
but you can set your price point of how much comfort you want your dog.

1683
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,480
Like $150 a night.

1684
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,520
Your dog gets our own room with a flat screen TV.

1685
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,800
He's walking around the park with a pocket bee and he wants to set him up somewhere safe.

1686
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:35,760
It just drops him off.

1687
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:36,240
Yeah.

1688
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:36,720
Yeah.

1689
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:37,200
Wow.

1690
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,200
My jaw dropped when you said that.

1691
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,360
That's crazy.

1692
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:41,600
Yeah.

1693
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:42,800
Wow.

1694
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:48,160
I saw, I think there was a man, I think it was in Japan who got, who bought a life,

1695
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,320
like a realistic Kali costume and he wants to live like a dog.

1696
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:52,800
Okay.

1697
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,240
So I wonder like if you could do that and then get for 150 bucks, that's not bad for

1698
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,280
a hotel room at Disney.

1699
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,520
Get a flat screen TV.

1700
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:03,200
The hoaxes that go around the more insane parts of the inner.

1701
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:03,520
Sure.

1702
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,000
Sure.

1703
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,120
Is that like every elementary school is like this now?

1704
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:07,680
Right. Sure.

1705
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,800
Is that a price point to get your dog caught with a butterfly net?

1706
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,400
There's gotta be, right?

1707
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:12,960
Oh, good question.

1708
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:13,200
Yeah.

1709
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,000
It's gotta be.

1710
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,400
The Disney dog catcher, which I assume is there too, because that's basically what.

1711
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,520
Just look, I love my dog.

1712
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,960
I just want to see what it would look like with a comical.

1713
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,480
If he was on an episode of Top Cat.

1714
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:31,680
I think a big change in how people like in 30 years, I think the way the comfort

1715
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:38,000
that dogs can get on vacation, like, cause you can also just be staying at a Disney hotel and then

1716
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:38,800
what's her twice a day.

1717
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:43,760
You can go and say hi and hang out with your dog and take them on a walk on the little dog park.

1718
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,160
And then they go back to their room and you go back to your room.

1719
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:46,640
Wild.

1720
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,200
So, yeah.

1721
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:51,440
So Rolf is advertising this service, which I don't know.

1722
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,280
They don't publicize as much anymore.

1723
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:54,080
No.

1724
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,640
So you have to like, know about it.

1725
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:56,960
Yeah.

1726
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,360
Well, some of the hotels are dog friendly.

1727
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,760
You, I mean, a dog can stay in a room with you.

1728
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:02,320
Sure.

1729
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:02,480
Yeah.

1730
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,320
A dog can rent a room by himself.

1731
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:04,800
That's true.

1732
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,920
As long as he has a credit card.

1733
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:07,120
Yeah.

1734
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,800
What else you got here?

1735
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:11,680
Laundromat stuff.

1736
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:17,520
We end up in, as you had to do, as all the TGIF shows did, we end up in the Indiana Jones.

1737
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,000
Mm hmm.

1738
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,440
It's done spectacular.

1739
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,560
So it's exciting to see.

1740
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,160
Muppets with guns next to swastikas.

1741
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,000
It's very, very jarring only then.

1742
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:28,240
Yeah.

1743
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,240
Kermit is very sweet though.

1744
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,760
Like he keeps shooting guys and they go like, are you okay?

1745
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,480
I'm sorry.

1746
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:34,960
Oh, yeah.

1747
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:35,600
I don't.

1748
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:39,440
And very clear his discomfort with violence and confrontation.

1749
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,480
But then Piggy comes up with, doesn't she have like the machine gun?

1750
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:42,640
Yeah.

1751
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,680
She's in the plane.

1752
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:44,320
Yeah.

1753
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,680
Piggy is out of her mind.

1754
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,160
She's ready.

1755
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,280
She's so much angrier.

1756
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:47,840
Yeah.

1757
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,360
She's the angriest of all the muppets.

1758
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:50,560
Yeah.

1759
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:50,800
Yeah.

1760
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:52,240
There's, okay.

1761
01:03:52,240 --> 01:04:00,000
So there's also the Rainbow Connection performance with Raven Simone, with the young Raven Simone,

1762
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:00,960
which is very sweet.

1763
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,920
There's not much to say about it really, but it's sweet and cute.

1764
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,120
Credited as little girl.

1765
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,400
What was it?

1766
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,760
She's credited as little girl.

1767
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:08,480
Just little girl.

1768
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,120
Little girl.

1769
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:09,200
Wow.

1770
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:09,600
That's it.

1771
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,480
Mm hmm.

1772
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,440
After a name like Quentin Fitzwaller, like you want a good name.

1773
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,240
Give her a name.

1774
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:14,880
Little girl.

1775
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:15,600
Give the character a name.

1776
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,040
Well, that's one of these Helen tests.

1777
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:17,680
Yeah.

1778
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,640
Disney go back and give Raven Simone a name in this.

1779
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:26,720
A great performance moment where she starts singing the song and then Kermit goes,

1780
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,520
I don't believe this.

1781
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,200
That's so funny.

1782
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,560
That's such a great gag.

1783
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:39,440
I think the thing that people really, one of the things people really like about classic

1784
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:45,680
muppet stuff is that it's self-aware, but in like a charming way or like a cute way.

1785
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,280
And it's so low key.

1786
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,160
It's so low key.

1787
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,520
It's so subtle.

1788
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:53,120
All the old muppet stuff, not that they're like completely playing everything over the

1789
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:59,840
top now, but just there's such like letting things like really just throw it away.

1790
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:03,760
And it's that it's muppets that you're saying like, yeah, that muppet really undersold that

1791
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:04,880
line and it really worked.

1792
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:05,440
Yeah.

1793
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,160
It's insane.

1794
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:10,000
It's nodding the camera before Deadpool did it.

1795
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:10,500
Sure.

1796
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,560
If you don't know the muppets, it was kind of Deadpool before Deadpool.

1797
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,600
Yeah, pretty Deadpool.

1798
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:16,800
Deadpool is our muppets.

1799
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:21,200
Deadpool would host if they ever reboot the muppet show, right?

1800
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:21,760
Yes.

1801
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,200
You know, it feels like I'm not, and I'm not advocating for that.

1802
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,080
Sounds like you are.

1803
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,200
I want to be very clear.

1804
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,560
I do not want that.

1805
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,000
That's a bad idea.

1806
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:30,560
Yeah, I know.

1807
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,920
I would like that actually.

1808
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:32,480
Yeah.

1809
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:36,480
Um, you know, Hey, the kids in the hall have proven to me that you can just bring something

1810
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,040
back without sort of like new idea.

1811
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:39,520
Yeah.

1812
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,480
Just do it again.

1813
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,840
Maybe that's the best idea.

1814
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:44,400
Just do it again and maybe have the kids do it again.

1815
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,360
And maybe have the kids and bring back the muppet show and have the kids in the hall.

1816
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:49,200
Yeah.

1817
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:49,760
Yeah.

1818
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,280
Uh-huh.

1819
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,520
But you know, you got Charles Gruden in this.

1820
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,480
He's he's running around.

1821
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:55,120
He's hamming it up.

1822
01:05:55,120 --> 01:06:00,160
He's in front of I think the best thing that he that he had to do things in front of theme park

1823
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:05,200
audiences does not square with my idea of what Charles Gruden would want to do.

1824
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:05,440
Yeah.

1825
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,440
But he does it and does it great.

1826
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,320
Just big broad, like reaching out and grabbing them.

1827
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:14,160
And does he I believe he yells victory is mine.

1828
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,440
In front of a crowd at the Indiana Jones show.

1829
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:23,040
And you don't really get a lot of shots of like crowds in the background watching what's

1830
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:26,960
happening, which makes me wonder how much they like blocked off, you know,

1831
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,280
I wonder that in all these cases, what is the crowd?

1832
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,000
Hard to know.

1833
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,520
Because wouldn't you stop?

1834
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:36,400
Like if you just saw a bunch of muppets filming something like in 1990, I feel like.

1835
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,680
But then also there's probably plenty of people that were just like,

1836
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,120
I must be doing that every day here.

1837
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:41,360
Yeah.

1838
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,960
It's Hollywood studios or where like.

1839
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:43,440
Sure.

1840
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:43,840
Maybe.

1841
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,120
Like it's because sometimes you'll just go into Disney and it'll be like,

1842
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,560
uh, warning, we're filming today.

1843
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:48,960
Sure.

1844
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,000
And you won't know what it is.

1845
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,920
And then later you'll be like, oh, like Stevie Wonder played a medley in front of the castle.

1846
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:54,400
Yeah.

1847
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,520
And you'd be like, I missed it.

1848
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,720
I was in the park though.

1849
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,120
I was there when Gavin Newsom did the universal.

1850
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,400
We're back with the minions.

1851
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,880
COVID is over two years ago.

1852
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:03,680
Whatever that was.

1853
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,200
I was in the park.

1854
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,280
That's our generation's mission accomplished.

1855
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:07,920
Yes.

1856
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:08,960
Yeah.

1857
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:13,680
Kevin, our governor with the next to a minion and grew.

1858
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:17,040
And I assume Lucille ball saying COVID is done.

1859
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,560
Optimus prime.

1860
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:19,680
Optimus prime was there.

1861
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:19,840
Yeah.

1862
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:20,480
Optimus prime.

1863
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,360
So, uh.

1864
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:27,600
When I was there in, uh, November, uh, we walked by the day we checked out.

1865
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:31,360
Like there was someone, uh, there was a, they were filming stuff for the Christmas

1866
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:35,120
specials and like from a distance we could see like, oh, wow, they're really,

1867
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:38,720
I didn't know you could go that far down on like the grass next to the castle.

1868
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,520
I hope they don't like tripping that little stream or whatever.

1869
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,000
I think Jane was like, that's Darren Chris.

1870
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,160
Well, whoever it is, I hope they're watching their feet.

1871
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,040
Yeah, I hope so.

1872
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:55,440
So I mean, if we missed anything along the way to the, to rounding up the Muppets

1873
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,400
and taking them to, to Mickey's office.

1874
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,040
Yeah.

1875
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:03,520
Rizzo, Rizzo kind of manipulating Charles Groten to buy him treats.

1876
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,000
Yes.

1877
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,040
Is really fun.

1878
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:08,720
Uh, the one handsome pig actor, Patrick, what's his name?

1879
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:09,760
Link Hogthrob.

1880
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:10,240
Thank you.

1881
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:10,720
Wow.

1882
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,640
What an, I didn't know the name that rules.

1883
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:18,320
He has a very funny line to Groten that's like, do you know where I can buy some

1884
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,960
masculine t-shirts featuring cute little mice?

1885
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:23,120
Wow.

1886
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,160
That's so funny.

1887
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:24,720
Yeah.

1888
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:25,040
Oh yeah.

1889
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:28,960
Cause Rizzo's like, the thing about the Muppets is you got to look out for weird,

1890
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,400
insane things.

1891
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,960
And then he comes over and says that and he's like, just like that.

1892
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:33,040
Yeah.

1893
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:33,440
Like, yeah.

1894
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:35,440
Wait a minute.

1895
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,440
That was a Muppet.

1896
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:39,600
A delight.

1897
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,840
I think he then, so he rounds them up and he's on the phone with Mickey.

1898
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,080
He refers to them as the Kismet game.

1899
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:54,480
And, and then Mickey runs, I'm sorry, Kermit runs interference because he's,

1900
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,480
he's met Mickey somewhere.

1901
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:56,960
Sure.

1902
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,720
Did he say where he's met Mickey?

1903
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,160
Well, he had to sign a lot of contracts.

1904
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,400
Yeah.

1905
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,000
They've been, they've been putting like work.

1906
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,040
It's a lot of stress.

1907
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:05,760
Oh, he does.

1908
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,440
He says they're both in FASA.

1909
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,160
Oh, what did that stand for?

1910
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:10,480
Yeah.

1911
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:15,920
Fictional, fictional or furry animal, furry animal society of America.

1912
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,040
The screen actors.

1913
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:17,760
Something.

1914
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:18,000
Yeah.

1915
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:19,280
Something like that.

1916
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:23,360
I mean, all look, all the Muppets should be in FASA, you know, they got to work on.

1917
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:23,520
Yeah.

1918
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,560
It's not the first time I've heard of the Henson company having union issues.

1919
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:26,800
So.

1920
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:31,760
So we round, we round everybody up.

1921
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:32,960
We go to Kermit's office.

1922
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:38,640
It's a, a one of the finest cinematic moments ever.

1923
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:42,880
I mean, it is just great seeing an animate, like animated characters with,

1924
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:50,240
I think so many of my favorite Muppet scenes involve like them all meeting somebody at a desk.

1925
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:51,280
Like Orson Welles.

1926
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:53,360
It really is very similar to the Orson Welles scene.

1927
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:53,840
Yeah.

1928
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:54,400
Yeah.

1929
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,520
A lot of buildup.

1930
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:55,760
Yeah.

1931
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:56,800
Sky.

1932
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,320
And then, I mean, similar because I like the one I like in the new movie.

1933
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:04,400
One of the best things in the new movie is when they all like pretend to be one guy and a big.

1934
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:04,880
Oh yeah.

1935
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:06,240
Yeah.

1936
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:09,600
So imagine if they switched the Orson and the Mickey scenes though.

1937
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,800
So it's Mickey at the end of the Muppet movie and Orson at the end of, I don't know.

1938
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,000
It does not make sense.

1939
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:14,480
Yeah.

1940
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,120
But.

1941
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,640
Doesn't quite work time.

1942
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,760
If you're no, no, no.

1943
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,320
No.

1944
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:22,560
Now imagine you switch Mickey out at the end of hyperspace hoopla for Orson Welles.

1945
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,280
Oh, man.

1946
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,000
Now I'm.

1947
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:24,320
Now.

1948
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,880
Now it's a surprise.

1949
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:27,440
Oh, man.

1950
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,000
Orson whipping and nae nae.

1951
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,040
I just want to feel this moment.

1952
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:38,640
Orson style.

1953
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:39,680
Yes.

1954
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:44,880
We know remote.

1955
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,000
We know remote farm.

1956
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,840
So yeah, they meet.

1957
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,440
Mickey says, welcome to the family.

1958
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:56,080
It's kind of a, it's a weird.

1959
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:59,200
It's the Muppets are dancing with the devil.

1960
01:10:59,200 --> 01:10:59,680
Yeah.

1961
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,800
A little bit back.

1962
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,800
It's maybe this was a moment that shouldn't have happened.

1963
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,280
Yeah.

1964
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:07,520
Did and they all it's it really feels like, and now here we go.

1965
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:08,800
We are all friends.

1966
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,440
And instead it became very strange and spotty.

1967
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:15,680
I think there's also a little bit of like Mickey Miss Piggy connection.

1968
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:17,600
He kind of like gives her a look a little bit.

1969
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:18,800
Hey.

1970
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,200
Mm hmm.

1971
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,280
It's straying on his.

1972
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:26,080
Hey, he's a big star, you know, I would, I would be a little attracted to him.

1973
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,320
You met Mickey.

1974
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,440
Oh, if you're Piggy.

1975
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:29,840
Yeah.

1976
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:30,320
Oh, okay.

1977
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,160
Oh, wait, you're saying it's the other way.

1978
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:35,040
I don't remember who was into I have it as that Mickey was into.

1979
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:35,760
I mean, maybe I just got.

1980
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,320
That's what I mean.

1981
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,440
Oh, I see what you're saying.

1982
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,000
It's a reverse.

1983
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:38,640
Was into.

1984
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,440
Yeah.

1985
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,200
I feel like Piggy's into Mickey.

1986
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,720
I think I think it's a little about.

1987
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,240
Mickey's happy with me.

1988
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:45,200
I imagine.

1989
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:45,840
Yeah.

1990
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:46,480
Yeah, sure.

1991
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,960
You never know who's hall passes.

1992
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:52,000
Piggy and Kermit are on the outs and they've even made.

1993
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,840
Well, I know that Mike's is Minnie.

1994
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:54,480
It is.

1995
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:55,280
Yeah, that's true.

1996
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:01,360
So, you know, but but I'm saying Kermit and Piggy have had on and again off again.

1997
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:01,920
Sure, sure, sure.

1998
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,360
Versus Mickey and Minnie, who it always seems to be constant.

1999
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:05,760
Pretty sad.

2000
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,760
Yeah, there's never really been other than that.

2001
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,440
Stick it up your stick it up your ass.

2002
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,640
Fresh man.

2003
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,280
What's that?

2004
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,080
Wash your head.

2005
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,680
Oh, go wash your.

2006
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:18,880
Soak your head.

2007
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:19,440
Fresh boy.

2008
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,560
Soak your head.

2009
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,280
Fresh boy.

2010
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:24,880
But what's the context of is that is that Mickey disguised as.

2011
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:25,680
Fresh man.

2012
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:26,160
Is not.

2013
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,040
It is not.

2014
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:27,920
Fresh man.

2015
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:28,400
Freshman.

2016
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,800
It's a fast times line.

2017
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:31,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2018
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,240
I'm confusing.

2019
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,120
Yeah, very similar.

2020
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:38,640
What is the is the context of that that Mickey is disguised as Minnie and being hit on.

2021
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,000
By Mortimer or.

2022
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,200
Mortimer Mouse.

2023
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:42,480
Yeah, I forget exactly.

2024
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,160
It's in one of the old comics.

2025
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:44,660
Wow.

2026
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:46,480
I'm trying to remember.

2027
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:51,520
But but that either way somebody says the phrase soak your head.

2028
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,560
Fresh boy.

2029
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,060
Yeah.

2030
01:12:54,160 --> 01:13:00,080
That was a whole confusing thing too because that was in a short that had the same name as a short

2031
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,920
that played at the Main Street.

2032
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:07,760
Where like in MJ like an exclusive thing but then there's this other thing from the 90s

2033
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,800
that both had the same generic kind of name.

2034
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,360
What's that name?

2035
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:12,000
What's it called?

2036
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,200
I forget what it's called.

2037
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,600
Here's the here's the look by the way.

2038
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,800
This kind of like closed eyebrow eyebrow.

2039
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,920
So I think I'm I'm I'm calling this Mickey.

2040
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,200
Is that a windbreaker?

2041
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,320
I think it's a cardigan.

2042
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:24,960
Oh, is it?

2043
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:25,600
Okay.

2044
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,200
Or maybe it's a members only.

2045
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,600
He's he sports a members only a few times.

2046
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:30,320
Patrick, yeah.

2047
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:31,200
Thoughts on Denise.

2048
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,880
Oh, oh, I mean this is now we're getting into conflict.

2049
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,960
Oh, no, no, no, no, Denise.

2050
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:43,520
I mean, for people who don't know, Denise is Kermit's new girlfriend.

2051
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:49,520
When him and Piggy break up on the ABC show, I mean, they don't do anything with her.

2052
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:50,240
You know what I mean?

2053
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:53,360
Like she's not meant to be a full character.

2054
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,160
A full character.

2055
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:55,680
It's just like it's a joke.

2056
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:56,640
It's a joke character.

2057
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2058
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,560
I haven't thought about Denise very much.

2059
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:04,560
I'm I'm seeing the headline from MTV in defense of Denise, the world's most hated puppet.

2060
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:06,080
I didn't know that.

2061
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:07,280
I don't think that's true.

2062
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,040
I don't know if I agree with that headline.

2063
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,760
She can't be the most hated when Waldo exists, you know.

2064
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,720
Oh, do people not like Waldo?

2065
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,080
I don't think people like Waldo.

2066
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:16,800
Oh, really?

2067
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:17,680
I love Waldo.

2068
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,680
I think Waldo is funny, but I don't think people like Waldo.

2069
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:23,280
There wasn't a lot of Waldo.

2070
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:29,600
So I guess if Waldo wasn't in Muppets 3D, I guess I could see why you would not like him.

2071
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,560
But he's in he's in Jim Henson hour a little bit.

2072
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,360
OK, right.

2073
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,320
But that's it.

2074
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,000
But I could see where you would.

2075
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,920
But because he's so tied to my childhood.

2076
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:38,560
Sure.

2077
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,680
I do like him.

2078
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:40,080
Yeah.

2079
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,440
And I have a toy of him.

2080
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:41,920
Do you?

2081
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,080
No toys existed of him.

2082
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:45,600
There's a Parkstar.

2083
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:46,240
It's a Parkstar.

2084
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:46,400
Yeah.

2085
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,920
You're ruining my bank account.

2086
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:48,320
Thank you.

2087
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,720
Well, it's going to be expensive, I think, because a couple of years.

2088
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,000
That one might not be so bad.

2089
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,520
A few of the Parkstars are very expensive.

2090
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,320
Wow.

2091
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,120
There is a Waldo.

2092
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:57,520
Yeah.

2093
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,200
Waldo turns into Mickey.

2094
01:14:59,200 --> 01:14:59,680
That's true.

2095
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:00,640
It's a trick.

2096
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:01,120
That's right.

2097
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,800
Palisades never made a Waldo.

2098
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,320
And that's one of the greatest regrets of my life.

2099
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:06,820
Yeah.

2100
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,200
You can't blame it on yourself.

2101
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:09,840
You really can't.

2102
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:10,340
You can't.

2103
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,760
So then, I don't know, welcome to the family.

2104
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,080
And then we get one big last musical number.

2105
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:22,640
And they, as you were saying, they put their hands in the handprint, in the cement.

2106
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:23,360
Yes.

2107
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:26,160
And there's a very funny gag where they go back to the swamp.

2108
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:30,320
And then they go, oh, no, we left Miss Biggie in the cement.

2109
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,280
And I don't know.

2110
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:34,960
I still don't quite know how they do the Muppets standing.

2111
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:39,040
When the Muppets are free standing, always like, that's a magic trick.

2112
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,160
I don't understand.

2113
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:46,880
It's similar to, because one of those Jim Henson hours shows you how Waldo works,

2114
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,960
which is early motion control.

2115
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,760
So you're looking at an unadorned Muppet.

2116
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:56,400
It just looks like you put your hand into two shoes and it's picking up all of the,

2117
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:02,240
I mean, it's how they operate the mouths on the Ninja Turtles or on dinosaurs.

2118
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:04,880
So it's like, it's really early motion capture.

2119
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,640
It's also same thing at the end of Muppet 3D when he's on the fire truck going through.

2120
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:10,880
That's motion capture.

2121
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:16,400
I guess Rizzo is on, like Charles Groten holds Rizzo in his hand at one point

2122
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,120
and then puts him on his shoulder and he's kind of moving around.

2123
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:19,360
Yeah.

2124
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:23,120
I mean, it could be, like, usually now they will just, you know,

2125
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,760
green screen the guy out from behind him.

2126
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,760
Sometimes they do like mirrors where they'll have like forward facing mirrors.

2127
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:33,840
So you just see the ground in front of you, like reflected back.

2128
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:34,320
Okay.

2129
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:37,440
That's kind of a shot that's far enough away where maybe that was the case.

2130
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,080
But I don't know because she's moving a lot.

2131
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:40,480
Yeah.

2132
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:43,520
You know, this is probably a glorified, like RC car.

2133
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:44,560
I'm sure that's what it is.

2134
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:44,880
Yeah.

2135
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:45,280
Yeah.

2136
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:45,760
A remote.

2137
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:46,240
Yeah.

2138
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:50,000
Your phone has 400 more times the power than it ever had.

2139
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:50,480
Yeah.

2140
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:50,880
Yeah.

2141
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:51,280
Yeah.

2142
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,600
But they, I mean, they back way up.

2143
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,320
They like truck all the way down Hollywood.

2144
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,280
It's really funny.

2145
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:03,040
And yeah, you get by the end just so small and sad down there.

2146
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:03,920
It's really wonderful.

2147
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,680
While they're saying there's a new family ties on tonight.

2148
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:08,400
I think that's what

2149
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,520
Well, Scott, you can say that.

2150
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,040
Well, you go ahead if you have it.

2151
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:17,440
I don't know.

2152
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:20,080
Well, here maybe let me see if I just have the actual clip.

2153
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:20,560
Yeah.

2154
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:21,840
It's well, let's see.

2155
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:22,640
There's different versions.

2156
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,200
So who knows?

2157
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,000
Might take a sec.

2158
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:36,960
Look, I wish I had it.

2159
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:37,200
I

2160
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:41,440
Next that very aliens got a craving for a furry be like,

2161
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,680
how is it with a kitten?

2162
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:48,800
Then there's no place like home on the special season finale of two to seven tonight.

2163
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,560
Only on NBC.

2164
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,440
Two to seven.

2165
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:52,800
Those were the two that I heard.

2166
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:53,520
Oh, yeah.

2167
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,280
So yeah, I mean, I like that.

2168
01:17:55,280 --> 01:18:00,960
So the story on Alf tonight is that Alf is chasing after a kitten.

2169
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,720
Isn't that like one of the primary?

2170
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,320
Every episode.

2171
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:04,820
Yeah.

2172
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,160
How do we hook them?

2173
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:11,360
How do we make sure we watch this sweeps episode of Alf?

2174
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:15,360
But it really sounds like that episode is Alf has a crush on a cat and maybe he doesn't

2175
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:15,920
want to eat it.

2176
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:16,560
Mm.

2177
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,400
It says he's smitten with a cat.

2178
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,120
Right.

2179
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:25,600
We got to like, also guys that ended up being the series finale of two to seven of Marla

2180
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,920
Gibson Jackie Harry's two to seven.

2181
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:29,120
Wow.

2182
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,600
I also own an elf puppet now.

2183
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:32,480
Whoa.

2184
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:33,280
Puppet?

2185
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:33,760
Yeah.

2186
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,120
A new elf puppet.

2187
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:35,680
Wow.

2188
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,440
I pre-ordered the action figure.

2189
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:37,760
Oh, yeah.

2190
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:38,160
Me too.

2191
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:38,720
Okay, great.

2192
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:39,520
Just make it sure.

2193
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:39,920
Yeah.

2194
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:43,840
It was almost the series finale of Alf.

2195
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:44,960
If not, wait a minute.

2196
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:47,680
I'm not seeing it though.

2197
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:49,120
Just command F smitten.

2198
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,200
Well, I'm just seeing it in my...

2199
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,760
I'm seeing it as the...

2200
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,480
Maybe it might've been a rerun actually.

2201
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:58,000
I don't know.

2202
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,800
I'll sort out this Alf specifics.

2203
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:02,960
I'll just share.

2204
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,200
Wait, it was a rerun because Alf finished on March 24th.

2205
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:09,760
Oh.

2206
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:10,560
1990.

2207
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,640
Another tragedy in early 1990.

2208
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,000
How did anyone go on?

2209
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,680
That is also a different world.

2210
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:20,080
Could you imagine a network nowadays like this show is ended.

2211
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,880
So we're going to show a few months of reruns.

2212
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,080
Mm.

2213
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:24,720
Oh, yeah.

2214
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:24,960
Yeah.

2215
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:25,520
That is weird.

2216
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,080
Yeah.

2217
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:26,720
Oh wait, I found it.

2218
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,320
The episode is called Live and Let Die.

2219
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:28,880
Wow.

2220
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,040
bride stops a group of kittens for a meal.

2221
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,480
This is funny.

2222
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:35,040
That's good.

2223
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:40,880
However, after one kitten grows fond of Alf, he begins to question his personal view.

2224
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:41,760
Whoa.

2225
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:42,560
Wow.

2226
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:43,920
Next is actually...

2227
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,080
We're writing it off as like, yeah, calm.

2228
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:46,480
All right.

2229
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,560
Big breaking news.

2230
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,680
Alf wants to eat a cat.

2231
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:50,160
No, no, no.

2232
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,080
We wanted to eat a bunch of kittens.

2233
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,080
And perdrevamping the entire...

2234
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,120
Are you a vegetarian?

2235
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,240
Question everything.

2236
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,560
Very special Alf is what it sounds like.

2237
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,600
Does he still like to put on sunglasses and play guitar?

2238
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,520
Who is this Alf?

2239
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:03,840
Man.

2240
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,840
Oh, a line real quick that is another...

2241
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,000
Again, I hate to keep bringing these up.

2242
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,440
Things that don't happen anymore.

2243
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:15,360
When Kermit is and Miss Piggy are doing the Indiana Jones stunt show

2244
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,640
and she's just firing the giant gun in the plane,

2245
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:22,240
Kermit yells, Miss Piggy, how are we going to explain this to Big Bird?

2246
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:23,520
Whoa.

2247
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:24,800
It's so fast.

2248
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:25,920
It almost gets clipped.

2249
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:30,480
But I'm pretty sure he says, how are we going to explain this to Big Bird?

2250
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:34,640
Like, how are we going to explain this violence we're committing to Big Bird?

2251
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:37,040
Who is the mind of a child.

2252
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,440
What if he's just talking about the Nazis in general?

2253
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:40,480
Well, that's true.

2254
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:41,600
That's a big conversation.

2255
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,400
I mean, how do you explain World War II to a six-year-old bird?

2256
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:48,320
It's tough enough to explain death in general to Big Bird.

2257
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,440
That was very moving.

2258
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,360
So it shouldn't be...

2259
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,920
All the Muppets should share this burden together.

2260
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:54,820
Yeah.

2261
01:20:55,360 --> 01:21:02,080
The last Waldo Park Star that sold on March 23rd for $24.99 was $6 shipping.

2262
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:05,120
That being said, I don't see one on eBay.

2263
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:05,840
Wow.

2264
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:06,340
Okay.

2265
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,040
Hopefully if one pops up, it'll be around there.

2266
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,680
I guess I'll set up an alert like everything else in my life.

2267
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,360
That's what you got to do.

2268
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,120
They won't let me set up any more alerts.

2269
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,280
They say, you have 200, you can't do anymore.

2270
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:22,080
We just discovered the sheer volume of alerts on Mike's phone.

2271
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:22,640
Oh, yeah.

2272
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:23,520
This is meant to be.

2273
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,720
This is bringing the Muppets and Mickey together.

2274
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:32,720
I got a lot of Twitter alerts for deals and Wario 64 and Wario 64, I assume.

2275
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:33,360
Yeah.

2276
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:33,760
Yeah.

2277
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,440
So yeah, there's a lot going on.

2278
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:35,940
Okay.

2279
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:37,860
Okay.

2280
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:39,520
Wonderful special.

2281
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,880
Good time to talk about it.

2282
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:46,960
Also, Charles Groton, he gets demoted and has to clean up a bunch of gum under a bench at the end.

2283
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,120
A lot of blasts.

2284
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,600
Great performers, great performances.

2285
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:53,600
So much fun.

2286
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,960
You think Groton's still working there?

2287
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,280
That fictional.

2288
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,240
Quentin Fitzwaller.

2289
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,480
Did he get hired back after the furloughs?

2290
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:02,960
Good question.

2291
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,000
That's a great question.

2292
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:04,500
Yeah.

2293
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,200
Or did he seem edgy?

2294
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:10,480
I imagine they fire him for losing all those keys.

2295
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,120
That's like.

2296
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:13,440
I mean, that's probably, yeah.

2297
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:18,400
And for ledges, I don't know if they ever charged the Muppets for admission for that.

2298
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,600
They lost a lot of money.

2299
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,200
Do you think that's why the deal didn't go through?

2300
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,840
Oh, they made people mad.

2301
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,120
Yeah, it's actually all there.

2302
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:26,320
They planted the seeds.

2303
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,120
Due to the bumbling of Quentin.

2304
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,440
He ruined the whole thing.

2305
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:32,000
Yeah.

2306
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,880
He's responsible for everything bad that happened to any Muppet performer after this.

2307
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,000
Oh no.

2308
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,640
Well, it's just his character, not Groton, the character.

2309
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:41,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2310
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:41,600
Yes.

2311
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,600
But yeah, the fictional face of evil.

2312
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,680
Blame it all on him.

2313
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:49,600
But funny to see the Disney parks acknowledge the existence of gum.

2314
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,400
One of Walt's original nemesis.

2315
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:57,680
We haven't talked about that much on the show, but you cannot buy gum in Disney parks.

2316
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:58,720
Oh, is that right?

2317
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,480
Yeah, because they don't want it everywhere.

2318
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:01,840
And they're right.

2319
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:02,800
It would be everywhere.

2320
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,840
Yeah, be everywhere.

2321
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:04,800
That's a good call.

2322
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:08,800
So I think that you could buy, for many years, you could buy cigarettes, but not gum.

2323
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,160
They're easier to pick up.

2324
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:12,640
That's true.

2325
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,080
So you can bring gum in the park, though.

2326
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:16,480
You could.

2327
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,400
Yeah, you can bring it.

2328
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,080
I've chewed gum on rides.

2329
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:20,720
Wow, brag.

2330
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:22,480
Okay.

2331
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:23,920
That's a little reckless for me, Michael.

2332
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,800
What is your mother going to say about that?

2333
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,560
She wouldn't like it because she wouldn't want me to choke.

2334
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:29,920
Yeah, she's right.

2335
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:34,720
She hears that she's going to be upset.

2336
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,880
Geez, well, what a blast.

2337
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,080
So fun to talk about it.

2338
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,560
Hey, I think Patrick Hunter, You Survive podcast, the ride.

2339
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:43,680
Wow, we did it.

2340
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:50,000
So much for giving us a lovely afternoon to spend an afternoon talking about the Muppets.

2341
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:52,240
Hey, let's exit through the gift shop.

2342
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:53,360
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2343
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:53,920
Oh, man.

2344
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:54,640
Okay.

2345
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:55,920
Yeah, George Lucas Talk Show.

2346
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,000
You can watch any episode on YouTube.

2347
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,760
I recommend just finding a guest that you like and then just, I mean, listen,

2348
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:03,600
I see three guests right in front of me right now.

2349
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:04,320
That's a good one.

2350
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,440
That's a weird one.

2351
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,880
That's a weird one to start with, though.

2352
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:07,520
That's a weird one.

2353
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:11,680
But there's a lot of good people and you can find one that you like.

2354
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,280
You did Muppets tonight.

2355
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,000
Yeah, you did.

2356
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:14,560
We did.

2357
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,600
Yeah, we watched all of Muppets tonight with a bunch of the performers,

2358
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,280
the writers and the producers and everybody.

2359
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,120
That was a fun one.

2360
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,360
Ratscraps is an improv show in New York.

2361
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:29,200
It was Ask Hat at UCB and then that changed when the theater closed.

2362
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,400
We're doing it every Sunday.

2363
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:34,240
You can stream it online or you can come watch it in person.

2364
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,400
You can follow me on Twitter.

2365
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,680
It's at Patrick Kottner.

2366
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:42,640
And right now, trying to get more followers than the canceled NBC show about a boy.

2367
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,320
So what are the hurdles you've already made it?

2368
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,720
We've already gone past Animal Practice,

2369
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:56,880
1600 Pen, The Blacklist Redemption, Marlin, and now we're at About a Boy.

2370
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:57,520
I think that's all.

2371
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,400
Marlin Wayans?

2372
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:58,800
Yes.

2373
01:24:58,800 --> 01:24:59,280
Okay.

2374
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2375
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,760
Wow. The accounts are started for all of these.

2376
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:04,560
Isn't that crazy?

2377
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:05,600
Are there an Alpha count?

2378
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,000
Well, there's a new Alpha count.

2379
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:08,640
There's a new one.

2380
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:09,840
He's been doing a lot recently.

2381
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:10,800
Alpha real.

2382
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:12,400
Wait a minute.

2383
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:13,600
That's not out of range.

2384
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,800
That's 9,000.

2385
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,160
He's actually not that close to us.

2386
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,400
I think we're edging ahead.

2387
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,880
But 9,715.

2388
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:21,280
Yeah.

2389
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:21,520
Yeah.

2390
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:22,160
What are you at?

2391
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,560
I'm like 86 maybe?

2392
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:25,200
8600.

2393
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,560
Oh, so it's completely in the...

2394
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:27,040
Oh yeah.

2395
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,560
That's what we could beat.

2396
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:29,040
That's not bad.

2397
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,560
Yeah. 8632.

2398
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:31,040
Wow.

2399
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,960
It feels like the prime and alpha for a comeback.

2400
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:34,960
Well, he was just sold.

2401
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,960
He was sold to the shout factory.

2402
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:37,200
Yeah.

2403
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:39,840
And then there's rumors he's going to be,

2404
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,480
spoiler alert, in the Guardians of the Galaxy 3.

2405
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,240
Really?

2406
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:45,120
There's a big push.

2407
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:48,400
I don't know if it's probably a cameo, if it is indeed the case.

2408
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,880
But what happens a lot of the time, and I was just made aware of this,

2409
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:54,960
there's a licensing expo that happens in Las Vegas, which all of a sudden you see,

2410
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,920
oh, Golden Girls has every piece of merchandise.

2411
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,840
All of a sudden there's sweatshirts and everything.

2412
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:04,080
You go to this licensing thing and people make pitches based on what they own

2413
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,880
to get characters and stuff back out there.

2414
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,720
So all of a sudden when you go, yeah, why is there all this elf stuff?

2415
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:14,560
It's because there was a guy who owns Elf or is a representative

2416
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:17,600
pushing that on a lot of companies to make elf stuff.

2417
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:21,600
So elf right now, NECA is making the elf toy.

2418
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,400
This company Kid Robot makes those puppets of elf,

2419
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,120
which is owned by the...

2420
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:28,560
They're both owned by the same guy who also owns Graceland

2421
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,200
and also owns Loot Crate.

2422
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:32,480
Wow.

2423
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:35,040
And owns a bunch of stuff, random stuff.

2424
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,440
So yeah, sometimes there's a push.

2425
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:38,320
So I believe you're right.

2426
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:41,120
I think there's a push now for elf to get back out there again.

2427
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:42,160
Now here's what I'll say.

2428
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:46,400
I've tried to get elf and his friend, Paul Fusco on the Lucas show.

2429
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:47,200
Yes.

2430
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,280
And I'm going to say, let's start the campaign right now, guys.

2431
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:51,760
Oh, sure.

2432
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,560
So if you're listening, tweet at the elf official account,

2433
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,320
say to have him come on towards Lucas Talk Show.

2434
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:59,760
Because I don't follow elf because then they'll get ahead of your 90s.

2435
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:00,720
Do not follow him.

2436
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:01,120
Follow me.

2437
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,360
He was on...

2438
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,880
Okay, so this is real in the woods.

2439
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:09,200
There was a Target event in conjunction with NECA and Kid Robot

2440
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,280
a couple months ago called the Hall-a-thon,

2441
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,920
which is a confusing thing where they just release a bunch of new stuff

2442
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,680
they want you to buy and it's on a website.

2443
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:19,280
But they were having Mark Summers do videos to host the Hall-a-thon

2444
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,360
and he talked to his good friend, Paul Fusco.

2445
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:25,760
So Fusco is down to talk to Mark Summers via video.

2446
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:26,400
Okay.

2447
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:27,840
He's out there.

2448
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,560
He's he and he was on the show Duncanville.

2449
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:35,360
Alf was on Duncanville and he does a little funny bit there.

2450
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:35,760
All right.

2451
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,920
So Fusco is around, seemingly game.

2452
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,720
But yeah, maybe he's completely sold Alf off now.

2453
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:41,040
I don't know.

2454
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:41,360
I don't know.

2455
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:42,160
I don't know.

2456
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:45,440
Alf is in the Donald Trump, Funny or Die mood.

2457
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:45,920
Oh, yeah.

2458
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:47,520
Donald Trump.

2459
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:48,320
We all remember it.

2460
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,760
He was on the Goldbergs too.

2461
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,400
He's been on a couple of things.

2462
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:52,720
Yeah.

2463
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:53,920
So yeah.

2464
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,120
And you want him as Alf.

2465
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,040
Get into this licensing.

2466
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:57,680
Here's what I'll say.

2467
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:58,320
I want him as Alf.

2468
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:58,640
Oh, yeah.

2469
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,160
I want him as Paul Fusco.

2470
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:01,360
I want whatever.

2471
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,520
I have the puppet so I can do Alf if you want.

2472
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,000
I'm working on the voice.

2473
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,360
Not there yet, but it's close.

2474
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,640
There's days when it sounds like some days he goes, oh, yeah, you got it.

2475
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:12,080
And then I lose it.

2476
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,120
You just got to work on Willie.

2477
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:14,160
That's your way in.

2478
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:14,800
Oh, for sure.

2479
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:15,200
That's it.

2480
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,560
That helps you get into it.

2481
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:17,760
Yeah.

2482
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:20,160
It takes a lot of energy too, even though he's a laid back guy.

2483
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:20,480
Sure.

2484
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,840
Have you ever seen his talk show?

2485
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:22,320
Yeah.

2486
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:22,880
Okay, great.

2487
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:23,920
There's a clip online.

2488
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,120
I found this Alf Instagram.

2489
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,040
There's an Alf Instagram of all the clips.

2490
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:30,880
I think it's Bring Back Alf, I believe.

2491
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,640
And it's just constant Alf stuff.

2492
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,800
Ads, commercials, stuff.

2493
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:38,800
I think there was a Scarface parody that somebody posted yesterday.

2494
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:39,300
Great.

2495
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:40,480
Maybe I'm wrong.

2496
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,480
But then there was a clip from his talk show with Ed McMahon.

2497
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:42,880
Yeah.

2498
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:43,520
Do you know what I'm talking about?

2499
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:47,120
There's a young woman on the show and she's got like a tattoo of like Alf or something.

2500
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:50,800
And like Ed is going in to touch her and Alf's like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2501
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,360
Ed, you can't do this, Ed.

2502
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:55,440
It's like from 2006.

2503
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:57,120
Wild show.

2504
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,280
So yes, Alf's talk show.

2505
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,400
Then can we put you on the spot?

2506
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:05,760
Can you say thanks for subscribing to the Second Gate?

2507
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:06,320
All right.

2508
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,080
I'm doing this too early, but I'll do it.

2509
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:10,480
I want to say, okay, it is Scarface.

2510
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:13,440
It's Alfaccino and it's Furface.

2511
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:15,200
And that's the...

2512
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:20,480
Alfaccino is not Duncacino played by Alfaccino.

2513
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:21,040
No, yeah.

2514
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,280
Alfaccino is Furface.

2515
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,280
Director of photography, Kit E. Litter.

2516
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:33,360
So what am I saying as Alf?

2517
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,120
Thanks for subscribing to the Second Gate.

2518
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:38,880
Thanks for subscribing to the Second Gate.

2519
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:39,520
It's close.

2520
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:40,080
It's not bad.

2521
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,600
Just throw Willie in there and then see what happens.

2522
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,520
Willie, I'm Alf.

2523
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:46,960
Thanks for subscribing to the Second Gate.

2524
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:48,480
I think you're right.

2525
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:49,040
That's it.

2526
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:49,600
That's a key word.

2527
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,440
I got it closer than that second time.

2528
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:51,920
Yeah.

2529
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:56,720
Willie is a keystone and you know it's good impression when you say, I'm blank.

2530
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:02,000
Also, he's reminding Willie who he is.

2531
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:08,880
Okay.

2532
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:10,960
Well, yeah, Mike keep working on it.

2533
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:12,240
Alf will be back in some form.

2534
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,800
Whether it could be Mike, could be not.

2535
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:18,800
And hey, this is a great episode talking about a 1990

2536
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,840
piece of Disney video content.

2537
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:29,120
There may be another episode about a 1990 piece of Disney video content.

2538
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:33,760
But where, you ask, where will our episode about such a thing be?

2539
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:36,800
Well, stay tuned because big announcements coming.

2540
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,280
We'll leave that as a mysterious tease.

2541
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:41,840
It's a tease, Willie.

2542
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:45,280
It's a tease.
