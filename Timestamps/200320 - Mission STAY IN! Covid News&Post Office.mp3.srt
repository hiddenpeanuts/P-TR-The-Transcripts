00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Warning! The following podcast will be light on funny warnings,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
because we're all up to our necks in actual scary warnings.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're gonna talk about this fucking virus and try to have some fun on Podcast The Ride.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a podcast about places you can't go.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm Scott Gardner, and usually we say joining me as always,

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
but this certainly is not as it always happens.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Via social distance satellite is Mike Carlson.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yes, I am here. I'm what, like what, 10 miles from?

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Not 10 miles from, I'm 10 miles from you.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
No one is that far away from each other.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That's what's funny.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I recently, the other day, I skyped into a meeting that was like up the block.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It was like within, it's like a 10 minute walk, and I was like, nope, not risking it.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Also not risking it Jason Sheridan.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes, I'm here. Scott is close enough that I almost texted him to like,

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
hey, could you drive by, and I'm like, no, I'm not gonna do that.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm close enough that I almost texted him to like, hey, could you drive by,

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and just throw an SD card out the window or something?

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah, go ahead.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I was gonna say Jason drove by, because I had to give him a zoom to record,

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and I just dropped it in his trunk.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We spoke through a little crack in his window, but we're not like,

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Did you really?

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's crazy. It's crazy what's happening.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You're doing drops?

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Oh my God.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We did a bug out bag drop.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What is that?

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
A bug out bag, like a go bag.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh, okay. I know go bag. I didn't know bug out bag.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I think go bags are more for spies, and bug out bags are more for like survivalists.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We're really getting the last laugh right now.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Scott, have you ever heard of bug out bag?

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I've not heard of bug out bag, but it seems like something crucial.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
These are certainly bug out times, I'll say that.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You know, in case this is being listened to later, as in an archive sense.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We're recording this Tuesday, March 17th, around 4 15 p.m.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Just for historical sake, because like the situation is changing what's happening right now.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
There's an outbreak of coronavirus, and who knows by the time this comes out what the situation is.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So I just want everyone to know it's Tuesday, March 17th when we're recording this.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So any relatives, any ancestors listening to this later,

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
just know that we tried our best. We fought.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We fought to survive, and we did the best damn theme park podcast we could.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes. And also just like, who knows? Yeah.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Who knows? Yeah, I don't. We could be.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I could be living. I can move back home in a couple of days.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Who knows? Who knows what happens? Is that on the table?

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Are you driving? I would. I guess I would have to drive. Yeah.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Well, the flight. The deals on flights are great right now.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes. So there I have seen a lot of these.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So right now, obviously, everyone is being recommended in the world to stay in their homes,

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
not do much traveling, only by necessity, only for like groceries.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But the airlines are still at this moment operating.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So I have a Twitter alert that's set up when you get deals for different airlines

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and they are going constantly. And it's like, go to Jamaica for fifty dollars.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So your dream, you're like you're checking and your points in a very grim way.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It is now come to pass. Like the best deals in since the beginning of flight are now possible.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes, basically right. But I cannot take them if I want to be like a conscious,

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
a conscious citizen of the world. If you want to be alive. Yeah, it's probably best.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah, yeah. You know, it's strange how quickly this is all unfolded because we so we recorded an episode,

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
what, like a week ago, and we were saying like like in the episode, you'll hear it's like a Patreon episode.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And we should give the warning like we're not being flippant about it, but certainly was recorded in the before times,

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
that being several days ago. And while before we recorded, we were like,

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
is this going to turn into us like podcasting separately from each other's apartments to Quest?

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And then how quickly that became? Yes, that's exactly it. That's what has to happen.

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That's the only morally justifiable thing to happen. So after we finished recording,

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I went to a Trader Joe's and was like, well, this is really crowded. People stocking up, huh?

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Little to little did you know that very soon this would just be war zone.

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Like it was seeing a product that a Trader Joe's would be an achievement.

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah, I was too I had Tuesday night. I had like that anxiety and I started like getting things.

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But yeah, Wednesday is really when I think collectively everyone realized what was happening

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
because the NBA was canceled and Tom Hanks got it. Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson got the coronavirus.

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And I think that was sort of cult like our moment when everyone went, oh, shit.

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah. Well, and in the midst of all it to bring it to our topics, theme parks,

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:05,000
none of which are available to go to everything. Everything we've ever talked about on the show is cannot be gone to.

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Gone to. It's a staggering fact. You can still listen.

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Hold on a second. Hold on a second.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Oh, wait, Jason. Yeah. Are some of the businesses at City Wall,

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Hollywood still open, though? Jesus, I don't know.

83
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I think that you are right. I think the downtown Disney and Disney Springs or maybe not Disney Springs,

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
but downtown Disney now is going to close.

85
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Disney Springs and City Wall, Hollywood, I believe, closed all of the Disney and Universal run businesses

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and left it up to the other tenants whether they wanted to stay open or not.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Right. So maybe the donut bath bomb place is still open.

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't mean to discount that because soap and cleanliness are extremely important.

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes. Yes. The movie theaters are closed.

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Most movie theaters across the country are closed.

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes. And I found out you can get a refund for your AMC Stubbs A list and pause the pause the accounts while the movie theaters are closed.

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So don't let that billing go. If anyone has that program, don't let that billing go.

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I mean, that the theme parks closing, yes, was like it was an intensely dramatic thing to while.

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So for future posterity, yes. And this bizarre just watching them all go down, probably Disneyland, kind of the leader in it after sort of a false start where I guess.

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
All right. Well, there was an issue warning against mass gatherings, but Disneyland is going to stay open.

96
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And then it was only a couple hours before. Right. Never mind.

97
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And then I think one by one, everything else, all other parks in the country started going.

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah, it's that area.

99
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Nicole mind. That was a canary in the coal mine for how insane companies would start to behave when Gavin Newsom said, well, I had a call with Bob Iger last night and we decided Disneyland could stay open.

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah, that's yeah, because look, I think we've all slowly sort of realized what was happening.

101
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I mean, like I think in the history, at least as long as I've been alive, you'll hear about stuff and like swine flu and SARS and that that stuff's all deadly and bad.

102
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But ultimately you would hear about in the news and then it wouldn't affect you for the most part.

103
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Like we wouldn't have to change behavior.

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So we heard about this and like I think it was last Saturday.

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It was two Saturdays ago where I was talking to Lindsay and I'm like, does it feel like maybe they should shut everything down right now?

106
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And we were like, yeah, I guess so.

107
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
All right, let's go to my birthday where there's going to be like 30 people talking to each other and touching each other.

108
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That will that will be forever known as the last party.

109
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It was the yes, it was the last party.

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And I I chalk up some of this slow moving action to just our brains not being able to contemplate.

111
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's changing like our way of life, essentially.

112
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So like our very American brains like other parts of the world do that like many times, either from disease or war, sectarian violence, that sort of thing.

113
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But in America, our privilege, our privileged, selfish lives that we get to lead, it was like we're going to have to do what we can't do what.

114
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So I chalk some of it up to that.

115
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I, of course, chalk the rest up to like money and big business.

116
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Sure. Yeah, I was I think wondering for a while, is is it hysteria?

117
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Is it everybody overthinking everything?

118
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And like, I think even a dumb part of my brain was like, we're shutting the parks.

119
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's going to make everybody freak out.

120
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And I don't think I was syncing up with, oh, this needs to be done.

121
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This absolutely is the only way we can move.

122
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah, I yes, I think that I mean, other people I've talked to, like who had gone out a couple of days after like Wednesday and I'd be like, what are you doing?

123
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Because like I think, yes, once you realize like, OK, the reason we're inside is like to just not spread a disease because you could have you could have it and spread it, but not even know you have it.

124
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And it's very dangerous for older folks for the in general.

125
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's a pretty fun thing about it.

126
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You know, so how do you know if you have it?

127
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Well, almost anything and no symptoms could be as that could be the ultimate symptom is no symptom.

128
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yes, that is very possible that you do.

129
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You're asymptomatic.

130
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So, yes, it has been a slow attorney, essentially turning off our economy and turning off of all of our just behavior that we take for granted and our ability to move has been obviously psychologically.

131
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Tough for people.

132
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And again, like we're not even roughing it that bad.

133
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Well, Lindsay and I were in the apartment.

134
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm drinking the same kombucha I drink.

135
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I mean, I'm not really I'm not suffering right now.

136
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You didn't fill a bedroom.

137
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You filled a spare bedroom with that kombucha just so you would have it on hand.

138
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Well, there was an Amazon Prime now deal, I think, for like two dollars a bottle.

139
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So I do have a large stockpile of it.

140
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So I am, you know, I'm fine.

141
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And I'm like, people are being affected.

142
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Like people listening to this might be affected and our hearts go out to you.

143
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I mean, it's it's like real.

144
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
This is a real thing.

145
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah, that's what I think.

146
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I think, yeah, there is no one listening to this who hasn't been affected adversely in some way.

147
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And boy, I just hope it's not that bad or not recoupable in some regard.

148
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And if it is, yeah, God, we feel terrible.

149
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And all we can try to do is, you know, do our dumb usual thing and try to smile, which we will do.

150
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
We're just processing some of the some of the garbage.

151
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
We certainly are not just going to be be grim the entire time.

152
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We're doing OK. I could say this is like a pretty positive conversation considering the mood of things.

153
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I think so. Yeah.

154
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And I think the episode we recorded a week ago, I am not concerned any more about the stuff being flippant.

155
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm more concerned with it being Pat being like, oh, these jokes have already been made 20 times.

156
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh, well, what are you going to do?

157
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah, no, it's it's fine. It's just it's so clearly we're saying, oh, we like like, yeah, well, things be radically different by the time this comes.

158
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes, extremely, completely very different.

159
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And to and to that end, that's part of needing to jump in and do an episode is partially to explain what they all we're doing,

160
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
because we've been banking episodes for a while.

161
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We've we've been like we've almost never had such a strong reserve of episodes.

162
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
There's so many, including the one we just put out, the Kingda Ka episode with Dan Klein.

163
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And I think it was just like, well, we should probably put something out soon where we explain that you may be hearing some episodes

164
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
where we are not in any way addressing the largest elephant that's ever been in any room.

165
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So just know it's not because we're not thinking about it.

166
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's because the episodes are from the before times.

167
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,000
They're from, you know, early March when we could scarcely imagine what was going to happen.

168
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah. So if it's like we're like, oh, wow, I went to this restaurant yesterday and it was crowded and I, you know,

169
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
it was crazy. Someone dared me to lick the table and I did it like that's because it was maybe a month ago.

170
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:03,000
If we're describing our how our vigorous love of touching doorknobs and just really laying our hands on them for minutes at a time,

171
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
that's a very specific. I really enjoyed the doorknob run.

172
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And I'm glad to know you all like doorknob touching as much as I do.

173
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But it might be viewed as insensitive at this point.

174
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yes, that's a future that will be one of the future sort of inside jokes on podcast.

175
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The right is our love of doorknob touching.

176
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Yes. And there is an episode coming up where I say I'm just back from Las Vegas.

177
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I was in Las Vegas again in the before time.

178
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So I was not there doing doorknob touching.

179
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Citizens of Nevada, calm your restless minds.

180
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah, right. So there's going to be so many of those things.

181
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,000
This is going to be like a standup sets where you say like, you know, I was at a restaurant earlier and that's not sure that happened three years ago.

182
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
We're going to be we're going to sound like liars for a lot of episodes in the future.

183
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah. What's crazy about this whole thing, too, is that we could have already had this thing.

184
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
This virus like who knows?

185
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So like people had it in Vegas when you were there.

186
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Who knows what happened?

187
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What are we doing to Jay?

188
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Let's not put that in Jason's head.

189
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
He knows he can handle it.

190
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I do have to ask, how many times did you guys convince yourself this past weekend you had it?

191
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Oh, because I I on and off had a tightness in my chest and I was like, well, here it is.

192
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And slowly realized, oh, I've just been having a rolling panic attack.

193
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I've calmed down now.

194
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The other thing was, oh, well, having to go to the grocery stores to stock up the like don't go out a lot kind of defeated when one grocery store is out of something vital and you need to go to a second or third and then you finally find it.

195
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But the second or third one has clearly been there for 50 years and has very, very narrow aisles.

196
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And everyone put on cologne and perfume that day.

197
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So I was like, oh, I'm not having Corvid 19.

198
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I am having an allergy attack from the very potent sense in the very close quarters I have been in.

199
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Maybe though it's good for people to mark themselves so that you know that you've breathed the air that they've been around and you know that if they have it, you now have it.

200
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Everyone should just just mark themselves however they can just, you know, just to get out in front of it.

201
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah, I, I, I've left to do a couple of grocery runs and to mail something and then I quickly was like, I think we're going to need to do a lot of stuff remotely from now on.

202
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So I bought what's called a capture card and the only they had one at Best Buy and I said, well, maybe I'll just pick it up at Best Buy.

203
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But this is early too.

204
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm still not quite sure because you see all these different articles about what's safe, what's not safe.

205
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And I was like, OK, I'm going to run into Best Buy to get this.

206
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I've pre-ordered it. They'll have it waiting for me.

207
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I ran in there. They said, oh, here we go. Oh, wait a minute.

208
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And then they took 15 minutes to find the item for me while I nervously stressed out, paste the refrigerator section at Best Buy away from any person.

209
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I saw a guy cough into his arm like 30 feet away and I could feel like a chill run up my spine.

210
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And just a few weeks ago, being in an electronics store with very few products is what we did for fun.

211
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yes, we happily we made a whole event of it at the now closed fries Anaheim, which, you know, I was really happy.

212
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But I think it technically was it was under 50, I have to admit.

213
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So that that event, while not advisable, is technically like allowed by the law today.

214
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yes, it depends, though. Yeah, it depends on the meat is palatial.

215
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I think at this point, some places are saying 10 or less. Oh, my God.

216
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So it would it would have been against that suggestion in some places.

217
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Sure, sure. And I'm not saying I'm going to do it.

218
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's just, you know, what a what a different world.

219
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
What a contrast. And I'm just glad we got to see everybody.

220
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm glad, you know, hey, we probably won't be seeing fans anytime soon.

221
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Oh, yeah, not a live show for for a minute, unfortunately.

222
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
No, I yeah, it's going to be I don't know.

223
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't know. You hear a lot of different numbers, but I would

224
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I would not expect a lot of big things to reopen for a while.

225
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That two weeks that Disney says it's going to be closed, I would bet a lot of money

226
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
that's going to be more than two weeks.

227
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yet even if it becomes like a loud like, OK, the parks are back over.

228
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
How willing is anybody to go?

229
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Nice try. Nice try, suckers.

230
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I mean, here's the thing, though.

231
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
We saw some clips of people like on a Sunday night still in the park.

232
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I think people will be willing to go.

233
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And yeah, you're thinking if you're thinking about it, I would suggest don't go.

234
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'd say probably don't go.

235
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You know what? I think our audience inside of theme park fandom gets it

236
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and understand from what I can tell, this is another side.

237
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The sort of other end of like online theme park media.

238
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I like because you guys have seen my favorite genre of what we've seen

239
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
in the last couple of days is the characters saying goodbye

240
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
because the parks are not going to be open for a little bit.

241
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So all of your favorites are going to gather on top of the train station,

242
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
blocking the exits and making everyone gather in a one of the smaller hubs

243
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
available in a Magic Kingdom Park.

244
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And they're all going to wave goodbye to you.

245
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And there's one. Suck shit.

246
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What were you thinking? Why would you do this?

247
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I don't know. I don't know.

248
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
On any end, why are they doing it?

249
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Why are there people filming it for me to see?

250
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And my favorite one is one that I saw from Disney World where, you know,

251
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
it is I will say this, it's a fun gathering of characters that they assembled.

252
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Why even some country bears are getting in the mix and we like them.

253
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
But the thing I don't like is a further outbreak of an infectious disease.

254
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So the people gathered and who are where it really was me.

255
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
The video I was watching is that it's you know, you're seeing who's up there

256
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
and people are starting to yell the names of the characters.

257
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Goofy, Goofy, Cinderella, Cinderella.

258
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
This is a type of fandom I don't understand.

259
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
There is like a virus in the air.

260
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's anyway. And you are so excited to see the obscure, never rarely seen characters.

261
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Cinderella. You're going to shout her name.

262
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I just don't I can't get in the head of.

263
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Well, those people had the madness virus from 28 days later.

264
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
They had the. That's important context.

265
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I will chalk up that to again what I'm saying, slow processing.

266
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Those people were on vacation. Maybe they didn't get they haven't been looking at Twitter.

267
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
They haven't been looking at the news.

268
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's still strange to see it, of course, when we're quarantine.

269
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But I blame the company a little bit more than I blame the folks.

270
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Sure. I'll say this, though.

271
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't know as much as we do this podcast and talk about theme parks all the time.

272
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I guess still if I had to do the voice that I heard, it seemed to me like a, you know,

273
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
let's say north of 40 year old man.

274
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And I think screaming Cinderella disease or no disease is a tad confusing to me.

275
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
But this is me who, when we talked about the Star Wars dance, a thought or whatever the fuck that was,

276
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I didn't understand why everyone was so excited that Mickey came out.

277
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It was so exciting, but it's not surprising.

278
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It was a Star Wars show. You didn't know it was you didn't think of Disney character was going to come.

279
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It was unexpected. Disney where it's in the in this Walt Disney World.

280
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You're not going to win this argument.

281
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It was shocking to me that Mickey came out at the end of the Star Wars.

282
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Shocked, shocked, in a shocking development.

283
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Fourteen in a row. And it's all Star Wars characters.

284
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Scott, let me put it in terms you would imagine if those doors had opened and Peter Cotero walked out.

285
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Peter Cotero! Cotero!

286
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
All right. Well, that was involuntary. It just came out.

287
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
But again, we're not in Cotera land.

288
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
So Peter Cotera is not seen anywhere else in Disney World.

289
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
He's not in like all the iconography.

290
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's not a big planter of Cotera yet that you walk in and see when you go into a Disney park.

291
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Right. Yeah, I don't know. That's maybe not the best.

292
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm trying to think of another comparison here.

293
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Like if if we were watching the Aladdin, Disney's California Adventure Show,

294
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
which they used to be there, and then like, say, Spider-Man came on stage,

295
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I think that would be exciting because you wouldn't expect it.

296
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
They're not in the same universe.

297
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I suppose so. I don't think I would gasp as if it was the most shocking thing that had ever occurred.

298
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
But that's fair. I mean, I'm trying to think.

299
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Look, we're not like so far away from being 40.

300
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And I'm trying to think of the time, last few times I've yelled.

301
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
We went to see, we went to the 80s night at Disney a couple of months ago and we saw Totally Mini.

302
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
There's a little dance party that's based on the 80s mini.

303
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I guess it was a was it a series or was it a special?

304
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It was like a video. I think it was a prime time.

305
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So this is the thing with Elton John. Yeah.

306
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
So when Mini came out, we lost our minds because she was dressed as 80s Totally Mini.

307
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And we danced with her and we are old. We are old folks.

308
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Well, you should have danced to it.

309
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
That is correct. And that's that's nothing that I object to.

310
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:45,000
If it was more of a specific Cinderella, like Cinderella from Cinderella 3, whatever that one was, would you currently gold?

311
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Search for curly curly gold. Would that be acceptable?

312
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I suppose so. Yes.

313
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Some more alternate Cinderella or if Spinderella, Salt and Pepper's DJ had come out, that would have been more surprising to me.

314
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
That would be amazing. But still not excusable here in these in these quarantine times.

315
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Sure. That's fair. I can get behind that.

316
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I'm I'm trying to think of potential bright sides or anything fun that can happen in this way that we're recording.

317
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Oh, no. Wait. Another thing we should say at the top also.

318
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So you're in the episodes that come out week to week and you'll get it as soon as you hear certain ones.

319
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
So if you so if you don't hear us talking about of extremely frightening virus all the time, then that means that's one that we recorded a while ago.

320
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,000
If we say at the beginning that this is a sequester, so then you'll know that that's that's what's going on.

321
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You might even hear a sequester. So the long time out from, you know, I want to say when we're not sequestered and you hopefully it's not that long.

322
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
But if it doesn't line up with current events, just know, hey, we're trying our best.

323
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
We're trying to try to plow ahead. It's going to be a confusing timeline.

324
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Yeah, it's confusing as Cinderella, a twist in time.

325
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Did you look that up or did you know?

326
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
What's that?

327
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Did you just look that up? Did you know?

328
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I'm not sure that that's Cinderella 3.

329
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I know that there is a Cinderella called a twist in time where they go into the first movie a la Back to the Future 2.

330
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Oh, wow. We got to watch that.

331
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I mean, we will watch all things.

332
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Things now we have time to we're going to we're going to burn through everything on that Disney plus us up idea that we're going to be out soon.

333
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yeah, we got to watch all that garbage now.

334
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Yeah, I mean, things I am planning.

335
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm planning to be in here for like two to three months minimum.

336
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
That's my psychologically what I'm thinking is going to happen.

337
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
It could be longer, but that's the minimum.

338
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So we are going to miss out on things like Knott's Berry Farms, Boysenberry Festival, which I was very excited to go to this year.

339
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
We were going to cover all the different boysenberry treats and that's not going to happen.

340
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
We're going to miss. Yeah, we're going to miss out on some.

341
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I assume Marvel will be delayed now because they have to stop construction.

342
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's another fun thing.

343
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Yes. All the riots are going to happen for a while.

344
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Those bastards, those those pets keep their secret, keep their secret lives secret for a little longer.

345
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
This is just what they want it.

346
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I think they made it in a lab.

347
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You might be on to something there, but that we had that right.

348
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Universal was going to open in a couple of maybe a week or two and that will wait.

349
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So, yes, Disney plus is where it's at.

350
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I hear let me throw this out to you.

351
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Maybe this will coincide.

352
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I don't want to we don't want to say exactly what's going to happen because maybe we don't know.

353
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But I mentioned buying a capture card.

354
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Mm hmm. And I think maybe this is coming out on a Friday, maybe this Sunday.

355
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
There might be some podcast, the right activity on Twitch.

356
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Yes. Yeah, I think maybe as well.

357
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So stay tuned to our social media and because yeah, in the in the lack of being able to do live shows.

358
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Yeah, let's let's have some fun.

359
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Let's get into a new medium and try to the one that's like not the most embarrassing for nearly 40 year old people to be doing.

360
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Yes, we should probably, you know, keep at least six feet away from.

361
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
But Twitch, I think we could have some fun on Twitch.

362
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Yes, I have a pitch.

363
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I'll give you guys a hint.

364
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And let's see if you can.

365
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You could don't have to say it out loud because I don't know if we're going to do this Sunday.

366
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
But eventually I have a DVD that's been sitting on my shelf for a while.

367
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And all I'll give you is a hint is Christmas with the Cranks.

368
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So maybe we watch that on Twitch with with the listeners.

369
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Now is the time.

370
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And as the time, it's not the movie Christmas with the Cranks, by the way.

371
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
That's not what I know.

372
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I know you know what it is.

373
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I know what it is.

374
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I got it. I got it.

375
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Yeah, yeah.

376
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I think it is time.

377
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I think I think this is probably time also to finally do the long, if not awaited, tolerated.

378
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
We've long tolerated the notion of doing an episode where we watch all of Father of the Pride.

379
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Oh, yeah.

380
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:31,000
If there we finally found a scenario with this quarantine where that would be a less tedious thing to do than day to day life.

381
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I have the DVD within arm's reach as we speak.

382
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Boy. Well, then we're going to have to figure out there will have to be some drops in here.

383
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
But then beyond that, well, once we figure out some logistics.

384
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Yeah, I think I think it's time.

385
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
This is going to be we're going to clear out the attic of all the ideas we've ever been talking about.

386
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Mm hmm. Yeah.

387
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And in fact, actually, we should throw it to the because this is we're going to get to some listener questions in a little bit here.

388
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
But that's probably a thing to ask.

389
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
What do you want to do with us on Twitch?

390
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
We're all hanging out.

391
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
We're all hanging out in disparate bedrooms and offices.

392
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
So, yeah, what do you want to see us do?

393
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Let's have some fun. Yeah, I am also twitching a lot like on my prom.

394
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I'm not private. I was going to say private account on my account.

395
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Fat Carlson on Twitch and I've just been playing video games with Evan Susser.

396
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,000
So I'm I'm I'm entering this new streaming world.

397
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And, you know, we're trying a lot of stuff out.

398
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Maybe we could play a game as well.

399
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Well, there are. Yeah, there certainly are video games to play.

400
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
There's that Magic Kingdom and yes, game.

401
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:50,000
There's again, once again, the the Universal Studios GameCube game, which finally again in sequester light feels like an actual.

402
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Finally, OK way to pass the time.

403
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
My problem with that game, it involves running around a theme park and picking up garbage.

404
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,000
My my my GameCube is the only Nintendo system I have that is broken.

405
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Oh, which I guess I can find a used one.

406
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I'm sure it's not one hundred like thousand bucks or whatever.

407
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Do we all want to get like start a roller coaster tycoon park again?

408
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Well, I play that every now and then on my phone.

409
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Yeah, I look there's no way to stream games off of your phone, unfortunately.

410
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But I could see if I could download it.

411
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You mean build a park together or build competing parks?

412
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Oh, that's interesting. Maybe competing parks.

413
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I don't we'll talk about it off air.

414
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Yeah, yeah. Some of these logistics will we'll figure it out on our own.

415
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
But yeah, hey, tell us what you want.

416
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Give us ideas. Do our work for us and we'll we'll figure out some fun we can have.

417
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,000
We can we can make this just like a three month long or longer snow day.

418
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Yes, that's yeah, we'll do.

419
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
We'll do our best watching the movie Snow Day.

420
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
It might be fun.

421
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I don't know. It's not necessarily applicable.

422
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
But again, very few things are there.

423
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
We're going to have to loosen the definition of what it is we do.

424
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I have been so bored.

425
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I put on the movie Memoirs of an Invisible Man with Chevy Chase.

426
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It was also in Snow Day.

427
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
This is finally my chance to make it through the full Chevy Chase filmography.

428
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Yes, I think that's a very good idea.

429
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I just you know, speaking of Chevy Chase, there's a new film coming out.

430
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
That's it's like a Curb Your Enthusiasm with Paul Hogan from Crocodile Dundee.

431
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
What the fuck?

432
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Yeah, it's the premise is that Paul Hogan like comes back to Hollywood and Chevy Chase is in it.

433
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And it's like it's like really just Curb Your Enthusiasm with Paul Hogan.

434
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And we should watch that if it's video on demand as well.

435
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Oh, man. I bet we're going to make it to that Lance Burton movie.

436
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Oh, my God. Billy Toppett, the Lance Burton movie that was direct to DVD.

437
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
My brain will not retain the words Billy Toppett.

438
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I think you've said them to me six or seven times and my brain just swats it away like a ping pong paddle.

439
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Every bad idea I've ever said is like 50 percent better now because we're in the house or in the apartment.

440
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Is this where are we going to get so bored that we just we just do the harbor hoedown?

441
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I don't know what boredom you're talking about is.

442
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I live for this shit. I hate leaving my house.

443
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I was born for this.

444
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
So, yeah, Jason, let's let's catch up.

445
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
What is your routine like now for the last couple of days?

446
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Food wise, what are you keeping in the apartment or house?

447
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:59,000
You know, I've been watching my girlfriend and I had been watching a lot of the lights like 90s romantic comedies.

448
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Most of a ton of which I had not seen or had only ever seen like half of like 10 things I hate about you.

449
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Very good. Yeah, I really like that.

450
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Never been kissed.

451
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Also pretty good. Pretty good.

452
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Weird. I mean, obviously weird.

453
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
But like, oh, John C.

454
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Riley's first film role.

455
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Interesting.

456
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
There's like a base level of quality.

457
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
If it was something was in a movie theater in the 1990s, it wasn't just like like wretched.

458
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Yeah, for sure.

459
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Yeah, there's some there's a lot of movies around them that are like really good, like three star movies.

460
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Went backwards, went in a little more in my wheelhouse, watched the 1944 version of Meet Me in St.

461
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Louis with Judy Garland on a weird app in the Roku store that has all these classic movies, but just feeds you an unseemly number of ads.

462
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Like every eight minutes.

463
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So the movies are free and a pretty good quality.

464
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
But like then you will see the same ad for like online online schooling for children.

465
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Like you'll see it five times in a row.

466
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It's clearly some sort of Ponzi scheme algorithm nonsense.

467
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
But great songs and meet me in St. Louis.

468
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Why don't you give us a taste?

469
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Oh, yeah.

470
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
What should I?

471
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I mean, the whole time because maybe in St. Louis, if you haven't seen it, it's about a family, a large family.

472
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:47,000
We're very excited for the World's Fair coming to St. Louis, the 1904 World's Fair, which celebrates the Louisiana Purchase.

473
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And so the whole time everyone is singing meet me in St. Louis, Louis, meet me at the fair.

474
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Don't tell me the lights are shiny anywhere but there.

475
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And so like just constantly singing that, which is a song.

476
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
That was nice. Thank you.

477
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Very nice. Thank you.

478
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Yeah.

479
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Yeah, the movies kind of split between songs from that were popular in the time period and songs written in the 40s for the movie.

480
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
And it's a big MGM.

481
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Like it's a big it's like split up into chunks like big set pieces.

482
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And it's a big MGM movie musical, which I think are like if people don't like musicals are the most like interesting or fun like kind because they're just like so everything had to be done with a million.

483
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Background members and chorus members.

484
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Lave.

485
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Yeah, it's very lavish.

486
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,000
These are these are films that would be deeply illegal or troubling in the current climate.

487
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Yeah, no.

488
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Yeah, they would have to be CGI.

489
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Someone would have to do something called crunch to get it done to like have one person tap dancing.

490
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:11,000
But then Bugsby Berkeley would just have like 50 women doing making a giant cake like they turned to the other left and suddenly they're no longer a line of women.

491
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
They are a giant multi-tiered cake.

492
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
They would just that's what movies were.

493
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I think maybe like I think we'll also be stretching the confines such to it.

494
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:30,000
You know, and we do have like a final four thing coming up, but maybe there's like a can we do the brackets for the best Bugsby Berkeley musical number?

495
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Oh, of course.

496
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Oh, yeah.

497
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I mean, that was a good most problematic one, too, because there's some really like again, like incredibly giant set pieces and like Footlight Parade, the one that was like mentioned a lot in the great movie ride.

498
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Some very poor racial stereotypes that I don't think aged well back then, let alone now.

499
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Well, I think that puts them at risk of not making it all the way through the final four.

500
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Yeah, some points for racism.

501
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
They will lose in the first round if they're racist.

502
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Let's make that.

503
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
We don't want to make it too predictable.

504
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,000
But yeah, we'll all be shocked if a racist one makes it for the past round one.

505
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Sorry, Shanghai Lil.

506
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It was very cordial of you to apologize.

507
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Very.

508
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
And of course, the title character of that song played by Rosie.

509
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Is it Rosie Keeler?

510
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I think was the name or Ruby Keeler, the very, very pale woman who starred in all those movies.

511
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Yeah.

512
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Okay.

513
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
My.

514
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
But James Cagney tap dances out of nowhere in a sailor suit.

515
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
All right.

516
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Okay.

517
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Yes.

518
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You know, you enhance Jason.

519
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
All right.

520
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
This is the important question.

521
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Treats in the house.

522
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
What are you keeping?

523
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Okay.

524
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Are you hoarding?

525
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Are you stockpiling?

526
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
How's it going?

527
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,000
You know, I always heard during times of stress or trouble or economic recession, people went

528
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
kind of like went immediately towards comfort like that.

529
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
But I didn't really find any shortage of treats.

530
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
What am I looking at right now?

531
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I got a half full bag of goofy sour balls.

532
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I've got a bowl of Cadbury Robbins eggs.

533
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
A bowl show.

534
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Well, like I opened the bag and dumped them in a bowl.

535
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Okay.

536
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Let's see.

537
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Robbins eggs.

538
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Yeah, that's what I always heard them called.

539
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
They're like sort of big oblong Easter.

540
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Easter candy is still in stock.

541
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Yes, that is true.

542
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I was just at CVS.

543
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Yeah, tons of Easter.

544
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
This is not affected the Easter candy market.

545
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Take comfort in Reese's eggs, which I think are the best shape of Reese's.

546
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I've got some Kit Kat ice cream in the freezer that I have like miraculously not really cracked

547
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
into yet.

548
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I've got a couple boxes of cookies.

549
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
This is a lot, by the way.

550
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Yeah.

551
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Yes, you're right.

552
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
But this isn't even due to Corona.

553
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
This is just kind of what you got.

554
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Well, it ticks up around Easter season to begin with.

555
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
You don't have Christmas Robbins.

556
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
You don't have Halloween Robbins.

557
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I don't have Christmas.

558
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I might have like one or two wrapped like stocking stuff for candies somewhere still.

559
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I try not to keep sweets in the apartment unless people are coming over or there's some sort of special occasion.

560
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:44,000
But I will say I have for the first time in a couple of years, a package of EL fudges.

561
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Nice.

562
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Oh, that's some comfort.

563
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Oh, just see it for the physically visually seeing our old pal EL.

564
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
He's really comforting.

565
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Yeah.

566
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Well, wait, what is EL?

567
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Ernie Keebler.

568
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Is that I don't know this mythology very well.

569
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
I'm trying to remember.

570
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
What does the EL stand for?

571
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Is it is it Ernie Luther Keebler?

572
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Were they like very proud Protestants?

573
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
The Keebler elves were all Protestants.

574
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I didn't really.

575
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Yeah, that's right.

576
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
They did not.

577
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
They did not like the papists.

578
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:28,000
It seems like you could either think of it as the ELF, EL fudge, ELF just stands for elf.

579
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Then that's what it is.

580
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
But also, I'm also seeing that EL stands for everybody loves everybody loves fudge.

581
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
How about electric light fudge?

582
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Yeah, I would also accept that.

583
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Yes.

584
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
What is that?

585
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
So these the character is that little elf guy?

586
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
He's not EL fudge.

587
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Well, that's Ernie Keebler.

588
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I know I would bet my life savings on his name being Ernie Keebler.

589
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Yeah, that's that's correct.

590
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Yeah.

591
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And he's I guess it doesn't mean his name.

592
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I guess what you're saying, it stands for Al for it stands for everybody loves love Ernie

593
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
love.

594
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
You better believe I'll know.

595
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I'll find out who all of these characters are.

596
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Fryer Tuck spelled like because he fries Ernie's nephews, of course, are Zoot and JJ.

597
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Oh, my God.

598
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I love Zoot and JJ.

599
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Do you know we're going to do a whole oh, Patreon on the Keebler.

600
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Keebler the Keebler family tree, the linear family tree.

601
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Yeah.

602
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I'm super down.

603
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Elwood, Leonardo, Elwood, Fast Eddie.

604
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Oh, I know.

605
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I love a fast Eddie.

606
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Let's abandon the rest of this episode and just do the Keebler elves.

607
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
This becomes it is crucial in a trying time that we learn the names of all the Keebler

608
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
elves.

609
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Wow.

610
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I never thought about the Keebler elves.

611
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I would love to.

612
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
All right.

613
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
So I'm going to go ahead and do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

614
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little

615
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of aving.

616
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I would love to.

617
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
All right.

618
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
So while this one will turn this one around fast.

619
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Yeah, they've been around since the 60s.

620
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
There's a long there's plenty of meat on this bone.

621
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
All right.

622
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Keebler elves coming.

623
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I mean, we should probably switch over to audience questions because we asked for for

624
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
some of those.

625
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,000
But what have we really not hit here to be said at this momentous tedious occasion?

626
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:37,000
If you go to our Facebook page, our Facebook group, our new group of moderators has been

627
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,500
kind of putting all of the press releases or emails of the park closings and dates and

628
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,500
stuff in one like long thread.

629
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:51,520
And that was very helpful to look at in one spot.

630
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:57,000
So yeah, I mean, do you guys have anything on on the park closings?

631
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
No, just that I'm sort of like, you know, expecting it to be a while in case you haven't

632
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
heard our our annual passes.

633
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Obviously, this is one of the less pressing matters going on in the world right now.

634
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
But our annual passes will be extended as long as the parks are closed.

635
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Yeah, that is interesting.

636
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I'm curious how long that's that's going to be.

637
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And I like that they did get that announcement out fairly quickly.

638
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Yeah, I agree.

639
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Who who knows exactly, but it's not going to be I don't think any I don't think anything

640
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,000
goes back to 100 percent the way it was before and at least like 18 months.

641
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Like there may be a world where six months from now you have to take your temperature

642
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
to get into Disney.

643
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I know what you're saying.

644
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Yeah, there's going to be something like that because I've seen this compared to the you

645
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
know, it's like shoes at the airport.

646
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
There will be some like it's going to be different.

647
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:05,000
People have said no, like don't expect a vaccine until the minimum 18 months.

648
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Jesus. Yeah.

649
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
So anything can happen.

650
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
But I mean, I think stuff will change and open again.

651
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
But I think that's yeah.

652
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Prepare for things to be different for a while.

653
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
That's what I'm reading.

654
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I had a couple of little oddballs in the way.

655
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I mean, after the first couple of days of every company you've ever had any interaction

656
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:40,000
with emailing you that with their coronavirus procedures, then stuff started to turn ugly.

657
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I mean, a lot of places laying people off and there's arguments there of like, well,

658
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
they have to lay them off and then rehire them to get unemployment.

659
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,000
That's a big leap to trust some of these flat out vultures that they are going to rehire

660
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
everyone.

661
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Some very odd little moments.

662
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I was saying Disney Springs and CityWalk Hollywood were first closing the Universal and Disney

663
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
owned businesses.

664
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:13,000
There was a news story at an NBC affiliate which just used the phrase about Disney Springs.

665
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
People will still be able to go and walk around.

666
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And I'm like, oh, please don't do that.

667
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Don't don't know.

668
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And then the strangest thing, which someone I posted and then someone told me they have

669
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
kind of walked back.

670
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,000
But Universal Orlando seems like they did not quite get their shit together messaging

671
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
wise because they told everyone to go home and they'd be paid for two weeks.

672
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,000
And then Friday afternoon turned around and said, OK, everyone's coming in and you're

673
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
going to either sit in your break rooms or you're going to clean, which is insane.

674
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
And then it seems like they've scaled that back for the record.

675
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Well, some of Universal staff can work from home.

676
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Universal Orlando employs twenty seven thousand people.

677
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
So kind of a big group if you look at it in aggregate.

678
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
A bit of a mass gathering.

679
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Yes, you might say a mass gathering.

680
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I'm sure it's going to be weird from what I've heard.

681
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Some of these parks like use like these people are employees and these people are contractors.

682
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
And that's going to be gnarly to see how that plays out.

683
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Disney also like was ending the the rock band in the UK pavilion and the drummers in the

684
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Japanese pavilion at Epcot.

685
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I don't know if that was just when the contract was up, but that looked pretty shitty that

686
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,000
those poor guys were announcing it Sunday as everything is shutting down.

687
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Announcing it with like and in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you made

688
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,000
for extremely dramatic moments, the end of the revolution or whatever.

689
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Yeah, very pretty dignified exit, unlike the people showing them the exit.

690
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
So, yeah.

691
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
So, yeah, it's who I'm hoping by the time this comes out, there's some sort of like

692
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
national plan for people to get compensated.

693
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
That's what certain people are talking about in the government.

694
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
So, again, things are changing.

695
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:23,000
So I'm hopeful that people are going to get taken care of.

696
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Who knows?

697
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I mean, it was kind of before all this, but do you think is there any possibility of the

698
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Sector Keeper being allowed back into cricket wireless?

699
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
That's a good question.

700
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I think that maybe when they try to pass this, whatever this coronavirus stimulus for people

701
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:53,000
is in the Senate, that maybe somebody can sneak in the severance for the Sector Keeper

702
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
into the bill.

703
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Oh, just put it in the fine print.

704
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Absolutely.

705
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Yes, yes, yes.

706
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Do we think we have a member of Congress that listens to podcasts to write?

707
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Do we think there's one in the House or the Senate?

708
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I mean, we can burrow down.

709
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
We can look at the analytics and see what the numbers in like D.C. and Virginia are like.

710
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
At least some aides, maybe.

711
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
So, yeah, maybe yes.

712
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
If you're at least an aide of a senator or a congressman, please let us know so we can

713
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:30,000
get the Sector Keepers severance from cricket wireless put into a bill at the 11th hour.

714
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
And they're doing great.

715
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
The Congress is doing great on those bills right now.

716
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
You know, they're undercutting each other and that's all going very well.

717
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Primaries in multiple states in the country right now.

718
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Yeah, that's nothing I couldn't yell about for another hour, but we should answer listeners' questions.

719
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
That seems like a more fun thing to do.

720
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:01,000
We're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back and we'll answer some of your questions because we listen to our constituents, not like Congress.

721
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Nice. Yeah.

722
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Hey, and we're back to take some some of your questions.

723
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Thank you for filling up this episode and giving us some things to talk about.

724
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Before we get to listener questions, I have sort of a topically relevant question for you guys, which is this.

725
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:30,000
What who is your favorite sequestered or socially distanced Disney character?

726
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:41,000
As I was thinking about this, and there's certainly more than more than one, I think Rapunzel, you would have to say, entangled.

727
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I wait, I'm forgetting a big one.

728
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:52,000
If you count them as Disney, the Han Solo in the carbonite is technically so he couldn't get anybody sick down there.

729
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
True. Didn't really choose it, but kind of forcibly so.

730
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I I'm forgetting a very Gepetto.

731
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I think Gepetto in the in the belly of the whale is right.

732
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
It is is is contributing to diminishing the curb.

733
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
The curb. Genie Genie in the lamp.

734
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
That's what I yes. Yes.

735
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
The genie. That's a very long.

736
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Hopefully ours is not as long as the jeans.

737
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Did you say beast in the castle?

738
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Oh, absolutely.

739
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Yes. Yeah, true.

740
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Really all of the enchanted objects in their own way.

741
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
They don't quite keep distance from each other.

742
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
But, you know, we're still talking to significant others and such.

743
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
So we should pick a favorite of these or.

744
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Oh, yeah, or just, you know, I'm just trying to make a list.

745
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I think I feel if you have a favorite, certainly go for it.

746
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:54,000
But, you know, I think I feel less alone knowing that some of my many of my favorite characters have been sequestered at various times.

747
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Yeah, I get that.

748
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Are there any park specific characters that are more like sequestered?

749
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Oh, that's a good point.

750
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Yeah, do you mean the Yeti in Everest?

751
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I might say yes.

752
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And that's a pretty that's his choice.

753
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
He doesn't want you bothering him.

754
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Right.

755
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
That's good.

756
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Yeah, that's good.

757
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Because I'm trying to obviously all robots are stuck there.

758
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
But we're saying in the universe of these rides and the story.

759
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Yes.

760
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Who like doesn't want to be bothered.

761
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
OK, on the people mover in Florida, the woman getting her hair done by the way.

762
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
She's not getting her hair done by a robot.

763
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
True.

764
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
That's yes, that's safe.

765
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
She's not harming the well-being of a human barber.

766
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
OK, I'll allow that one.

767
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Yeah, I think that counts.

768
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Yeah, I'm flashing down.

769
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I'm picking universal.

770
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I mean, any character you're disturbing like like the abominable snowman.

771
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I think the the inciting incident of Guardians Mission Breakout is is is that Tyvon

772
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
allowing you to come see his opening his collection of the public.

773
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
He I think was sequestered until now.

774
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Well, he's forcing all those monsters and aliens and the Guardians of the Galaxy

775
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
to be sequestered as well.

776
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Yes, that's the entire thing is rocket breaking them out of being right.

777
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:27,000
So we're actually hurting the public good by going and rescuing them.

778
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Yes, exactly.

779
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Yeah, Tyvon seems more like he has like Howard Hughes kind of top floor office.

780
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
So he's self sequestered and everyone else is quarantined in a group.

781
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Yeah. Would you rather be sequestered in your apartment or in the Tyvon collection?

782
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Well, there's I don't know.

783
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I think there's living things in there.

784
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
You know, figment.

785
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:57,000
And I like that's where I'd be worried about any germs that any of them have the figment or Groot as.

786
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Yeah, God knows where Howard the Duck has been.

787
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Not good. He's very sexually active.

788
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
So, yeah, yeah.

789
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
It was the 70s when he was created.

790
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
So he's very horny.

791
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Mm hmm.

792
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
That is a film I will not be revisiting during my sequester.

793
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I mean, I say that now, but it's like in a month.

794
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
The drugs sounded pretty good right about now.

795
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Yeah. So, yeah, that's a lot of that's a good lineup.

796
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And I guess I'd I'd pose that back to the listener, your your favorite sequestered or quarantined.

797
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
And they are different things.

798
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Thanks for bringing that that color on the spectrum to that, Jason.

799
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Yeah.

800
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Mm hmm. Well, your questions, though, that's that's what we're here for.

801
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Does anybody have one have one ready to go?

802
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I have the one I saw first really wasn't a good theme park question, but I did want to answer it.

803
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Mm hmm.

804
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
It says during this time.

805
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Sorry, sorry. That's not it.

806
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:03,000
They basically they're just asking if Jason and I had our dream X-Men lineups,

807
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
which I think we talked about doing and we never did.

808
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Matthew Hurdle asked that question.

809
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
And I have my answer real quick for everybody.

810
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:17,000
It's Beast Gambit, Nightcrawler, Shadowcat, Storm, Maggot and Dazzler.

811
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
So there you go.

812
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Pretty good.

813
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
That's pretty good.

814
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Yeah.

815
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
You want to come you want to come back to it?

816
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Write it down while we're doing this and then you'll say at the end.

817
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I already have so many things Jerry rigged.

818
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I'm not going to be able to focus.

819
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I'll give I'll give like a chaos one off the dome.

820
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:46,000
So Jean Grey Cyclops Wolverine, Cable Gambit, Shadowcat, Dr.

821
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Celia Rise.

822
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Oh, pretty good.

823
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Pretty good.

824
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Longshot.

825
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Oh, long shot's pretty good.

826
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
He just says good luck.

827
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Scott, do you have an answer for this?

828
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
If you just like of the X-Men, you know.

829
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Yeah, mine would be Ernie Fryertuck, Zoot, not JJ.

830
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Sorry.

831
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Fast Eddie, Edison and Art.

832
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Hey, it's all good.

833
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Very good.

834
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
A lot of the non mutant ones.

835
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
But, you know, long shot with not technically a mutant came from another dimension.

836
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Arcade world or whatever.

837
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Mojo world.

838
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Mojo world.

839
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I really I know I know I'm throwing a lot of shade by leaving them off at buckets.

840
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Who?

841
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,000
You know, now that I think, you know, buckets being the one who throws the fudge onto the cookies, I probably should have included him.

842
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
But, you know, we're coming up with these just off the top of the dome.

843
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
That's Jason's favorite character in fiction.

844
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Yeah.

845
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I mean, I think you need I think your story possibilities really open up if you have Fast Eddie end buckets because, you know, the kind of antagonistic relationship they have is really something.

846
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Yeah.

847
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Well, a Fast Eddie wraps the products.

848
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:03,000
So an overage of fudge on the cookies makes Fast Eddie's job harder.

849
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
So it's tough for them to find a work balance.

850
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

851
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Mm hmm.

852
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Anybody do you have one?

853
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I've got one about my bullshit.

854
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Yeah, go ahead.

855
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
So sure.

856
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:24,000
From the Facebook page, Emily sure is asking vertical or horizontally sliced hot dog buns.

857
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:33,000
And I believe what that means is are you like if you were holding the bun in your hand, would you slice the side or would you slice the top?

858
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:43,000
And I have to say I mostly associate top sliced hot dog buns with like the northeast with New England kind of especially like lobster rolls kind of if you can picture one of those.

859
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
So I'd have to go horizontal because that's my I respect the top slice.

860
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
But horizontal is probably my go to choice.

861
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Interesting.

862
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Interesting. I think I'm a top slice guy.

863
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I know I wasn't asked asked, but I think it's I think it's very novel and I am enchanted by it when I see it.

864
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I think because it's so rare to be you're enchanted by it.

865
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Enchanted.

866
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Enchanted. Sure.

867
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Enchanted is such a good word, such a flowery word when you spy a hot dog bun.

868
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Well, you know what I also you know, a lot of those top slice, you know, get a little toasted or a little buttered, you know, so there might be a little extra surprise in there.

869
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
You never know.

870
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I'm going to I'm going to direct one to my wife feel bad saying Mike's bullshit.

871
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
This is not it is a Mike directed.

872
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
It's insulting to a certain someone to say bullshit.

873
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
This is from Tyler FG.

874
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:45,000
If he could go to a theme park, what do you think Edwin, your dog's favorite attraction would be?

875
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
That's a good question.

876
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I guess the bread tour at California Adventure because he would like the smells.

877
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Although I guess, you know, any ride that Edwin could do a little smelling, he would be happy with.

878
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I don't think he doesn't like a car ride.

879
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
He gets very upset.

880
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
He whimpers when he drives like anywhere.

881
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
He doesn't drive.

882
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
He doesn't drive. We drive him.

883
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
So I think anything with anything that doesn't move and has a smell.

884
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
So I mean, that's why I'm going to say bread tour at California Adventure.

885
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Speaking of Edwin, someone is asking for the picture of Edwin in a sandal.

886
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Oh, yeah, we post that.

887
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I think it's got it.

888
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I might have that. That's a good. Yeah, that's that's an important pick me up.

889
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I'd also like to say maybe one of the only positive things about us recording in different places is that finally there are more pets in the show.

890
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Pet lineup.

891
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:45,000
There is a possibility any time that we're recording one of these sequestrosodes that will get an appearance from my cats who I haven't talked about that much.

892
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Certainly said that I have them, but it's probably time they aren't in here right now, but they could come in at any time.

893
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
And they really hate when the door is closed slightly.

894
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I'm amazed they haven't come in yet, but it's probably we're all bored and it's probably time for you to meet my my cats.

895
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
There's Brenda who has jet black hair.

896
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:10,000
She's named after Brenda from 90210 and she's kind of, you know, you know, like skinny and feisty.

897
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
So what I would say scratches me a lot.

898
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
And and then there is Bunny, who is the one with the seat.

899
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I've definitely referred to one of my cats having a thick seat.

900
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
And that would be that would be bunny.

901
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:30,000
So if you get an appearance or just get a picture and she's more like bunny colored, like gray and white.

902
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:38,000
So if you if you hear me referring to him, now, you know, the new show that's Bunny and Brenda.

903
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
That's great. I got confused. I thought Brenda had the seat, but it's bunny.

904
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Got it. It is. It is bunny. Yes, because she bunny is more rabbit esque in general.

905
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I think the seat is part of that. That's it.

906
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:58,000
She feels more anatomically like a bunny and Brenda, you know, because she loves to climb.

907
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
She's kind of like a little mini King Kong.

908
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
When I see the city walk, King Kong kind of reminds me of Brenda.

909
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:13,000
That's nice. So now, you know, the expanded lineup of the of the show pets, I'll tell you if they come in.

910
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Let's go. You know what? Let's do an order. I'll go next.

911
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I'll go next. Then Jason and so because usually when we do this, we can point at each other.

912
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Now we don't have that ability. So we'll just go around Robin. How about we do that?

913
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
That's a good call. That brings it to you. Yeah, it brings it to me.

914
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
What are each of this is from Kevin Tully on Facebook.

915
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:35,000
What are each of your favorite theme park rumors that didn't and probably will never come true?

916
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
You can also include things that were announced and never built.

917
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I'm going to stick to the first part. I'm going to say rumors.

918
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I'm going to go with Wicked taking over Marvel Island, California, as they had Islands of Adventure.

919
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
That's my favorite, weirdest rumor. We've talked about it a lot.

920
01:01:53,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I do want it to happen because it means then that Disney can use Marvel in Florida.

921
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:07,000
We have a we now have a drop that would require a drop ride, a high speed roller coaster

922
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:15,000
and an immersive, extremely expensive screen ride to all be different shades of the mythology of wicked.

923
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Yes, this is if in case you're just joining us for the first time,

924
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:25,000
theme park podcaster Jim Hill has been talking about this for a few years that this has been a possibility.

925
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
It has not come to fruition yet.

926
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:34,000
But yes, that would mean that all of that stuff would have to be themed to specifically wicked.

927
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
So that that is the one I want to have.

928
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
He says this because Universal owns wicked.

929
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
There's been like a talk of a wicked movie that has not happened.

930
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Right. I know I'm so confused about what's there's not been such a film.

931
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Much much like Cats, the wicked movie, which is supposedly moving through the pipeline,

932
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:05,000
will happen much later after the wicked zeitgeist has died down.

933
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Let's make sure to get people really make sure everybody really forgets what the thing was.

934
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I mean, it's still running. It's still very successful on on Broadway and the books that it's based on, I believe, successful.

935
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
But yeah, I don't. I don't know.

936
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I mean, it's clearly Jim Hill's life work is trying to get this wicked thing.

937
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
He's pushing it because it's what he wants. Well, mine is also a Jim Hill.

938
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I've never stopped thinking about the idea that the Jimmy Fallon ride was going to be him interrupting twister.

939
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Oh, yeah. Going live every single day from the Tonight Show studio, which would be a challenge right now as it is,

940
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:50,000
he's production and him in Jim's words, threatening to throw a cow at people.

941
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
That's what the Jimmy Fallon ride was going to be was him.

942
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,000
And he like crudely taped a sign over the wall that says Jimmy Fallon's ride,

943
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,000
but that it's otherwise still the iconic twister, write it out.

944
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I think that's a new visitor to Universal Studios from China, I think, would completely understand.

945
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Oh, yes. The attraction based on the 1996 movie has been taken over by the talk show host.

946
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Yeah, that's good. I think mine.

947
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Well, Mike and I always talk about there are those plans for a giant like massive Marvel rise in the Middle East.

948
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,000
But that I mean, that was a little far along, so not really a rumor.

949
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:50,000
But I think the original Star Wars land plans at Disneyland were very interesting of like the Millennium Falcon

950
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,000
sitting above you right in the center where that sort of metal sculpture is.

951
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:03,000
And then the Endor speeder bike run kind of taking over the land occupied by Autopia and the subs.

952
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Mike, there was more. Right. Am I what am I forgetting?

953
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Those are the two big ones. The idea, I think, like kind of where the is it where the people mover used to load?

954
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Is that the thing that's been sitting up there like unused? Oh, yeah. Yeah.

955
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Like that would have been the Millennium Falcon and it would have just been a walkthrough where you would have met Chewbacca.

956
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,000
And then they would have demolished America Sings building interventions building.

957
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:33,000
And yeah, it would have been a speeder bike ride. I think they were going to take out Autopia and the subs maybe.

958
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
So you would have like started inside. I believe that's right. Yeah.

959
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
And then you would have gone through like the forests of Endor.

960
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,000
And I guess, yeah, I guess Star Tours would have stayed the same.

961
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Maybe Space Mountain would have stayed. So right in the in the middle of this would have just been Space Mountain.

962
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,000
But maybe I think people were thinking that space forever.

963
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Like, I think people were thinking that the hyperspace was sort of a holdover from that idea.

964
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Oh, maybe. So it was like a cheaper version of what they were thinking they would change if they had had Star Wars take over Tomorrowland.

965
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:19,000
I'm glad that didn't happen, though, but it still might be now, especially years away from Tomorrowland being different.

966
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Hey, forgive me for being quiet during all that. But speak of the devil. Bunny came in.

967
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I had some good pics of Bunny right at the microphone. She didn't she didn't talk or anything, but she's wandering around my the big contemporary hotel model that is on my desk.

968
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
So, hey, check out check out our Twitter for some of that sweet cat content.

969
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Yeah. Who's next? Scott, is that Jason next? Jason, I think.

970
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I got a very good one from Liz Blackerby.

971
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Which of the Duffy gang would you most want to be stuck in quarantine with?

972
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Hmm. That's a good question. I think I'm going to answer first.

973
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I think it's and I'm going to say his old name, but I know he has a new name and we haven't talked about it yet.

974
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Olu the turtle.

975
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Have we all seen, though, that Olu's name is not Olu anymore?

976
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:21,000
What is it? Hold on. I'm trying to find out. It is Olu Mel.

977
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Oh, so much like Cookie became Cookie Ann, Olu is becoming Olu Mel.

978
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Yes, it's not just Olu anymore. And he's a turtle and he's chilled out because he's like he's from Milani.

979
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
So he's a very like probably a really good roommate.

980
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Like Gella Tony is the of course, the Italian painter cat, and he would just be a lot like he'd always want to go party.

981
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,000
He would be like if you were stuck with him, I think you maybe would get on your nerves.

982
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
So that's why I pick Olu Mel.

983
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Maybe I ought to go Cookie Ann because she's going to be making treats this whole time.

984
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I'm stuck. That's a good pick. Yeah.

985
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Just practical more than anything. Yeah.

986
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Jason, what do you think?

987
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:13,000
I feel like has no one said Duffy yet.

988
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I mean, I think it got I gave it up to the big guy.

989
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I think he I just find him very rock solid.

990
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
I feel like he'd be a comforting presence.

991
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I think the number of outfits that he has would probably be, you know, fun.

992
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
You do a little fashion shows, that sort of thing.

993
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
And so you yeah. So and he takes on all those skills, right?

994
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Like when he wears the pit crew outfit, he is a handyman.

995
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Right. I don't think that's I don't I think he's just playing dress up.

996
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I don't think he actually like he's not someone who actually can like do everything.

997
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I think he's just playing fun dress up.

998
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
You think he's doing stolen valor for any number of occupations?

999
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
OK, stolen pit crew valor. Sure.

1000
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I'm not saying that's not fun, because, yes, I guess I guess if you were in an apartment

1001
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:18,000
having a big teddy bear go in and do like a pretty woman scenario, like where you were sitting,

1002
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
watching him try on outfits would be entertaining.

1003
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Yeah, I think so. Yeah, he's he's like, is it different than we don't think it's like Barbie?

1004
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
We're like Barbies in different outfits, but I think Barbie does the jobs.

1005
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
We don't think she does. He's doing the jobs.

1006
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
I don't think Duffy is doing the jobs.

1007
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I don't know if this is actually written down anywhere, but that's my reading of it.

1008
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
That's the stressor.

1009
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Yeah, for the most part, it's just like he's wearing, you know, a polo shirt and khaki pants.

1010
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Yeah, I don't know if somebody has an objection to this, please let it be known.

1011
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
But that's my take on Duffy.

1012
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Well, good picks. It would be nice to be.

1013
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I mean, I mean, like Mike, you are quarantined with some of the Duffy gang.

1014
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Oh, yeah, they're right here. I'm looking at them right now.

1015
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
And I hopefully it doesn't come to this.

1016
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Hopefully you don't have to eat them.

1017
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I would start with Tippie Blue.

1018
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Good.

1019
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
The bird mailman.

1020
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Good.

1021
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
The least emotionally connected to Tippie Blue.

1022
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
That's why I don't want to be so cruel.

1023
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
But if that came to that.

1024
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:34,000
It's good to have the order in your head, really any group of people you're in, even before all this, I think.

1025
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:41,000
And after this, I think just whenever you get in an elevator, just kind of like do the math of what order you would you would eat people in.

1026
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Mm hmm.

1027
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
It's just helpful. Practical.

1028
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Yeah. And listeners, please send us the order in which you would eat the three of us.

1029
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
If you were in a situation where we were the only food, who would you eat first?

1030
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
And somebody is like, all right, I've thought a lot about this.

1031
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:03,000
So like this is drawn 25 page.

1032
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Yeah, no fan.

1033
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
We don't want fan art of that.

1034
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:14,000
That's one of the times I will say no fan art of listeners eating us for food and sustenance.

1035
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Yeah.

1036
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
None of that, please.

1037
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I for.

1038
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Absolutely do a non-culture fan art.

1039
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Yeah, here's here's a fun one.

1040
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
This is from Parker, a mama, mama.

1041
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:38,000
What is blue 32 doing with all this time away from performing that he brings up a good point that there was a specific as we've had the moments of everything getting closed and sometimes in an email form via David Copperfield did make an official announcement of it.

1042
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:45,000
This that he will not be doing the doing the production with his alien blue 32 for a little while.

1043
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:50,000
I wonder if I I have that somewhere in a text.

1044
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Let me see if I can find it, especially in times like these.

1045
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Magic is important to me.

1046
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to find it.

1047
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to find it.

1048
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to find it.

1049
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to find it.

1050
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to find it.

1051
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to find it.

1052
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
It reminds me of a text.

1053
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Let me see if I can find it, especially in times like these magic is important.

1054
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
It reminds us to dream and believe our own ability to achieve the impossible.

1055
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Nothing is more important than the health and safety of my audience, my team, and my family.

1056
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
So we're pausing shows today to assess the situation.

1057
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Powerful stuff from from David and his love for us.

1058
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
He's not he's not in the show.

1059
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I like to think that when David is performing, he takes blue with him.

1060
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Mm hmm. So they can be sequestered together.

1061
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,000
That's that's not a that that's not a sure that they don't need social distance.

1062
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
No, I mean, yeah.

1063
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Is it more likely that blue is just like stuck in a box in the back of the MGM Grand?

1064
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Yes. Oh, I like to think not in the world of the show.

1065
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Yeah, that is weird. The blue is just sitting somewhere.

1066
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Yeah, moving.

1067
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,000
So it's possible that David takes blue with him.

1068
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Like, I assume David gets driven around because he's so famous.

1069
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:17,000
But I'd like to imagine like David with a top down on a convertible has blue next to him in the car

1070
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:23,000
and that they're just like letting the air flow, like flow through their hair and their antenna.

1071
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,000
And they're just like two cool buds driving around Las Vegas together.

1072
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Like, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan.

1073
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
It's it's all their blast and rat pack there.

1074
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Yes, they're ignoring the quarantine because they have magic on their side.

1075
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
So it doesn't it doesn't apply to them.

1076
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
If they get infected, they just wish it away.

1077
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Yes, I think that there's no.

1078
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Yeah, I think that like David probably has sort of a sixth sense for everything.

1079
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Mm hmm. He has a spider sense.

1080
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:03,000
So I think David, yeah, he knows when something's contaminated and he just says a couple magic words and it goes away.

1081
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,000
And then, of course, blue is able to as if you've listened to our patron episode,

1082
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,000
David's blue alien friend is able to pick out an audience member that's hot.

1083
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Right. So he is a power to.

1084
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,000
So he so so maybe he's like,

1085
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,000
if he's stuck in a room somewhere, he's probably like flipping through Tinder.

1086
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
That's what he's doing.

1087
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
He doesn't know when he's going to be out and on the prowl again, but he's like getting his cue ready to go.

1088
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
She's hot. She's not left.

1089
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Right. Right. Right.

1090
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
No, left. I don't remember which is.

1091
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
I don't know which one's which I've never done it. Jason's the only one who's done it.

1092
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,000
I don't quite. I mean, left to left is when you want.

1093
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,000
No. Right is when you want. Yes.

1094
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
OK. But I had to remember because you're you're.

1095
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Yeah, I guess you're making the same motion.

1096
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I it that would be a punch line for jokes, I feel like for a while.

1097
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Like and I would forget which was left and like I would forget like, wait, what is good and what is bad?

1098
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
So just saying like, yeah, you're going to have to swipe left on that one.

1099
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
You're like, does that mean cool, man?

1100
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Everyone else in audience laughing uproariously, you just like slow clapping to like, no, I get it.

1101
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I totally get it.

1102
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Let me go here.

1103
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:34,000
This is from Doc Chapa at Twitter.

1104
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Who should the next R3X be?

1105
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
An old retired character who should return to the park in a big way.

1106
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Oh, that's good. Very good question.

1107
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Thank you for that question.

1108
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Not that it has to be this way, but I'm certainly thinking in part of a big new development,

1109
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:56,000
like the Marvel area of of California Adventure might be good.

1110
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Like it's like an old character that's a little anachronistic.

1111
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
And how do we like fit it into a new?

1112
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:08,000
I mean, that makes me think Marvel McFay in the Marvel line.

1113
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Oh, interesting.

1114
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Yeah. So it's you know, his name is Marvel.

1115
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
So so he fits. He's allowed.

1116
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Yeah. What did he do?

1117
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I want to obviously see him come back.

1118
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
What were you saying? Sorry.

1119
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:28,000
What did he do? What was kind of his his function on this earth?

1120
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Spreading good sheer, I think. Great. Great.

1121
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
It seemed like, yeah, he was just sort of like call for a good time.

1122
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Call Marvel McFay not in maybe a sexual way, but just, you know, to party to have fun.

1123
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:50,000
For Lutz. Call him for Lutz. For Lutz, as you say. Yeah.

1124
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
It was. Yeah, that was the old days.

1125
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,000
All right. So he's dealing drugs to Iron Man. Great. OK.

1126
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Yeah, that's bad. Iron Man has a problem.

1127
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:05,000
But I mean, look, that's opens up a lot of storyline possibilities, certainly.

1128
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Yeah. I also think people are going to be so like wiped out and emotional

1129
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:20,000
after all this Corona stuff that I think Disney to brighten mood should just be selling drugs in the park.

1130
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Like, why not just give everybody everything they want?

1131
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Like, I think Marvel, Marvel McFay walking around with baggies of psychedelics.

1132
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Let's just make everyone real. We're all going to need it come October or whatever it is.

1133
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I think I'll say this. This. Yeah, go ahead.

1134
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:43,000
The funny T-shirts like the funny Disney T-shirts with like Donald having Corona are just going to be awful.

1135
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Oh, my God. No, I don't want to see those.

1136
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
I won't we won't make we made it.

1137
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,000
We made a bunch of bad drinking Disney shirts, but we will not make those.

1138
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I can guarantee that. Old characters were we'd like to see back.

1139
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Yeah, I think Sam Eagle from America Sings. Yeah, we've talked about him before, but he's he's got to come back.

1140
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,000
We got a context where where do we put him?

1141
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
You know, people aren't happy.

1142
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Apparently, there's some people who are extremely unhappy about the eagle, the same eagle barbecue and Epcot.

1143
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
So put him in there. He's a Disney character. He's Disney.

1144
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:34,000
It's not an outside IP and he's, you know, he's he's cooking up ribs and tapping kegs.

1145
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Sure. Yeah. Walk around Sammy goal to tap the keg like literally.

1146
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Yeah, he has to actually run it.

1147
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:47,000
It was the kind of thing they're going to have to do with budget cuts is make the suited characters also serve the food.

1148
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Yes. Yes. Which honestly was always my dream as a kid.

1149
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
I thought, oh, they're working there. I thought that would be fun.

1150
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
But of course, the reality is that would be very strange.

1151
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,000
You want it to be that you wanted it to be the like goofy is bringing you food and it really is his job.

1152
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
And if he doesn't do it, he doesn't get money.

1153
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Yeah. And he like he trips and like a bowl of pudding falls on my dad's head.

1154
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:16,000
But what we don't see is like are the OSHA complaints after the fact.

1155
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Oh, my God. A lot of paperwork.

1156
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
How unsafe would that kitchen be?

1157
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Just like that. Not like goofy would like he would be so he wouldn't knock, knock knives over and it would like barely not stab him to death.

1158
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Yeah, it would like knives and it would like perfectly form the shape of his body around him against the wall.

1159
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
And that'd be funny for us to see.

1160
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,000
But less funny for the other endangered chefs.

1161
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Oh, my gosh. I can't even imagine.

1162
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Yeah. Did keep goofy out of the kitchen for gosh sake, for gosh sake.

1163
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Goofy go home. Yeah.

1164
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:58,000
You're only going to spread this virus further or with you do comical bumbling will hurt someone at some point.

1165
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Yes. Jason, what do you think?

1166
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Characters.

1167
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
What? Sorry, I've gotten my birds confused.

1168
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Mike, what was yours again?

1169
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Sam Eagle from America Sings, the top hat.

1170
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Yeah, like a top hat.

1171
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Was that your choice?

1172
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Yeah, that that was who I was thinking of.

1173
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I just couldn't remember.

1174
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Like, no, I forgot that there are all Eagles are named Sam.

1175
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
That's right.

1176
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Yes. Yeah, as we proved definitively.

1177
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:34,000
I mean, Horizons, Robot Butler, Horizon.

1178
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I mean, if they're going to do Epcot, like vintage Epcot, Horizons, Robot Butler or Smart One from CommuniCorps, like, you know, they got to be somewhere.

1179
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I think I think there's no changes to Smart One.

1180
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
He's just walking around. They don't update it. They don't do anything.

1181
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
He's just rolling around the park again.

1182
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Everybody freaks out.

1183
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
It's a huge Instagram thing.

1184
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Why are they just get them out there?

1185
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Yeah, that reminds me.

1186
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Scott, did you see the like there was an old, old Epcot show that like the video video of it just went up for the first time called like Mr.

1187
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Something's computer review that I think like would happen by Smart One.

1188
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Oh, interesting.

1189
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
No, I haven't seen that.

1190
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I'll check that out.

1191
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
I got to dig this up.

1192
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Yeah.

1193
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Great.

1194
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Wait, Mike, you had something.

1195
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
I've honestly I forgot.

1196
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
I forgot what I was about to say.

1197
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
I'm trying to get my next question prep.

1198
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Oh, yeah.

1199
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Hey, you know, that's the dexterity of having to do these mailbag episodes.

1200
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Yes, I actually do remember I was going to say I was going to say my pitch is just for Smart One to move in with Jason.

1201
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Oh, that'd be great.

1202
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Just like two pills.

1203
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Would Smart One help me?

1204
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
No.

1205
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Oh, it's more.

1206
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
No.

1207
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
OK.

1208
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
No.

1209
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
He'd be more of a burden.

1210
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Well, oh, great.

1211
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:59,000
So what is the worst remake quality Smart One would have leaking oil everywhere?

1212
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Motor oil.

1213
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Oh, yeah, that sucks.

1214
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
I'm sorry, Jason.

1215
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
All clean up after me.

1216
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,000
My arms do not reach the rag and the floor.

1217
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
I will spark.

1218
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
I can have oil in me, but not outside me.

1219
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Light up my cigarette, too, please.

1220
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Wipe the oil before we light my cigarette.

1221
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Smart One, we're going to lose the security deposit if you keep smoking indoors.

1222
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Our landlord can get bent.

1223
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
OK.

1224
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
He sucks.

1225
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
It's not very that's not very productive.

1226
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Smart One.

1227
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I'm smarter than him.

1228
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Tell him that instead of next rent check rate.

1229
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
I'm smart.

1230
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Smart One is smarter than you.

1231
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Care of.

1232
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Fuck you.

1233
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
I broke that.

1234
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I broke that toilet again.

1235
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I weigh 300 pounds.

1236
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
With what?

1237
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
On my body.

1238
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
My butt.

1239
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Why were you anywhere near it?

1240
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I was trying to leak my oil in the toilet as you suggested.

1241
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
That's not really flushable.

1242
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Oh, well, you should have said something to me about it before.

1243
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I said that.

1244
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
I said it sarcastically.

1245
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Oh, by the way, did you know that my full name is Smart Ass One?

1246
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
No, come on.

1247
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,000
It's about my wicked attitude, my wicked toot.

1248
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Well, I don't care for it.

1249
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Sorry, you got to live with it, pal.

1250
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
The S's in as are smelled with fives.

1251
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,000
I like this.

1252
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
New character.

1253
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
This is great.

1254
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
There's more questions, but that's hard.

1255
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
That's hard to top.

1256
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
That was a lot of fun.

1257
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Is there anything else we want to jam in?

1258
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,000
I've got a good one, and I think this might be a good wrap up.

1259
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,000
I mean, we're not going to get better than a piece of shit smart one.

1260
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Smart Ass One.

1261
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Smart Ass One.

1262
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Yeah.

1263
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I think that's a good one.

1264
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Smart Ass One.

1265
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Smart Ass One.

1266
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:13,000
But this might be helpful if people are looking for entertainment during the quarantine.

1267
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:18,000
David Agua Bubblegum on Twitter is asking, what are your guys' favorite podcast, The

1268
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Rides episode?

1269
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Interesting.

1270
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
How can you pick?

1271
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
They're like our children.

1272
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
They're like our children.

1273
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:31,000
We did do the AV Club had us talk about some of our favorites.

1274
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Well, obviously it's this one in quarantine.

1275
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
I mean, yeah, it doesn't get better than this.

1276
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:41,000
They don't have to deal with any of those fucking guests.

1277
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
I've hated every one of those guys.

1278
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
There's an extra.

1279
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Scott's starting to crack.

1280
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,000
When you say something funny, there's an extra half second to go like, oh, did what I say

1281
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
was, was it not funny?

1282
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
And then you might be hear a laugh on the other side of this.

1283
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Like that's, that's really good.

1284
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I really like that.

1285
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Yeah.

1286
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,000
I think I just, I think some of my audio that I'm recording on my own just dropped out.

1287
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
So yeah, yeah, stuff like that.

1288
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Jason leaving all the time.

1289
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:10,000
I it's, you know, having problems to deal with tests, your rigors as a podcaster.

1290
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
And that's why this current one is easily my favorite.

1291
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:19,000
If I had the word hero is thrown around a lot.

1292
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:25,000
If I had to pick a second favorite, it's probably McGruff.

1293
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
The McGruff music episode.

1294
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Yeah.

1295
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
And, and McGruff too.

1296
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I mean, now is the time to really like get down and digitize and do all the research

1297
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
to, to figure out McGruff too.

1298
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
I will tease this.

1299
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I can't, I have to keep it vague.

1300
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:47,000
I hope I will finish it by, I will tease something extra that I've thought of for McGruff too.

1301
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Oh, that is going to, I think it'll, I think it'll turn out well.

1302
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
That's all I'll say.

1303
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Neat, neat.

1304
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
But there's, I mean, we promised a lot.

1305
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,000
I'm still trying to hunt down the person who wrote the songs.

1306
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I'm still, we're in the process of digitizing the new McGruff or the old McGruff music that

1307
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
we found.

1308
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
We found an additional McGruff album we didn't know existed.

1309
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,000
And there is something else I've got in the works.

1310
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,000
My God, this might be McGruff two, three, four.

1311
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,000
This might be a separate McGruff spinoff podcast.

1312
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:26,000
It'll be like Avatar where we announced four different McGruffs with different subtitles.

1313
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:34,000
It's an incredibly ambitious array of future McGruffs that will come out in 2032, when

1314
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
we're allowed outside again.

1315
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I don't, I don't know if this is like the best episode to listen to.

1316
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:48,000
And I don't, I can't speak to that because I don't listen to all of them back.

1317
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
But I'm not a fan of the ones I do.

1318
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:56,000
But I've never had more fun doing podcast the ride than the hundredth episode live show

1319
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
with the Sector Keeper and Bugsy.

1320
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
That's certainly the book.

1321
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:06,000
When I think of like when I, when have I had just the most delirious fun doing anything

1322
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,000
podcast the ride related, it is probably that one.

1323
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:15,000
So if it's my favorite in that I'm the most fond of having done it.

1324
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
But that's that that's me.

1325
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Sure.

1326
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:27,000
The hardest I've laughed I think were the the two part failed parks with Jason Willner

1327
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
on the Hard Rock Park.

1328
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
And what are those?

1329
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Who are the what are those guys called?

1330
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
The weirdos?

1331
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Sid and Marty Croft.

1332
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Marty Croft.

1333
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Yeah.

1334
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
The two hippie weirdos.

1335
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
So funny.

1336
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
The two hippie weirdos.

1337
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Where is the lie?

1338
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
The lie.

1339
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:51,000
But especially the the end of part one whenever whenever we ended up doing it I had to run

1340
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
out.

1341
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:58,000
So listening to the wrap up of the first part was I started laughing all over again because

1342
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
I didn't know what it was.

1343
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
And you two did a great job on that.

1344
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Thank you.

1345
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Hey.

1346
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Oh you mean the at the beginning of the episode or like this sudden like guess what?

1347
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
We're rocking harder next week.

1348
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Yes.

1349
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Yeah.

1350
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Yeah.

1351
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Yeah.

1352
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Yeah.

1353
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Let's say that's that's I think that one was just this just hasn't been so much surprise

1354
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,000
for us in recording one.

1355
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Hey.

1356
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
So and then now we are a little we feel a little more loaded to bear like we think oh

1357
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,000
now here's a good one and then we almost like put too much pressure.

1358
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,000
That one was just snuck up on us so much.

1359
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:39,000
How fun how funny all that got that we had no idea was going to be over three hours.

1360
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
That was a ton of fun.

1361
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I felt similarly.

1362
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
It was two episodes but we did them back to back.

1363
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:52,000
The most recent run with Eva Anderson in the downtown Disney ordeal that like felt like

1364
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
a mega episode because we did them back to back.

1365
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:00,000
But the speed round of all the stores that's that's another one of the most fun I've had

1366
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
recently.

1367
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Yeah.

1368
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:08,000
So that lesson is the longer the longer we record if it's under three hours we're probably

1369
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
it's the quality is going to be low.

1370
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Yeah.

1371
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
So over three.

1372
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
So yeah over three hours means good.

1373
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Yes.

1374
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Yeah.

1375
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
We got to start doing these way longer.

1376
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
So yeah I mean that's it for now.

1377
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
I think so.

1378
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
I think you survived podcast the ride.

1379
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Should we retire the term you survived in this scary.

1380
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
That is actually really grim now that you say it.

1381
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Yeah let's put that away for maybe a little while.

1382
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:43,000
We need a new catchphrase.

1383
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
You you you listened to podcast.

1384
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,000
That doesn't seem like it has as much fun in it but it is true.

1385
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:56,000
No you you endured podcast.

1386
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
I don't.

1387
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Yes.

1388
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Put up with podcast the ride.

1389
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
You put up with a podcast.

1390
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
You put up with podcasts the ride a sequester showed.

1391
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
And thank you for for putting up with us.

1392
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,000
You know it's going to be you know it's going to be different.

1393
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Mr.

1394
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Joe quote it's going to be different from now on.

1395
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
But you know will the show be worse.

1396
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Yes.

1397
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Yes it'll be worse.

1398
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Sadly it will be worse.

1399
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Keep in mind all shows will be worse and in some cases not happening at all.

1400
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,000
So so is it better than a show that isn't happening.

1401
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
I think so.

1402
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I for one am looking forward to like the podcast final four final four when

1403
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:46,000
everyone does a bracket of all of the different podcast final fours.

1404
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Oh yes.

1405
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Each other.

1406
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Yeah because there are yes because this this conceit that we do is also

1407
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,000
something that all the other podcast and podcast were friends with like dough

1408
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,000
boys and blank check.

1409
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Yeah I think it's time for all of the final four.

1410
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000
To compete.

1411
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:06,000
And again then there is no you're going to listen to that episode.

1412
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Our final four in a world where there is no real final four.

1413
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,000
So forgive us when we aren't mentioning constantly that this is a parody of

1414
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
something that doesn't exist.

1415
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Yes.

1416
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Yes.

1417
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Cut us some slack.

1418
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:23,000
There will be again we said there'll be episodes where everything seems fine

1419
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
and those are old but still fun.

1420
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
We had no idea that they were time capsules.

1421
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:36,000
It was just a slice of life of what it was like in you know circa February 12th.

1422
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Yeah.

1423
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,000
So yeah there's going to be some whiplash but you know you're all used to it

1424
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
from going on all these rides.

1425
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Yeah.

1426
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Whiplash.

1427
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
You stick their necks hurt.

1428
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Yes.

1429
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
That's my point.

1430
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
So it's really we won't get for a little while.

1431
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:59,000
So just listen instead listen to this podcast and shake your head around it's

1432
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
fun.

1433
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Really Wayne's world it because that's how much this podcast rocks.

1434
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
I had fun.

1435
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:13,000
This is I'm going to say this is some of the most fun I've had during the

1436
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,000
quarantine but the bar is extremely low.

1437
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:22,000
I think it's like this and like making jokes on Twitch.

1438
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
