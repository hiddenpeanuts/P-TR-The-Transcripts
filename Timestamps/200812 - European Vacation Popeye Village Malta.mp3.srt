00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
Biraz Â¡Hola!

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:29,120
Welcome

3
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:37,560
to the first podcast the ride European vacation second gate day trip side excursion.

4
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,520
That's a PTR EVSG DTSE.

5
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,880
I'm Scott Gardner and look who's along for the ride.

6
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,560
We didn't lose him back in Italy.

7
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,120
Mike Carlson is still here.

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,120
I am here.

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,120
I'm loving Europe.

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,600
I'm living it up.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,320
I'm finding myself.

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,960
Yeah, well that's exploring.

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,280
I'm exploring.

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,160
That's where we last left you.

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,800
And yeah, I mean, it's been it's been wilder.

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,680
It's been it's been body or I mean, ever since that, I mean, we're looking at you on the

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,600
on the zoom and I don't know what's going on below the desk, but you are shirtless though.

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
I am shirtless.

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,120
I am but I have very thick pants on.

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,120
I will say that.

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,420
Oh, extra thick pants, but no shirt.

22
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,840
Just in case any European insects you aren't aware of where to start trying to eat through

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,880
your pants.

24
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,720
Properties, deadly European insects.

25
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,560
Yeah, I don't want them down there.

26
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:38,360
Yeah, to be suddenly exposed is you're a little you're you're above the waist looser now.

27
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,920
But yeah, but I do invite the European insects to feast on my upper half.

28
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,640
I am excited about that.

29
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
It's an open buffet.

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,240
Well, that's pretty that's pretty welcome.

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,320
That's the opposite of germophobia, I'd have to say.

32
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,040
Hey, how's Europe treating old Jason shared?

33
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:02,640
Good. I am wearing a large, oversized, old fashioned bathing suit.

34
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,920
It looks like a like a wet suit.

35
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,880
It's got white and blue stripes on it.

36
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:15,040
And of course, a Greek fisherman's cap to go along with the many of the denizens of

37
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,560
today's destination.

38
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,800
Oh, the denizens of Sweet Haven, you mean?

39
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,560
That's right.

40
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,960
Oh, sweet haven.

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,680
God must love you.

42
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:35,560
I'm so glad we all know the iconic, the very singable songs from 1980s pop.

43
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,680
Other than maybe like Islands of Adventure, Jason, is there a place you'd rather live

44
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,760
than Sweet Haven?

45
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,080
I you know, I maybe not.

46
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,440
I mean, this is all very new to me.

47
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,640
This one I kind of like knew as like an oddly enough fact, but I hadn't really dug

48
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,560
into the tourist, the Malta Tourism Board and the official website until the other

49
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,880
day. And I'm I'm pretty charmed by this place.

50
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,080
Yeah, me too. This seems this seems good.

51
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,560
I'll say right off the bat, we're sort of weighing, well, would we actually go to

52
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,640
these places or not?

53
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,600
And this one, absolutely, because the rest of Malta seems lovely.

54
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,160
And then you add this weird decaying film set to it.

55
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,960
Hell, yes.

56
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:32,480
Yeah, films that they paint it too, because in the movie it is very brown and now it is

57
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,160
pretty brightly colored.

58
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:42,720
This is what what I read about it is that it was shabby on purpose from Robert Altman's

59
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,400
direction because the costumes are so bright and cartoony and, you know, like olive oil is

60
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,800
primary color red.

61
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,480
So to make those pop, the town was supposed to be kind of dull, which made me think that's

62
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,840
sort of odd then to have a theme park that was directed to be dull.

63
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,000
But I guess so they have you're saying that they have brightened up the colors of

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Sweet Haven.

65
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:11,480
Yes. And I guess we should say that what we are talking about is officially called

66
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,680
Popeye Village in the tiny little nation of Malta.

67
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,160
Mm hmm.

68
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,080
Which I knew almost nothing about.

69
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,680
I in my head it was part of Italy, but that's not true.

70
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,480
It's a little bit off the coast.

71
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,920
You know, if you look at it on a map, it looks like a little like speck of mud getting

72
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,160
flicked off of the old Italy boot.

73
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,080
Yeah. Yeah.

74
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,200
I had no knowledge of this.

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,520
I don't know. Do we completely say this is the set, the remaining set from the movie

76
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,160
Popeye that was made in 1979, came out in 1980?

77
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,440
Yeah. So it's like as if it's as if, you know, think of a famous movie.

78
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,760
They left everything up.

79
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,960
Star Wars, Star Wars.

80
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,640
Standing some sets left in the deserts of Tunisia, I believe.

81
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
Is that something like that?

82
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,040
Yeah. So like Luke's home became a theme park destination, essentially.

83
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,720
Yeah. Then think about that.

84
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,080
It didn't. It's probably some sort of destination.

85
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,320
But if it had, it's not quite as lovely as Malta out there in that desert.

86
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,680
Are there other examples of this where they left up a little town?

87
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:31,040
I want to say that the old west in Back to the Future 3 was left up, but then was

88
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,600
weirdly destroyed in a fire at some point as the real courthouse square at Universal

89
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,880
has been several times.

90
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,280
It's just cursed. It's a cursed layout.

91
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,640
It's a cursed like a town square overhead, I guess.

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,680
The big answer to your question would be, I don't know how much it is standing, but

93
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,000
in terms of tourism destinations, the Lord of the Rings stuff in New Zealand.

94
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,120
Oh, big, big tourism.

95
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,760
Spot. OK.

96
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,600
And these are kind of equally beloved properties.

97
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,400
Popular movies just about made the same amount of money with inflation.

98
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,760
Sure. Counting for inflation.

99
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,880
I the Popeye movie.

100
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,360
And again, just to fill in some background for the listeners starring

101
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,040
Robin Williams, very huge at the time.

102
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,480
Robin Williams. 1980.

103
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,720
Shelley Duvall is Robin Williams is Popeye.

104
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,280
Shelley Duvall is olive oil.

105
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,360
Robert Altman has made Nashville Mash the long goodbye.

106
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,080
And then he makes Popeye.

107
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,680
And it is cope.

108
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,040
It is like produced in conjunction.

109
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,080
Walt Disney Pictures and Paramount.

110
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,440
So this is a Robert Evans overseeing this production and co-directed

111
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,120
the backup director of this movie was cocaine.

112
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,800
And you can just just kind of feel it in the pratfalls and some of the

113
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,400
performance choices.

114
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,200
Um, that is correct.

115
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,080
It, you know, I'm no expert on any of these people, but

116
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,520
Robert Altman, I believe, was a pretty big drug user at the time.

117
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,280
Robin Williams were certainly aware of his his use of substances.

118
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,920
The music was done by Harry Nilsson and on most sets, especially

119
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,360
Harry Nilsson, famously, like also gregarious, hard drug, hard drinking

120
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,400
musician, one of my favorites ever.

121
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,280
Now, why would the musician be a problem?

122
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,360
Well, because in this case, they flew him out and he made music

123
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,280
on the set and they did little concerts every night.

124
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,920
They'd watch dailies every night and do concerts every night.

125
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,040
And just everyone got hammered for both of these things.

126
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,080
Um, and I'm forgetting one.

127
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,680
Oh, oh, Robert Evans, who was pretty hardcore

128
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,040
busted for cocaine in the fallout from this, like during the post

129
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,920
production of this movie, which kind of triggered a big collapse

130
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,880
of his career, although he sort of got it back together and was, you know,

131
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,480
a producer and kind of a funny oddity up until his death.

132
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,400
But yeah, it really the cocaine blew up for him not long after this movie.

133
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah, cocaine everywhere.

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,840
I am not look, believe it or not, I'm not a big drug user.

135
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,360
Maybe Europe will open that up for me.

136
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,200
But I will say the parties that they seem to have every night seem awesome.

137
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,560
Yeah, man.

138
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,800
I mean, think about the people who are there.

139
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,040
I mean, yeah, I think, you know, Mike and I, I think we both dig Nielsen a lot.

140
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,960
And then there's all these other like his Van Dyke Parks is there, you know,

141
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,320
what, like the Beach Boys collaborator.

142
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,200
This guy, Klaus Vorman was around, who was his drummer, who also did the artwork

143
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,440
for the revolver album cover.

144
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,800
There's like the coolest musicians in the world and Robin Williams.

145
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,400
Free. This is his first movie.

146
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,440
So he's you know, that's prime cool Robin Williams.

147
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,720
All the everyone around is awesome.

148
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,360
A beautiful part of the world.

149
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,040
Yes. Although I think it rained all the time.

150
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,000
It was like super rainy and like the the sea level rose,

151
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,680
which caused them to have to build.

152
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,280
OK. Oh, not as ideal.

153
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,080
But still, there's got to be some rain sounds good living in Los Angeles.

154
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,000
And let's not forget a party animal and Robert Altman,

155
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,320
a regular collaborator, character actor Paul Dooley.

156
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,480
Paul Dooley is hanging out.

157
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,080
He's playing Jay Wellington Wimpy.

158
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,320
And this is a thing I always forget about.

159
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,360
Paul Dooley is the voice of Sarge, the military jeep in the Cars movies.

160
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,520
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Wow.

161
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,480
He's one. He's very one of those guys.

162
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,320
He's in the Christopher Guest movies like I think I didn't even realize

163
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,720
that was him because he's younger than a lot of what I've seen him in in Popeye

164
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,680
in his role as just don't don't ever not say the full name, Jason.

165
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,240
Give it to me one more time.

166
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,320
Jay Wellington Wimpy, who, of course, will gladly pay you Tuesday

167
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,280
for a hamburger today.

168
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,320
Your favorite character in fiction.

169
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,240
I you know, it's kind of neck and neck with sluggo.

170
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,840
I would love to take on any either either role.

171
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,720
I've aged out of sweepy.

172
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,400
So don't sell yourself short.

173
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,920
I've admitted that I've come around to that.

174
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,800
But maybe the aging Irishman, the aging technology.

175
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,680
Oh, well, I'd love to play like you tween sweepy.

176
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,560
Yeah, tween sweepy.

177
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,480
Oh, in the sort of Riverdale.

178
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,560
Yes, in our date. Yeah.

179
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,240
Sweet Havens. Sweet Havens.

180
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,000
Serious weekly Popeye reboot in which Jason plays multiple characters.

181
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,320
Why the fuck not?

182
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,200
You just that's everything we're in.

183
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,240
We're in the slop.

184
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,440
We may as well roll around more in it. Oh, yeah.

185
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,960
I mean, yeah, look, it's it's coming.

186
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,040
It's just a matter of do we do it or not? Yeah.

187
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,280
And I say we hey, let me hang out and do coke on the set.

188
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,600
That's all I want to do. I don't need to be part of it.

189
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,160
This is Jason's show and I don't want to get in the way. Oh, sure.

190
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,320
Well, first things first, we got to find a micro nation in Europe.

191
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,520
We have to spend seven months building a town.

192
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,280
Dear God, this is the most complicated thing ever.

193
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,480
Did you guys catch why this is this was shot in Malta?

194
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,160
I didn't see it. Not, but I was wondering.

195
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:54,560
I think that the deal is that once Robin Williams came on board.

196
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,120
And by the way, this this the idea of making a live action Popeye

197
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,800
I think it first grew out of that Robert Evans lost the rights to produce Annie,

198
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,400
which became the 1982 Carol Burnett Annie.

199
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,560
He didn't get to make that.

200
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,360
So he had a big meeting. It was like, what other comics?

201
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,000
I want to make a comic. I want to fuck them.

202
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,080
Fuck those any people. I'm getting a comic movie out.

203
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,920
Somebody suggested Popeye. What's that?

204
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,360
I was trying to do the voice.

205
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,000
Fuck them. Oh, that's Robert Evans.

206
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,480
Voice is one of my favorites to do.

207
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,920
Pat Oswald does it and Bob Odenkirk does it and Michael McKeon does it.

208
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,160
But it's like one of the most fun, one of those fun voices.

209
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,200
This is you. The guy was scared.

210
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,680
You bet your ass I wasn't.

211
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,000
Like it is is is the did he sound like that before?

212
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,120
Or is that super nasal thing due to the cocaine?

213
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,120
OK, and a dray to probe.

214
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,600
He he is he's a guy who and we cannot have this turn into an

215
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,280
an Evans episode because I'd love to.

216
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,760
But he is a guy, I think, always like he loved the old 40s movie.

217
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,880
So he's always kind of talked like this, I think.

218
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,080
So when you watch it, he's like, I'm Robert Evans.

219
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,320
And he still has a little nails a thing going on because he wasn't so crazy

220
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,240
with the cocaine.

221
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,200
But then when he's narrating his book on tape, the kid stays in the picture.

222
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,120
It is full on like his nose is collapsed.

223
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,800
Like there is like you can't he's not getting anything out through the nose.

224
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,520
It's not exactly like this.

225
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,920
And this is how he's talking.

226
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,440
And you're like, he's not breathing.

227
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,960
There's no air going through his nose when he's talking.

228
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,760
I'm just a pure anecdote machine.

229
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,320
I do this 24 7 and if I stop, I die.

230
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,000
And Jason and I met him like seven years ago.

231
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,640
Yes, we have a.

232
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,440
What? Yeah, we have a photo with him.

233
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,880
I guess he put out a follow up book and we went to they were having a signing

234
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,400
at Roman's this big bookstore in Pasadena.

235
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,120
And at the end, like he he was like signing autographs.

236
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,920
Well, well, well, they said they first of all, we went there.

237
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,080
And my first thought while hearing him speak is, oh my God, this man is about to die.

238
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,680
He's going to die tomorrow, like tomorrow he'll be dead

239
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,000
because he was just like kind of way going and out.

240
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,760
And then all of a sudden he would be like, I talked to I talked to Fred

241
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,200
Zafor a couple of and I told him, Fred, this is a great movie in there with you.

242
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,960
What are you doing?

243
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,560
What are you doing?

244
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,160
Wasting your time with the kitchen with your spaghetti.

245
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,880
Like you would go into one of his like anecdotes from the book, which is that

246
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,520
anecdote from the book for real.

247
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,120
And then he would kind of drift off and forget what the question was.

248
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,680
And they told like they told us no photos.

249
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,520
He's already signed the books.

250
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,600
Do not come up after the to him after this.

251
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,680
Yes. How did you then?

252
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,400
Well, everybody well, everyone bum rust.

253
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Everyone bum rust.

254
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,720
Roman's one of the best places to do a book signing.

255
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,400
They're so organized and stuff, but so many people just went around

256
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,560
the other side of the table and stood next to him.

257
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,320
And we were like, we were early in the line and we're like, well,

258
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,400
everyone else did it.

259
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,400
So and I I said one of the weirdest, dumbest things I've ever said,

260
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,360
the most embarrassing things I've ever said to like a famous person that I was meeting.

261
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,600
And I said, Hi, Mr.

262
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,840
Evans, I'm a young actor.

263
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,720
Huh? Why did that come out of my mouth?

264
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,680
I knew he wasn't making movies.

265
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,320
I didn't think he was going to put me in a movie.

266
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,080
That's not some delusion I had.

267
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,800
Yeah, right. I said that.

268
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,520
Yeah, right. Show me some ID.

269
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,720
And I gave him a setup for the best Robert Evans line he ever could have given.

270
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,440
He goes, Well, I'm an old actor.

271
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,080
And I was like, wow, he did it.

272
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,440
He did like a line off of my line.

273
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,480
Oh, the other notable person there in attendance, he's Butler.

274
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,400
Yes, very old man.

275
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,800
But I like a spry young chicken.

276
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,040
He's so energetic.

277
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,480
And he's in that video that they that somebody made of Evans's house, his famous house,

278
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,000
which I'm forgetting the name of it.

279
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,600
It's got like some fancy name.

280
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,120
And it's the house that you ask.

281
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,760
It's like why it's like Wildwood or something.

282
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,920
Yeah, it's not that.

283
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,120
But Jack Nicholson famously had to go and beg the person who bought that house when Evans lost it.

284
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,320
He lost it because he was out of money and he had to like, I don't know,

285
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,400
it gave up the bank, took it, and then somebody bought it.

286
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,360
And Jack Nicholson, because he's such good friends with Evans,

287
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,880
had to go and beg this man to sell the house back to Robert Evans.

288
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,080
And he did. So Nicholson got Robert Evans's house back.

289
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,440
Anyway, it can't be a Robert Evans episode.

290
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:36,760
I can't. I've got a story that's very similar to that, that I just found that involves

291
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,480
Evans and groveling and using celebrities to grovel.

292
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,840
Or maybe I can head back into it from what we're saying that he.

293
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,160
Oh, he wanted to make a comic movie.

294
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,240
He ends it up on Popeye.

295
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,680
Every it's weird that Robert Altman ended up doing it because they talked to the other directors.

296
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,880
It was all always going to be like great on tour.

297
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,080
Hal Ashby.

298
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,520
Why am I forgetting the other one?

299
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,040
Like the only people it was like the greatest of the greats.

300
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,800
Dustin Hoffman was in consideration for a while.

301
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,600
They want to build a Radner to play Olive Oil.

302
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:18,240
But her manager, Bernie Brillstein, said under no circumstances should you go to an island

303
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,600
with Robert Evans and Robert Altman.

304
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,840
Good advice.

305
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,440
Even though she didn't she never really got that great of a movie career.

306
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,480
And he even was like, it's good money and it's a good boost.

307
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,560
But for your safety, you should pass on this film.

308
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,560
Probably is our move.

309
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,600
They ended up with Robin Williams, but that caused them to have to shoot

310
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,680
in the winter due to Mork and Mindy's schedule.

311
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,680
So now, you know, this probably would have been shot in New England if the summer was an option.

312
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,200
But now they had to find somewhere where it is sunny during the winter,

313
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,000
which is where they ended up with Malta.

314
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,360
It's possibly that, but also possibly that

315
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,480
both Altman and Evans wanted to get away from the studio and be in a remote place

316
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,240
where probably they couldn't get bothered and where they could do whatever they want,

317
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,320
including lots and lots of cocaine.

318
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,800
There's several crazy stories about getting the cocaine around to the island,

319
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,400
one of which, and just to credit him, I'm pulling a little bit of info

320
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,320
from a medium article by Alex Papadimas, a Grantland writer

321
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,040
who wrote a great thing about if you want to learn more about Popeye Village.

322
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,040
But he he quotes a crew member, David Levy, who recalls smuggling

323
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,240
pharmaceutical contraband through Maltese customs inside

324
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,520
human sized dummies.

325
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,880
They pretended, well, obviously, this film is going to, you know,

326
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,120
it's it's a seaside thing is going to be lots of bodies falling out of ships.

327
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,600
You see, there'll be so many cannonballs going off.

328
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,680
Twenty dummies will net another dummy shipment.

329
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,000
So we need 200 dummies,

330
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,000
200 dummies filled with cocaine,

331
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,280
200 Popeye's full crew, Popeye's whole ship crew.

332
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,760
The question is, did they still insert the cocaine

333
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,440
via the butthole?

334
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,560
Was it still is it still a cavity situation?

335
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,880
I insist on it.

336
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,680
It's a tradition. It wouldn't feel right.

337
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,920
Should the dummies

338
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,320
That's too I'm too excited.

339
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,560
I'm too excited to do the voice.

340
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,160
Should the cocaine go in the butthole?

341
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,080
You bet it should.

342
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,280
Do I wish the dummies still said ouch when you were pulling it out?

343
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,520
You bet I do.

344
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,800
You can't have it all.

345
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,000
But the other story.

346
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,840
Oh, sorry.

347
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,440
You know, I have to import multiple glass water bottles of

348
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,360
Playboy Mansion grotto water to preserve myself.

349
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,880
Since that's since I sleep in a water coffin

350
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,680
filled of the grotto water, you bet your ass I did.

351
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,040
The only thing that works.

352
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,560
My skin will completely decompose otherwise.

353
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,800
So much fun.

354
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,800
Yeah, yeah.

355
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,600
So one more Evans thing similar to this bizarre Nicholson.

356
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,200
I guess, boy, this guy will not only pull in a name,

357
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,880
he'll pull in a name for the most pathetic reasons.

358
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,640
I'm a little confused by this story, but I think what happened is

359
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,520
he packed two big steamer trunks with all of his belongings

360
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,680
and in those belongings, lots and lots of cocaine.

361
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,560
Then his luggage failed to arrive in Malta.

362
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,840
By then, as Jason sort of alluded to, they had to get in real close

363
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,240
with the Maltese government.

364
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,000
And he's, you know, he's he's got a good relationship now with the prime minister.

365
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,920
And in order to get this luggage back and to make sure that some rando

366
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,520
doesn't find it and all the cocaine inside, he goes to the prime minister

367
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,720
and he says, you must conduct an exhaustive search for my bags.

368
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,600
Well, I can't do that.

369
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,600
I can't drop everything and make all my people find your bags.

370
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,240
And he says, but you must, because in the bags

371
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:10,920
is a letter to you, the prime minister from my dear friend Henry Kissinger.

372
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:18,480
Oh, and that is he is look, he talks about him in his book so much.

373
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,440
Oh, OK. Oh, so the Kissinger thing is a big it's a big thing.

374
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,120
It's a big thing.

375
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,600
He makes him come to the Godfather premiere.

376
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,920
Yes. And what is my one of my I don't I don't know how to explain.

377
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,480
He calls it Dr Kissinger, Dr Henry Kissinger.

378
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,520
He's seeing with the hard Kissinger kissing her.

379
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,720
Yeah, it's like he's he's in a he's in like a meeting.

380
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,880
Like it's like it's like Robert, I can't come to the Godfather premiere.

381
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,720
He's like, I need you there. I need you there.

382
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,000
I need you there. Will it be the same without you, Dr Kissinger?

383
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,240
You bet it won't.

384
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,360
Um, so then so this worked and like, OK, well, I must receive

385
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,240
these bags with this letter,

386
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,440
conduct the search and it was the luggage was recovered the next day.

387
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,560
Here it is, Dr. Mr. Evans.

388
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,240
He was able to get the cocaine out with anyone noticing.

389
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,120
And then he immediately got on a plane back to the US

390
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,480
so he could go talk to Kissinger and get him to write a letter with the wrong date.

391
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,120
He could pretend there was always a letter in there to the prime minister.

392
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,200
I you know, this kind of fits in good with the

393
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,920
Maltese prime minister story.

394
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,480
I read a profile, I think it was a screenwriter a few years ago,

395
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,400
and he had a deal with Paramount and he went to go look at his office.

396
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,600
You know, he had an office and he was on the lot

397
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,080
and he walked down the hall and he saw an office door that said Robert Evans on it.

398
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,520
And the guy is like producer or executive.

399
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,280
He was working with he was like, hey, does Evans still produce?

400
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,640
Like, that's pretty could we get him on there?

401
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,600
And they're like, oh, no, no, Evans.

402
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,440
Evans is on on like kind of a holding a courtesy contract.

403
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,440
He doesn't produce anymore.

404
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,520
But, you know, the thing about Robert Evans is he can keep a secret.

405
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,680
There's a there's a line item there.

406
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,000
It was apparently a line item or an under the table item of like,

407
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,360
well, we got to keep Evans on staff because he knows too much.

408
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,640
I know where the bodies are buried. Yeah.

409
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,960
Yeah. Will I will I say where they're buried?

410
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,240
You bet I will.

411
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:36,720
You know, not only OK, so on the island of Malta, all of these crazy characters,

412
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,720
Robert Williams, Aldman, Evans, Nielsen.

413
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,680
I'm going to add one more to the list.

414
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,880
I can't believe I didn't put this together sooner.

415
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,480
So in order for all of this to happen,

416
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,720
everything from the hiring of Altman to the casting of Robin Williams to

417
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,800
we're going to build an entire village in Malta, and it's going to take seven months.

418
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,600
The person who ultimately had to sign off on all this

419
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,320
is the person above Robert Evans, who I think at this time was

420
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,120
the head of production at Paramount.

421
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,920
This was he wasn't his own producer.

422
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:16,160
He was like doing this as part of Paramount and the CEO of Paramount

423
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,480
at the time, one Mr. Michael Eisner.

424
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,880
So, so therefore,

425
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,520
you know, everything it's this is in the kid stays in the picture

426
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,040
that he brings up, hey, what about that kid from Mork and Mindy?

427
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,000
And Eisner says he's great.

428
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,120
But do you think he can carry a film?

429
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,720
Strangely,

430
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,440
Robert Evans' response is this is after Dustin Hoffman had dropped out.

431
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,760
All right. So Eisner, do you think he can carry a film?

432
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,120
Who can? All I know is he is Popeye, not a Jewish Popeye.

433
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,760
What? What?

434
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,040
Yeah, I don't know.

435
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,680
He was like still there.

436
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,680
That was his way of excusing, like, well, said to lose Hoffman,

437
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,880
but at least it's not a Jewish.

438
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,400
What a weird thing to be hung up on and then put in your book.

439
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,200
He essentially says the same thing about Gilda Radner, too.

440
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,360
Like, well, at least this olive oil won't be kosher.

441
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,880
What? I think he's Jewish, too.

442
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,720
So maybe he considers that part of the hour all messed around.

443
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,520
But still, like, why?

444
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah, I guess you're not that far.

445
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,720
Because I feel like when he talks about the Godfather,

446
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,760
other people of that time talk about the Godfather, like all these

447
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,920
goddamn Italians making a movie, I can't wrap my head around it.

448
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,240
Like, so it's like, what's next?

449
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,680
The Irish making a movie? I don't know.

450
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,520
I tell you, he constantly his jokes about Francis Ford Coppola,

451
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,200
who he did not get along with, is all about him being in the kitchen

452
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,160
making spaghetti.

453
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,640
That's just that's like his go to.

454
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,480
I believe it's that I believe Evans claims that they delivered

455
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,480
like a 90 minute cut of the Godfather that was bad.

456
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,200
And he goes, what happened, Francis?

457
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,320
You've made a great film.

458
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,440
Where is it in the kitchen with your spaghetti?

459
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,520
Could barely see the celluloid.

460
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,960
There was so much spaghetti stuffed all over the film.

461
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,520
And I think Francis Ford Coppola has a much different account.

462
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,560
He is a page of the script soaked in sauce.

463
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,040
Yeah. So in his account, there wasn't perpetual marinara

464
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,440
just pouring out of his beard. Right.

465
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,520
Or is it a little bit?

466
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,760
Why does he why does he make Coppola sound like a garbage pail kid

467
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,280
just covered in spaghetti and marinara?

468
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,360
He yeah.

469
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,280
Spilled everywhere.

470
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,000
Sometimes he'd slip it.

471
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,680
He'd spend 15 minutes just trying to get up and then flopping right back down.

472
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,480
Do you want a hand, Francis?

473
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,960
No, no, no. He'd say he was too proud.

474
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,680
It's crazy. I think Pat and Oswald's

475
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,280
Pat and Oswald talking about the book on tape is like it's Lucifer

476
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,440
dictating his memoirs.

477
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,760
Yeah. With a martini on his belly.

478
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,760
Well, which relatedly, because I did.

479
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,280
I searched in the book for mentions of Eisner.

480
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,520
And the last one in the book is that in the 90s,

481
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,800
he got a call or a memo from Disney

482
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,320
that was specifically at Eisner's request, apparently.

483
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,520
It was to see if he would be interested in voicing Hades in Hercules.

484
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,760
Whoa. I forgot that.

485
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,640
Or wow. Really?

486
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,480
He's come up many times on the show.

487
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,000
If you don't remember, that's the character voiced by our favorite actor

488
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,640
of all time, James Woods.

489
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,720
Well, now, OK.

490
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,200
I guess I shouldn't assume, but I don't know.

491
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,600
We love the guy.

492
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,800
I love him.

493
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,400
I don't follow.

494
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,360
I don't follow actor gossip much nowadays.

495
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,200
I don't know what's going on.

496
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,400
Their personal life is for them.

497
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,560
And I don't I don't look into it.

498
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,040
It's none of my business.

499
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,120
But, you know, James Woods did play it in this very like slick

500
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,560
talking agent kind of way.

501
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,400
So I think maybe in the back, they were sort of thinking

502
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,440
maybe it's sort of a Robert, Robert Evans type.

503
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,600
And why didn't he do it?

504
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,080
Did they realize he'd be bad?

505
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,360
Maybe they thought to be like the villain of the film who has to carry it.

506
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,440
He's not I mean, he was an actor.

507
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,320
He was in the movie The Matador.

508
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,680
Oh, he started as an actor.

509
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,400
Wait, or no, no, the bad.

510
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,360
I may mixing it up.

511
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,560
It's the subtle.

512
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,320
It's the Sun Also Rises.

513
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,880
Yes, the sun. Sorry.

514
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,080
Thanks. The Matador is Frank Sinatra.

515
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,160
Is that right?

516
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,320
Oh, I don't know.

517
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,600
It's a movie that he produced, maybe.

518
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,720
Yeah. But he wanted to be good.

519
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,520
He was an actor to begin with.

520
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:49,120
And then he saw the producer on set who defended him when he had done a bad job

521
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,720
and that the producer yelled, the kid stays in the picture.

522
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:58,720
And that's why what Robert Evans wanted to be a producer and not an actor.

523
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,320
Wow. Wow.

524
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,640
Because that's where the power is.

525
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,440
And then cut to him years later, controlling this little city.

526
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,160
But here's what I'm thinking is that, OK, this this set was built.

527
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,280
And then today it is still a themed experience that you can go to.

528
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:23,160
Doesn't that make this really the first themed experience commissioned by Michael Eisner?

529
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,080
Hmm. Very good point.

530
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,440
Pre dates Disney.

531
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,440
This is like the big this is the demo for what this is him

532
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,800
like starting to put plant flags all over the globe.

533
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,680
This is Eisner territory.

534
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,400
I think you're right. I agree.

535
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,160
Yeah, because I mean, the the construction of this was so intense.

536
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,200
Like we said, it took seven months to build the film set.

537
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,680
They also had to build a breakwater, which is a kind of seawall

538
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:56,400
to keep the raging winter seas at bay and not in Sweet Haven Harbor.

539
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:02,080
And they also had to build an access road to get to the town to get to the set.

540
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,840
There wasn't that. They didn't have that.

541
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,040
They didn't have a road.

542
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,800
They had to build an access road.

543
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,840
So, yeah, it seems foolish to demolish it all.

544
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,080
Give it a fresh coat of paint.

545
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:17,920
Put a couple of bars there, a couple of restaurants and might as well.

546
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,120
Yeah, yeah, there was that was like it was kind of the deal with Malta.

547
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,120
Like, hey, if you if you want to keep this feel free.

548
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,880
One more thing stemming from all this, I think.

549
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,560
So what ended up happening here, as you said, all this crazy.

550
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,400
They have to build road roads now.

551
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,840
They got to build a seawall.

552
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,960
This budget is spiraling out of control.

553
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:42,800
And even though this film was shot in Malta, partially to get away from Michael Eisner,

554
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,920
he did go visit the set at some point.

555
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,760
And this is in the kid stays in the picture.

556
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,400
I'm showing you guys a photo.

557
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,200
This this has to be Eisner on the set in Malta, right?

558
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,320
That looks like a look at it, isn't it?

559
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,960
Look at his messy hair.

560
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,800
Yeah, look at this.

561
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,560
I love it.

562
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,120
Gun this kind of like more hipster.

563
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,160
Devil may care more a lot more hair.

564
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,840
Not as balding at this point.

565
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,600
His clothes. Yeah, his clothes like are actually kind of cool a little bit

566
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,680
versus maybe later when he just looked like, as I said on the episode with about

567
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,720
the ducks, it seemed like he had a hat that was run over by a car.

568
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,080
A little cooler than that.

569
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,800
Yes, a little cooler than that.

570
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,080
He's still he's still got the wild hair that he always has in different ways

571
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,120
in pictures, which is what we like about him versus an eye.

572
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,280
Looks like a cool young actor.

573
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,400
He would still wear this shirt later.

574
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,480
He would just have a dress shirt, a collared shirt under it

575
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:42,360
and a collared shirt over top of the multi shirt.

576
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,000
Do we think he's is he is he a little handsome here?

577
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,800
Can Eisner get it?

578
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,680
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

579
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,880
I think he can for sure get it here.

580
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,560
He's got a cool like he's got a like a real bad boy kind of scowl going on here, too.

581
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,360
Yeah, I'm trying to think of an actor he reminds me of.

582
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,920
There's a little bit of a I don't know.

583
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,880
He did.

584
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,960
Is not so much in the fit, but the style.

585
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:11,360
I feel like Adam Driver would dress like this and be all scruff like that.

586
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,200
Yeah, I dress like this.

587
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,880
He looks like all the the most devil may care

588
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,360
hunks like Adam Driver and Jason Sheridan.

589
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,760
Yeah.

590
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,200
Oh, no, I'm just seeing the text under this picture that the next film,

591
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,240
Shelley Duvall made with Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.

592
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,520
This plot. Oh, that's right.

593
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,920
This poor woman.

594
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,280
I know when I was pulling that for that weird kosher quote,

595
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,560
there's also that he says

596
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,600
I remember it says I lied, telling Eisner that Duvall would be the big screen's

597
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,920
next Lucille Ball.

598
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,120
It was the biggest white lie I ever told.

599
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,520
Wait, why? Why would he?

600
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,160
He's saying Shelley Duvall's bad.

601
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,040
What is this? Yeah.

602
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,120
Why would he say that?

603
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,840
Unless he's covering for himself, having said that and pretending now it's a lie.

604
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,080
That he had no inside info about her.

605
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,960
Right, like he had to sell he had to sell her because he liked her.

606
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,120
Why would he put her in the movie being like her?

607
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,560
And then like once maybe she didn't become as big as Lucille Ball,

608
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,640
he was like, I just just kidding.

609
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,800
I didn't mean it.

610
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:24,600
She does a good olive oil in the movie, but two hours of olive oil is a lot.

611
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,280
Well, two hours of Popeye is a lot.

612
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,880
All of it. All of it is a lot.

613
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,880
I'm curious about your guys opinion about the movie.

614
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,760
Not to drag out Eisner, let me say one more thing.

615
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,440
What happened was they're spending all this money.

616
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,040
He went to the set and was like, oh, my God, this thing is a disaster.

617
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,480
This is spiraling out of control.

618
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,840
I need to get another studio involved to recoup some of these costs.

619
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,240
Hey, it's a family movie.

620
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,520
Maybe I could go talk to those folks over at Disney.

621
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,840
And that is the first that Michael Eisner ever interacted with Disney

622
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,600
or went on the lot. He went and talked to everyone.

623
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,280
Everyone knows all the beloved CEO characters at this point.

624
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,920
Card Walker, of course, and we determined is this silver fox, right?

625
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,600
We talked. Yeah, I decide that.

626
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,040
Get it. We said, yeah, he can get it as well.

627
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,880
Everybody in this group can get Ron Miller, I think, was very handsome.

628
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,720
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

629
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,000
So they agreed and they cofinanced it and it saved the movie.

630
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,960
And then a couple of years later, Ron Miller called Eisner and said,

631
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,720
Hey, would you want to take over as the head of the studio?

632
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,960
And he said, well, I'm pretty happy at Paramount.

633
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,080
I'd want to do more than that.

634
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,600
I'd want to like run everything.

635
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,320
I want to run the theme parks.

636
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,600
And that was what began his tenure.

637
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,840
So Popeye and this place are like a key component

638
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,640
in the tale of the rise of the king.

639
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,000
Wow.

640
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,320
I never thought of it like that to frame his rise, like the rise of the king.

641
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,000
But it's perfect.

642
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,480
Yeah. Yeah. This is this really I mean, this this makes me want to see

643
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,360
like the young Eisner Chronicles. Oh, my God.

644
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,560
As I said, Adam Driver, there's any way to get him on the show.

645
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,560
Maybe it's us producing a full season of television about his life.

646
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,880
Oh, that might get his attention.

647
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,080
If he has to like sign a form saying it's OK.

648
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,680
And then he asks, like, what's the tone of it?

649
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,680
Oh, it's incredibly is like worshipping you.

650
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,200
They're going to hire like a really fuckable actor to play you.

651
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,240
And you're going to go on adventures.

652
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,600
You're going to like surf the seawall in Malta.

653
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,280
You're going to like be putting the set back together yourself,

654
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,680
braving the elements.

655
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,240
I think he'd be on board for that.

656
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,040
I would have to think he'd like, OK, so a very.

657
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,600
You're making me look like the coolest man in the world.

658
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,960
Yeah, I want to make this.

659
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,760
Yeah, this sounds good.

660
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,440
Um, anyway, all this is backstory.

661
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,480
And I'm fine with saying all this because I, you know, as far as I can tell,

662
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,800
there's not that tend to do in this place.

663
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,000
It's mainly more about like the that it exists and the story.

664
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,440
But as we head over head into the village itself,

665
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,480
what do you guys think of this film was fighting the sea

666
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,960
and doing all the coke worth it?

667
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,800
It I, you know, I sort of rewatch it yesterday.

668
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,880
I haven't seen it in a few years, but my opinion on it is like,

669
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,840
it's interesting.

670
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,520
Yeah, it's an interesting.

671
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,600
Yeah. Experiment.

672
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,320
I think I rewatch Jason.

673
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,560
We were talking. Jason loves it, I think.

674
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,600
OK. I I rewatch it.

675
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,680
And I remember like half watching it

676
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,680
a few years ago.

677
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,680
Trying to do to

678
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,280
Marissa Strickland, I were writing a Popeye sketch and we're like,

679
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,480
I wish what to watch that movie.

680
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,840
And we like half watched it and like kind of checked out because it was so weird.

681
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,200
But I watched it last night and paid attention.

682
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,080
And I was kind of surprised how much I liked it.

683
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,440
I mean, there's a lot of character actor weirdos in it.

684
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,320
It takes some very big swings.

685
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,480
Like there's a lot of pratfalls.

686
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,200
I I thought it was interesting that it doesn't get the credit of trying to

687
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:14,200
recreate the comics and the cartoon in live action in the way that

688
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,160
like, oh, Sin City recreated these panels.

689
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,680
Oh, look at that.

690
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,560
Look at look, it's all the Avengers like in this one drawing.

691
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,440
And it's like, well, Popeye movie did the same shit.

692
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,400
And it was a lot weirder and more interesting and in some ways less successful.

693
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,520
But in other ways, like like when Pluto gets beat up at the end

694
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,240
and he swims away and he's yellow, like coward yellow.

695
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,800
I thought like, that's that's really funny.

696
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,960
Like, that's great.

697
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,400
And like they they make you wait for the spinach.

698
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,840
Like the spinach is the equivalent of like Captain America getting Thor's hammer.

699
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:57,040
And I was like, wow, this is really something like the ending

700
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,120
of the movie I thought was pretty fun.

701
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,280
There's some very slow moments.

702
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,200
There's a lot of Robert Altman ensemble weirdos in it, which we're happy to see.

703
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,560
I think the one guy is the guy in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

704
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,040
Is that right? It's Slugworth.

705
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,440
The tax collector.

706
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,960
Oh, yeah, maybe the same actor. Check.

707
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,680
But yeah, I mean, I think it's fun.

708
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,240
I don't think it cracks the top five Robert Altman movies for me.

709
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,720
Yeah. But it's really

710
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,200
it's really odd, but it's no Nashville or Long Goodbye or Mash or anything.

711
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,160
Yeah, I love Nashville.

712
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,120
Yeah. And I feel like I'm supposed to like it.

713
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,160
And I don't I gave it a shot before this.

714
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,800
And yeah, I really drifted.

715
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,360
I definitely drifted the proper national Popeye.

716
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,320
OK, because now I.

717
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,960
Yeah, I don't.

718
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,320
This is interesting.

719
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,000
Oh, that's the weird thing.

720
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,200
It's like it feels like it's like it's like they're talking to no like,

721
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,280
I don't know. It's like.

722
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,800
It's not there.

723
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,080
It's what's going on on the screen is interesting,

724
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,880
but it's like that doesn't feel like it's being directed at anything.

725
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,360
Feels like that weird naturalistic and film from really far away.

726
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,600
And you don't really know where it's going.

727
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:18,040
I mean, look, I love Nilsson very much and that the song He Needs Me.

728
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,840
It was reused in Punch, Drunk, Love, I think is is magic.

729
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,560
That is such a delightful song and a delightful performance from Shelly Duvall.

730
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,240
Then on the flip side, here's where the movie really

731
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,840
what I have a really hard time with is everything is food, food, food.

732
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,640
Everything is chow, chow, chow.

733
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,760
I get to that and like, I don't know where to.

734
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,880
I don't know what file to put this in my brain.

735
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,160
Is this so bad? It's good.

736
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,360
Is it is it?

737
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,720
Is it just good?

738
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,000
And I don't understand.

739
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,680
I don't. It's from one of my favorite musicians.

740
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,280
But why is it just everything is food being said over and over?

741
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,200
The other song, it's like he's large and he's large.

742
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,840
There's so much these weird meandering repetitious songs.

743
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,880
And I can only imagine being a child and watching this film at the time.

744
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,520
Like what this is, what Popeye is.

745
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,360
Yeah, yeah.

746
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:23,000
It feels like it's I mean, it is similar to Dick Tracy, which I watched recently.

747
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,680
But Dick Tracy is still more much more of a movie.

748
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,400
More of a real movie than this.

749
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,200
These are the these are the two these are the auteur

750
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:37,920
comic films that have that were that themed experiences throughout of.

751
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,280
And I can't really think of more on that list.

752
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,840
I think this movie and then Dick Tracy.

753
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,320
I mean, this is going to be disproved by like Superman and Batman.

754
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,400
But these two movies, Dick Tracy and Popeye not being bigger successes,

755
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,520
I think set back comic movies because I would always read for years

756
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,440
like they can't make an X-Men movie.

757
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,960
It just doesn't look right on the screen.

758
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,320
These characters just won't look right.

759
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,960
And I think that there was like the failure of Popeye and Dick Tracy

760
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,280
and specifically them going for the look of the comics

761
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:14,440
made people think and be very insecure, which is why X-Men has like black leather.

762
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,760
And there's no way Wolverine can be in a yellow costume

763
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,520
that won't look right on film.

764
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,120
I remember reading this like a lot.

765
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,600
Oh, sure, sure, sure.

766
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,600
Well, because some of it didn't work out well at all.

767
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:33,400
I mean, they they started filming the movie without his big muscle arms.

768
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,760
Yes, they didn't arrive in time.

769
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,720
So that's why he's in a trench coat for a long time.

770
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,240
And then even then, they like it definitely looked bizarre.

771
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:49,840
Today, however, you know, the arms are have their final resting place

772
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,920
at a pretty cool spot, not not a planet Hollywood,

773
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,520
but rather at the Comedy and Magic Club in Hermosa Beach,

774
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:02,120
the club that Leno would test his monologue that for many years and post

775
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,920
the tonight show, like when he didn't even have to be doing it anymore.

776
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,280
Let me just show you guys a photo of not just the arms,

777
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:15,280
but also our friend Ryan Perez happily sitting under the

778
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,680
this important piece of film prosthetic history.

779
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,320
Wow. So, yeah, you have I've never been to the club.

780
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,920
You saw Mr. Leno one night. I know I did.

781
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,160
The whole Moonbeam City writing staff all went together.

782
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,360
And boy, the moment he came out, like seeing him in person,

783
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I think Tommy Blatch said it was like Frankenstein walking in there.

784
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,240
Whoa. I've never seen Frankenstein in person.

785
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,280
And you're just like staring at his proportions for like, wow, that really is.

786
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,520
His head really is like that.

787
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,080
Wow. But going to the Animal Actors Show.

788
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,480
Well, a real live Leno.

789
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,320
Was he still doing it there before pandemic?

790
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,640
Is he still doing it now during pandemic?

791
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,920
Oh, no.

792
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,400
Well, he or his or did Leno get invited to Chappelle's comedy camp?

793
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,800
You guys seen Chappelle's comedy camp?

794
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,600
I know all about Chappelle's comedy camp.

795
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,200
Yes. Yeah.

796
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,480
It's a weird assortment.

797
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,160
Like, you know, yeah, there is Silverman's there.

798
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,800
Louie is there and Jaleel White is there.

799
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,720
Oh, I miss Jaleel. I miss Jaleel.

800
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,040
Jaleel's saying, I mean, I'm psyched on that.

801
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,840
If you're going to have a comedy camp, you do watch Family Matters

802
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:32,640
and go like he is a truly gifted physical comedian.

803
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,760
I think it's easy to be snarky about Urkel, but he is.

804
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,040
So is Jaleel there testing out new

805
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,680
pratfalls and roller skate hijinks and Chappelle's giving him notes?

806
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,760
I would love to hear how mad he is at Ben Schwartz for getting the Sonic voice.

807
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,920
Oh, that's right.

808
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,080
He was Sonic on both cartoons from the early 90s and a good Sonic.

809
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,600
So why wasn't there a Peter Cullen type campaign that it must be Jaleel?

810
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,000
Good question. I don't know.

811
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,440
But that Jaleel is my Sonic.

812
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,760
Yeah. Yeah. No offense.

813
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,720
I respect for your Sonic. Yeah.

814
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,040
Where were we? The film?

815
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,200
I mean, it looks crazy, which is very,

816
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,600
you know, makes you want to go to this place.

817
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,320
You definitely are like, you can't believe it's real.

818
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,960
It's one of the most ambitious sets ever constructed.

819
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,960
And it's crazy that it's still real.

820
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,920
This is this is bonkers. Yeah. Big swings.

821
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,360
I mean, it's crazy to think that the same guy made this and like

822
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,240
I watched California split not too long ago, which is just

823
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,840
Elliot Gould and George Segal, drunk gamblers,

824
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,720
just kind of going from one big win to the next.

825
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,840
And it is weird that they use the same sort of like he always had a ton of mics

826
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:50,800
going, so you catch snippets of audio like like Jane was like,

827
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,560
you can hear olive oil in the boxing sequence.

828
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:57,600
You can hear her voice in the middle of the crowd.

829
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,920
And it's like, oh, yeah, that's weird,

830
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,760
because he's probably using the same setup from all those other movies.

831
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,760
Yeah. A bunch of overlapping.

832
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,880
People talking much like a Zoom podcast record.

833
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:17,920
You could think of it as being, you know, annoying or fraught with errors,

834
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,280
or you could think that what us and everyone is doing right now is Altman.

835
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,200
Yeah, I like that. Good. Yeah.

836
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,800
Yeah. Give us some credit.

837
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,640
We're always if you hear us talking over each other saying, no, no, no, you go.

838
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,720
It's it's always a tribute to Altman.

839
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,160
Sorry, am I frozen? You guys go.

840
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,080
No, no, no, Mike, you go.

841
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,120
No, no, you're Robert Evans impression.

842
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,880
No, no, no, no, you wait.

843
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,960
No, are you am I?

844
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,520
Yeah. Well, the kids days of the picture.

845
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,880
Am I frozen? You bet I am.

846
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,040
Government vouchers.

847
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,240
So sorry. Are we there?

848
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,920
We said we said all the peripheral stuff.

849
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,080
Can we talk about the about the place?

850
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,320
Popeye Village, the place?

851
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,960
Yes, please. Yeah.

852
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,600
Um, I OK.

853
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,200
Let's see. The set consisted of 19 wooden buildings.

854
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,920
It they had to bring in eight tons of nails.

855
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,720
That's important to know eight tons of nails.

856
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,120
I mean, the whole I guess the article I read said

857
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,720
made a point of saying no indigenous timber on Malta.

858
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,400
So they do import everything from Holland and shingles from Canada.

859
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,880
And there were no roads, as you said.

860
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,240
This is so complicated and it leads you to a place that, you know,

861
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,840
it looks a little cruddy on purpose.

862
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:35,440
That being said, oh, my God, the views of the sea

863
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,920
in this place and the cliff walls, I mean, because part of this,

864
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,480
but it seems like this place is a mix of being a go into Popeye World and hey,

865
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,480
there's a big trampoline down there or going out in a going out in a bikini.

866
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,600
Like it's like part just regular euro beach and then part.

867
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,800
And, you know, basically see the set of an art film.

868
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:01,760
Yeah, it's I was thinking, should it be called like Malta Popeye Sea?

869
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,720
As a name for its theme park.

870
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,040
Good punch up. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

871
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,720
Popeye Sea.

872
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,360
I think that's good.

873
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,040
And then, yeah, it's just like, you know, you can go on the beach

874
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,000
or you can walk through a set.

875
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,080
Well, there's a dance.

876
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,240
A lot of dancing. You're right. I'm sorry.

877
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,760
A lot of dancing.

878
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,640
And maybe I can throw to this this clip, Jason, your zoom background right now

879
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,680
is from the video that all I'll play a second of here.

880
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,480
This this really gives you the vibe pretty well.

881
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,200
Imagine listeners that we are now showing you Popeye and olive oil

882
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,560
as they looked in the film, except that they are not Robin Williams

883
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,840
and Shelley DeVille, but rather two random Italians.

884
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,320
Here we go.

885
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:57,720
And then the shots of nice sights and boats over the with the trolls song.

886
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,400
Waterfalls.

887
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,360
It's messing around.

888
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,880
Let's see, let's see some other dancing here.

889
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,960
You get a dancing Pluto in there.

890
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,120
Pluto, who is just wearing a double XL.

891
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,800
Let's describe the Pluto that we're looking at.

892
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,440
They spent all the money on the Popeye outfit, a little money on olive oil.

893
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,840
And then Pluto is just wearing like a double XL polo shirt and like a pillow.

894
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,560
A pillow shoved in. Yes. Yeah.

895
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,600
The cheapest

896
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,760
fat costume you could ever.

897
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,960
Yeah, the most filthy beard.

898
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,440
It's it's pretty delightful and not a costume you expect to see dancing

899
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,760
to Timberlake.

900
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,800
And then later,

901
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,720
I mean, we could just talk about the freeze frames this year.

902
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,960
Is, you know, they're kind of waving their arms back and forth.

903
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,280
The Pluto and olive oil.

904
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,280
And there's a bunch of like bikini folks and kids,

905
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,040
peach chairs, three, like sloppy flash mob

906
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,360
and like some inflatable stuff bouncing around.

907
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,920
My favorite is when it cuts wide and then there's a bunch of people

908
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,080
doing the Macarena.

909
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:18,240
Well, and the blink, if you miss a character dancing,

910
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,520
there is a dancing poop deck pappy in a couple of shots.

911
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,680
There is. Yes.

912
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:30,840
The Ray Walston old man, the father character played by

913
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:35,080
a 20 year old, who is this poop deck pappy?

914
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,680
This is the life I would love to go here.

915
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,800
No question about it.

916
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,760
Why would I love to be in this flash mob? Yeah.

917
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,760
Oh, and there's one costume character early on.

918
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,440
There's like a bear.

919
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,400
Like there's there's just an unidentified like

920
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,520
bear. Yes, that's correct.

921
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,400
And I have some info about this.

922
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,240
You say bear.

923
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,640
Aaron said dog somehow inscrutably.

924
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:09,440
Everyone is wrong. It is a rabbit, which makes no sense.

925
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,800
It's just isn't right. It's not I'm looking at it.

926
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,200
It's not it's not a rabbit.

927
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:18,440
And I know this because they do a big Easter thing every year.

928
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,320
This is strangely as Easter is big in Tokyo Disney.

929
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,880
So also is it big at all the Popeye's?

930
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:31,080
And this year they had to shut it down, obviously due to COVID-19,

931
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:37,040
which led to this an old wistful post of the bunny and this strange caption.

932
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:41,200
Hashtag happy Easter, hashtag everyone from our very own Ricky,

933
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,280
the hashtag bunny, a very different hashtag Easter.

934
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,680
No, ashtag egg hunts and no hashtag rabbit hopping.

935
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,200
Ricky is hashtag celebrating hashtag alone this year.

936
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,200
There's so there's so many more hashtags I'm getting tired of.

937
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,360
Oh, wait, let me let me say the full sentence.

938
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:00,160
Ricky is celebrating alone this year, but that is what's best.

939
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,880
Hashtag social distancing, hashtag space, safe, hashtag stay home.

940
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,560
We will hashtag hop hashtag next year.

941
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,760
Hashtag do not worry. Hashtag longing for summer.

942
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,520
The masterpiece of a hashtag post.

943
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,320
Who does social media for Popeye Village?

944
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,160
I don't. I'm a genius.

945
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,680
The altman of social media.

946
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,200
Wow. Ricky. Yeah.

947
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:26,720
So that's Ricky the bunny, not Ricky the rabbit.

948
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,000
Ricky the bunny who's not in Popeye, as far as we know.

949
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,320
No, I haven't heard of that one.

950
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,560
Not in the extended universe.

951
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:39,200
Ricky, good news, they rolled the stone back from the cave

952
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,680
and it was empty so you can hang out in there for a little while.

953
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,800
It's cool.

954
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:51,080
The unforgiving Maltese son will dance alone in this hashtag.

955
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,840
Now, does the extended Popeye verse perhaps feature,

956
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,160
I don't know, a dabbing Santa

957
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:05,480
with some with some elves

958
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:09,880
who seem to be getting interested in something else during this dance performance.

959
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,080
They're checking out.

960
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,880
There's one of the articles I read about visiting this place said,

961
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,120
just everyone seems stoned.

962
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:24,000
Like, it's just all these like half committed teenagers who, you know,

963
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,360
they like leave and do more drugs and all have sex with each other.

964
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,280
If they've kept the Altman spirit alive.

965
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,800
Scott, what if I ever tell you that's actually not Santa, it's baby New Year.

966
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,040
Well, you think it much like the bar that you thought that was a dog.

967
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,400
It's a bunny. No, that's baby New Year.

968
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,560
Is that based on something or is that just?

969
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:46,840
I don't know.

970
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,600
It can't be right.

971
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,800
Everything's topsy turvy here and it played Malta pop, I see.

972
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,000
That could have been right.

973
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,960
So as we if that video conveys it,

974
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,840
this is it's a healthy mix of like it seems like

975
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,160
so there's 19 buildings, at least what's in them.

976
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:09,200
It's a lot of it is like museums about the film or when Robin Williams passed away.

977
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,320
There's a little like exhibit paying homage to him.

978
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:16,040
You can go see you can go pay homage to Altman and Evans and Williams,

979
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,720
and then you can go dab and Macarena

980
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,600
with most your clothes off.

981
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,800
Not a ton to do, as you were saying.

982
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,200
It doesn't seem like it.

983
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:31,320
That's why I'm not too concerned about all the time spent at the beginning,

984
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,360
because I'm looking at the.

985
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,040
Like what there is like the Explorer

986
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,520
section, just as I as I jump around,

987
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:45,800
you know, like here's here's parts of the of the attractions.

988
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:50,240
Anchor Square, this platform is re closed for refurbishment at the moment.

989
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,480
Anchorage rest closed at the moment, waiting to be refurbished.

990
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:00,080
The Santa's Toy Town, that's only open half the year.

991
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,080
Olive Oil's house. So cool.

992
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,960
Olive House is being refurbished and being refurbished.

993
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,880
But wait, what if you go during a specific time of the year?

994
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,000
You know, maybe that being maybe Halloween,

995
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,360
maybe they really do it up for Halloween with the with the outfits.

996
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,120
You know, describe.

997
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,520
So what are we seeing here?

998
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,720
Popeye and Olive Oil.

999
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,800
And is that also blue dough?

1000
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,960
I yeah, dress like the strangers.

1001
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,320
Basically, they have like olive oil has like bad zombie makeup on her

1002
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,520
exact same outfit that she wears all the time.

1003
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,320
And she looks drunk.

1004
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,760
And Popeye has some sort of massive, you know,

1005
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:47,480
and she looks drunk and Popeye has some sort of mask on and a cape,

1006
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,280
but his normal outfit on.

1007
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:54,880
It's a sailor hat, but a Jason mask and a vampire cape.

1008
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,520
Yeah, I'm going to go ahead and call that a Dracula cape.

1009
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,320
He have her. I would say that.

1010
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,400
Pluto looks like he's wearing a lab coat.

1011
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,160
The yeah, like buttoned wrong,

1012
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,880
like the third button is attached to the second hole.

1013
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,000
Yeah, it's kind of stumbling over and he's just in like cargo.

1014
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,600
His bottom half looks like Kevin Smith.

1015
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,200
The shorts and shoes, the jorts.

1016
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,280
And they have here, as you see on the package for the Halloween,

1017
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:26,240
they have Popeye's special trick or treats, the dark haunted house,

1018
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,880
meet the monsters that lie in the dark Halloween dance

1019
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,280
and crafts balloon modeling and face painting.

1020
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,920
Moon modeling, I don't know.

1021
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,240
Like you invent a shape of a balloon.

1022
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,560
To have, I guess,

1023
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,360
design your own balloon.

1024
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,000
What about square? Oh, it popped.

1025
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,640
Didn't work out, kid.

1026
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,440
I also have a poll because I, by the way, I spent one night

1027
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,000
just going backwards through their Facebook photos,

1028
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,160
which I encourage the listener to do and find your own treasures,

1029
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,840
which there are many of.

1030
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:07,480
I'm about to show you something truly disturbing.

1031
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:12,080
I'll just hear I'll just get your reaction without explaining it.

1032
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,240
Here is this.

1033
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,040
Yeah.

1034
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:21,200
What this is is for Halloween.

1035
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:25,240
Olive oil is in costume as Bluto.

1036
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:29,880
So olive oil is wearing a plastic Bluto mask.

1037
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:34,800
And that might not sound like the most terrifying thing you've ever seen.

1038
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:40,000
But I assure you, as we stare at it, it is deeply, deeply unsettling.

1039
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,000
There's something about just the plastic.

1040
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,680
I mean, it's like a weird

1041
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,880
cute doll with fake rouge and this like ghostly.

1042
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:52,160
I mean, it's a mask you would wear to rob a bank or to kill somebody.

1043
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,920
It's kind of this is sort of deep in the Divo world

1044
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,080
as a character, I think, called Bougie Boy is like a like

1045
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,960
disgusting, creepy like man baby.

1046
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,760
It kind of looks like the scary Divo man baby.

1047
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,080
I do not like this.

1048
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:14,040
This is I hesitate to show anything right that I find frightening on the show

1049
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:18,280
because I've learned my lesson from Chucko to try to keep my fears in my pocket

1050
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,680
less they less they come back over and over again.

1051
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:21,880
And it's a good point.

1052
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,960
I'll have to.

1053
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,200
Well, I'm sure this will never come back again.

1054
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:30,320
No, this Freudian nightmare will never come back.

1055
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,320
No way this grotesque felt unibrowed

1056
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,960
olive oil will.

1057
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:42,240
Yeah. You know, somehow like get involved with Randy Gerber, some crap.

1058
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,120
No way. There's no chance.

1059
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,400
And like make me dress as pan.

1060
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:50,680
I will reveal here that a friend of mine bought me some taramana tequila.

1061
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,720
Rock tequila for helping him find a toy.

1062
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:57,880
Oh, that's cool.

1063
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,720
Uh huh.

1064
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,680
Uh, I haven't tried it yet.

1065
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,800
I haven't tried it yet. I'm a little I don't want to.

1066
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,560
I don't want to cheat on Randy and George, but I'm going to have to

1067
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,240
because it's sitting in my kitchen.

1068
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,360
Do you like Casamigos?

1069
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,680
Do you think the tequila is good? Never had it after all.

1070
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,520
Fuck this shit.

1071
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:18,960
After all this crap, if Scott fucking crap, well, they bet you should.

1072
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:23,640
So, you know, when in the company of people with a million dollar briefcase,

1073
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,960
I should throw any them in their tequila, but I haven't had it.

1074
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,120
We're striving.

1075
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,640
We're strivers.

1076
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:35,000
You know, every time I think about buying it as a bit, I go fifty five dollars.

1077
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,080
We're on the grind.

1078
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:41,520
God knows how much the single serving bottle I saw in the Vegas

1079
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,880
like hotel gift shop was. I considered it.

1080
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,760
But, oh boy, they'll take you for a ride.

1081
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,040
That's got to be a four hundred dollar trip or something.

1082
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,440
Oh, my God.

1083
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,680
For all this, I never said I tasted it.

1084
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:55,880
I know about that.

1085
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,240
It's about the lifestyle.

1086
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,520
Two guys hitting the road.

1087
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,680
Do they look cool on those motorcycles?

1088
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,680
You bet they do.

1089
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,920
Their casa is our casa.

1090
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,920
Let's sound by that and put it on a soundboard for later.

1091
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,240
Yeah, no more soundboards.

1092
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,960
I bet you're wondering, are there packages for teens at Popeye Village?

1093
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,960
I am. Of course, there are.

1094
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,080
Party with a difference.

1095
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:28,680
A thrilling birthday or confirmation party for the young teens.

1096
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:29,680
Exclamation point.

1097
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,880
Confirmation?

1098
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,560
Like the religious, like the Catholic?

1099
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,120
Have it at Popeye Village.

1100
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:41,400
Are you choosing a third name beyond your middle name that's a saint's name?

1101
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,720
Do it at Popeye.

1102
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,120
Do you want to be named after Saint Popeye?

1103
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:46,840
Saint Popeye.

1104
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,760
Jason's confirmation name is.

1105
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,960
The Asian name is J.

1106
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:53,960
Wellington Wimpy.

1107
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:54,960
J. Wellington Wimpy.

1108
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,120
Jason, can you say a middle name?

1109
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,120
I don't know your middle name.

1110
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,120
Michael.

1111
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,960
Oh, Jason Michael J.

1112
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,440
Wellington Wimpy shirt.

1113
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,880
Yes, that's right.

1114
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,440
Back to this copy.

1115
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:11,000
Have a blast with your family and friends during our team building activities and become

1116
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,160
a movie star during our animation show.

1117
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:18,760
Take two filming when you and your guests will star in a movie on actual film set.

1118
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,920
That singular film set and see themselves on the big screen.

1119
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,440
An actual film set, yes.

1120
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,080
So have the birthday party you will never forget.

1121

Only at Popeye Village Malta includes food, boat ride, team building, take two show with

1122
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,560
free DVD for the birthday girl boy.

1123
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:40,120
Are there now we I think we looked on YouTube for this place a little bit, but is there any?

1124
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:43,480
I don't think anybody posted their team building.

1125
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,400
You know, let me Google.

1126
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,600
Movie DVD.

1127
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,880
Take two filming.

1128
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,160
Well, because this is a thing they offer on the web.

1129
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:53,560
They're like you can shoot like you can.

1130
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:58,440
And they in the montage of the music videos, so the promotional music videos, which they

1131
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,840
have a second one on their YouTube page, it's like flying drone footage.

1132
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:09,160
There are shots of like Popeye holding a camera and they're like they shoot stuff

1133
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,040
throughout the village.

1134
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:13,400
And I think they cut it together at the end of the day and try to sell it to you.

1135
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,600
Like one of those classic.

1136
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,160
It's included in the teen package.

1137
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:18,760
Oh, OK.

1138
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,360
So yeah, so that's included.

1139
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,920
The boat ride is free, though, on the map.

1140
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,160
It's like get on the boat ride free at least every 15 minutes.

1141
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:33,480
Oh, I saw a thing on the website that said this place with free glass of wine.

1142
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:33,960
Wow.

1143
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,720
Free postcard, free glass of wine.

1144
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,440
Yeah.

1145
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:39,240
And and of course, let's not forget.

1146
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,320
Let me see if I can do this screen share.

1147
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:46,360
I just set up the screen share on mine.

1148
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,320
Can you guys see this?

1149
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:47,880
Of course.

1150
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:49,080
Yes.

1151
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:49,720
Oh, yes.

1152
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:50,920
Weddings.

1153
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,240
Weddings at Popeye Village.

1154
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,920
And it's a little olive oil of Popeye getting married.

1155
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:57,480
It's great.

1156
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,120
It's their silhouettes in gold.

1157
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:06,760
And it looks like olive oil is wearing a veil that's curly queuing out in a splendid fashion.

1158
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,160
Wow.

1159
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,040
Who wouldn't want to?

1160
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:11,800
Who wouldn't?

1161
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,520
Yeah, God, you can get.

1162
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:18,280
I mean, these are cool photos.

1163
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:24,360
A picture of like a bride and a bridesmaids and then like a big illuminated love sign.

1164
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,520
Like a very modern looking love sign.

1165
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,880
Yeah, they're very cheap hipstery.

1166
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:34,920
And then but then and then that's in front of a framed photo from the film of olive oil and

1167
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,840
sweet pea sweet pea looking at it.

1168
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:40,200
No olive oil looking out of a pipe and sweet peas and a little.

1169
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:40,760
Oh, yes.

1170
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,800
She's trapped in the pipe for much of the third act.

1171
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,120
You go in here.

1172
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:47,480
We don't want to choreograph you.

1173
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,840
Man, it's it's wonderful.

1174
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:55,960
I actually I have some wedding photos as well because I was starting to feel like.

1175
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:00,680
I mean, Jason, we know your love of this world.

1176
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,920
We know your love, Jay Wellington.

1177
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:07,400
This seems like this place is calling out to be the place where you get married.

1178
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:08,760
I agree.

1179
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:13,080
I mean, I look everyone loves a destination wedding.

1180
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:16,280
It's very convenient and considerate for your friends and loved ones.

1181
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:21,800
And if we and we can all assuming we're invited, I hope so.

1182
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:27,160
But if we, you know, as long as we contact the prime minister early and say that we're

1183
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:31,800
bringing in a letter from Henry Kissinger to him, then we can bring all the cocaine we want.

1184
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:37,880
Yeah, I think we can tell we can talk to whoever that prime minister is and we can

1185
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,520
tell them we do a very popular podcast.

1186
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,120
And I think this thing is on the house.

1187
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,840
Just to get tourism up.

1188
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:50,840
If you go to the Popeye Village website right now, they started taking the OK.

1189
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:54,440
These are labeled as red and blue like vouchers.

1190
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:57,640
And what this is, is the Maltese government has given.

1191
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:03,000
I'm assuming I believe Maltese is the correct term.

1192
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:09,240
The government of Malta has given vouchers to its citizens to use a tourism destinations

1193
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,280
to drive up business.

1194
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:16,440
So essentially like Disney dollars to use on food and entertainment.

1195
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,920
And they're taken at Popeye Village.

1196
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:19,480
Cool.

1197
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:25,320
Which doesn't seem very expensive to begin with, but I don't know the economic situation

1198
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,320
of this tiny little nation.

1199
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,200
Declare it now.

1200
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,600
As soon as quarantine is over, we're going out there.

1201
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,560
Jason's getting married.

1202
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,240
OK, well, I can't make that keep that promise.

1203
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:39,080
Live podcast recorded right before the wedding.

1204
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:39,480
Yep.

1205
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,200
Some during.

1206
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:40,920
It's a write off.

1207
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,600
We'll do all these parks too.

1208
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:43,320
And also.

1209
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:49,880
All right, now record it in the cinema, which is just a 30 inch TV at a dark room showing

1210
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:53,000
like making up behind the scenes footage and clips from the movie.

1211
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:59,720
Do you think we can talk to them and let you get in the wimpy outfit and do some of these dances

1212
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,280
with the other other cast?

1213
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:04,600
I think I just go real.

1214
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,360
I think I just bring my own wimpy outfit.

1215
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,800
It probably looks nicer than theirs.

1216
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,800
They might not have one.

1217
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,240
I haven't seen a photo of one.

1218
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,320
I think he's going to bring his own little bowler hat.

1219
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:19,080
Yeah, I mean, I was also thinking this is the place for your wedding because when I

1220
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:27,240
saw this photo, this is like a this is a rose in a little little mason jar in front of a big

1221
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:32,760
wooden sign that says wimpy and I'd gladly pay you Tuesday for hamburger today and he's in

1222
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,840
front of a big stack of burgers.

1223
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,200
His eyes are half open.

1224
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,120
It's kind of a half asleep wimpy.

1225
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:43,080
Jason, is this the most romantic photo you've ever seen?

1226
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:53,320
Well, since second only to the wimpy's at Islands of Adventure when they started including

1227
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,640
like a milkshake with your combo order.

1228
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:57,880
That's the honeymoon.

1229
01:05:58,760 --> 01:05:59,260
Yeah.

1230
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:03,640
It's a destination multi-pop eye wedding.

1231
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,680
Only to Lagoon though.

1232
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:12,040
This is starting to look like an Indiana Jones movie where the plate like crisscrosses the

1233
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,080
arrow on the map.

1234
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:14,380
Yeah.

1235
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,720
Anywhere wimpy is featured, we have to go to.

1236
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:23,320
The one remaining wimpy's hamburgers chain restaurant that's still standing.

1237
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:24,200
Oh yeah, where is that?

1238
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,680
I don't I'm sure there's still was that big in Britain?

1239
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:29,880
I forget where that was.

1240
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,560
Oh, the full wimpy trip.

1241
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,360
Just here while I'm still screen sharing yours like.

1242
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:40,360
Right and groom kissing in front of like a recreation of the boxing scene with a guy

1243
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:46,680
in a striped old tiny boxing uniform and olive oil going, oh, and then this is this is what

1244
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:47,720
sealed the deal.

1245
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:52,840
If you get married there, your guests can dine on heart shaped hamburgers.

1246
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:54,140
Wow.

1247
01:06:54,840 --> 01:07:00,120
We're looking at a big tray of raw meat shaped into raw patties shaped like hearts.

1248
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,960
Possibly a heart shaped steak tartare.

1249
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,560
Yeah, that is more popular in Europe.

1250
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:08,280
Oh, maybe.

1251
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,800
Yeah, yeah, it looks a little odd.

1252
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:10,600
But then look at this.

1253
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:14,520
You got a bun with the heart burned into it.

1254
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:18,200
One thing I'll say about this place, I think all the food, all the food that I've seen

1255
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:18,840
looks good.

1256
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:24,040
I mean, we just got done with movieland Italy, where it was a bunch of like indiscernible

1257
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,400
fried horse shit.

1258
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,920
Maybe maybe literally.

1259
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:30,520
And then this is these are some good looking burgers and all that.

1260
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:34,200
I think they serve a lot of like good fresh pasta and nice wine.

1261
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,120
And there's somewhere you can go.

1262
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,480
There's a oh, yeah, tipsy and son's winery.

1263
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1264
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:47,800
With a chalkboard sign that where somebody's drawn a jaunty Popeye saying I am what I am

1265
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,320
and I am drunk.

1266
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,640
Jason, I'm gonna have a great time at your wedding.

1267
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:55,800
This is great.

1268
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,920
How close to this can you live?

1269
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,960
How close is the nearest like house?

1270
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,280
You can live on the right.

1271
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:06,920
Right.

1272
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,720
But like how is it like 10 feet from Popeye Village?

1273
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:10,280
Do we know?

1274
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:11,960
That's what they might be.

1275
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,240
They might be leasing.

1276
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:13,720
I don't know.

1277
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:16,360
They might want to fill some of those refurbished spaces.

1278
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:21,560
If you do the refurbished, if you're willing to flip the house while you're there, if

1279
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:29,560
you'll if you'll restore this, the room that you live in to be a fully 1980 quality sweet

1280
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:35,720
peas nursery, then you can live there for just like 100 euro a month.

1281
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:37,560
That's a good deal.

1282
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:41,720
I mean, I, you know, look, I'm not looking to get out of America necessarily, but you

1283
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:44,040
know, it's always something to have in the back of your mind, maybe.

1284
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,840
I think about, you know, maybe around November, I might be thinking about moving.

1285
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:49,640
Sure, possible.

1286
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:50,680
It's possible.

1287
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:51,720
No particular reason.

1288
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:52,840
It's the chill.

1289
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,280
It's just chilly, you know.

1290
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:57,000
Then seasonably.

1291
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:57,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1292
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,880
It sounds like it's going to be better in Malta.

1293
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,080
It'll be better in Malta.

1294
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:01,320
Yeah.

1295
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:06,040
OK, there's still three Wimpy's burgers.

1296
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,880
I don't maybe this is a smaller chain.

1297
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:13,400
There's one, two in Tennessee, one in Missouri.

1298
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,400
I don't know if this is the original Wimpy's.

1299
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,360
It says original Wimpy's, but you know, anyone can just slap that.

1300
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:21,000
Does it have him on it as a logo?

1301
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,720
Not not on the home page.

1302
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:23,960
Hmm.

1303
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,320
Now they're trying to like, you know, hipify it.

1304
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:30,200
So it's like it's called like WB now.

1305
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:35,880
Like they just do the initial of Wimpy's burgers or like the W.

1306
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,360
And Wimpy is hot now.

1307
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,240
It's like a hot guy.

1308
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:43,240
Keto Wimpy.

1309
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,800
What have we not discussed that you can do here?

1310
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:58,200
I saw some article that said there's like a restaurant where you can play cornhole in the

1311
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:02,920
middle. You throw toilet paper rolls into fake toilets.

1312
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:10,600
There's wooden boxes that say game toilet roll toss, and that's just in the middle of a restaurant.

1313
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,960
Man, this is a dream.

1314
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,800
Yeah, I'm dying to toilet toss.

1315
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:22,280
I'm loving the vacation, guys.

1316
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:25,160
We're sort of finding all these wonderful places to live.

1317
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,240
Potentially, we'll move to Malta.

1318
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,200
Jason, can I was wedding there?

1319
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:34,520
But then maybe you end up moving to Missouri to be near the one of the last operating W's.

1320
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:38,520
Yeah, there's a well and then Wimpy is a different.

1321
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,600
I knew that Wimpy is a British fast food franchise.

1322
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,160
I there's there's all sorts of Wimpy food out there.

1323
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,280
There was one in the in the Woodfield Mall, right?

1324
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:53,160
That came up, I think, in our Woodfield Mall.

1325
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:53,960
Wandering.

1326
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:54,460
Yeah.

1327
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:57,960
Walking Wimpy's footsteps.

1328
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:58,600
That's the trip.

1329
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:05,960
All Dooley's home, the Paul, the room that was Paul Dooley was born in.

1330
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,560
There was a newer Popeye movie, right?

1331
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,120
It didn't happen.

1332
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:16,280
It was the it's a revered design.

1333
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:18,120
Was it Jenny Tartakovsky?

1334
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,680
They released like a trailer and it didn't.

1335
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:23,720
Right. They never made that?

1336
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,640
Yeah, I don't know what happened.

1337
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:30,280
Some studio hijinks, but whichever.

1338
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,680
Like everyone was really excited about and I do.

1339
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:33,640
I liked the look of it.

1340
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,320
Yeah, I'm seeing it now.

1341
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,280
Yeah, it does look cool.

1342
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:37,640
He's the guy.

1343
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:41,320
He's the creator of Dexter's Laboratory and Zanray Jack and Primal.

1344
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:41,960
It's on now.

1345
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:43,720
Yeah, I don't know.

1346
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:44,280
I don't know what happened.

1347
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:45,240
Yeah, look cool.

1348
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:45,720
Disappointing.

1349
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:46,280
It didn't happen.

1350
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:51,160
Well, as we learn from a movie world or whatever the hell it's called,

1351
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,240
maybe we just go into production now on Popeye.

1352
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,960
We just say we're doing it.

1353
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,120
Oh, well, wait.

1354
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:01,000
Now I'm seeing maybe look at this headline.

1355
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,600
This is after up our alley.

1356
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:07,560
Popeye movie gets new life as Jenny Tartakovsky teams up with King Features.

1357
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,920
Our favorite thing we say all the time for some reason.

1358
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,560
King Features Syndicate comes up a lot.

1359
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,280
I think it's coming up on Friday this week.

1360
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:20,840
Can someone break down why I like saying King Features Syndicate so much?

1361
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:22,280
I don't really.

1362
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,360
I love saying it.

1363
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,960
It's just so functional and like the idea that it's the whole gang.

1364
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:33,160
It's the you know, because you could say the Disney gang, like the big five.

1365
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:37,800
And here's the you know, the are all the Marvel heroes.

1366
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,280
And here's the King Features Syndicate.

1367
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:44,120
Pals like crown like the Disney.

1368
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:50,280
The Disney Pals were like the Crown Alliance Group, like something very dry.

1369
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,640
That's I guess what that's the fun of it.

1370
01:12:53,640 --> 01:13:00,760
King Features Syndicate, the Crown Alliance Group, United Entertainment Holdings National,

1371
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:08,040
Mickey Minnie Goofy Crown Alliance Group, Crown Alliance Group land.

1372
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,040
Yeah, I guess that's what's fun.

1373
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:11,560
I think we got it.

1374
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:14,120
I think that yeah, but we're still the Mealy Mouthed.

1375
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:17,240
Yeah, we're still going into production on Popeye.

1376
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:19,480
Jason's writing it right now.

1377
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,760
Yeah, yeah.

1378
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:21,880
Yeah, producing.

1379
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:25,480
Yeah, I mean, I'll switch over.

1380
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:28,600
I'm going to get I'm going to knock a draft out of Young Eyes and Chronicles.

1381
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:36,440
I'm still I'm pretty deep into I'm scripting season two of Late Shift,

1382
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:39,640
the full series, and then I'll like let me know.

1383
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:46,120
I'll pop into the room on the on Popeye or made or Sweet Haven as we were calling it.

1384
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:46,360
Yeah.

1385
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:51,560
When do we yeah, when do we parlay the podcast into a production house that takes way too much,

1386
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:52,680
too many projects?

1387
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:57,720
And then you get like annoyed every time you see that like podcast the right is producing this

1388
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:59,080
and you're like they don't have time for that.

1389
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,280
Give it to somebody that you know doesn't have a show.

1390
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,480
That's where we're headed maybe with this podcast.

1391
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:13,560
You mean like a certain voice of a snowman who's attached to approximately 45 projects

1392
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:14,520
in any given day?

1393
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,760
He has the perfect amount of projects.

1394
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:21,240
He's the perfect amount of time to do them.

1395
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:23,960
And I thank him for reuniting these casts.

1396
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:27,000
See, for being a soldier in the reunion battle.

1397
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:33,720
Everyone's going crazy to see the phantom meet Mandrake the Magician yet again.

1398
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,880
All your favorites.

1399
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,720
What are the wait are those who are they?

1400
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:44,440
Those are more that are those King feet.

1401
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,800
The Phantom is the purple in the purple.

1402
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:48,280
Oh, Billy.

1403
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,120
Oh, I see that.

1404
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:50,920
Phantom.

1405
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:56,360
I see Mandrake Mandrake was another like comic strip or pulp character.

1406
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,280
They're like Prince Valiant.

1407
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,280
These are all like the adventure serial.

1408
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,920
Mark trail, you know, Mary Worth.

1409
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:07,640
We are also got a production on all of you got to have a.

1410
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:12,760
Oh, you know, you got to have a it's just called worth.

1411
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:13,960
You know, that's the title.

1412
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:15,160
Yeah, it's called a word trail.

1413
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,400
Trail worth.

1414
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,360
Yeah, and they're both 21.

1415
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,480
Yeah, and they're hot as shit.

1416
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:24,520
They're hot as shit.

1417
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,560
Mark trail is hot.

1418
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:28,840
Is it weird that I'm kind of in the Mary Worth?

1419
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:32,200
I'm in the Mary Worth.

1420
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,440
Florence Pugh, Timothy Chalamet.

1421
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:35,080
Oh, God.

1422
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:35,960
Boom, boom.

1423
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:36,440
Done.

1424
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:36,760
Hit.

1425
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:37,560
Let's print it.

1426
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:37,960
Done.

1427
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,080
Let's get a Broadway World.

1428
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,600
So yeah, Broadway Broadway World will be announcing it.

1429
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,440
These projects will all be coming to view boo.

1430
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:47,720
They'll all be streaming soon.

1431
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:53,320
So be on the lookout from podcast, the ride features syndicate.

1432
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,240
Yes, that's the name.

1433
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:58,440
I'm gasoline.

1434
01:15:58,440 --> 01:15:59,640
Alley is back.

1435
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:04,440
Walt and skeezics played by real life couple Affleck day.

1436
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:08,040
Armus, you got it's a hit, you know.

1437
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:15,000
And if anyone harasses us and says you don't have the rights to these properties,

1438
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,920
we'll say, can I interest you in a personal letter from Henry Kissinger?

1439
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:21,480
That's a threat.

1440
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:22,200
That's a threat.

1441
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,840
Yeah, that's a scary thing to get.

1442
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,080
My notes are running low.

1443
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,200
What have we missed?

1444
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:33,720
Does anyone have any parting words for Puppet Village?

1445
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:35,000
Malta for Malta?

1446
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,800
I hope I'll see you soon.

1447
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:42,040
Yes, mainly that I'm dying to go.

1448
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,640
I can't wait to go.

1449
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:50,440
Yeah, this is I mean, so we've only done two though, looking ahead at the other place.

1450
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:55,080
Is this the one to be thrown right now is like the place we'd most want to

1451
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:58,440
visit from the European vacation?

1452
01:16:58,440 --> 01:16:59,160
I think so.

1453
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,680
I think this one is so unusual.

1454
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:08,440
I really think I love how much the Popeye characters are here.

1455
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,720
You can get your picture with them.

1456
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,240
You can dance with them.

1457
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:18,920
And if the trend continues where they dance to modern music, like in the marketing material,

1458
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:24,200
eventually they will be dancing to the new hit song from Cardi B and Meg the Stallion.

1459
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,360
So that's getting very exciting.

1460
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:29,160
The one that Congress guy is mad about?

1461
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:33,560
Yes, and it'll be very interesting to see if they do the unedited version

1462
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,800
or the more upsetting clean version.

1463
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:40,040
I will say I am so comfortable with the name of the song now.

1464
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:43,000
I wouldn't have been before this Europe thing started, but now

1465
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:47,800
I'm still not going to say the full name of it, but I'm so comfortable with it.

1466
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:49,720
Wait, I don't know it.

1467
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:50,760
You got to say it.

1468
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:51,480
Say the name.

1469
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:52,920
Is it true that you don't know it, Scott?

1470
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:53,640
I don't know this.

1471
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,160
I've seen the thumbnail, but I haven't.

1472
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,040
I don't know the name of the song.

1473
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,400
Jason, you know the name of the song?

1474
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,160
Oh, yeah.

1475
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,080
I know both versions.

1476
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,000
Jason's mic is cutting out.

1477
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,440
I think Mike's got to say it.

1478
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:09,560
If I say the name of this, it will be the dirtiest thing anyone ever said on podcast arrived.

1479
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:10,760
Whoa.

1480
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:13,480
I truly have not seen the name.

1481
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,240
I'm not even pretending.

1482
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:15,880
I don't know.

1483
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:16,840
You're going to have to say it.

1484
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:18,840
I feel like you're behind the paywall.

1485
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:21,160
Mike, call your shot.

1486
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:25,080
Do you want to say the official name of the song or you don't want to say the clean edit?

1487
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,160
The clean edit version is WAP.

1488
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:29,640
And?

1489
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:30,360
Oh, come on.

1490
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:32,360
No.

1491
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:35,960
Well, Mike, say the name of the song and I'll tell you the radio edit name.

1492
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:36,680
Oh, it's different.

1493
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:38,520
Maybe I don't know the radio edit name.

1494
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,160
Oh, okay.

1495
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:42,440
And maybe the song is called Wet Ass Pussy.

1496
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,400
That was that harsh to say.

1497
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,920
Well, I'm just saying it's the dirtiest thing I've ever said on the show.

1498
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:51,480
But you're right.

1499
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:52,440
I'm in Europe, baby.

1500
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,840
You're tossing out.

1501
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,960
You're saying Wet Ass Pussy all day and night.

1502
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:00,840
It's going to be your new when I say Mike Carlson is here.

1503
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,880
You'll say, yes, Wet Ass Pussy, everyone.

1504
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,480
Scott loves saying it.

1505
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,120
I'm really reveling in it now.

1506
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:08,360
Yes.

1507
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:09,960
It's a fun song title.

1508
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:12,280
But Jason, the radio.

1509
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:13,160
What is the radio edit?

1510
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:17,240
So you can't say Wet Ass Pussy on the radio.

1511
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:19,960
What you can say is wet and gushy.

1512
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:20,760
Oh, really?

1513
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,280
Yeah, that is a lot more.

1514
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:24,680
That's worth.

1515
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:26,920
Yeah.

1516
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:27,640
Yeah.

1517
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:27,880
Huh.

1518
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,400
Well, you'll soon see all your favorite Popeye friends dancing to both versions.

1519
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,360
All right, guys.

1520
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:37,480
Now the other one.

1521
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:39,000
Let's run.

1522
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:43,400
The show is just them going through all three versions.

1523
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:46,760
I'm hesitant to do an impression of any of the characters.

1524
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:47,320
Is blue.

1525
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,960
No, he's just like, yeah, all right.

1526
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:52,600
Now we did when as pussy.

1527
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,600
Let's do wet and gushy guys.

1528
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:58,840
Does anyone want to take a stab at a Popeye impression and embarrassed themselves?

1529
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,440
Because I don't have one, but I haven't.

1530
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:01,640
I don't think I've tried.

1531
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:02,680
You don't want to try Jason.

1532
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,960
I mean, how do you start it?

1533
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:08,680
What's the key?

1534
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,600
That's exactly like Donald.

1535
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,120
We're back at it again.

1536
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:15,240
Yeah, it's Donald.

1537
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:16,440
I think we got to try it, though.

1538
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,840
It's like Dave Coolie.

1539
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:24,040
Right.

1540
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:24,920
That's it.

1541
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:25,880
Me ship.

1542
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:31,000
You've never been so welcome at a party before.

1543
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,640
All right, let's go back to Robert Evans.

1544
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:35,880
We should.

1545
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:36,840
Well, olive oil.

1546
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:42,360
Well, wait, in fact, before we get out of here, we got to we got to stamp the passport.

1547
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:48,200
Look, clunk and and wouldn't you know, it's in the shape of it.

1548
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:54,600
I think that the passport stamp is Robert Evans rendered in Popeye style.

1549
01:20:56,520 --> 01:21:01,240
And there's a quote bubble and he's saying, am I what I am?

1550
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:02,280
You bet I am.

1551
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:04,840
Great.

1552
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:05,880
Wow.

1553
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:08,520
I'm spelled with a Y, of course, spelled like.

1554
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:09,320
Yeah.

1555
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:13,480
Gonna be tough to beat that, honestly, as far as stamps are concerned.

1556
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:19,240
It's a beauty.

1557
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:21,160
It looks great.

1558
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:24,440
Certainly, I don't have to go make this.

1559
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:25,480
It exists already.

1560
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:28,120
Yeah, it's there in front of you showing it to us.

1561
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:28,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1562
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:29,400
There it is.

1563
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:34,680
Wow, it's and thank you, invisible hand that is stamping our passports.

1564
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:38,200
I don't know what entity this is that has given us these stamps, but

1565
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,160
thanks for taking us around on this fake trip.

1566
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:41,960
Yeah, thank you.

1567
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:44,840
Making sure it's all on the up and up because we don't want trouble like

1568
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:48,280
Evans and his trunks full of Coke.

1569
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:48,780
Right.

1570
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:50,280
His body's full of Coke.

1571
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,680
It occurs to me looking at again at your zoom background, Jason, that

1572
01:21:55,480 --> 01:22:00,760
blue does big fake belly might be the perfect thing to smuggle cocaine in.

1573
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:02,760
Oh, yeah.

1574
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:03,160
Oh, yeah.

1575
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:05,560
Yeah, no one will open that up.

1576
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:07,480
It's just a blue belly.

1577
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:08,760
Don't worry about it.

1578
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:09,880
Yeah, it looks so realistic.

1579
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:10,760
No one would even know.

1580
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,440
I've never seen such a well crafted gut.

1581
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:20,280
Airlines would the airport, they would just wave you right through that normal belly.

1582
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:21,400
Got it.

1583
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:25,320
And Pluto belly coming through nothing inside.

1584
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:27,080
Another one.

1585
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:29,080
All right.

1586
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:29,720
Again.

1587
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:31,720
This is going to be a good movie.

1588
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:40,760
Well, folks, you survived podcast, the ride European vacation, second gate day trip site

1589
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:41,320
excursion.

1590
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:42,920
This is a blast.

1591
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:47,320
We got one more of these coming up later in the month between two of the main feed episodes.

1592
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:49,320
We'll be doing something fun in here.

1593
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:57,800
But as for now, the journey continues this Friday on the main show, the free show.

1594
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:05,160
And we'll be do we do we give any good hints we can say about that place?

1595
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:07,400
Question.

1596
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:16,920
If you like brightening robot smiles, you want a smile that's maybe more terrifying than the

1597
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:21,800
the Pluto olive oil xenomorph we're looking at.

1598
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:23,880
If people know, they'll know.

1599
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:29,720
Like there are some real Europe parkheads, I think somebody's going to know.

1600
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:30,760
Somebody's going to know about.

1601
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:31,800
Yeah.

1602
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:32,360
You know what?

1603
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:33,960
Please guess on Twitter.

1604
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:40,040
If you think you know where we're going based on what I said, I said a scary robot smile.

1605
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:41,720
Yeah.

1606
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:45,880
If that's enough, there's another might be a lot in there because that

1607
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,720
that I don't know.

1608
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:52,280
There's probably a lot of scary looking robots spread out through Europe.

1609
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,440
I think that yeah, I think that narrows it down to all theme parks in Europe.

1610
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:00,840
This has kind of been the uniting thread between all of these.

1611
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:05,720
Well, but anyway, yes, thanks for joining us.

1612
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:10,280
If you didn't see it on Twitter, we've got a podcast to ride European vacation

1613
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:11,400
shirt available.

1614
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:15,160
A new logo from my wife, Mary Gardner.

1615
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:16,360
That thing's fun.

1616
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:19,000
And otherwise, yeah, keep following the journey.

1617
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,400
Fun stuff in just a couple of days.

1618
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:23,160
Are you going to have fun?

1619
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,040
You bet you are.

1620
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:26,840
All right.

1621
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:28,040
Bye folks.

1622
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:28,760
Goodbye.
