1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,960
Warning, the following podcast may contain four grown men hashing out a longstanding

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,960
Michael Eisner related beef.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,440
The shocking truth of why Phil Collins didn't perform at the Oscars 34 years ago.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,520
And khakis, khakis, khakis.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:28,520
It's the ultimate theme park media snarkster crossover as we welcome Kevin Perjurer, creator

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:57,120
of Defunctland to funk it up with Tarzan, Jane, Old Turk and Podcast the Ride.

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,760
And a podcast the ride hosted by three guys who are friggin pumped to spend a few hours

10
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,160
talking about rockers in dockers.

11
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,760
I'm Scott Yerner joined by Jason Sheridan and Mike Carlson.

12
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
Hey guys.

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,760
Hey, yeah, they're the dress, the musician style dress is amazing in this.

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,440
Not to tip too much too early.

15
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
No.

16
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
But I was also.

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
It paints the era.

18
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,920
I think the only thing that could pin this more into 1999 is if the performers yelled,

19
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,640
let's hear it for the NATO forces, victorious and Kosovo.

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,680
Just watching it, it evokes such an era with so little.

21
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,360
And if only Disney really does need to acknowledge specific military campaigns more often than

22
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,760
their dance shows.

23
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,600
Like Tarzan would have announced the killing of Osama bin Laden.

24
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,760
Yes.

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
We got him.

26
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,760
Jane, we got him.

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:04,840
Hey, so yes, as we're alluding to today, we are talking about Tarzan rocks, which if you

28
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,840
don't know it, and there's a little bit of likelihood you might not know it.

29
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,440
This was a live show that started in 1999 and ended at some point in the mid 2000s that

30
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:22,280
was celebrate a live spectacular celebrating the music of the eternal Phil Collins Tarzan

31
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,680
score in a much more rockin manner than Disney is usually willing to do.

32
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,720
But if you don't know this attraction, then you probably do know our guest.

33
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,740
I'm sure you're familiar with his work if you are a theme park nerd or regular listener

34
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,740
to this podcast.

35
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:44,040
Over the last couple of years, he's made a series of extremely popular history videos

36
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,800
about defunct theme parks.

37
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,880
He's often cited as a source from us.

38
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,180
He does probably significant more amount of research than we do.

39
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,640
And we're happy to have the to hear some stuff straight from the horse's mouth today.

40
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,480
Joining us for the first time on podcast, the ride from defunct land, Kevin Perjurer.

41
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,880
Welcome, sir.

42
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,880
It's about time.

43
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,880
I am angry.

44
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,360
And I can only get into Tarzan rocks.

45
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
It was my Trojan horse.

46
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,280
And I'm so glad that it finally worked.

47
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,280
Weakness, which is, you know, weird music, weird rock music.

48
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,880
Two worlds, one family, podcasting and videos coming together.

49
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,720
At last.

50
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,960
I remember the first time I listened to the podcast.

51
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,280
I mean, you were in my ears as I run.

52
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,160
Oh, yes.

53
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,480
Oh, I love I love the podcast.

54
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,120
You know, I thought I thought, wow, these these guys are really funny.

55
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,040
I mean, I was because I assumed it was like a research based like podcast.

56
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,280
I'm like, these guys are hilarious.

57
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,960
And then I looked all three of you up and they're like, oh, they're comedians.

58
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,520
And they don't always do their research as much as as I do.

59
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,200
At least this was in this was in the earlier episodes.

60
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,200
So you were like quoting like my videopolis video from the second episode.

61
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,560
You're plenty of us.

62
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,480
Most most of the time, our sources are you and Jim Hill and Len Testa.

63
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,120
So congratulations. You beat them.

64
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,360
First of all, you made it here first.

65
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,160
Yes. And you should be proud.

66
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,680
But thank you for letting us siphon off of your info.

67
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,880
Say it a little less carefully and pass it off as our own.

68
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,320
No. Well, we've we've been such a fan of your videos for for a long time.

69
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,600
And I think I had a similar reaction in that, you know,

70
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,880
I probably saw a thumbnail of one of them and I pulled it up

71
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,600
fully expecting to be immediately greeted by a guy saying, hey, guys,

72
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,080
so today we're talking like who's in like a friggin Tiki

73
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,480
shirt and like, you know, like a hovel of an apartment with

74
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,120
too many too much bullshit around him.

75
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,520
Scott just trashed half of theme park media.

76
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,040
Apologies. Like everybody's all my friends.

77
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,320
That's good luck luck luck.

78
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,960
I have no I have no problem with having a bunch of crap in your apartment.

79
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,600
It makes it. But you know what I mean, there's like a type of video

80
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,960
that I've come to expect from theme park media online.

81
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,960
And to watch your videos and find that they're like they're very clean.

82
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,320
They're very well produced.

83
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,000
They're they're they're funny.

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,360
When you go for jokes, they are funny.

85
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,720
Like it was all like your stuff is a real breath of fresh air.

86
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,640
And yeah, hey, I'm glad we're all we're all here complimenting each other.

87
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,240
Sure. Well, thank you.

88
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,200
I'm glad I am the the the the again.

89
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,640
I got I got into it.

90
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,920
I think the first episode I listened to was Universe of Energy.

91
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,320
And I was the point that I remember the first time that I was like,

92
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,840
this is hilarious. I was jogging because I listen to podcasts

93
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,800
only when I'm working out.

94
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,680
And I was I was jogging.

95
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,240
And you made the universe of energy joke where you say, like,

96
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,880
it's like the guy that wants to have sex with energy as one of the theme songs.

97
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,720
And I like I like people like we're like I was running around a track at a gym

98
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,720
and I like started laughing so hard, I had to stop running.

99
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,040
So it just looked like my heart had given out.

100
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,920
And it was like holding onto the wall.

101
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,560
And people were like, what the hell?

102
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,520
I'm like, no, no.

103
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,560
And I mean, too long to explain to these people.

104
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,760
But I mean, great, great, great content.

105
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,200
There's a comic book where Mickey explains Valdez and I don't know.

106
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,440
I mean, the whole thing, that was so great.

107
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,600
And then I saw the Videopolis episode and my ego was like, you're mentioned.

108
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,840
And I'm like, what? And I was so I was like, I was just like 15 seconds,

109
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,040
15 seconds, 15 seconds. And then I was like, I was mentioned.

110
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,320
Oh, fantastic. I mean, great stuff.

111
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,800
Hey, thank you.

112
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,920
I think if you had played that clip over, if you'd asked them to put it on the gym

113
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,480
loudspeaker, I think it would have played.

114
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,000
I think everybody lifts and weights would have understood

115
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,360
the deep yet at University of Energy comedy.

116
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,040
So next time that next time we I think we often provoke

117
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,440
the fits of laughter so intense that

118
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,920
hospitalization is a lot of times.

119
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,920
Bodybuilders come up to me and they say they'll be benching and listening to us

120
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,080
and that they drop the bar right on their chest very often.

121
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,720
So I would advise people not to bench press and listen to podcasts to ride

122
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
caved in picks.

123
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,680
Kevin, you were also nice enough to ask all of us to do

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,840
voices for the your Disney's America video,

125
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,000
which I wanted to let you know I sent to my mother.

126
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,520
And I said, keep an eye out for a familiar voice.

127
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,720
And she's like, that video is very good, very interesting.

128
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,680
I really don't remember much of that park.

129
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,200
What voice was I looking for?

130
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,240
And I was like, mind your son's.

131
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,480
My dad got it immediately.

132
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,240
Like, I think my dad was like, oh, is that Mike's like the first thing?

133
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,840
But yeah, my mom did not recognize me as disgraced, pervert

134
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,600
Senator Larry Cricket.

135
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,320
That also started you.

136
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,840
At you basically, we had a competition between Scott and I for Michael Eisner.

137
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,880
And I don't know, we were we got in the zone.

138
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,880
I still think mine wasn't it was OK.

139
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,360
I got a little gravelly, but we started like I was at a bus stop

140
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,240
waiting to get on like to get to the airport.

141
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,560
And I was just like, hello, hello, hello, hello.

142
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,960
Like, is that right? No, it's not.

143
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,960
I'm like trying to listen to it.

144
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,360
I'm like walking away from the other people waiting for the bus

145
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,880
because I'm trying to figure out Michael Eisner's tone.

146
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,920
And like so so thank you for casting me as Michael Eisner.

147
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,000
If it ever happens again, I've spent more time on it.

148
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,960
It's not good yet, but it will be good.

149
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,640
Yeah, well, I'm so happy that you guys came on.

150
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,160
He also came for charity land.

151
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,680
And and those are just those are great.

152
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,600
Both of those were great experiences having having you all on.

153
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,960
But I agree that Michael Eisner ended up being really good.

154
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,160
I love to use it again.

155
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,600
That was, of course, I brought you on because it was a Ken Burns style

156
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,320
documentary on Disney's America.

157
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,440
So I guess I need to find my which was a Ken Burns Civil War parody.

158
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,560
So I guess I need to find my Michael Eisner Vietnam story

159
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,040
so I can bring you on again to do that one.

160
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,200
Well, I was, you know, like we've talked about and we and we brought this up

161
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,160
a little when we did your charity live stream

162
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,160
that I think maybe one thing where we disagree with you on a little bit.

163
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,160
I think you're a little hard on old Eisner.

164
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,640
And and I was trying to remember like where

165
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,200
where I started feeling that, where I was like, oh, the like the Eisner hate

166
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,280
is is strong. And I think it was I realized it was at the end of Disney Quest.

167
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,000
And I rewatched the end of your Disney Quest episode.

168
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,000
And speaking of documentaries, I was like, this is like this is turning

169
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,600
into Fahrenheit 911 about Michael Eisner.

170
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,760
This is like painting a picture of a warmonger.

171
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,840
Where? Yeah, it's I don't know.

172
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,840
I I'm curious.

173
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,800
I think Mike's played well because you did such a villainous

174
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,080
take, which is probably what you were after.

175
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,040
A little bit. I had ulterior motives to my casting.

176
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,200
Yes, perhaps. Yeah. The the the darker, the darker.

177
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,400
It's like takes on battle.

178
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,720
You know, do we do fun?

179
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,480
Do we do fun, Batman?

180
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,120
Like Adam West or do we do?

181
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,240
Do we do a scarier Frank Miller one?

182
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,000
And clearly you were that you're the scary.

183
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,240
You're the scary Frank Miller.

184
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,120
I swear to me.

185
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,400
But but I'm guns, Carrie.

186
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,760
The weapon of the coward.

187
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,680
Here's what I will in that one.

188
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,240
You described him as an unfocused, fickle, often angry CEO.

189
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,800
I don't doubt that.

190
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,160
Did you not remember it?

191
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,000
Because like we don't I don't remember like some things I say.

192
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,240
I mean, I've never had them like I never had that read to me

193
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,200
out of context and just that before in an interrogation six months ago.

194
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
You referred to Mr.

195
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,120
Eisner.

196
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,560
No, I think, you know, I see where you're coming from with it,

197
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,800
because clearly there was like a good Eisner era and a bad Eisner.

198
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,520
I think he I think he turned.

199
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,280
And this will all I better shut up now or we'll never get him on the show.

200
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
We want him on the show.

201
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,680
He's made it sort of a declaration.

202
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,280
The party line Eisner was perfect.

203
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,240
He was always perfect.

204
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,040
And that's the that's the way I feel.

205
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,880
No, no, no. I think like,

206
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,560
yeah, clearly there was I mean, because he got ousted from the company and everything.

207
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,560
Roy Disney sort of pushed him out.

208
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,440
But I think we're I don't know, I feel like we I feel like we forgive him.

209
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,760
I feel like, you know, we talk about music a lot.

210
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,200
It's like the good the good stuff was so, you know,

211
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,760
oh, you know, the first five albums were so great.

212
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,560
I'll forgive the shitty last 17.

213
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,040
It's like Weezer.

214
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,200
Well, I don't know what we're doing on that one.

215
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,760
It's the two first albums are so good.

216
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,280
I'm ready to forget anything.

217
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,840
Forgive anything.

218
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,120
You're going to forgive any amount of Weezer of Rivers solo rap.

219
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,400
Yeah. Anyway, Eisner, though.

220
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,760
Eisner. Well, like the the argument between a good Eisner and a bad Eisner is kind of

221
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,880
it's basically is that the case?

222
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,840
Is there a good Eisner and a bad Eisner or was there a Frank Wells and a not Frank Wells?

223
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,840
Yeah. Because if you

224
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,320
I mean, like the in the story I'm telling in season two of Defunct Land is

225
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,360
starts with Euro Disneyland and that failure.

226
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,120
And that was the start to his downfall.

227
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,080
So I'm telling his downfall.

228
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,640
I'm not talking about his from 1984 to 1992 ish.

229
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,400
I mean, then not that there was anything extraordinary happening there besides the

230
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
the seeds that were planted to make these incredible renaissance movies.

231
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,280
And also that time that the rescuers down under like inexplicably did well.

232
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,400
And like they like someone burst and they're like, we're winning.

233
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,720
And they're like, that's not that can't be right.

234
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,720
Would the rescuers down under is really performing on the box office.

235
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,480
But but the but, you know, Eisner is is is is kind of like an antihero

236
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,360
in that he is the most human character in any of the Defunct

237
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,280
Land episodes because he is and, you know, I do treat the subjects as characters

238
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,680
to a certain extent because you have to, you know, tell stories.

239
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,840
And when you're telling multiple stories throughout multiple episodes,

240
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,400
you see my guys has turned to the dark side at the end of Disney quests,

241
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,240
which is why that that that quote you mentioned was there.

242
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,840
Well, you know, the Philadelphia location, as you point out, is still a parking lot.

243
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,800
But in their defense, the Market East neighborhood is not exactly flush

244
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,000
with parking options. So good for our fair city. Yeah.

245
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,320
Yeah, it's well, like, well, I think the Philadelphia parking lot takes the place

246
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,520
of like the returning to Flint, Michigan and all of the Michael Moore.

247
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,840
It's the heat that we lay waste to, you know, all these big decisions of laid waste

248
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:03,000
to this poor town. Yeah, they're they're they're they're exactly parallel, I think.

249
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,480
Yeah. Well, the but with the series, you know, I try to find out where Michael Eisner

250
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,920
turned, because I think no matter who you ask, there is a there was the turning point.

251
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,000
And so everyone kind of says it was Euro Disneyland.

252
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,280
And my argument was it was more of a result of Euro Disneyland,

253
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,280
Disney's America, Club Disney, Disney Regional Entertainment as a whole.

254
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,600
And that's when he turned. And that's what brought us Superstar Limo.

255
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,960
And then what's coming up is Hong Kong Disneyland, which is the finale.

256
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,320
Oh, interesting. I don't know when this airs.

257
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,720
So no one's doing my ideas if this is an hour already.

258
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,280
At least it'll be in February or March.

259
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,160
Do you know when when that's when you're heading for the finale?

260
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
February.

261
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,160
Gotcha.

262
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,280
No, no, no. I meant as in we are in February.

263
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,440
Oh, yes. Currently in this time that we're recording.

264
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Yes, yes, yes.

265
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,440
Gotcha. Yeah.

266
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,440
But OK, so you're building up to Hong Kong Disneyland, which we haven't really talked

267
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,640
about a lot on this show.

268
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
I don't like.

269
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,520
I mean, don't give away your video.

270
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
Don't give away the things that happened.

271
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,520
Yeah. The things that happened.

272
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,520
I can reveal my past is the take on it.

273
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,200
I mean, it does seem like it's probably the chinsiest of the Magic Kingdoms.

274
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,760
That's fair to say, correct?

275
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,960
It was a it was a horrible, horrible mistake.

276
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,360
It was it was a terrible idea from the start.

277
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,360
And I'll go into it, but it's worse than Paris.

278
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:30,360
It's it's such an interesting story of like of the magic of the magic of the magic of

279
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,360
the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic

280
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,360
of magic for the magic of the magic of the magic.

281
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:52,880
So like, the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of팩 Ranger has destroyed

282
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,360
imprisoned to the point where ityelling and screaming at each other and all and collect

283
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,320
all the migrants, all of them, soldiers.

284
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
So I mean, the message of magic.

285
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,760
OK, so from the beginning I went with the idea that there was, you know,

286
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,240
but the but yeah, I mean, I don't know.

287
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,360
I find it I find it very funny because it was like, yeah, we're going to go classic.

288
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,200
We're going to build the Disneyland Castle.

289
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,120
And yeah, yeah, we need to save a lot of money.

290
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,560
We're going to build the smallest castle we can.

291
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,440
Yeah, they didn't decide that super well.

292
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,120
That seemed pretty evident what they were.

293
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,280
And now they are replacing the castle, correct?

294
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,560
They're doing just why I'm doing the episode, right?

295
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,200
Yeah, sure. That's my defunct of the defunct.

296
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,440
I mean, Hong Kong is still around.

297
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,800
So that's it. It's the castle.

298
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,920
But it's the first walk in a way.

299
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:44,800
The first castle ever to be torn down again with parallels to, you know, Iraq War era.

300
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,600
It's sort of like the tearing down of the Saddam statue.

301
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,600
There's a lot of significance to this.

302
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,640
I hope we get to see footage of the castle being turned in.

303
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,960
If we're talking if we're talking CEOs, though, like if you were to write, let's say one to

304
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,840
10 Eisner overall and then Iger overall, do you have a number that pops in your head

305
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,720
for both of them just to weigh out all the stuff they've done?

306
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,360
Well, it's it's hard to say.

307
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:19,040
The and so if you read my book plug for book, the there's a great the ending.

308
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:27,120
Not that there's a there's kind of a I come to come to this this head of the Michael Eisner

309
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,200
hate and like the book is kind of about the Eisner hate towards the end and like how how

310
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,840
to handle it and different things.

311
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,400
And it culminates into a lightsaber fight between Bob Iger and Michael Eisner and which is

312
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,960
which is a wonderful ending to that to that classic book.

313
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:51,800
But the the I'm trying to think Bob Iger is a so Bob Iger came from capital city, right?

314
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,880
He was ABC guy. He was brought into the company.

315
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,960
And I think I was reading somewhere Michael Eisner was worried from the start that he

316
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,840
wasn't creative enough for Disney, like he was too much of a numbers guy.

317
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,600
And he's like, yeah, Bob Iger, I don't know.

318
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,280
He has his potential, but he's just, you know, he's too much of a numbers.

319
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,000
He doesn't he isn't thinking about the product.

320
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,600
So so Eisner thought of himself as like an avant garde artist.

321
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,120
And Bob Iger was this uptight guy who only knew how to do math.

322
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:25,680
No, I mean, like I wish because that would make a great like 90s drama blockbuster movie.

323
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:31,720
Sure. But but no, that's not really quite that.

324
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:38,240
I think it's more of Bob Iger is is so obsessed with the stocks and getting and getting the

325
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:44,560
board on his side. And Eisner was so obsessed with becoming Walt Disney and like being that

326
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,640
guy. And no, there's just it's multilayered.

327
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,880
I don't I don't know how to answer that. I feel very I do feel like this is an interrogation

328
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,320
of sorts. I was giving you a very, very broad question that I expect you to give a perfect

329
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,320
number response to the CEO's performance.

330
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,120
The polygraph is just going crazy right now.

331
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,920
I just imagine like Bob Iger holding a lightsaber and going like, I love this classic lightsaber

332
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:19,880
like like with Simpsons characters talking about like this lightsaber is my favorite

333
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,960
of all the sabers.

334
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,720
Hamburgers are more of a weekend food like George Bush on The Simpsons.

335
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:33,000
I think in the book I gave Michael Eisner the Disneyland Star Tours opening ribbon

336
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,280
cutting saber. If you remember that one.

337
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
Yeah, yeah.

338
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,360
Oh, that severed the ribbon at the beginning.

339
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,960
OK. Oh, wow. You gave him a specific one that he had held in real life.

340
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,960
Yeah, I know. I know that was just like a throwaway joke, but that's actually something I

341
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:53,600
did. And then Bob Iger, I think, had Kylo Ren saber, if I remember correctly, maybe

342
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,760
just a red lightsaber. I don't know.

343
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,320
That makes sense. He's shepherded the Kylo Ren films.

344
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,520
So, yeah, yeah.

345
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,240
Makes sense to me.

346
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,320
Spoilers, I guess.

347
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:09,880
He also started the last shareholder phone call by proclaiming destroy the past, kill

348
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,360
it like Kylo Ren.

349
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,640
So and that's how we got Will Smith as the genie.

350
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,440
Oh, boy. I think that's going to be good.

351
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,600
I think we're all going to be surprised.

352
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,600
No, they keep doing this thing and they keep getting surprised when it doesn't work or

353
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:38,240
they they I guarantee Disney has this one VFX studio made of like 15 people that they

354
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,480
only use for trailers because they did the same thing with the Avengers trailer where

355
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,560
Hulk was running at the end of Infinity War.

356
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,480
But really, it was just Mark Ruffalo in the mech suit.

357
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,000
And so they have these these people that are doing visual effects just to throw people

358
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,440
off in the trailers. And they keep getting surprised with the Latin trailer because he's

359
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,520
like, yeah, just just make something real quick.

360
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,640
And they got this blue monstrosity.

361
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,760
And it's just for the trailer.

362
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,680
I'm sure the real one looks way better than that.

363
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,400
Isn't the rumor that they did that real quick because they released that photo of him

364
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,560
without the blue. Like, there's multiple photos of him, not blue.

365
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,640
And then everyone was like, why isn't he blue?

366
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,960
And they were like, no, no, he's going to be blue.

367
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,560
He's yes, for sure going to be blue.

368
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,920
Don't worry. He's going to be blue.

369
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,720
And then they turned around and were like, oh, my God, make him blue right now.

370
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,560
He has to go. Like, like, that's what I heard happened, which makes a lot of sense with

371
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,280
how weird some of those shots are, too, that they were just like, oh, shit, we got to

372
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,680
make him blue. People can be mad.

373
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,160
Make it the stinger at the end.

374
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,480
Let's reveal a major character is the state.

375
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,560
I mean, yeah, I don't know.

376
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:40,560
It's the the the the this is Eisner's fault again, because he made one hundred and one

377
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,640
Dalmatians. That's true.

378
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,760
He did. And the book.

379
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,800
Yeah, I was thinking about that the other day.

380
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,400
Like, that was the first live action remake.

381
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,840
But like, we don't really think about I mean, how often do you find yourself thinking

382
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,600
about the live every day?

383
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,920
I mean, I do like it.

384
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,160
Yeah. And you, Larry, a young you, Larry.

385
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,640
That is a movie, I think, that delivers on the promise.

386
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,000
Not that I'm not planning on watching one hundred and two Dalmatians anytime soon,

387
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,000
but I feel like it did basically deliver on the promise of the casting, like good

388
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,800
casting for a, you know, a significant character.

389
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,000
Will Will Smith as the genie go over the same way?

390
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,160
Well, I'll say this, it's not going to be the same because it's not going to give

391
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:33,400
the the now defunct MGM studios a wealth of behind the scenes.

392
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,800
Here's how Dalmatian animatronics work.

393
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,480
Like they went all in on showing those on monitors and stuff at the backlot tour

394
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,520
and like little displays and all when those movies were coming out in the 90s.

395
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,440
So like, here's how we made one hundred and one dogs without having to have

396
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,200
one hundred and one dogs on set.

397
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,480
And a lot of creepy animatronic puppies.

398
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,640
Yeah. Yeah.

399
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,480
Like we're like writhing around and sort of like the bend in their

400
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,240
bend in their lip flaps and then in a bizarre way.

401
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,400
Yes. Yeah. I remember being freaked out by that.

402
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,960
That's my Disney experience.

403
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,040
Your ultimate Disney attraction.

404
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,520
That's my version of the that's not my president meme.

405
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,320
That's that's my Disney experience.

406
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,720
Yeah. Feel free to implement that as much as you can.

407
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,920
You aren't seeing creepy animatronic puppies.

408
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,400
Just for my last question about pertaining to Michael Eisner, at least for this, is

409
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,520
would you purchase a like a deluxe

410
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,240
hundred dollar to one hundred and fifty dollar doll or figure of Michael Eisner?

411
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,320
Would that be something you would be interested in displaying in your home

412
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,320
for the purpose of the bit or in like my actual I have to actually

413
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,120
think about this as a purchase in my life?

414
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,480
Yeah. And let's put the caveat in that like it's not you can't like even get

415
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,960
ironic Instagram likes.

416
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,000
It's just for you. It's just for you and the doll to look at each other.

417
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,920
No, because my answer for me is yes, I would buy it one hundred one hundred fifty

418
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,440
bucks if it looked really good. He's got the suit on.

419
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,080
I would love it if it came with his desk from those opening of the

420
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,400
and then like Walt's desk.

421
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,440
But yes, it's Walt's desk.

422
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,080
It's exactly how he had it.

423
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,760
But Michael Eisner standing over it, feeling very cocky.

424
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,360
But yes, I would own that doll.

425
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,800
I think Scott agreed with me.

426
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,880
He would also be interested.

427
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,160
And he's not a big guy.

428
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,120
One one caveat is there a change of ties?

429
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,200
Yes. Oh, yeah.

430
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,800
These high format figures like this Batman I have here, you got different faces,

431
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,640
you got different outfits, you got different.

432
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,200
Yes. I want a big wide tie with like a Donald pattern on it

433
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,880
and then a big white tie with Glenn Close from Under One Dalmatians on it.

434
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:43,480
As long as I can change that those ties, I mean, three minimum, but optimally seven.

435
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,440
So a different tie for every day of the week.

436
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,800
And it's littered with accessory.

437
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,080
I mean, you got the it definitely comes with a beaches and cream kitchen sink.

438
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,360
Sunday, it comes with carpet.

439
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,800
Why did it come with that?

440
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,600
Because he loved he loved the Yacht and Beach Club.

441
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,320
OK, he loved the the New England sounds like the thing for your toy.

442
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,520
What I want.

443
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,720
I will buy it if it comes with all of these ties.

444
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,840
Yeah. OK.

445
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,680
Carpet samples for the Grand California Hotel.

446
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,600
Extra Deluxe figure comes with Breck, a child Breck.

447
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,400
Thank you for Star Tours, Breck.

448
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,000
Thank you. I just want to.

449
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,400
He's given like the thumbs up and there'll be like little pictures of the rides

450
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,080
and like Breck, you can display it.

451
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,560
So Breck is thumbs up being like classic rides.

452
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,200
Michael has a notebook in front of him with ideas and then

453
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,240
Splash Mountain with Darrell Hanna animatronic question mark is written on the front.

454
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:52,240
With all of these, I think the accessorizing has won Kevin over.

455
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,400
All right. So you're in, Kevin, is what I'm asking.

456
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,280
Yes. One more thing on Michael Iser, though, that I should say that he exists

457
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,960
within the Defunct Land series.

458
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,680
And if I knew if I guess if anyone's listening that hasn't watched the series,

459
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,640
I should you don't have to.

460
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,400
But this would make a lot more sense why the Eisner hate

461
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,320
the and it's not that I don't like Eisner.

462
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,400
I think the company was much more fascinating when ran by him.

463
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,520
I think he is a he's one of the best programmers to ever live.

464
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,960
Like as far as deciding what content should be created and, you know,

465
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,800
cultivating and pushing that content to be its best.

466
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,880
He was one of the worst CEOs because he didn't understand business.

467
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,680
He doesn't. And when he focused on it, I still don't think he really understood it

468
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,880
in that in that time period, or he was just too unfocused.

469
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,160
But in all seriousness, I do prefer the company under Michael Eisner.

470
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,800
I'm a big Don Tatum guy, though.

471
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,600
So I would say Eisner over Eiger, but I'm Tatum all the way.

472
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,600
So when was the Tatum one?

473
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,920
What years was that?

474
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,880
Oh, my gosh, I just had to look it up because I said it out loud.

475
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,240
I was like, you stumped me with Don Tatum.

476
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,240
It sort of rings a bell.

477
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,400
Oh, my gosh.

478
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,680
See, he was

479
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,720
CEO until 1976.

480
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,320
He was right after Roy.

481
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,640
So because Walt Disney was never the CEO of Walt Disney.

482
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,960
So from 1971 to 1976, he was the head of the company.

483
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,240
OK, what is so? Yeah.

484
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,400
Wait, where was the Don Tatum guy right here?

485
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,200
Where was E.

486
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,400
Card Walker during that time period?

487
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,400
Wasn't he the head after that?

488
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,920
After that. OK.

489
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,760
OK. So I'm trying to make a run.

490
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,960
Like, what are some films in the Don Tatum era?

491
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,640
I mean, like, he probably probably a couple of love bugs.

492
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,440
Did Herbie go bananas in the Tatum era?

493
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,880
Well, let's see.

494
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,120
I'm sure her herbie did go bananas in the Tatum era.

495
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,720
He did not.

496
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,000
Unfortunately, that was that was all herbie went bananas for Walker.

497
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,360
I believe herbie will only go bananas for Walker.

498
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,840
I'll tell you this right now.

499
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,760
Well, I got a list in front of me now.

500
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,040
The barefoot executive, maybe based on his own experience, if he was such a cool guy.

501
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,680
Was he like a Jimmy Buffett type?

502
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,920
Might have been the type.

503
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,520
I've been to this is the early 70s.

504
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,440
Oh, yeah. Even such a thing as a Buffett type.

505
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,240
Yeah. The million dollar duck.

506
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,360
Of course, the biscuit eater, you know, like Jason's favorites.

507
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,960
Oh, the biscuit eater is about it.

508
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,840
It is about a dog. That explains it.

509
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,640
I pull up the poster and it's about a dog.

510
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,080
World's greatest athlete, super herbie road again during his era.

511
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,120
The hell is the Bears and I, the Bears and I, starring Chief Dan George.

512
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,960
Most movies don't start chief.

513
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,560
So like that, I'll be honest, I have I have never heard of most of these.

514
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,280
Yeah, which that's something.

515
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,320
Oh, but here we go.

516
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,480
Apple. Yeah, yeah.

517
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,040
Oh, yeah. Now, that's what I like.

518
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,000
Yeah. Apple dumpling game.

519
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,080
So just for having given us Apple dumpling gang.

520
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,840
And what's going on in the parks in the Tatum era?

521
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,200
Well, Walt Disney World's coming out.

522
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,080
Oh, yeah. That's one. Yes. Good point.

523
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:16,320
So this is actually where Tatum does come in is Epcot is heavily developed.

524
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,680
Or this is the time where so and I'm going to explore this in season three.

525
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,880
But I always consider Epcot Walt Disney's Rosebud.

526
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,320
He just like shouted it before he died.

527
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,560
And everyone was like, what the hell does that mean?

528
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,760
And so for like, you know, the next 10 years, people were like,

529
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,360
did he mean like a real city or was this like a scale model of a city?

530
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,800
And I don't know.

531
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:45,040
And so that he spent a lot of that time, like, you know, talking to the state

532
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,280
of Florida and the state of Florida being like, please don't build a city.

533
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,640
And he's like, I don't want to build a city

534
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,440
for that whole thing.

535
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,280
So that was a really that was a really interesting time for the parks.

536
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:59,480
Hmm. And clearly they finally correct what Walt wanted.

537
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,760
When it became a display of upcoming Sega games

538
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,520
that finally crystallized his vision.

539
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,640
Walt Disney envisioned Sega the entire thing in the moments before he died.

540
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,440
And they finally got it.

541
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,600
Mickey and Sonic together.

542
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,080
OK, so season three, we got Tatum, we got we got the death of Disney.

543
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,800
Anything anything else you can tease or that you're starting to think about?

544
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,040
So I separated into seasons and people were like, this is why are you doing this?

545
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,840
This means nothing.

546
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,800
And it means something to me.

547
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,640
And that's all that matters.

548
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,360
Season two is very much about season two is like headline.

549
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,480
Attraction would be journey into imagination.

550
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,800
It's all about creativity and the what the creative process can yield

551
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,960
and what obstacles can get in the way of the creative process

552
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,760
and the results of the creative process.

553
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,280
And, you know, in the in the medium of theme parks, theme entertainment and whatnot.

554
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,840
And it's also a look into what businesses have the ability to do

555
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,720
two things such as creativity and all that jazz.

556
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:11,080
And so season three would be more about the future and the views of the future.

557
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,360
And and so that's more of the Epcot kind of idea.

558
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,680
So I guess the headline would be Horizons.

559
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,160
I'm not sure if I'm going to do it for that season, but Horizons would be that

560
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,160
attraction where we're all we're talking about, you know, we're going to World's Fair.

561
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,480
I don't want to spoil too much because I know everyone's on the edge of their seat.

562
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,280
But yeah, so that would be my explanation of that.

563
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,480
And season one was a mistake.

564
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,600
I mean, do you have do you have like a multi like season arc?

565
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,000
Like, do you have like a series finale in mind?

566
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,320
Like what the last season of Defunct Land?

567
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,520
How far in advance do you think about this type of thing?

568
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:53,840
I think season to season and I do have a series finale in mind.

569
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,560
And it might be at the end of season three.

570
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,080
We will see. Oh, really?

571
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,240
I might be wrapping it up. Wow.

572
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:09,400
Well, is it just so I can reboot it, just so I can be like the new class and it'll be

573
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,720
all right. Right. Yeah, I see.

574
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,360
With a different person.

575
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,400
Yeah, reboots are in vogue. That's a smart move.

576
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,760
That's good. And Screech will be involved.

577
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,600
The whole thing. Yeah.

578
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,080
Well, you that you have the that you are thinking in a bigger way and do have a season

579
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,800
finale in mind that puts you a notch ahead of Vince Gilligan.

580
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,200
He just figured it out as he went.

581
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,800
So you're I'll declare it here.

582
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,320
Kevin Perger, superior to Vince Gilligan.

583
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,960
Yeah, better showrunner.

584
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,120
I appreciate that and agree with it more more so.

585
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,600
Yeah. Happily take that and just own it.

586
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,120
You know, it's a question I had for you also is, you know, because we're both in us, us

587
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,120
with our theme park podcast and you with your theme park video series.

588
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,480
We all we all have to we all have to think about topics and figure out, you know, how

589
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,560
much how much meat is on the bone.

590
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,920
And is that just a thing that's part of an episode or does that sustain a couple of

591
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,360
episodes? Is there anything about your process that you can tell us?

592
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:13,200
And specifically, have you ever like started a video and gone, there's not enough there.

593
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,800
That was a trip to nowhere.

594
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:22,160
Yes, I have started videos and I talk I talked about this in a recent one of my podcasts

595
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:28,560
where I I you know, that becomes a challenge for me where I say, well, I'm going to I can

596
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,120
make it interesting because, you know, I can make anything interesting.

597
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,120
And then you realize that I would know you can't that you're not that talented.

598
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,960
No, sometimes no one's that talented to make certain things interesting.

599
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,480
And what I've come to is in some situations and I should pull up just my

600
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,720
I keep it all on Google Docs, which is a great business suite.

601
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,920
But I can I can scroll and see if I have any that I just haven't done.

602
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,920
But what it comes down to for me is if the people that are supposed to be interested

603
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:02,480
are not involved or not, you know, if they're if if they as people do not have their

604
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,800
mind focused on this park or ride, there's probably not a story there because you don't

605
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:13,080
have any characters. So for for instance, I gave so Wonderland Sydney,

606
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,160
is an episode on an Australian theme park that closed down.

607
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:20,000
It was it was absorbed by a company for business purposes and then abandoned for business

608
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,880
purposes. They didn't care about it at all.

609
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,040
Purely a business transaction. It's like the bakery didn't make it.

610
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,080
There's no story there. Like, that's all it is.

611
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,480
But there was a huge fan base that was just like crying on the last day.

612
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,200
And that was like, OK, that's a story.

613
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,960
You know, people are involved. People care.

614
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,120
This was this affected people. But if I know and it's and usually in the theme park sphere,

615
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,480
people really care. So it's really great.

616
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,760
But sometimes they don't.

617
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,960
OK, here's actually an example. Wow.

618
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:57,360
Never mind. So the arcade is something I've always wanted to do.

619
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:06,720
The arcade, if you can guess, is was the arcade on the Disney cruise line ship Disney

620
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:14,480
Dream and it was removed and replaced with Vanellope's Sweet Shop themed to Wreck-It-Ralph,

621
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:20,560
which is ironic. And that irony, because it was an arcade and Wreck-It-Ralph is.

622
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,960
Yeah. But the but that irony was not enough, believe it or not, to drive a 12 to 24 minute

623
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,200
episode unless I gave the entire history of the Disney Cruise Line, which was actually the

624
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,080
purpose for the episode to begin with, because I love the Disney Cruise Line.

625
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,120
But yeah, did you experience the arcade yourself?

626
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,720
Oh, I mean, it was it was an experience.

627
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,640
You know, it had the sign outside that had a little parrot sitting on it and said arcade

628
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,800
with like three or four hours. And I was like, whoa.

629
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,040
And I go inside and it's this it's a small arcade.

630
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,040
And then I played a game or two.

631
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,680
And then I left. I was like, wow, that was the arcade.

632
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,600
You're saying that wasn't enough for 20 minutes.

633
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,360
Yeah, that was not enough for 20 minutes.

634
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,720
I couldn't find the imagine here behind the arcade, which was another thing.

635
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,240
I'm sure there was there was a lot of drama at the time of how are we going to how are

636
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,160
we going to accomplish the arcade?

637
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,440
Although, you know, I do want to do an episode now that I'm just on this for some reason.

638
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,240
I do want to do an episode on all the arcade puns.

639
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,120
I don't know if I've mentioned this before at all to anyone or maybe even you.

640
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,480
But for some reason, this sounds familiar.

641
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,680
But I want to do the starcade, the arcade.

642
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,840
Oh, I'm sure there's more.

643
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,520
What was the arcade in the contemporary called?

644
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,800
Or is it still there? It is still there.

645
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,440
Most of the hotel ones are still there.

646
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,080
They don't have fun names, I feel like.

647
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,480
Maybe they do. Maybe you can set it all to music from the red hot chili peppers

648
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,280
stadium, Arcadian.

649
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,800
That's that's my note for you.

650
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,920
Yeah, I'd like to see 20 minutes just

651
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,080
determining how many hours there were in the pirate themed.

652
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,240
No, I mean, what?

653
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,400
That's not the point of it.

654
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,240
That was the yeah, it's on a boat.

655
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,960
It's got a lot of hours. There's a parrot like.

656
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,440
I mean, that was it. That was the whole thing.

657
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,840
It was the the parrot had an eye patch.

658
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,200
I think. But when you get.

659
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,720
Sorry, I was going to say, it does sound like it's enough for us to do an hour

660
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,120
second gate episode on it, though, if it just has a parrot with an eye patch.

661
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,640
Like that's enough for us to think in the world of comedy podcasting.

662
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,800
You just go. You don't think about it.

663
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,760
Too hard. Wow.

664
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,320
You should. We yes.

665
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,440
Yeah, we yes. And that's why they're all so good.

666
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,160
Do you know? I mean, I that's how my my good friend, Disney Dan, makes videos.

667
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,600
He brags about it all the time.

668
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,080
Sometimes he just did a video.

669
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,160
He does the costume character revolutions, if you've ever seen those. Oh, yeah.

670
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,240
And he's like, I didn't even write a script for that one.

671
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,520
I just started talking.

672
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,360
And I was like, that's that. OK.

673
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,760
That's like Ken Burns being like, I didn't even research the similar.

674
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,080
I just started talking.

675
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,680
Then here we are on episode eight.

676
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,160
I feel like I've heard like Jay-Z or something like I don't write the rap

677
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,880
they just come out of my head.

678
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,720
Yeah. So Jay-Z and Disney Dan are very similar.

679
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,120
Yeah. Kevin has been skill again.

680
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,680
And Jay-Z, Disney Dan is Jay-Z.

681
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,800
Yeah, I would say that.

682
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,320
I think it's the analogy falls apart when you realize that, you know,

683
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,600
you can just make up raps like it doesn't.

684
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,640
Have to be based in fact.

685
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,720
And Dan was supposed to be making a history video, whatever.

686
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,320
But no, yeah, I agree.

687
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,920
I'll yeah, I'll give him the Jay-Z title for today.

688
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,200
You don't think you can successfully freestyle a history of Pluto

689
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,560
costumes from 1955 to today?

690
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,200
I mean, we're about to freestyle a history of Tarzan rocks.

691
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,480
So, I mean, I guess we'll find out.

692
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,960
I didn't do extensive research recently.

693
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,480
I've always been fascinated with Tarzan rocks, but I can start making up facts.

694
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,600
Well, well, Disney Dan it.

695
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,480
Well, it's just a seed of our fuck it.

696
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,280
Well, Disney Dan, I fuck it.

697
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,320
Disney D or Jay-Z.

698
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,320
Yeah. Well, let's let's let's start getting into it.

699
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,520
Let's let's start rocking, gentlemen. Yeah.

700
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,200
Yeah. I'm really excited.

701
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,760
And you you came to us with this topic and I'm.

702
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,520
Well, that's a question.

703
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,680
You talk about meat on the bone and stuff.

704
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,360
Do you think do you think?

705
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,360
Well, we can determine after this episode, perhaps.

706
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,400
Do you think that there is a defunct land video in Tarzan rocks?

707
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,200
Or is it or is it a mere podcast?

708
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,600
The right episode?

709
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,360
This this will serve as the video, most likely.

710
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:39,160
I will say there is enough because you have Tarzan and you have Animal Kingdom

711
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,840
and you also have the right.

712
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,520
So essentially, at this point in my videos, you pick a topic

713
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,920
that's going to be the meat and then you season it with all these other things.

714
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,800
So there wasn't a ton of information that I could go off of for the

715
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,800
I don't know if you saw the haunted castle mystery tour video

716
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,880
from Tokyo Disneyland for Halloween.

717
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,280
I did that. So, yeah, I was that was a great.

718
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,560
I was shocked, by the way, of then during that one.

719
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,640
I had no idea what that was.

720
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,840
Yeah, that was a super interesting.

721
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,640
But there wasn't a ton of the meat just explaining the right itself

722
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,600
on information of that.

723
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,560
But you can talk about the Black Cauldron and that history.

724
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,480
Super interesting.

725
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,000
And then, you know, Tokyo Disneyland a bit and its opening.

726
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,120
And so you can season it.

727
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,320
I think this is one of those things.

728
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,040
It was early in the park parks development.

729
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,280
You have the history of Tarzan as the last movie in the Disney Renaissance.

730
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,640
And, you know, there is a video here.

731
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,960
The reason I'm considering, you know, transitioning from defunct land

732
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,680
eventually, maybe season three, four or five and not doing this like indefinitely

733
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,440
is because, you know, I would start to get into like Tarzan rocks.

734
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,400
I could do an entire season of just like Tarzan rocks and Spider-Man rocks

735
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,920
and all those.

736
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,000
You are familiar with Spider-Man rocks.

737
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,600
Did you do an episode on that?

738
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:58,120
We touched on it in a stunt show episode that was one of our first four

739
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,280
episodes, I believe.

740
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,640
So we hit we have a new theme park podcast.

741
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,440
We got to hit Spider-Man rocks ASAP as quick as we can.

742
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,320
So, yeah, we know all about it.

743
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,640
Yeah, you do the rock season like, hey, we're helping.

744
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,920
We're part of it. We're doing all the voices you need.

745
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,160
We're making up songs for you. We're scoring.

746
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,840
That's that's our wheelhouse.

747
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:24,800
You're fighting over who gets to be Hard Rock Park CEO John Benkowski.

748
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,320
Like, no, I'm going to do Benkowski.

749
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,280
Oh, yeah, that's that's what ends us.

750
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,240
The fight to be Benkowski friendships over.

751
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,640
I think you get Benkowski to do his own voice.

752
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,160
Yeah, he could do it.

753
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,960
This is actually a great idea.

754
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,320
Now that I think about it, I'll do rock season defunct land rocks, defunct

755
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,680
land rocks, defunct land rocks.

756
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,800
Please make it happen.

757
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,360
I will be Winston the punk rock dog, though.

758
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,800
That famous character, you know, the famous character from the Hard Rock Park,

759
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,960
Winston, the punk rock dog.

760
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,960
Come on, Kevin.

761
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,160
No, he's a famous character.

762
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,040
I looked in these episodes, need characters.

763
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,040
And with that park, you have Winston.

764
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,440
So it writes itself.

765
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,680
You have Winston and you have the amazing bare metal family.

766
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,400
They were like the country bears, but they rocked and the acrobatic roadies.

767
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,960
That's true, too. Yeah.

768
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,560
Which, yeah, that's fitting.

769
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,160
This show is very acrobatic.

770
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,320
It sure is.

771
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,760
It sure is.

772
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,760
I would say the I would like to just to butt in and say that the country bears do rock.

773
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,640
And that that was a offensive comparison to put down the bears like that.

774
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,880
If you see the movie, the country bears.

775
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,680
That's right. I think, Kevin, you and I share the same love of country bears.

776
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,400
When it's so good.

777
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,840
When that evil Zack Ryder was trashing Disney World Rides, I was OK.

778
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,840
Carousel Progress, I really like a lot.

779
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,000
But then when he said the country bears was kind of boring or the robots world,

780
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,360
I did share your anger.

781
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,560
And he did. He was a real heel when he said that.

782
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:04,920
And I you and I, we're going to do multiple country bears episodes.

783
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,960
My co-hosts aren't even prepared for what I will eventually propose to them

784
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,240
in regards to length and amount.

785
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:15,280
The question is, do we even have to be here or can you just talk for four hours

786
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,080
straight without assistance?

787
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,000
Do you already have the audio?

788
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,880
He's just been recording it.

789
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,000
I feel every night.

790
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,600
What I do is I put a little candle by the bed and I bring the recorder

791
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,600
in the bed with me and I just talk about one of the characters for two hours

792
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,400
and I go to sleep during that.

793
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,880
Like I I drift off to sleep at that point.

794
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,800
And that's where you wear, sir.

795
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:40,320
He wears three petticoats and each more lovely than the last.

796
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,720
Good night, Trixie.

797
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,440
This is why this is why Lindsay sleeps in a separate bedroom.

798
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,760
Like you are some rich old money weirdos.

799
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,400
Liver lips, mackerel.

800
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,560
Ah, I do down out there.

801
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:05,080
So I do have a quick country bear story that also involves Disney, DJ, Disney, Dan.

802
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,400
We were at the parks in the other during Christmas.

803
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,280
So like during like, you know, the time you're not supposed to go.

804
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,880
And it was crazy.

805
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,400
And the country bears was packed because the park was packed.

806
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,080
It was it was it was amazing.

807
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,080
And Dan, we get in there.

808
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,120
We are in the back row of the theater and everyone's quiet.

809
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,120
You know, they're getting ready for the the the cast member to start the like

810
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,800
the puns before we get started.

811
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,760
And we're standing up as we're walking in with the last ones to sit down.

812
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:34,880
Dan still standing, starts clapping and he says, we're about to give these bears.

813
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,240
He does not speak like this normally.

814
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,400
He just did this for this this part.

815
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,160
He said, we're about to give these bears the best costume performance

816
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,560
I've ever seen. They've been practicing all week.

817
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,920
Let's give it up for these bears.

818
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,440
And the amount of confused Brazilians in that room was more than usual

819
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,080
for Orlando at the time.

820
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,800
But we did get a large portion of the crowd to start cheering for the bears

821
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,000
as if they like it, get them to come on stage.

822
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,560
It was a fantastic moment.

823
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,160
So definitely next time you're at the Jamboree,

824
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,840
try to get the crowd a little riled up beforehand.

825
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,320
The bears love it. They've been practicing for a while.

826
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,640
I think that's great.

827
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,760
Orlando, some of the crowds are a little lackluster.

828
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,640
Not the case in Tokyo, though.

829
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,840
They were to see those robots.

830
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,440
Yeah. Standing out.

831
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,960
Not a standing out, but they were definitely like clapped

832
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,360
and they were they were hungry for those bears.

833
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,680
Thank God. Beautiful.

834
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,600
Well, but let's talk about some some different

835
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,200
rock and animals here a little bit.

836
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,760
Tarzan Rocks. So so Animal Kingdom opens a couple of live shows when it began.

837
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,560
There was a Jungle Book live show, I believe, initially.

838
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,640
And a couple of years into the run, they traded out

839
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,200
in ninety nine to promote the

840
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,760
then new Disney animated film Tarzan,

841
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,280
with, of course, the Phil Collins score.

842
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,520
Did you guys get a chance to see this?

843
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,760
Who saw it in person? I never saw it in person.

844
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,480
I have no idea if I saw it in person or not.

845
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,040
I cannot remember.

846
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,960
I would have been I would.

847
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,480
You know what? I don't think I'm saying this.

848
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,360
I don't know if I would.

849
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,520
Maybe we saw it. I have no memory of it whatsoever.

850
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,840
Watching it. And I also watched a a pretty good quality video of it.

851
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,160
And I have to give the person credit because they cut together two performances

852
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,800
for this video.

853
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,480
And but the only difference is the main narrator has

854
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,400
one of them as bright blonde hair and one of them is very bald.

855
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,920
So it very much gave the feeling of like in The Shining,

856
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:41,240
when the shots go back and forth and furniture has moved like that unease

857
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:45,520
Kubrick was trying to create kind of happened when I watched the video

858
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:50,080
of Disney Rocks. But the The Shining reference is interesting

859
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,720
because I was actually thinking The Shining because the Jungle Book

860
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,520
show that came before this,

861
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,360
Baloo looks like Blo Bear from The Shining,

862
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,960
the bear performing oral sex on a man in a hotel room.

863
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,080
You mean? Yes.

864
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,920
I mean, have you seen have any of you looked up the Jungle Book,

865
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,280
the one that came before this? No, no, no, I haven't.

866
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,200
Do you have a computer? Google it. It's amazing.

867
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,600
They didn't. It's not full body costumes.

868
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,120
It's full body minus just the face.

869
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,440
You what? What?

870
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,480
Weird. I was thrown in.

871
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,440
I mean, in the Tarzan one, because Turk is an actual like,

872
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:32,720
you know, character like a walk around character.

873
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,640
Oh, my God. By the way, audience, you all know Turk.

874
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,400
You know, Turk, right?

875
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,960
Rosie O'Donnell's beloved, beloved scene stealing.

876
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,920
Every Disney animal steals all the scenes, steals all the scenes,

877
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,200
especially terms it up when Turk trashes the camp.

878
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,920
Also, Kevin, very bold of you to declare this the end of the Disney

879
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:58,600
Renaissance, like that this is what I what was to that was 2000 dinosaur.

880
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,040
Was that what was that the next big release?

881
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:07,480
Sorry, I'm trying to play this jungle book so we can get a picture of the horror.

882
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,160
I see. So there were there were there was a version of the Jungle Book

883
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,920
where they they had a face, I guess.

884
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:19,120
But the there was an earlier version where there was no face and it was creepy.

885
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,800
But but yeah, this would be the end of the Disney Renaissance, I believe,

886
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,680
because this is Disney post Renaissance starts in 2000

887
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,640
with I know I just know Tarzan is the is the end.

888
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,840
You consider it and that it's it's hand drawn.

889
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:37,000
It's still like it's not it's it's Tarzan well regarded.

890
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,760
Where do we where does it really land on?

891
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,720
Well, it's not I don't even think it's like a consideration.

892
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,440
I thought that this was just the way they were deemed.

893
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,240
Like I thought that was just the errors.

894
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,800
I didn't know. Yeah.

895
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,880
Is it up for debate? Well, I'm talking personal.

896
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,240
Yeah, how does everybody feel about the film Tarzan?

897
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,280
I remember I saw I've seen it once.

898
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,680
I we don't we did not own it on VHS.

899
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,320
I saw it. I remember liking it, but I remember it was what?

900
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,240
Ninety seven, ninety eight, ninety nine.

901
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,360
Ninety nine. Is it ninety nine?

902
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:11,360
Geez. I remember thinking I didn't need those animals talking.

903
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,040
I remember, but I remember thinking it was kind of a decent, like almost

904
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:19,560
adultish cartoon, like a more of a, you know, a little bit more of a mature

905
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,800
kind of a story. There's a hanging in it for God's sake.

906
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,280
Was there? Yeah.

907
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,240
The bad guy gets hanged at the end, I believe.

908
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,040
Oh, is that right? Kevin, can you confirm?

909
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,000
How many? This is going to be my role.

910
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,280
I was just someone did.

911
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,760
Someone was killed.

912
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,040
Yeah, no, I can't confirm that that happened.

913
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,480
There they also it also starts with a double murder.

914
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,840
And then it's not just like by the tiger, I believe.

915
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,560
And then the tiger chases after Tarzan.

916
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,280
So it wasn't just like an off screen like and then the ship didn't make it.

917
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,680
It was like, oh, no, this tiger murdered your parents.

918
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,680
And then the tiger is going to chase you for the rest of the like.

919
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,680
I liked it. I remember liking it, but I didn't.

920
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,240
It didn't make such a crazy impression on me.

921
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,680
I thought the Phil Collins song was fine.

922
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,280
I like the Phil Collins song now, but it was not such a big moment in my life.

923
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,960
Yes. So this is multiple songs.

924
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,120
My friend. Excuse me.

925
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,720
I'm just saying the big one.

926
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,120
The the major. Yes.

927
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,920
I refuse. I refuse to acknowledge one as better than the others.

928
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,400
I'm so sorry. They're all equally amazing.

929
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,920
They're one distinct musical piece like Queen's Night at the Opera.

930
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,520
It's a sweet. It's all one thing. Yeah.

931
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:36,760
So You'll Be in My Heart is a this one.

932
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,960
The Academy Award for Best Original Song that year, as well as the Golden Globe,

933
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:45,680
beating out South Park's Blame Canada and Amy Mann's Save Me.

934
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,040
Is this was this a correct decision?

935
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,240
That's a good question.

936
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,120
Now, I will say, since watching this, I have had these songs

937
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:58,800
stuck in my head for a few days, but say beating out Save Me is

938
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,600
Save Me is a really great song.

939
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,800
It's such a great song. Not in consideration, although the General Tarzan

940
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:09,080
soundtrack did win a Best Original Soundtrack Grammy.

941
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,560
So in that regard, the entire suite was represented.

942
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,600
So Phil Collins raking in awards from the score.

943
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,440
How many times can I burst into one of the Phil Collins?

944
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,360
How many times can I do a terrible Phil Collins impression before people will stop

945
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,520
listening and unsubscribe from my videos?

946
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,840
I was I was threatening the same thing in the episode

947
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,280
to my wife, who encouraged me to not.

948
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,160
But I kept thinking if somebody if one of you presented a factoid

949
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:43,560
of something interesting, I wanted to I wanted to always go, I want to know

950
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:49,440
and show me I want to know about the Tarzan Rock show.

951
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,800
So my personal thing with Tarzan, I what is it?

952
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,800
I want to know.

953
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,160
There we go. I'm glad I could say you're already old.

954
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,400
Much like I cannot remember if I saw this show,

955
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,640
I cannot remember if I saw the movie in theaters.

956
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:15,480
I believe we had the soundtrack because I mean, the soundtrack sold a lot of copies

957
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,040
on vinyl. Yeah, probably on vinyl.

958
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,960
That's the best way to hear a son of man's song.

959
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,960
Trash in the camp really pops.

960
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,960
Neil Young was really mad about Son of Man's audio quality when it was on MP3.

961
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,440
Yeah. That's why you had to get Pono for.

962
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,960
We were a cassette family for too long.

963
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,000
My mother would not fudge from the cassettes.

964
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,840
What year did you get a CD player?

965
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:42,600
When I was in eighth grade, so like probably 98, 99.

966
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,040
Oh, really? Yeah.

967
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,760
Wow. And I had to argue for it.

968
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,680
Like I had to to fight for it.

969
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:57,880
So, yeah, I but my my childhood association with Tarzan was the Johnny Weiss

970
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:02,080
Mueller animatronic in the great movie ride.

971
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,520
But those were not the movies I saw.

972
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,960
I saw it out, you know, singing in the rain.

973
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,800
I did not seek out the Johnny Weiss Mueller Tarzan.

974
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,840
But so I really didn't get a craving for it.

975
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:18,440
You didn't leave Disney World going more Weiss Mueller, Mother Miller, more Jane.

976
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,080
No, not really.

977
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,880
And I think even as like a kid, because what I would have been just starting high

978
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:30,000
school, I think I would have been coherent and not to go like this.

979
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,960
This Tarzan have dreadlocks.

980
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,320
Is this a white guy with dreadlocks?

981
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:40,760
Because you knew this was cultural appropriation even in even at 13 or whatever.

982
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,760
Well, I don't think we use that term, but I think I just knew like, oh, this is weird

983
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,040
that this is going to be a one of the biggest movies of the year.

984
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,360
And sure.

985
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,480
Yeah, it's Tarzan.

986
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,080
Why the marriage of Phil Collins and Tarzan?

987
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,920
Like musically, these things don't really overlap.

988
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,040
I don't. I think he did.

989
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:07,560
I think he made an admirable attempt at being the omniscient musical narrator

990
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,240
of the tale. If you haven't seen Tarzan, the characters don't sing.

991
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,120
He just sings for them.

992
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,360
I don't know.

993
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,520
I think it's an interesting choice.

994
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,000
All I said was an admirable attempt.

995
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,480
I'm not saying it was good, although the Academy said as much.

996
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:33,320
Can I say this little bit of Phil Collins Oscar trivia that it was interesting to me?

997
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:39,720
He was nominated for Against All Odds in 1985 in a stacked year.

998
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,400
Other nominees. Let's hear it for the boy Footloose.

999
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,520
I just called to say I love you.

1000
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,960
And there's another really good one that's Ghostbusters.

1001
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:52,120
That's got to be one of the best five ever in that category.

1002
00:54:53,080 --> 00:55:00,440
And the Academy looked at who was nominated and they said this Phil Collins.

1003
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,840
Now, who is this?

1004
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,560
Oh, he's one of the most popular musicians of the time.

1005
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,280
Well, look, we're really more of a movie award show.

1006
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,760
And I don't know if we want this music guy.

1007
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,240
We have a big presence on our show.

1008
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:18,560
Meanwhile, Phil Collins had rerouted his tour to like

1009
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,200
I'm going to cancel some dates so that I can be at the Oscars.

1010
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,280
He's there. Can't wait to perform.

1011
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,560
The Academy says, no, you can't.

1012
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:31,400
And they got some friggin choreographer to sing Against All Odds instead of him.

1013
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,320
And he's just sitting in the audience watching a performance at which,

1014
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,360
if you watch it, is terrible.

1015
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:42,080
It's an awful performance in the same year that Ray Parker Jr.,

1016
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:44,440
who for some reason was allowed to perform.

1017
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,200
Well, yeah, like, what is that logic?

1018
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,600
And Denise Williams performed.

1019
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,520
So they count as movie people, but the Academy is like,

1020
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,240
can't wrap their heads around getting Phil Collins to actually play.

1021
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,480
So he's sitting there.

1022
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,680
He's watching this.

1023
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,040
Meanwhile, Ray Parker Jr.

1024
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:03,840
does this really bizarre Ghostbusters performance that's interrupted by like

1025
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:07,760
Borsch Belt, Three Stooges Ghostbusters, who are dressed, of course,

1026
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,360
in the iconic bright blue, shiny uniforms.

1027
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,800
So with giant silver shoulder pads.

1028
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:18,440
Yeah. Why? Ray Parker at one point shoots magic out of his finger like Mickey

1029
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,400
and blows up a ghost.

1030
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,560
So Oscars are over.

1031
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,040
Phil Collins loses to I just called to say I love you.

1032
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,760
He they ask him, what do you think of the performance of your song?

1033
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,280
He said it was shit.

1034
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,920
But I'm kind of glad I didn't have to perform after what they made Ray Parker do.

1035
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,920
So they just totally pissed all over.

1036
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,760
If like if you're watching the current Academy Awards debacle and thinking

1037
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,680
that's the worst thing the Academy's ever done.

1038
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,200
Yeah, yeah. I don't like the the Academy Awards have always been

1039
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,520
really wrongheaded and stupid.

1040
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:55,160
But could you imagine them now so desperate for ratings going like Lady Gaga?

1041
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:58,920
You are not singing shallow. Absolutely not.

1042
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,400
Yeah. Well, I don't know.

1043
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,480
Their decisions have been so inexplicable and shitty lately. Yeah.

1044
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,880
No. Yeah. I think today they would just give like 30 minutes

1045
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,840
of the broadcast to Phil Collins.

1046
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,920
I do come whatever you want, please.

1047
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:17,360
It'll be after our tribute to the Lifetime Achievement Award for Brian Singer.

1048
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:25,200
I'm Kevin. You were saying a quick thing on Ray Parker Junior before this.

1049
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,760
This goes away forever.

1050
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,240
Is the I I share revenue.

1051
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:36,000
So whenever someone copyright claims a video for music or video,

1052
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
you know, they have options. They can either take all my money.

1053
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,040
They can or they can put a copyright strike strike on me.

1054
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,160
They can do nothing or they can share revenue.

1055
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,760
So we both receive revenue.

1056
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,680
I've only been I've had none of those things happen, maybe ignoring,

1057
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,840
but only one time have I shared revenue with anything.

1058
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,240
And that person is Ray Parker Junior for the Ghostbusters

1059
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,560
spectacular episode of Defunctland.

1060
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,600
What's interesting is it's not a company.

1061
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,680
So it's not like Universal Media Corp.

1062
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,920
It is Ray Parker Junior.

1063
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,600
So if you click on that video, what comes up is says you're sharing revenue

1064
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:14,680
with Ray Parker Junior, and it's the funniest just image.

1065
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,760
Oh, so you just got an email one day saying there's been a copyright claim.

1066
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,960
Oh, what? By BMI? No, by Ray Parker, by Ray Parker Junior.

1067
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,200
Not a company at all.

1068
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,560
And he didn't he didn't want all the money.

1069
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,320
He just wanted to share some of it.

1070
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,960
Just a little bit.

1071
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,360
I mean, I mean, great.

1072
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,240
I was strange. Wow.

1073
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:39,160
So but on the Tarzan thing, before I forget this, too, I.

1074
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,520
So it's interesting.

1075
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,960
We have a running theme of improving

1076
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,920
the of improving like episodes through this podcast for some reason.

1077
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,120
I was looking up and so I was going to make a joke.

1078
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:54,520
I was like, you know, it sounds like Phil Collins is improving these lines

1079
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:58,480
in the like in the songs because he because some of them don't make sense.

1080
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,000
He's like, in learning, you will teach

1081
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,240
and teaching you will learn.

1082
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,320
Like, you know, it's like the Dana Carvey

1083
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,360
Chopin Broccoli, where he's making up the song on the spot

1084
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,280
with executives over his shoulder.

1085
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,240
But that is how he came up with some of these.

1086
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,200
So it is. It is.

1087
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,000
Yeah, I just read that it came from improv sessions

1088
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,000
and his reactions while reading the treatment.

1089
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,840
So he literally got up there and he's like, so man, I'm going to sky.

1090
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,160
And then he's like, I'm going to sky in the next one.

1091
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,800
Or I'm assuming it's British or something.

1092
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,520
And anyways, I mean, this whole thing.

1093
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,840
Yeah, yeah.

1094
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:44,200
You know, it's you know, it's strange to tie back in the copyright claim thing.

1095
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:48,040
I have some experience with specifically the song two worlds

1096
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:53,360
and the performance of it in this video for any any listeners

1097
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:57,200
who are the rare, beautiful bird of who is a fan of both podcasts, right?

1098
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,960
And the clip cup franchise.

1099
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,280
There is a video that I did

1100
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:05,320
the full title clip cup four point live campus, Columbus,

1101
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:10,600
a live edition of a video that a video series I was part of in which we

1102
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:15,160
it was a live show, so we needed to finish it with, you know, a big, glorious,

1103
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,960
you know, you know, just just a big spectacular finale.

1104
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,400
And this was shot where I went to college, Loyola Marymount.

1105
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:28,520
We finished this thing with a huge performance of two worlds by Phil Collins,

1106
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:33,440
which we wanted to do a sound like, you know, just like something

1107
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,000
with the two worlds vibe, just make this out of nowhere.

1108
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,440
This thing feels like Tarzan rocks.

1109
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,680
All of a sudden we realized what sound alike is ever going to give you

1110
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:46,080
the pure raw magic of two worlds, one family with what that did result in

1111
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:49,520
is the video being pulled from Funny or Dice YouTube channel

1112
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:53,120
due to a copyright claim by by Phil Collins, maybe not Phil Collins himself,

1113
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:58,200
but by whatever whatever owns the Walt Disney, I would imagine.

1114
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,640
Anyway, if now you want to see an even more stirring performance of two worlds,

1115
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:07,280
then the Tarzan rocks version, it's exclusively available on view.

1116
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,560
Bu dot com vi o bu dot com two worlds, one family.

1117
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:18,880
Anyways, litigiousness runs rampant and many pieces of work.

1118
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:26,160
So but because of that, I do have this fondness, particularly for for two worlds.

1119
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,840
There's something sort of like, I don't know, which one.

1120
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:31,160
What song do we like the most out of these?

1121
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:35,080
If you had to declare one, you'll be I think I like the you'll be in my heart.

1122
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,280
So still you'll be in my heart.

1123
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,960
My toughest time with that one's kind of like a little like,

1124
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,280
I don't know, that's that's like a sleepy ballad to me.

1125
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:46,680
I think I discovered I think I actually ended up over researching this dig.

1126
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:49,480
And I want to know, can you show me?

1127
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,800
That's not the name I know.

1128
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,640
I like that, too, though. I don't want to put it.

1129
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,840
I don't it's not like by heads and shoulders like in my mind.

1130
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:00,920
Sure. All the same zone of, you know, Kevin, I feel like you're not a fan

1131
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,600
of any of this from. No, no, no. I love them all.

1132
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,400
That's the thing is the only the saving grace of this film,

1133
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,640
because I remember seeing it and being like, why is this?

1134
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,960
Why do they make a sad version of George of the Jungle?

1135
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,280
I mean, which I think came out before, right?

1136
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,200
Is that right? In the same time, right around the same time.

1137
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,240
And apparently Brendan Fraser did read for Tarzan.

1138
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:24,680
Who the hell is Tarzan?

1139
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,280
Doing you know who it is?

1140
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:30,200
It's the actor who plays the president on Scandal. Oh, yeah.

1141
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,840
Strange. Forget his name.

1142
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:34,760
But I thought that was just such an odd thing.

1143
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,920
Yeah. Also, if you go to the Wikipedia page,

1144
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,880
the story by credit is given to

1145
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:47,280
nine, 12, 15, 18, 21.

1146
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,120
People have story by credits on Tarzan.

1147
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,320
Wow. Wow. 21.

1148
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:55,400
Like this being, you know, an old book.

1149
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,840
Like how many people needed to crack the story of a preexisting old book?

1150
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:03,280
Right. Yeah. Well, I mean, I guess back in the day, what they I mean,

1151
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,200
my Michael Isers wanted to get rid of this when he came into the company.

1152
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,320
But, you know, when they were making really great movies in the dark age

1153
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,960
after Disney's death, I mean, they were doing it the way they always had,

1154
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:14,640
which is they didn't.

1155
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:19,120
They just had the halls lined with with paper and just like that.

1156
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:22,200
Every every single frame or every storyboard of the animatics they created.

1157
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,760
They didn't write scripts.

1158
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,120
And if they need to change something in the story,

1159
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,320
they just walk down the hall and change that part of the story

1160
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,920
and put up a new piece of paper with what's happening on screen.

1161
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,600
Oh, gosh. So it might be a situation like that.

1162
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,680
But sorry, back to the soundtrack.

1163
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,840
OK, I don't want to keep derailing because I'm just reading this fascinating

1164
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,120
Wikipedia page.

1165
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:42,920
Well, I yeah, that Wikipedia page, I the filmmakers talk

1166
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:49,160
so much about two worlds, one family is really the core idea of the movie.

1167
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,680
And it just gets repeated.

1168
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:55,240
So every all the writing about the movie, it's like you have to understand

1169
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,920
the hands, the symbol, the symbol is the hands.

1170
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,200
Two worlds, one family.

1171
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:04,960
It's just like, Jesus Christ, you're really hitting the nail on the head.

1172
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,640
And then in the show, of course.

1173
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,560
By the way, I don't know how much we've said this is like not so much.

1174
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:15,560
This is if you've seen like the Beauty and the Beast musical at Disney,

1175
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,440
where it's not like that.

1176
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:19,520
It's not like that.

1177
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,760
No, no, no. That's what I'm saying is there's, you know, it's not like a

1178
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:26,800
a series of scenes from the film condensed into a live show.

1179
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,040
This is a rock concert. All right.

1180
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:31,760
There's a band visible on stage.

1181
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,240
And when they in about a couple of songs in, they introduce themselves

1182
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,640
and they say that this is the two worlds concert tour

1183
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,960
where we all come together for this journey to begin.

1184
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:47,600
What can I can I can I describe the first like five minutes of this performance?

1185
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:50,840
Because I've watched it like 20 times and I'm like, please do.

1186
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,240
Yeah. On the soundtrack, I do love the soundtrack.

1187
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,480
I cannot I can only remember the song I've heard last

1188
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:01,280
because they all sound the same to me until I hear them.

1189
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,720
And then like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1190
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:09,840
It's just like, yeah, it's just a heart, a heartwarming Belton.

1191
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:13,320
And if anything I've learned from Tarzan Rocks,

1192
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:17,800
it's that these songs are only good if Phil Collins is singing them.

1193
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,040
Yeah, it's the only thing that works about that soundtrack.

1194
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:25,960
And when it's kind of like three barely harmonize and,

1195
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:28,840
you know, Florida performers.

1196
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,480
Yeah, it's rougher.

1197
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,960
Phil Collins has figured out the encryption of music

1198
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:38,360
and that no cover will even be possible if it's not sung by him.

1199
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:41,240
He's created a musical style that only works with his voice.

1200
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,120
But the I guess the first five minutes, the it starts with saying like,

1201
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,160
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Tarzan Rocks.

1202
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,920
And it's in the theater in the wild, which is currently

1203
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,200
we're finding Nemo the musical is just at the stage.

1204
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,680
This is pre Everest or I think that's where.

1205
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:58,760
Yeah. Which it's like, oh, yeah, this is this is Animal Kingdom.

1206
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,720
And it's not a zoo still.

1207
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:05,480
And so you you have the guy come on.

1208
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,840
You have Tarzan Rocks and big letters.

1209
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,720
Also, this is not enclosed.

1210
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,320
I should mention that because there's, you know, back in the day,

1211
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,040
this thing was not finding Nemo the musical.

1212
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,160
It wasn't all enclosed.

1213
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:16,720
So you are outside technically.

1214
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,960
It's an open air amphitheater like the Hollywood Bowl.

1215
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,920
You see a concert.

1216
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:21,760
Yeah, I mean, it's a concert.

1217
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:22,480
It's a concert for this.

1218
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,360
The two worlds tour.

1219
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,480
I mean, this is Leeds.

1220
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,360
Am I at live at Leeds with the who?

1221
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,960
Is this the Isle of Rite?

1222
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,120
This place looks rockin.

1223
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,560
You're at Bonnaroo, man.

1224
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,600
And it's it starts similar to how Mickey's film our magic starts

1225
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,840
in that there's like there's characters off screen.

1226
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,640
So if Mickey's farm magic starts with, you know, goofy being like,

1227
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:48,120
and he like, you know, walks up the stairs and does all that, it's cool.

1228
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,520
This one does not start like that.

1229
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,920
This one starts with audio clips from the movie.

1230
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,360
Nothing has indicated that the show is starting.

1231
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,000
These people might as well be saying, like, put on your 3D glasses or watch out.

1232
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,600
But it's like literally just clips of being like Tarzan.

1233
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,840
He's he's he's a man.

1234
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,680
And it's like it's like unrelated.

1235
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:09,440
And then the the characters like come through the aisles like the.

1236
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,520
And I guess this is when we can we can someone else can describe,

1237
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,680
because I'm not going to do it justice.

1238
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,480
What these these animals, I guess,

1239
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,880
the trapeze artists or the roller skaters, I don't know.

1240
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,920
Someone please help me to describe.

1241
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,480
OK, so they're kind of like they kind of look like

1242
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:32,000
the more locks in any production of the time machine,

1243
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,400
be it stage or screen, like they're kind of ape like,

1244
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:39,640
but they're also kind of like just generic, like there's I mean,

1245
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:43,600
they're supposed to look like great apes, but they are on roller blades.

1246
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:51,840
They they kind of look like the shrub people who hide in yards and

1247
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,680
like like as part of a SWAT team and attack people.

1248
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:00,360
But if they shaved just like 70 percent of their on body shrubbery.

1249
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:03,200
Yeah, like a ghillie suit.

1250
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,440
Yeah, there's felt ghillie suits mixed with rollerblades.

1251
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,120
I just immediately was like, oh, Starlight Express.

1252
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:13,600
Yeah, oh, putties like some of the pariaginic putties.

1253
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,680
They kind of reset the Power Rangers had.

1254
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,320
Yeah, in case you don't know, goons that were called putties, like the

1255
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:21,400
turtles had foot soldiers and they were just people that were going to get

1256
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,600
the shit kicked out of them. But yeah, they were.

1257
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,160
Yeah, very scary. They looked a little better.

1258
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,360
They that's a little darker, a little better.

1259
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:31,200
That that's kind of what these guys look like. Yeah. Mm hmm.

1260
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:36,360
So they're they're running around and the stage just gets populated.

1261
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:41,040
Yeah, just it's already full and the curtains haven't even opened yet.

1262
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,240
Immediately full.

1263
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,760
Uh huh. Just just so we're clear,

1264
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:48,640
Tarzan does not show up until 14 minutes.

1265
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,600
No, we're on minute three of my explanation.

1266
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,080
Minute three. The lead.

1267
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:58,560
And he any like any leaves about three minutes later.

1268
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,120
Yes, Tarzan barely present in Tarzan Rocks.

1269
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,000
It's really weird.

1270
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:09,120
But who is present is like a guy who I I describe as a glam Ryan Styles.

1271
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,400
That's the singer of the band.

1272
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,840
My description would be Craig Kilburn,

1273
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,440
just regular with no regular Craig Kilburn.

1274
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,840
Regular Craig Kilburn.

1275
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:21,360
While people are doing Cirque du Soleil

1276
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:28,800
s acrobatics everywhere on stage like this is also not to jump around too much

1277
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:32,760
because Kevin, I think you were building to the moment where, yeah, there's acrobat,

1278
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:37,080
there's ropes and skaters like what's going on?

1279
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:40,880
We walked into a Cirque du Soleil franchise, what's happening?

1280
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:44,760
And then a big guitar hit.

1281
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:49,200
A second curtain opens behind the first curtain.

1282
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:52,120
Or it's more of a tarp drops

1283
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:58,840
revealing scaffolding with a multi-layer scaffolding with a bunch of musicians on it.

1284
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:01,760
And it's very much in that Jesus Christ superstar.

1285
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:05,680
Yes. Mold or the musicians are on stage.

1286
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:08,200
This isn't some Rodgers and Hammerstein.

1287
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,400
There is rock on stage with you.

1288
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,640
And scaffolding also of the time, rent, I believe rent uses scaffolding.

1289
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,840
That's a very 90s thing.

1290
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,120
But it's very renty.

1291
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:23,120
And I imagined somebody in the Disney organization having to pitch like

1292
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:27,000
there's something there is a movement happening in New York theater right now.

1293
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:27,840
I don't know if you know about it.

1294
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:32,600
There's this little play called Rent, and it is revolutionized the way people

1295
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:38,320
are having to bring the bringing the culture of rent to the family friendly

1296
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,640
organization of Disney.

1297
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:44,120
There's like a model and they like pull it, pull it off like multi-tiered staging.

1298
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,600
But wait a minute, that's just scaffolding.

1299
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:48,120
Why haven't you dressed it yet?

1300
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,880
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1301
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,440
Also, that this is a musical.

1302
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:57,040
Yeah, like I don't know if we fully explain the Beauty and the Beast

1303
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,720
like show that used to be at MGM Studio.

1304
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,800
Is it still there at Hollywood Studios?

1305
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:02,320
Probably.

1306
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:09,040
I mean, that's that's the that's Tony Baxter, the book report kind of version

1307
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,520
like the abridged version.

1308
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:15,640
You get the story, you get the songs with the show, though it is a book report.

1309
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:21,760
Yeah, I but this is more like a jukebox music like like the leader of the pack

1310
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:27,800
or like whatever that Billy Joel one moving out like this Jersey boys, the

1311
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,720
spirit, the spirit of it.

1312
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:33,080
And it's it's a menagerie of songs.

1313
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:37,640
There I was a young ape man with my whole life ahead of me.

1314
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,680
Little Johnny Tarzan.

1315
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:45,800
Yeah. And I have to give credit like you pay for Phil Collins.

1316
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:50,000
You want to get your money's worth, you know, you want to get those songs in there.

1317
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,000
You want to get your use of them.

1318
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:55,840
So we kick immediately into two worlds.

1319
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,400
But as Kevin said, a little a little it's not the vocal force of.

1320
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:08,080
We've got Craig Kilmore and he's backed up by like the choice of their style.

1321
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,280
I wrote down they're kind of like Meredith Brooks, the singer of the song,

1322
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:15,320
Bitch. Yeah, yeah, there's two Meredith brothers in there in like leather trench

1323
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,600
coats and bustiers.

1324
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,400
It yeah, I don't know how the stage is full.

1325
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:25,720
And that's the thing that I can't get over is how full the stage is.

1326
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,960
Very busy. Yeah, very busy.

1327
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:33,360
I mean, this is a great encapsulation of a thing I think I brought up before,

1328
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:37,720
which is like the the theme park idea of rock and roll.

1329
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:41,880
Like it's where it's very it's it's inoffensive.

1330
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:46,280
It's got the tenets of rock and roll, but there's nothing really.

1331
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,080
It just kind of is.

1332
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:52,560
It works with the basics, such as coming out, asking how people are doing,

1333
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,240
receiving a response, saying, I think you can do better than that.

1334
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,920
Asking again and the response being higher.

1335
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,640
To answer your question, the backup singer is like kind of pirate ask

1336
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,960
like a lot of lacy, long, slipping sleeves.

1337
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:10,160
You know, in general, this video reminded me of the thing that we experienced

1338
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:12,720
in Buena Park, California, the Pirates Dinner Adventure.

1339
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:16,280
And that it has people on ropes and acrobatics.

1340
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:21,000
And it made me wonder why we as a society don't value acrobatics more.

1341
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:24,120
Why are we not impressed by acrobatics?

1342
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:25,960
I know it's really hard to do.

1343
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,960
It's it's so impressive.

1344
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:31,760
The the the full all around body strength of these people.

1345
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,480
And yet a theme park show with a ton of acrobatics you leave going is OK.

1346
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:39,800
Well, I would argue that perhaps this is not on the artistic level of a Cirque

1347
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,920
de Soleil. That would be my argument.

1348
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,040
This might not be a show as well thought out as something

1349
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:51,200
that Tarzan and Jane stuff with the the silk where I forget what that term

1350
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,480
exactly is, but they're using the sheet there.

1351
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:56,960
They are like just holding themselves up and soaring around the stage

1352
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:00,640
with these sheets and they're just wrapped around their arms.

1353
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:04,200
That was a there was a very similar part.

1354
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,400
Exactly the same, I guess, in the Pirates.

1355
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,360
Pirates. And it was impressive there.

1356
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,760
It was. It's a very impressive thing.

1357
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,520
It's used to convey, I think, lovemaking.

1358
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,520
I think it's a sex like it's a stand in for that.

1359
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,880
But it is a very physically impressive feat.

1360
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:21,960
Those of us who've had sex know that when you have it,

1361
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:27,280
it feels exactly like soaring through the clouds while gripping onto a fabric.

1362
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,880
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1363
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:32,280
Your massive forearm strength is required.

1364
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,640
It is interesting.

1365
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,760
It's all in the forearms.

1366
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:38,040
It's all in the forearms.

1367
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:41,600
The dulcet tones of a khaki wearing open shirted man.

1368
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,000
Khaki. Yeah.

1369
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:48,720
Semi-formal like this is this is me going out to a semi-formal dance.

1370
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:52,040
I really did not want to be at in high school.

1371
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:55,560
Why do you think there was a version of Tarzan rocks on the

1372
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:59,520
in the blue sky period where this man had a Tarzan outfit on,

1373
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,320
at least like a loincloth type thing?

1374
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,160
I would imagine that would have to have been like a certain point.

1375
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:06,760
They're like, well, let's make it a kind of a jungle band

1376
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,880
as opposed to dress like Mark McGrath.

1377
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:12,280
Yes, you're right. He's a very McGrath as well.

1378
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:15,920
Well, the same guy who passionately pitched rent also said,

1379
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,360
there's a movement happening in music right now.

1380
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,240
Let me two words, sugar ray.

1381
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:24,880
If we don't capital, if we don't incorporate sugar

1382
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,840
ray into the parks, the teens are going to have our asses.

1383
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:33,800
It's I also it's a rare opportunity in a Disney show

1384
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,640
to see a performer wearing a big watch.

1385
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,000
Mostly doesn't happen.

1386
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Mostly they got to leave their watches backstage.

1387
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,480
Yeah. And he's really like showcasing the watch

1388
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,960
with a big fist and like pulling it down, like, look at the watch.

1389
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,760
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

1390
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:53,360
It's it's it's really bizarre.

1391
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,920
Kevin, we're watching this right now.

1392
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:56,800
Also, just on mute,

1393
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:02,160
which is perhaps the way you should watch Tarzan rocks is on mute.

1394
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,720
But just, you know, we're commenting on things sort of as we see them,

1395
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:09,640
such as the two two identically dressed

1396
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:14,840
khaki guys like sort of like standing side by side, one with a guitar,

1397
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:19,000
one with a bass, but like that lame bass, like the six string bit,

1398
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,400
like the sting bass, you know what I mean?

1399
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,880
And it's like you got to wear it way high up.

1400
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:27,320
And that's not a cool look with for rock and roll for most part, I think.

1401
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:30,680
And there are multiple guitar and bass solos in this.

1402
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:34,760
And at one point, I believe the rate rollerbladers jump over the guy

1403
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:36,040
doing a guitar solo.

1404
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:39,360
And I think in the version I watched that the audience went nuts.

1405
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:43,560
Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's yeah, that is something happened. Yeah.

1406
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:49,400
Because the thing that still I mean, if this was a comedy sketch,

1407
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:53,880
if this was maybe something more free loose than SNL,

1408
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:57,320
but if this was like an actual comedy sketch, there would be like the

1409
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:00,240
the monkey man doing roller skating would be how it starts.

1410
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:03,080
And then the tarp reveal for the Phil Collins would be a good

1411
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,240
lead into the next one.

1412
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:07,160
And then it would keep escalating with like, you know, there would be people

1413
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:09,960
dressed in giant gorilla costumes wearing like sunglasses,

1414
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,560
like shooting guns into the air.

1415
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:14,120
And then the audience would just be camels.

1416
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,480
I mean, it would just I mean, it just it would keep escalating.

1417
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:20,560
If it was like cartoon, like, you know, adult swim, like this is something,

1418
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,520
you know, I'm just it's and it almost is there.

1419
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:24,640
It almost gets there.

1420
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,720
And the thing is that every time they bring a new elements into the show,

1421
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,800
they like half it like these roller skating moves aren't that impressive

1422
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,560
other than the one where they jump over.

1423
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,840
But like they're really just like going up the ramp

1424
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,600
and then they're going down the ramp.

1425
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,480
Like, OK, I just watched one that was pretty impressive.

1426
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:43,440
But they're doing they're doing what you expect out of a roller blader

1427
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,720
and not above and beyond.

1428
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:48,640
Sure. I would like to pitch you if you're talking about

1429
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:50,280
like plusing it and adding it.

1430
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:53,320
I want poachers on unicycles.

1431
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:55,440
This is a component here.

1432
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:59,080
See, yeah, stuff like that would totally totally fit with this.

1433
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:02,000
If this was made up, like if this was made for the purpose

1434
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,480
of being ridiculous and humor.

1435
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,160
I think, yeah, sorry, keep going.

1436
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:09,960
No, go ahead. I'm I was just going to say, I think like the movie,

1437
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,000
this show should start with two murders.

1438
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:16,040
I think that that would be a really exciting way to get it started.

1439
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:19,680
And it can be it can be, you know, shown through acrobatics.

1440
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,760
It doesn't have to be a graphic thing.

1441
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:29,360
OK, somehow we have not discussed Tarzan, Tarzan, like Edgar Rice Burroughs.

1442
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:33,520
It is so weird, Disney and like the mid to late 90s.

1443
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:38,200
Like we got to make Tarzan this thing originally published in the 19 teens.

1444
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,960
And everyone is obsessed with everyone.

1445
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,600
Tarzan a few years ago.

1446
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:43,680
Yeah, there was. Yeah.

1447
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:45,640
With Kristoff Waltz was the bad guy.

1448
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,880
I forget which hunk was Tarzan.

1449
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:53,280
But like Tarzan occupies a very weird space where the the novels themselves,

1450
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:57,680
along with the early John Carter novels, also written by Edgar Rice Burroughs,

1451
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:02,240
are in the public domain, but the characters are trademarked.

1452
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:07,560
So it gets so like if you want to make a Tarzan movie or spin or something,

1453
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:11,360
you may still have to pay the Burroughs estate some money.

1454
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:17,120
And the other thing about Tarzan and this is one of my favorite Wikipedia

1455
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:20,480
isms where they just kind of drop in phrases like this.

1456
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:26,720
And this was about in the Tarzan movie page.

1457
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:31,920
Another issue with Tarzan was the inherent and overt racism

1458
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,920
in the original Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan.

1459
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:39,680
The writers consciously chose to not include any African characters

1460
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:44,000
in order to avoid this topic, which, yeah, that brings up a point.

1461
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:50,280
It's all white people in this Tarzan movie, in the Disney Tarzan movie.

1462
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:51,640
Not in the band, though.

1463
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:53,600
Yeah, no, not in the band.

1464
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,440
It's very diverse. Yes.

1465
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,240
Are the singers white khaki guys? Sure.

1466
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:02,400
But, you know, if you want to channel Mark McGrath, that's what you got to do.

1467
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:05,040
I think they were taking some of the problems from the movie

1468
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,640
and they were improving upon it here at the Tarzan Rocks.

1469
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:10,280
So you could say it's sort of the perfect version of Tarzan.

1470
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,880
They spent three minutes of this thing just undressing Jane.

1471
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,760
Just like, oh, yeah, I mean, very impressive.

1472
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:22,400
She does do like two costume changes, like behind like the big sheets with that.

1473
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:26,240
That always makes me nervous in shows like, oh, God, you have to change.

1474
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:31,480
Like you have to do a quick change on stage and it's part of it with multiple cues.

1475
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:33,840
Like, that's impressive.

1476
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:37,880
Yeah. And it kind of as terrible as this is,

1477
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:41,240
you know, that point where she takes off the final layer

1478
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:44,440
and she then like was looking around and has that weird clipboard

1479
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,320
that she's running around with to like it's supposed to look like a book.

1480
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,120
But it's definitely just like a folder

1481
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:53,080
is that she keeps like running in the monkey man on stage,

1482
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:56,280
like kind of get in her way and they like corner her and circle her.

1483
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,840
And Tarzan comes and saves her.

1484
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,520
And if you remember back to Spider-Man Rocks, there is a very problematic

1485
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:09,800
scene that is very similar with Mary Jane and the alleyway.

1486
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:11,760
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1487
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,200
Oh, yeah, I guess it's a little bit.

1488
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:18,440
Yeah, those are kind of those are sort of like street rapists.

1489
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,440
I don't I don't quite recall.

1490
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:21,320
Oh, no, you don't.

1491
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:22,680
OK, well, go back.

1492
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:25,800
And I think I read somewhere was like a huge issue,

1493
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,680
like behind the scenes of the show.

1494
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:31,000
If not that, it's just like like today, it's totally crazy.

1495
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:34,200
It's like it's very cartoony and odd and weird anyways.

1496
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:37,720
But the but yeah, no, I'm just like probably you are.

1497
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:38,480
I don't know what point you are.

1498
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,640
I'm just I'm watching this this mess.

1499
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,200
Yeah, we're out of sync here.

1500
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,320
We're watching. We're watching flips.

1501
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:45,360
We're watching.

1502
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:49,560
Yeah, we're getting so well, this I don't know.

1503
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:53,680
Tarzan Rocks 2005, this is 1210 into the video.

1504
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,400
What's the time code?

1505
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:58,320
Can you show me?

1506
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:01,480
This is in the same year.

1507
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:07,560
Well, not 2005, but in 99 when this opened just up I four.

1508
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:10,040
There was I believe.

1509
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:13,960
Oh, no, that came later in the early to there was a like skateboard

1510
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:17,920
rollerblade show at Islands of Adventure in their massive amphitheater

1511
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:20,480
that is mostly used for special events now.

1512
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:26,000
The state of rollerblading in theme parks is dire today.

1513
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,080
And we need to keep this tradition.

1514
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:33,360
Another proposal of a season for you, Kevin, is rollerblading in the theme park world.

1515
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,360
All of season six is about to land skates.

1516
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:38,800
Yeah, it's going to be great to funk land skates.

1517
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,280
Yes, you had now you have your arc with like a backwards D

1518
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:44,400
and like a slash through the E.

1519
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,040
Yeah.

1520
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,000
Can I get that timecode?

1521
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,320
Oh, it's 13 or eight right now.

1522
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:51,960
Of course, you know, we're going to.

1523
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:53,440
Hey, Tarzan just showed up.

1524
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,480
He just showed up.

1525
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,600
Tarzan looks just like Trevor Moore.

1526
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:01,640
Every version of him in the show, it looks just like Trevor Moore

1527
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:06,040
because you expect because in the cartoon, it's like a very it's a very cartoonish,

1528
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:09,920
chiseled jaw, wide jawed kind of character.

1529
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,080
And this one is just like a white guy with long hair.

1530
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,560
And all I think about is Trevor Moore and how much it looks like

1531
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,720
the this one that I'm watching looks like Trevor Moore.

1532
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:20,200
White kids, you know, Trevor, Trevor Moore.

1533
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:22,680
Yeah, that was why is Trevor Moore for sure.

1534
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,720
But I will say this guy is jacked.

1535
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,080
This Tarzan is Jack.

1536
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,640
So they got, you know, they got a hunk from Florida.

1537
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:32,200
So finally something for the moms. Yeah.

1538
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,280
And now Jane here for the dads.

1539
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:41,680
Well, well, no parasol holding lady.

1540
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:47,280
My ultimate fantasy office Max binder that they have like a dozen of backstage.

1541
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,080
So in case it gets misplaced, they have identical ones.

1542
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:53,760
This strikes the whole thing strikes me as and I don't have any information

1543
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:57,800
to back this up, but wanting to appeal more to mom and dad,

1544
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:01,720
maybe especially dad, because like with kids, if I was a kid and I like Tarzan,

1545
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:02,800
I just want to see Tarzan.

1546
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:03,920
I just want to see the characters.

1547
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,240
I don't give a shit about a band.

1548
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,360
I don't care about the singer that isn't in the movie.

1549
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:11,200
But they must have been like, well, you know, this is a more engaging thing

1550
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:13,240
because Animal Kingdom is a little more adult park.

1551
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:17,960
They must have like kind of trying to been catered to like a more adult audience.

1552
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,000
I'm guessing that's a guess.

1553
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,320
Dads like 90s Phil Collins.

1554
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:24,000
I don't. Some dads, some dads do.

1555
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:27,480
I'm just saying that was probably their thought process,

1556
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:31,000
because you would just go with a pretty straight ahead Tarzan show.

1557
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,920
I would think I understand they don't have the problem that the characters don't sing.

1558
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,120
I think, yeah, I want to see the car.

1559
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:38,960
If I was kid, I want to see the characters.

1560
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:42,880
If it's going to be mostly music, I want to be encouraged to sing along.

1561
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:48,200
Oh, OK. Not me, Jase, but like as I feel like there's a lot of sing along stuff

1562
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:50,320
in the park. Am I wrong? Am I crazy?

1563
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:54,840
Because if we jump around a little bit, the audience, of course,

1564
01:24:54,840 --> 01:25:00,080
gets a big chance to get involved with the performance of Trash in the Camp,

1565
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,160
which is when the our beloved

1566
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:07,560
our beloved Turk comes out who has a headset mic on who has.

1567
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:10,080
Yes, that's the best part. Yes. Yes.

1568
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:15,400
The Rosie O'Donnell monkey in a headset mic, similar to today's

1569
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:20,360
hit TV series, The Masked Singer, in which the microphones are useless

1570
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,520
because the people have to be miked on the inside.

1571
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:26,880
In this case, Turk is probably re-recorded by a Rosie O'Donnell soundalike.

1572
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:30,600
And she gets this great intro of you seen her in the film.

1573
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,800
Now see her like you've never seen her before.

1574
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,200
Give it up for Turk.

1575
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,440
Comes out with a headset mic.

1576
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:39,520
The audience is divided into into sections.

1577
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:43,640
And, you know, one half does baby, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,

1578
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,480
and the other half does about that data over it.

1579
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:50,360
And this proceeds for in my in my memory,

1580
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,360
75 minutes.

1581
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:59,640
I I I truly hate that in any live performance

1582
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:03,360
where it's like, all right, like how long it takes to go like, OK,

1583
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,840
so this half of the audience is going to say,

1584
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,520
Waboo, and this half is going to say, Waba.

1585
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,000
And I hate doing it at UCB.

1586
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,600
Like sometimes like hosts do that to pump up.

1587
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:18,400
Like it's like those are hosting to promote a show in a few days.

1588
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,880
And they're like, pop up the crowd.

1589
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:21,520
And it takes so long.

1590
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,160
And it kind of works.

1591
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:26,080
When Turk hosts UCB shows, that's how she plays it.

1592
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:27,640
Well, Turks always a hit.

1593
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:30,840
I like Turks. Did you never go to a oh, sorry, I cut you.

1594
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:31,600
No, go ahead.

1595
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,360
I was going to say, did you ever go to a Ben Folds show with just him

1596
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:36,720
on the piano or he'd make you do the horn part to army?

1597
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:40,280
Yeah, that's the best version of the army.

1598
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:43,200
And what's the other one? Not the same. Not the same. Yeah.

1599
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:46,840
That's the best version of it, because he's actually teaching you octaves.

1600
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:51,320
That's a little more going on than just bibbidi, bop, bop, skibbidi.

1601
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:56,760
I'd also like to point out that the did you guys know about the recorded version

1602
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,760
of Trash in the Camp, the Phil Collins version of Trash in the Camp,

1603
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,520
as opposed to the film one?

1604
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,480
No, I don't.

1605
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:09,120
Why he couldn't do that alone to tear apart a whole jungle campsite.

1606
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:11,880
He needed help from his boys in in sync.

1607
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:13,960
Yes. Yeah, I knew this.

1608
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:14,760
Yeah. Yeah.

1609
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:19,720
And everybody seems Phil seems very like gunpoint about it.

1610
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:22,080
He's like they wanted to do a pop version.

1611
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:26,000
And I, you know, I thought I had to, you know, do something different.

1612
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,400
And he never goes on to say, and the in sync boys are brilliant.

1613
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:33,160
And I had a great time. That does not happen.

1614
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:36,440
It is more reciprocal of the other way where J.C.

1615
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:40,840
Chazee says something about, you know, when you get a call

1616
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:46,000
to be part of a Phil Collins song, you're like, yeah, I think so.

1617
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:50,080
Big J.C. really selling it.

1618
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:54,800
Also in the video, super like bad era of timber, like bleach blonde.

1619
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:57,640
Oh, yeah. It was his Stan era.

1620
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,320
It's that's that's a that's a rough vid.

1621
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:04,640
But I guess I'd rather watch Phil and in sync scat

1622
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:07,720
than how this plays out in the Orlando show.

1623
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,440
Yeah.

1624
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:12,040
Are you synced up with us now, Kevin?

1625
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:13,400
They're in the rope.

1626
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:15,600
They're they're making love, I think, at this point.

1627
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,120
No, what's this?

1628
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:21,680
There's a big there's a big circular sheet that dancers are spinning around.

1629
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:23,520
It's like a kindergarten game.

1630
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,440
Yeah, that's the whole thing.

1631
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:28,880
Can I get a time code like 18 or 1847 right now?

1632
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:30,320
1847, I'm trying.

1633
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:35,240
I'm so that was like they were swinging around on those ropes.

1634
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:37,160
They didn't have any harnesses on there.

1635
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:40,480
It's solely holding themselves like it is like.

1636
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,920
So do you know about the accident?

1637
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,520
Oh, oh, God.

1638
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,800
No, I want to know, can you show me?

1639
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:52,640
Yeah, there was an accident and I found it because all I all I could find

1640
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:55,040
it was on a message board

1641
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:58,960
because somebody yes.

1642
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:02,840
So this is on mouse pad dot mouse planet dot com.

1643
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,480
Even even better yesterday.

1644
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:06,840
My oh, sorry.

1645
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:10,840
In-laws and my cheese trap slash ear holes.

1646
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:15,680
Tale of space in the part of the scene of Tarzan meeting Jane.

1647
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:17,040
He prepares to swing on a vinyl.

1648
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:20,720
This is before this on a hydraulic lift wire and soar above the stage

1649
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:22,800
and crowd before picking up Jane and doing the same.

1650
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:26,160
At this showing, Tarzan was lifted about 20 feet in full swing

1651
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:29,400
when the wire gave way and dropped him to the stage risers

1652
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:31,840
where he crashed into the legs of the musicians.

1653
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:37,000
He stood up and exited stage right Jane after witnessing this ran off stage left

1654
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:40,000
and the curtain immediately closed a voice stated, Dear guest,

1655
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:43,360
due to unforeseen circumstances, this showing of Tarzan rocks

1656
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:45,880
is immediately canceled.

1657
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:51,440
And there were this was not the only message board post about this incident.

1658
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,600
There were other messages.

1659
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,760
I found another post from a different.

1660
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:59,680
I think it was, let's see, the dis boards dot com.

1661
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:01,560
I found and I'm not making that up.

1662
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:05,800
That's not that that that they also somebody was like, is that guy OK?

1663
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:06,680
Is anybody know?

1664
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,520
And like no one had any information.

1665
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:09,760
I think they were saying it was OK.

1666
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:12,160
Walked off on his own will.

1667
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:14,960
Well, but sometimes you stand up and you pass out dead.

1668
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:17,040
I mean, a few minutes later, so.

1669
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:22,080
Niche. Was there any was there a was there a third account on mouse snout dot com?

1670
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:26,240
Mouse snout did not have I didn't go back in the archives on mouse.

1671
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,200
That's a premium site, Scott.

1672
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:30,040
Mouse, you got to pay.

1673
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:32,720
I mean, I've been paying 15 a month ever since.

1674
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,560
Yeah, I'm going broke because of mouse snout.

1675
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:38,560
You could have bought three seesaws for that.

1676
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:42,840
About like, you know, I they were running this show

1677
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:46,640
multiple times a day for seven years.

1678
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:50,240
So I guess that is like accidents are going to happen.

1679
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:53,400
Just statistically, you don't have to be PR for something here.

1680
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:56,240
No, but I mean, I don't I don't know.

1681
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:59,160
Well, people I feel like when there's accident, people in the past

1682
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:02,360
have been like, why didn't you talk about this accident on this ride?

1683
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,920
Or worst case like, why didn't you talk about this death?

1684
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:09,160
And it's like, well, it's a little ghoulish to jump right to that

1685
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:11,200
and then jump back into jokes.

1686
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,040
But this sounds like an accident.

1687
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:14,480
It sounds like people were OK.

1688
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,000
I haven't funny accidents.

1689
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,520
That's why I read it. Yeah.

1690
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:21,360
Well, yes. Immediately saying immediately canceled.

1691
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,040
Yeah, sort of. Yeah.

1692
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,960
That tips it into funny.

1693
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,960
I wish they'd kept going and just.

1694
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:28,720
All right. So exit to the back of the theater.

1695
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:29,680
Remember, trust your heart.

1696
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:32,240
Let fate decide. And two worlds.

1697
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:35,400
I kind of wish they went up to the guy with this open shirt, the lead singer.

1698
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:36,960
I mean, like, you're going to have to fill in, buddy.

1699
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,680
You're going to have to do the swinging with Jane in the

1700
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,320
whatever the material on the ceiling.

1701
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:46,240
Grab hold of this fabric and we're going to pull you up.

1702
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:47,360
I don't know. Yeah, come on.

1703
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:48,320
You've seen the show a bunch of times.

1704
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:51,520
And then he grabs like his pants, the knees, and he goes,

1705
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:55,920
I knew I wore these for a reason to say and unzips his full length khakis

1706
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:57,520
to reveal khaki shorts.

1707
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,160
Unzips.

1708
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:02,240
Yeah. Remember those were big for a while.

1709
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:04,800
The khakis that it zippers like at the knees.

1710
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,320
And then you can make them short.

1711
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,800
You would zip off the legs and they would be shorts.

1712
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,160
I sure do, Jason.

1713
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:15,680
I think I may have been to Disney World circa 2000 and worn pants very much like that.

1714
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:16,880
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1715
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:22,160
I don't think I ever owned any, but I remember admiring like that's very utilitarian.

1716
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:23,200
Very smart.

1717
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,080
Very cool.

1718
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:24,640
Very cool.

1719
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:28,400
And you would beg your mom for 10 years before you finally got some.

1720
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:35,520
But grudgingly buying them at Old Navy, the cheapest store available.

1721
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,040
Sure. Oh, we had a lot of Old Navy.

1722
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,040
Any fond pants memories, Kevin?

1723
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:47,760
That's my in this conversation.

1724
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,680
I can't talk about anything else.

1725
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,920
It's my only segue.

1726
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,000
Unless it's about khakis.

1727
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:59,120
I have no khakis information that is relevant to the discussion.

1728
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:01,840
I did find a...

1729
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:07,280
I forgot to go through my proper channels of research for this episode.

1730
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:08,160
So sorry to me.

1731
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:09,760
Sorry from me.

1732
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:14,320
But I did do it just now and I have found the press release.

1733
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:19,280
I don't know if you already found this from May of 2000 for the show.

1734
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:19,920
Oh, please.

1735
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,400
Yeah. So I read through it.

1736
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,320
It's very short.

1737
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:27,440
And here's a few of my favorite quotes.

1738
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:29,520
This is the writer and director of the show.

1739
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:33,600
He said, if I had only one word to describe the show, it would be fun.

1740
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:37,600
There's so much going on up on stage and depending on where you sit,

1741
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:44,160
you will see a different show, which is so true because at times I feel like two different people

1742
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:51,200
wrote two different shows and they just did both of them because it feels like there is a rock show,

1743
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:52,960
just a classic rock and roll.

1744
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:53,840
We don't need acrobats.

1745
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,200
We got our guitars, man.

1746
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:56,000
We don't need to.

1747
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:56,960
We can shred.

1748
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,160
We don't need shred on skates.

1749
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:00,160
We can shred on this guitar right here.

1750
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:01,120
Like classic guy.

1751
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:04,160
And there's another person saying, no, we got monkey acrobats.

1752
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:05,440
We got roller skates.

1753
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:07,200
We got people swinging on vines.

1754
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:08,080
We got Tarzan.

1755
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:08,720
We got Turk.

1756
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:10,720
He has she has a microphone.

1757
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:11,840
And then you know what?

1758
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:12,560
We'll do both.

1759
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:19,200
And let's just put them everywhere because it's the funniest thing is in the first video I watched

1760
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:20,320
where they have two different angles.

1761
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:23,680
They keep cutting back and forth, which doesn't work because there's two different shows and two

1762
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:24,320
different casts.

1763
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:30,480
But it was funny is they keep cutting to different areas of things that are happening at the same

1764
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:31,120
time.

1765
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:35,120
So it'll cut to like Tarzan and he lands and in the back, Phil Collins is still going.

1766
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:39,120
And then it'll cut to like a person that he's like, he flies up and you realize after like the

1767
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:42,560
first 20 minutes of the 30 minute show, you're like, this is all happening at the same time.

1768
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:44,320
This isn't just like a highlight reel.

1769
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,640
Like this is just chaos on stage.

1770
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:51,520
Josh Birkbeck Yeah, to direct a video of this, you know, the guy who put this on YouTube did

1771
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:57,200
an admirable job because I think if you had 12 cameras to cover this, could you really do it

1772
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:57,680
justice?

1773
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,200
How could you possibly cover everything?

1774
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:04,320
It's two shows, one family.

1775
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:09,680
Josh Birkbeck The second interesting thing about this article is they say that the reason they

1776
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:16,720
had skaters is because the skaters were the animation reference for Tarzan sliding on the

1777
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:18,400
tree trunks in the movie.

1778
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:19,520
Oh, interesting.

1779
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:21,120
Josh Birkbeck So that's just a fun fact.

1780
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,960
And then this is fun.

1781
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:27,360
Josh Birkbeck Yeah, that's just that's actually like a solid fact, like a fun fact.

1782
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:31,600
Josh Birkbeck That reminds me of one that I love, which is that the how the inspiration for

1783
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:37,360
Aladdin was Hammer with his big pants and shuffle around and he's faster than lightning.

1784
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:43,440
And that's how a little that's how a little street rat could hop around of evading evading

1785
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:49,040
police and stealing bread, which Hammer also had to when his finances at the fan.

1786
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,960
Josh Birkbeck Once his cartoon went off the air.

1787
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:55,360
Hammer also the inspiration for Hammer Man.

1788
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:56,320
Little known facts.

1789
01:35:56,320 --> 01:36:02,480
Josh Birkbeck And then the final interesting tidbit of this is that Tarzan.

1790
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:03,520
This is the last line.

1791
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:07,120
Tarzan rocks is expected to stay at the animal kingdom for about three years.

1792
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:13,360
It doubled its expected life expectancy, which is amazing because I've never

1793
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:16,160
seen this before where they say like, yeah, it's only going to be here for a few years.

1794
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:19,920
Like as like why they put an expiration date on the press release.

1795
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:20,880
I guess.

1796
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:23,680
Josh Birkbeck Yeah, doesn't indicate confidence, does it?

1797
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:28,960
And the other but the what they were confident in the beginning because this opened like

1798
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:32,640
less than a month after the movie, I think.

1799
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:33,520
Yeah, you're right.

1800
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:40,320
June this opened in July, like so they had to prep this like simultaneously with the movie release.

1801
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:45,280
Well, it's not nearly as impressive as the legend of the Lion King, which came out months

1802
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:49,760
before the Lion King came out, which showed at the Fantasyland Theater where Phil our magic

1803
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:50,720
currently is.

1804
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:54,720
They had a Lion King show and that it was puppets and clips from the movie and that

1805
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:56,720
came out before the release of the Lion King.

1806
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:57,280
Wow.

1807
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:59,520
And they like did they had all the songs in it and stuff too?

1808
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:00,560
Yeah, the whole thing.

1809
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,800
You saw the whole movie before the Lion King was released.

1810
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:03,280
That's a while.

1811
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:03,840
I didn't know that.

1812
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:09,440
Well, we talked about on the animal king animal kingdom, like kind of overview episode.

1813
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:15,440
It's tough to be a bug opened months and months before a bug's life hit theaters at like Black

1814
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:15,920
Friday.

1815
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,800
So dinosaur, right?

1816
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:19,040
Yeah.

1817
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,280
You would see were spoiled at the Lion King show.

1818
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:26,160
So, you know, you knew everything that happened on like a big spoiler of a puppet show.

1819
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:26,480
Yes.

1820
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:26,720
Yeah.

1821
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:27,920
Big spoiler puppet show.

1822
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:29,840
I would never do that now.

1823
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:35,840
No, no, they just they just had that that that 20 VFX guys losing their minds, creating red

1824
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:39,520
herrings and trailers and then getting the entire internet to attack them for it.

1825
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,360
Who did they cut out of Pride Rock?

1826
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:44,480
Who is he holding up?

1827
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:48,880
I mean, like what do those people go home like?

1828
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:49,760
What do you do for a living?

1829
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:53,520
I create red herrings and movie trailers to throw off audiences and tick off fan bases.

1830
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:59,760
What would be very funny if when the Aladdin movie comes out and he isn't blue at all and

1831
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:03,200
he's just a man, he is just like, hey, what's up?

1832
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:04,960
And then people like, what the hell?

1833
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:10,320
I would love it if he just if Aladdin rubs the lamp and then a Toyota Corolla just pulls

1834
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:14,800
in to create like a genie gets out of it or a stagecoach.

1835
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,640
Like if Genie just drove a car.

1836
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:16,880
Yeah.

1837
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:18,560
To Wild Wild West.

1838
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:19,600
Sure.

1839
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:24,480
Oh, I mean, if Jim West, if they can tie together the Jim West mythology.

1840
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:28,880
Well, they can because the genie is supposed to be self-referential.

1841
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:33,440
I hope all of his pop culture references are just Will Smith movies.

1842
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:34,080
Oh, yeah.

1843
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,840
Hope this goes better than after Earth.

1844
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:38,960
Wild Wild West.

1845
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:41,920
When I roll it to the wild, wow.

1846
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:43,520
Oh my gosh.

1847
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,200
What part are you at?

1848
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:46,960
This went back.

1849
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:47,520
It was over.

1850
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,200
I was just jumping around.

1851
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:49,840
32.

1852
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:50,720
They're looking at the no.

1853
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:52,720
Jane is explaining how binders work.

1854
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,040
She's got a trapper keeper.

1855
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:55,440
I think.

1856
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,800
Please go to 2715 and just press play.

1857
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:02,880
2715.

1858
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:03,360
All right.

1859
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:04,160
Here we are.

1860
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:07,120
You get a great wide shot of the stage and all the crap that's going on.

1861
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:08,400
And then there's something happens.

1862
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:09,040
It's amazing.

1863
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:13,440
Church just walks in front of the camera.

1864
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:13,920
Oh, yeah.

1865
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:14,720
Yeah, we saw that.

1866
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:21,200
And two of the performers, two of the performers did that to in another

1867
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:26,800
part of the video where it's like if they saw a video camera, they would kind of play to it.

1868
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,480
We're going to have to post multiple versions.

1869
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:32,640
This one that we're watching and then the other one with the unnerving,

1870
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:35,280
like two different hosts simultaneously.

1871
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:39,680
And one of them kind of looks like Phil Collins and the other looks nothing like Phil Collins.

1872
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:41,520
Yeah, because he's got the shaved head.

1873
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:41,840
Yeah.

1874
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:46,800
And every time I watch, no matter what performance I watch, it always feels like

1875
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:52,240
an improv group that you're watching to where like it's fine.

1876
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:57,040
But if you really look into the people on stage, you can tell that they don't like each other.

1877
01:39:57,040 --> 01:40:02,160
Plus that they're ready to attack one another for things they're doing during the performance.

1878
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:04,560
Like right after this, they're like, what the hell was that?

1879
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,480
And they're just going to throw their skates down.

1880
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:08,800
It's like, we'll get out there every night.

1881
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:09,280
Too real.

1882
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:10,320
No, sorry.

1883
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:13,200
Acquiree on improv groups, gentlemen.

1884
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:16,560
Jason and I improvised together for many, many years and it's a hundred percent true.

1885
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:17,120
Whoops, sorry, I can't forget about that.

1886
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:20,560
You have so much contempt for each other by the end of the run.

1887
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:27,440
Do you think Turk was stronger with like initiations or third beats?

1888
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:34,000
Turk was not very good, but had a lot of ideas about theory.

1889
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:36,640
He was great with support moves.

1890
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:38,480
Yeah, it was good.

1891
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:42,320
He would say, we're in a diner or we cut to a diner.

1892
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,400
He would do any of those type of moves.

1893
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:44,960
Can someone-

1894
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:47,200
We're in a camp and we're trashing it.

1895
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:51,840
Turk, you've given a suggestion in the last 12 shows.

1896
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:57,120
Okay, can someone clarify, is Turk Tarzan's mother or friend?

1897
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:58,240
Turk is friend.

1898
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:59,040
It's friend.

1899
01:40:59,040 --> 01:40:59,600
It's friend.

1900
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:00,000
Okay.

1901
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:03,600
Glenn Close is Tarzan's mother.

1902
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:05,840
Bring it back around.

1903
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:08,720
I know, maybe Driver was the voice of Jane.

1904
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:09,840
That's good casting.

1905
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:11,280
Yeah.

1906
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:16,560
Turk is not to be confused with the characters from Disney's Dinosaur.

1907
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:21,200
Yar, Kron, or Plio.

1908
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:24,320
Turk is not Kron.

1909
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:26,080
I don't want to say this again.

1910
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:28,080
I confuse Turk with Plio a lot.

1911
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:31,840
I can use Turk and Plio a lot.

1912
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,120
Very easy to confuse.

1913
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:37,840
By the way, I also just did not shoot past the fact that there was a

1914
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:40,800
Phil Collins, Rosie O'Donnell collab.

1915
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:44,240
Let's not miss that fact in this world.

1916
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:46,720
On the same track.

1917
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:47,440
Yes.

1918
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:49,680
Finally, they all met.

1919
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:54,000
A bunch of cutie patooties, if there ever were.

1920
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:59,280
Do you think I would bet money that someone involved in this movie at some point

1921
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:07,600
said the phrase of, as we are about to enter the millennium,

1922
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:10,480
we need to remember two worlds, one family.

1923
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:11,840
Now more than ever.

1924
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:15,200
You know they must have laid it all out.

1925
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:16,400
Why 2K?

1926
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:18,960
Well, let's not forget.

1927
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:24,240
I was also recalling this on my Instagram recently with the Super Bowl having just passed.

1928
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:28,640
There was a stirring performance of two worlds on the Super Bowl halftime show

1929
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:33,840
for the millennium celebration, which was interspersed with very...

1930
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:39,680
What you just said, Jason, essentially is said by a very sedate Edward James Olmos,

1931
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:43,040
filmed in the closest shot in Super Bowl history.

1932
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:48,560
And what is Phil Collins wearing for his Super Bowl halftime platform?

1933
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:49,120
Khakis.

1934
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:50,160
You know it.

1935
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:53,920
And I think he might have those zippers that we were talking about too.

1936
01:42:53,920 --> 01:43:00,960
I think the ball that dropped on midnight, January 1st, 2000, was wearing a pair of khakis.

1937
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:04,480
They changed it.

1938
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:11,680
The ball unzipped his two khaki legs, revealing fresh hip khaki shorts for this

1939
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,840
hip new millennium.

1940
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:19,680
So much of this is...

1941
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:21,840
I'm glad we picked this topic.

1942
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:26,880
It's very ripe for this conversation for this platform.

1943
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:34,720
Another thing I have to say about the Phil Collins stand in this is you don't realize

1944
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:37,360
it until they start doing it and it takes you a bit.

1945
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:42,880
They all have choreographed beats to hit, to where they're doing these very simple rock

1946
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,160
and roll dance moves.

1947
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:47,600
So they'll do like, you know, point over your shoulder, point over your shoulder,

1948
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:48,560
now clap in the air.

1949
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:52,080
And they have to do that move at a very specific time in every show.

1950
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:54,400
What happens in between is up to them.

1951
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:57,360
So what happens is he's like, you know, this is my moment.

1952
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:58,000
I'm rocking out.

1953
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,520
This crowd's really pumped.

1954
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:02,560
This is almost the end of the Best of Two Worlds tour.

1955
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:04,560
Not the Best of Two Worlds, the...

1956
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:06,880
Whatever, the Two Worlds tour.

1957
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:08,320
I really got to do this.

1958
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:09,040
And so he's out there.

1959
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:10,480
He's like way out there.

1960
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:11,440
He's all the way at the front.

1961
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:12,400
He's on the edge of the stage.

1962
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:13,440
He's ready to take his shirt off.

1963
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:14,640
He's like, son of a...

1964
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:17,200
I got to go back there and do the over the shoulder, over the shoulder, clap in the air.

1965
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:20,720
And then he runs back and he's like over the shoulder, over the shoulder, clap in the air.

1966
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:23,760
And then he's free to come back and get in the way of the acrobats.

1967
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:29,280
It's so funny because he only goes back to do those few choreographed dance moves.

1968
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:32,960
Pump to the right, pump to the left, step, step, step, okay, back on stage.

1969
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:35,680
It must be a union thing.

1970
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,960
So have fun with it, but not too much fun with it.

1971
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,640
Those were his instructions.

1972
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:44,640
Because you probably would have gotten yelled at if he didn't.

1973
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:48,080
Because like, we choreographed this and like, I'm always interested because I don't know the

1974
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,040
answer to this.

1975
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:52,160
How much the director watches these shows?

1976
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:55,840
Because somebody is a director for them, but they run them five times a day.

1977
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:58,960
How often are they getting reprimanded for doing something bad?

1978
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:03,040
Like that Disney's California Adventure Aladdin show, they ran five times a day.

1979
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:07,440
Was the director just would show up once a week to check in to make sure that they were doing

1980
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:10,080
the right hand gestures and the right part?

1981
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:13,360
Like how often are these people getting checked out?

1982
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:15,280
So like, yeah, did he get reprimanded?

1983
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:16,000
I don't know the answer.

1984
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,120
I'm just asking this question.

1985
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:18,960
I'm sure an expert would know.

1986
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,920
I actually wanted to do the Aladdin show, but I stopped myself.

1987
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:25,280
I want, I don't know if you've done it already.

1988
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,000
We're bracing ourselves.

1989
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:32,560
That show is incredible and I loved it.

1990
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:36,640
I'm still sad it's gone and that's why I didn't want to do it because I just couldn't bring

1991
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:38,880
myself to make jokes about it because I think it's perfect.

1992
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:44,720
That's why I did not want you to talk about Tomorrowland 94.

1993
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:48,000
Because I'm so attached to it.

1994
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,080
The futures that never were, I mean.

1995
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:52,560
So that's a joke-free episode you're dictating now.

1996
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,640
No humor will be allowed.

1997
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:57,120
Bring me back.

1998
01:45:57,680 --> 01:45:58,400
I have some notes.

1999
01:45:58,960 --> 01:45:59,760
How do you want to do this?

2000
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:01,120
Do you want to like, you go first and then I go?

2001
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:06,960
Or just like hold a very, very strict and corporate about our very detailed opinions.

2002
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:09,280
No, but like Aladdin's great.

2003
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:10,400
It's still on the Disney fantasy.

2004
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:12,160
You can still see the show, which is awesome.

2005
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:17,520
I don't know where you're scathing in from right now.

2006
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:19,920
Are you on the Disney fantasy right now?

2007
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:22,880
Does my audio quality sound like that?

2008
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:27,120
I just imagine that's where you're making all of these videos.

2009
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:30,720
You just like booked a suite on one of the Disney boats.

2010
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:33,200
He's in like the captain's quarters.

2011
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,160
Maritime taxes are actually quite manageable.

2012
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:40,160
So tax breaks for making YouTube videos at sea.

2013
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:40,960
Right. Exactly.

2014
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:42,800
There is.

2015
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,240
Okay. So I'm sorry.

2016
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:47,600
The tangents, who cares, right?

2017
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:51,120
Okay. So the, I have taken Disney cruises and they're amazing.

2018
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:55,680
They have this morning show they do and you can look it up on YouTube.

2019
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:58,880
It is the least produced Disney thing you will ever see.

2020
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:00,160
And it is hilarious.

2021
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:04,640
Every time the cruise directors will do one every morning.

2022
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:08,240
So it seems, or pretty much like every other morning, they will record.

2023
01:47:08,240 --> 01:47:10,080
Like a today show style morning show.

2024
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:13,120
A today show morning show of what's going on around the ship.

2025
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:16,960
Like let's go check out the bippity boppity boutique every morning.

2026
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:21,520
And I don't know if they reuse certain parts, but you know, they film these things in one take.

2027
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:24,240
If the camera moves, if it gets stepped on, it's okay.

2028
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:26,080
And they show them on your stateroom TV.

2029
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:28,080
It's incredible.

2030
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:28,640
Watch it.

2031
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:30,000
Whoa.

2032
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,040
We got a book.

2033
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:32,640
This is your return.

2034
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:35,040
Scott, Scott, her video content.

2035
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:38,640
Like poorly made video content.

2036
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:41,040
For a micro specific location use.

2037
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:43,520
Yes. This is, this is certainly my wheelhouse.

2038
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:44,640
Oh my God.

2039
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:45,760
Second Trojan horse.

2040
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,360
Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2041
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:50,480
Yeah. That's your, that's your Trojan horse into the second gate.

2042
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:53,200
I think it was for you.

2043
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:54,240
You needed one for both.

2044
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,600
So all right.

2045
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:57,440
Well, let's start wrapping it up.

2046
01:47:57,680 --> 01:47:59,600
The final thoughts.

2047
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:00,720
Do you have any final thoughts?

2048
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:01,200
I want to know.

2049
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:01,840
Can you show me?

2050
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:05,520
I'm not gonna let this go.

2051
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:10,000
My fine.

2052
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,880
I, this is this well, how many years was it?

2053
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:13,200
Seven.

2054
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:14,720
Seven.

2055
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:18,400
Seven years after people stopped thinking about Tarzan.

2056
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:21,920
Yeah. I mean, I like that.

2057
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:23,840
I wouldn't mind if it still existed.

2058
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,520
Honestly, this is a, this is a fun thing.

2059
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:28,560
I would annoy people with taking them to for sure.

2060
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:31,840
So like I would, I would like it if it was still there.

2061
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:35,200
So I can't as much as we can goof on it, like I can't put it down

2062
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:38,160
cause this is like something I would go, Hey, we could go to Tarzan rocks.

2063
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:39,920
And I would be like, Oh my God.

2064
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:42,800
Cause that's what happened with the Aladdin show a lot where I go, we only

2065
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:44,080
Google see Aladdin again.

2066
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:44,960
And people would be like, no.

2067
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:50,880
And I'm about to be like this with Mickey's mixed magic, which I saw for the first time last week.

2068
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:52,080
I just want to warn everyone.

2069
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,320
Like, you know, we should go over and see Mickey's mixed magic.

2070
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:56,880
So this is right up my alley.

2071
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:59,760
I can't, I've, I've goofed on it enough.

2072
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:00,880
I wish it still exists.

2073
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:09,200
I have, I have a little plus set up something that was just sitting there waiting to happen.

2074
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:14,960
With this, with a merger of Tarzan and Phil Collins, I want a big gorilla

2075
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:22,000
playing the, in the air tonight, drum fill like that commercial that's sitting there

2076
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:22,720
waiting to happen.

2077
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:27,280
They don't even have to do the whole song if they want to avoid some, some copyrights.

2078
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:30,320
If they don't want the legal arm of Phil Collins coming after him, like,

2079
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:31,680
like they did me like having to me.

2080
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:38,320
So that's, that's sitting there a 20 piece drum set gorilla playing it otherwise perfect.

2081
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:43,840
I would have liked a little more lip service to me.

2082
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:48,160
So I wanted like twice as many Tarzan yells.

2083
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:52,640
And I wanted the singing narrator guy to go like, Hey, what are you doing?

2084
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:54,720
You're supposed to be at MGM studios.

2085
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:59,200
You know, like a little, a little bit of that 90s self-aware humor.

2086
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:01,200
Like a Johnny Weiss Mueller.

2087
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:03,120
That's a reference to like the animatronic.

2088
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:05,120
It's like, Hey, you're supposed to be in the great movie ride.

2089
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:05,440
Right.

2090
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:06,480
Oh, I didn't see.

2091
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:11,280
You got to fill it in a little bit.

2092
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:11,440
Yeah.

2093
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:12,560
I got to fill it in a little more.

2094
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:12,880
All right.

2095
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:14,480
That's thematically inconsistent.

2096
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:17,680
The, that's good.

2097
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:18,160
That's fair.

2098
01:50:18,160 --> 01:50:18,400
Yeah.

2099
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:20,160
I mean, 90s bringing them back.

2100
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:20,960
No, I think it's funny though.

2101
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:25,760
The yells that they do is completely pre-recorded and plays on tape, which is hilarious because

2102
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:30,080
the Tarzan is more concerned about not dying than he is about making sure that his lip

2103
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:31,040
syncing works.

2104
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:34,640
So if you go back and watch it, it's just like, Oh, okay.

2105
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:35,680
I got to get this thing off.

2106
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,440
They just gives up and the track keeps playing.

2107
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:42,160
But like, should it still be around?

2108
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:43,360
Given what replaced it?

2109
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:49,360
I wouldn't mind this still being around because at least it's crazy

2110
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:53,520
and fun and there's acrobats and things to watch because finding Nemo the musical.

2111
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:55,360
Have you all seen finding Nemo the musical?

2112
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:57,920
I don't think I have.

2113
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:58,560
I have not.

2114
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:00,880
Have you seen finding Nemo the movie?

2115
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:01,760
Yes.

2116
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:02,080
Sure.

2117
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:07,920
Take out all of the pauses, add 12 songs and condense it to 40 minutes.

2118
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:11,680
It is, it is the fastest paced thing.

2119
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:16,640
They're like, we'll be damned if we don't get every single plot point in this 35,

2120
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:17,680
40 minute show.

2121
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:21,120
But we are going to also add 12 songs.

2122
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:23,840
It is the most fast paced, like the mom dies.

2123
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:26,000
And then all of a sudden it's like, it's time for school.

2124
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,440
And then it's like, it's so quick and fun and terrible.

2125
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:32,960
But I mean, the puppetry is really cool, but I don't know theater in the wild,

2126
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:33,840
Tarzan rocks.

2127
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:35,360
I say stick with it.

2128
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:36,960
I think it would still work.

2129
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,560
I like the idea of it.

2130
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:42,400
So well, why can't the two worlds tour be a real tour?

2131
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:44,080
Why can't they send this on the road?

2132
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:44,560
Right.

2133
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:45,040
Yeah.

2134
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:50,080
Bring it to where we are in LA and bring it to you on the boat.

2135
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:53,120
Bring it to the boat, baby.

2136
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:56,400
As the helicopter lands and Tarzan swings down.

2137
01:51:57,440 --> 01:52:00,160
They did Devo 2.0 with those kids.

2138
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:03,360
I see no reason why they shouldn't do Collins Squared.

2139
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:12,400
Phil Collins tour, fronted by children singing the Tarzan songs.

2140
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:13,520
Collins Squared.

2141
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:20,000
So Collins, the one man, Phil Collins is replaced by two young children who meet

2142
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,880
the new Phil Collins and it's two little girls.

2143
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:23,120
Yeah.

2144
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:29,600
In learning, you know, I mean, the way everything's going with Disney,

2145
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:34,320
obviously, is that they're just they're just pillaging their own history and

2146
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:36,400
they're making new live action versions.

2147
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:41,680
So what are the chances that we get a new live action Tarzan in the next few years?

2148
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:43,120
Pretty high.

2149
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:44,240
Pretty high.

2150
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:48,320
So I don't think it would be out of the realm of possibility that a version of this could come back

2151
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:54,320
or this maybe, you know what, a version this exact show exact show comes back.

2152
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:55,440
Same performers.

2153
01:52:56,160 --> 01:52:57,520
Make it as a movie.

2154
01:52:57,520 --> 01:52:59,200
Make this as a movie as well.

2155
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:03,680
There's a mocap person playing the Docker singer.

2156
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:04,400
Yes.

2157
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:11,600
For some reason, a like they need an old man mocaps themselves into a 32 year old Florida singer.

2158
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:13,280
We get some Maccas on board.

2159
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:17,840
We get the Polar Express technology and I think that would be yeah, I think it would be perfect.

2160
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:23,520
And plus you can pull from the direct to video sequels Tarzan and Jane and Tarzan 2,

2161
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:26,400
which was a prequel of Child Tarzan.

2162
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:26,900
What?

2163
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:28,100
Yeah.

2164
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:31,680
This was the era of direct to DVD sequels.

2165
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:34,400
I think they should put all that stuff back into continuity, honestly.

2166
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:37,440
Yeah, I hope it's all on Disney and stuff.

2167
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:37,940
Yeah.

2168
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:39,360
Return of Jafar.

2169
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:40,960
Aladdin 3.

2170
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:42,960
I love Return of Jafar.

2171
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:44,080
Return of Jafar is not bad.

2172
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:46,320
I remember like, oh yeah, and his dad was like hot.

2173
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:46,820
Yeah.

2174
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:48,080
Yeah, you got a hot dad.

2175
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:50,160
And Gilbert Godfrey has two songs in it.

2176
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:54,080
As a kid, I loved that Yago had two songs.

2177
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:55,280
Yeah, that is fun.

2178
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:56,960
Jafar had a hot dad?

2179
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:58,800
No, Aladdin had a hot dad.

2180
01:53:58,800 --> 01:53:59,300
Yeah.

2181
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:02,080
All right, well then that's my request.

2182
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:03,840
My plus up to Tarzan Rocks is-

2183
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:04,720
I also think Jafar probably had a hot dad.

2184
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:06,800
I want Jafar to have a hot dad.

2185
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:07,300
Yeah.

2186
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:08,480
Jafar is a hot dad.

2187
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:09,920
I mean-

2188
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:10,880
Yeah, that's true.

2189
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:11,200
Yep.

2190
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:12,960
I guess he's creepy.

2191
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:14,560
He's creepy.

2192
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:15,760
He's evil, never mind.

2193
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:16,560
Please cut this up.

2194
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:23,200
All right, so yeah, videos are back in continuity.

2195
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:29,520
I want to see Jafar's hot dad and the Tarzan feature film is Tarzan Rocks.

2196
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:30,000
Yes.

2197
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:35,040
We've all agreed on many points and I feel good about what we figured out.

2198
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,760
I think with that, Kevin Perjury Survive Podcast The Ride.

2199
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:41,840
Thank you so much for being here.

2200
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:43,120
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2201
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:44,160
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2202
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:50,400
Yeah, go to youtube.com slash defunctland, twitter.com slash defunctland.

2203
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:53,120
Go check out the series if you haven't already.

2204
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:54,160
I'd really appreciate it.

2205
01:54:54,160 --> 01:55:01,200
And if you are already watching, keep watching for that Ken Burns Vietnam where Michael Eisner

2206
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:06,960
returns and all of the- and hopefully I can work in disgraced pervert Senator Larry Craig.

2207
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:14,240
I'll pitch you one might be easier because Ken Burns did that incredibly- very good but very

2208
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:17,600
long baseball documentary, Wide World of Sports.

2209
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:18,800
Think about it.

2210
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:19,600
Okay.

2211
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:22,640
I don't know much about it.

2212
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:29,760
Yeah, I want to- yeah, let's have an eight part series about a defunct gymnasium.

2213
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:30,720
Yeah.

2214
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:34,240
This is Atlanta Breeze spring training there for a year.

2215
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:35,600
This is the last season, I believe.

2216
01:55:36,160 --> 01:55:40,480
Okay, we had defunctland rocks, defunctland skates, and defunctland-

2217
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:41,520
Plays ball.

2218
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:43,360
So we had defunctland plays ball.

2219
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:44,320
Baseball.

2220
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:44,720
Play ball.

2221
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:46,080
Defunctland at the bat.

2222
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:49,280
I'm here with my friend Senator Larry Craig.

2223
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:52,080
It's not bad.

2224
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:53,360
It's really good.

2225
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:56,960
I think defunctland rocks should be called defunct band while we're still out there.

2226
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:57,840
I mean, that should definitely-

2227
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:58,720
Oh, defunct band?

2228
01:55:58,720 --> 01:55:59,920
Yeah, that's good.

2229
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:00,420
Uh-huh.

2230
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:02,800
I think you just start fictionalizing them.

2231
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:05,840
At some point, you've proven your storytelling capabilities.

2232
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:06,880
Just start making shit up.

2233
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:07,680
Just make shit up, yeah.

2234
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:10,640
Fan fiction about Eisner and Larry Craig going on a road trip.

2235
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:14,000
You're going to approve Disney's America.

2236
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:15,280
I can't.

2237
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:18,400
We're going to build it ourselves illegally.

2238
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:21,760
Buy some lumber, we're doing it.

2239
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:24,480
You're going to go into that room and you're going to approve Disney's America.

2240
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:26,320
How are you going to make me do that?

2241
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:27,200
Anyway, there you go.

2242
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:29,360
Eisner pulls a gun on-

2243
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:30,960
I have a gun.

2244
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:32,800
Hello?

2245
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:33,440
I have a gun.

2246
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:34,240
I have a gun.

2247
01:56:34,240 --> 01:56:36,240
I have a gun.

2248
01:56:36,240 --> 01:56:37,120
I'm not afraid to use it.

2249
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:41,680
Fickle, often angry, murderers.

2250
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:44,160
Yeah, well, brings us back around to your quote, doesn't it?

2251
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:44,720
Yeah, yeah.

2252
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:48,240
Unfocused fickle, often angry, often carrying a gun.

2253
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:52,960
I do like to think that Michael Eisner watched a version of Tarzan Rocks the year before

2254
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:55,840
all the crap went down and he was just like, this isn't going to play well.

2255
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:04,160
I think he watched it and rocked out, made devil horns and banged his head.

2256
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:05,760
The guy's going to have a rocking good time.

2257
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:06,720
I'm Michael Eisner.

2258
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:07,280
This rocks.

2259
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:10,160
Hello, I'm Michael Eisner.

2260
01:57:10,160 --> 01:57:10,960
I'm ready to rock.

2261
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:11,680
I'm ready to rock.

2262
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:13,200
I love to rock.

Kevin will be talking to us about the boat exclusive morning shows.

These are on YouTube.

2271
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:49,600
Yeah. Is this real?

2272
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:52,160
I'm going to be very sad if this isn't a thing.

2273
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:53,600
If you don't bring me back.

2274
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:54,720
No, I don't know.

2275
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:56,960
I think we're all sold.

2276
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:57,760
I don't think we will.

2277
01:57:57,760 --> 01:57:58,240
Fantastic.

2278
01:57:58,240 --> 01:57:59,520
Yes, these are on YouTube.

2279
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:00,080
It's a real thing.

2280
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:01,520
I'm super happy about this.

2281
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:02,160
Oh, yeah.

2282
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:05,360
We're all going to have to get we're all going to have to go on the boat.

2283
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:07,440
Yeah, to go on the boat.

2284
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:07,920
All right.

2285
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:09,840
We're hitting the open seas.

2286
01:58:12,240 --> 01:58:13,520
Kevin, thanks for being here.

2287
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:15,280
