1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,240
Dog.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,400
Warning, the following podcast contains some big news

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,360
from me and some big questions from you.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,160
Papa Scott welcomes you to Podcast The Ride.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:38,840
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, a podcast about theme parks hosted by three childless men in

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,840
their 30s.

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,520
No longer.

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,400
I am Childed Man in his 30s, Scott Gardner, joined by Uncle Mike and Uncle Jason.

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,960
How are you?

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,520
What if that was the way you told us to?

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,680
That would have been something.

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,400
Yeah, wait.

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:00,280
Oh, I mean, I was trying to surprise the listener, but this whole time I could have

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,080
surprised the host too.

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,080
No, I actually don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

17
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,040
So what's up?

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,240
Oh crap.

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,600
I thought I saw you on there.

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,960
OK, well, I got a lot to tell you.

21
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,160
You know I got a new phone.

22
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,520
You know I switched to Android.

23
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,000
I got a new phone number and really messed up my entire life.

24
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,440
I also I thought you were just like trying to be polite to Erin and not bring it up.

25
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,400
I guess clearly you haven't been paying you were paying a lot of visual attention for

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,320
a little while there.

27
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,400
Well, she kept standing behind pillars holding boxes, you know.

28
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,480
Like like a Veronica's closet actor, you know.

29
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,120
Conveniently passing donkeys and camels a lot of the time.

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,800
Yeah. So, yes, it's true.

31
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,960
The news is true.

32
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,520
Yeah, I'm I'm a dad, everybody.

33
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,560
I'm I'm Papa Scott now.

34
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,560
Let's make that permanent.

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,280
I'm going by Papa Scott, which which sounds I mean, it is good, but it sounds a little

36
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,880
it does sound a little similar to pop a squad.

37
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,440
So I'm not I'm not thrilled about it in that regard.

38
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,240
But I am thrilled because I just I just had a baby.

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,800
My wife and I just had a baby.

40
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,880
And just to be very clear, this is not some extended bits.

41
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,520
And we're talking about Rex or something, though we do respect him as number one.

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,360
We have had a second child.

43
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,880
And and let's do the gender reveal as well.

44
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,000
It's a good boy. Whoa.

45
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,240
Wow. He's a very good boy, everybody.

46
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,840
He really is, too.

47
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,800
I mean, I was going to say that regardless, but I certainly would characterize him

48
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,280
having met him now as a good boy.

49
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,080
Yes. Do you I mean, are you already like are you already gauging like

50
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,000
how good he's going to be with certain drop rides or

51
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,520
launches?

52
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,360
I yeah, I'm doing like a conversion

53
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,880
scale kind of on my body.

54
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,920
Like if I lift him up this high at his size, how many feet is that

55
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,120
equivalent to a Tower of Terror or to a lesser one, just like a camp Snoopy

56
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,160
kind of thing?

57
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,200
I I think, you know, a Tower of Terror.

58
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,520
Well, I guess if I if I got up like on a high flight of stairs and I jumped down

59
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,920
and he was in my arms, then that that that might be like a Tower of Terror height.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,120
But I probably couldn't like jump way back up to that.

61
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,880
It's hard. It's hard to do a launch.

62
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,520
Right. Yes, I see what you're saying.

63
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,080
Well, yeah, you say that because I now that reminds me of when Joe Rody

64
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,400
was describing what his philosophy was when he when he

65
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,000
reskinned the Tower of Terror into Guardians of the Galaxy Mission Breakout,

66
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,960
is that he wanted the car to simulate the fun of getting tossed in the air

67
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,440
like you're a baby.

68
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,000
Oh, you better believe I've thought about that when I've held him

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,840
like any like just kind of sudden.

70
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,600
I'm not actually jumping around with him just to be clear.

71
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,400
There's no Michael Jackson hijinks.

72
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,280
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

73
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,200
I think even if you did even just like a slight elevation, he doesn't even

74
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,640
respond to yet. He's very he's very new, by the way.

75
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,040
We're recording this.

76
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,960
He's not even two weeks old as we record this.

77
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,360
So but yeah, when he

78
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,200
I'm certainly not giving him a throw any time, but I with that Rody explanation,

79
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,960
I'm excited to do that.

80
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,040
I'm excited to give him him little rides.

81
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,600
You know, I'm thinking about the theme park angle of all this.

82
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,880
I was trying to theme the room,

83
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,000
creating a imagineering a themed environment for my son.

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,800
It's wonderful.

85
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,160
Yeah. Would you like to tell the listeners how

86
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,680
and where you told us?

87
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,200
Because it's very clear in my mind.

88
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,680
Do you? Yeah, I love that I can say that.

89
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,000
That for you, for the for the long time listeners of the show, that

90
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,720
Aaron and I told Mike and Lindsay and Jason in Epcot Center.

91
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,680
We were in World Showcase.

92
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,400
I think we had just left the Mexico Pavilion and

93
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,400
I and knowing that, yes.

94
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,520
So we knew right before we did our Orlando trip back in October.

95
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,920
And I definitely was in the effort to, you know, imagine

96
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,800
here a fun little breaking the news moment.

97
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,840
It was crazy knowing like, oh, I think I think we get to tell

98
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,400
the guys in Disney World. That's going to be nuts.

99
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,200
Yeah. What a what a perfect on a Disney World trip.

100
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,280
So crazy. What a what a way to heighten it.

101
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,000
It was so boggles.

102
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,160
And we were like we were trying to find the right moment, too,

103
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,120
because I knew it was going to be

104
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,960
it was going to end up being a problem because there were going to be rides

105
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,120
that Aaron could not go on.

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,840
Yeah. And and we ended up there just wasn't the right moment to say it

107
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,000
on the first day when we were in Disney Hollywood Studios.

108
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,200
So I'm just going on Tower of Terror and rock and roller coaster without her.

109
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,600
It was all it was all such a bummer.

110
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,520
I know she like specifically was really dreaming

111
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,960
and hankering to go on the original Tower of Terror.

112
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,720
So that was a bummer.

113
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,640
And we all got to go on the new Hagrid's coaster.

114
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,800
We had to like, you know, with our crazy connections, jump on that thing.

115
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,440
And she just had to sit back and hold our back.

116
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,880
Which we we made a point not to pull the Can You Hold My Bag?

117
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,520
Yes, very often.

118
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,920
But the Hagrid's thing was kind of last minute.

119
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,920
So we didn't know where to put anything.

120
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,600
Kind of quickly. Yeah.

121
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,840
So it's chaos around there.

122
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,760
And it really to use a Simpsons analogy,

123
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:03,040
it was a lot like Lisa coming back from the itchy and scratchy movie.

124
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,600
And like, so how was it as OK?

125
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,080
And I'll be honest, it's the greatest thing I've ever seen.

126
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,400
Exactly. I mean, it was hard to suppress the excitement

127
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,600
over that ride and several other rides.

128
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,360
So, Aaron, I just want to say,

129
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,680
I'm sorry we'll get you on all of those things.

130
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,040
I owe you a lot of bags held.

131
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,760
And I guess so does so do you guys, too.

132
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,200
Yeah, yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's true.

133
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,760
We didn't like, you know, she was sitting.

134
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,880
We didn't like, you know, just keep comically

135
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,320
handing her bags that weighed her down slowly and then,

136
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,200
you know, blocked her face in the end.

137
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,680
Like it was right. She was comfortable.

138
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,440
Well, well, look, if these parks open within the next year or two,

139
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,960
we'll go I'll hold the bags. Jason will hold the baby.

140
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,440
Hey, all right.

141
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,480
Give them all give them all a drop right.

142
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,880
Yeah, I'm the yeah, I'm the au pair.

143
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,200
You guys can bond over having extremely persnickety stomachs.

144
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,480
Yeah, Scott, I I do have to tell you,

145
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,440
I don't think I've ever told you this story.

146
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:16,080
But the night before you told us, Mike and I were at a bar

147
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,560
and I actively said the phrase, hey, did you notice we've been out of town

148
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,560
for three days and Aaron hasn't had a drink once?

149
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,520
You did notice.

150
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,240
Yeah, we were definitely because, yes,

151
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,600
it's a tell. It's definitely a tell.

152
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,600
I think I said, yes, I did notice that.

153
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,040
We were wondering and we thought about telling you guys at the

154
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,240
what's the place, Bahama Breeze?

155
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,920
You're thinking of the Schaumburg, Illinois, Bahama Breeze on Golf Road.

156
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,640
There's a restaurant.

157
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,960
It's a chain called Bahama Breeze that we went to after Woodfield Mall

158
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,960
to, you know, just get a nightcap as you do in Schaumburg.

159
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,800
What did we order? We ordered that was like a flight, right?

160
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,280
Or you had a flight.

161
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,360
You had a rum flight. Yeah. Yeah.

162
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,560
So in comparison, you must have.

163
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah, you must have been a little fishy that I had a flight,

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
which I didn't finish, and that Aaron next to me did not touch the flight.

165
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,160
Yeah, that's that's all a little insane.

166
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,400
Yeah. Oh, man.

167
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,640
That's that's so funny. You guys noticed it didn't.

168
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,480
We were wondering, especially because we kept.

169
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,920
There were other people who we told just because we had this twice

170
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,160
where we went to a restaurant, a drink order was placed.

171
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,520
And Aaron said, just a just a sparkling water for me.

172
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,080
And especially this was her dad was one of these scenarios.

173
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,200
Her dad gave her the biggest raised eyebrow glare I've ever seen.

174
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,120
And she just like, fine, I'm pregnant.

175
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,480
They could not hold it on. Hold it in.

176
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,760
I'm just saying you guys have a reputation you uphold.

177
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,000
Hell, yes. Yeah, it's it's pretty crazy.

178
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,760
And that's that's the main thing.

179
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,000
Look, if if if Aaron's if Aaron's listening back to this,

180
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,120
obviously, I am so impressed by your

181
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,560
you know, by your strength getting through the pregnancy and through the,

182
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,840
you know, through the delivery and everything.

183
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,880
But the drinking thing primarily and especially because we were in Epcot

184
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:21,080
Center during the Food and Wine Festival and you did not have a single drop.

185
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,800
And oh, my God, the fortitude, if that doesn't show that she could be

186
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,360
an incredible mom, then I don't know what does.

187
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,280
Yes. Kudos to Aaron.

188
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,280
That's it's that's a very hard scenario all around.

189
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,440
We could do an abracadabra.

190
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,040
There's so much we couldn't get done.

191
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,200
Couldn't do an alcoholic Star Wars milk. Right.

192
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,240
Yeah. Yeah.

193
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,560
All that combined with the, you know, incredible heat and, you know,

194
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,480
it was it wasn't as fun of a trip for for Aaron.

195
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,520
We ended up we ended up having a good time. Sure.

196
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,440
Oh, my God.

197
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,560
We it was such a bummer to like to to get that to realize what was happening

198
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,840
and go, oh, my God, Disney World. Oh, yeah.

199
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,040
I realize also it's possible that at some point in time,

200
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,480
because this is kind of a little verbal record of the birth of my son,

201
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,640
it's possible he could be hearing this someday.

202
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,480
So maybe I should cool it on the swears for a little bit. Hmm.

203
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,120
Yeah. What age would you anticipate he starts going into the back

204
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,360
catalog of your paywalled podcast?

205
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,200
Wait, is this a paywall?

206
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,160
Is it a wall? I thought it was a main feed.

207
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
I think it's OK.

208
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,280
I think my this is the second time during quarantine that I've been incorrect

209
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,400
about where the episode we're currently recording is going.

210
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,040
Well, who know? We don't know what date is.

211
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah, I know.

212
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,800
Literally, the main thing I have had besides a couple like Zoom

213
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,200
things is is recording.

214
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,320
That's the only thing on my calendar is recording and like,

215
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,200
oh, I'm sorry.

216
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,320
I took it off your calendar for a little bit.

217
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,760
Our boy took it off your calendar.

218
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,240
Oh, that's OK. I mean, that's the other thing we have.

219
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,080
We've been going.

220
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,680
We've been working hard for a while now to get a backlog,

221
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,920
to get like a buffer.

222
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,240
Yes. And which thank you, guys.

223
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,160
Thank Mike and Jason.

224
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,880
Thanks so much for that, for building up the

225
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,440
the catalog that could exist if I need to do a paternity leave.

226
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,520
I don't know that I super will because he is pretty mellow at the moment.

227
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,600
But you just, you know, just in case some crazy thing was going wrong.

228
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,920
It's nice to have the cushion.

229
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,600
But so, yeah, for our listeners, with that, I don't think you'll hear.

230
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,720
You won't get a break from me if you wanted a break from me.

231
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,600
Sorry, I don't think you're going to get it even with the birth of my son,

232
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,920
because we've been. Yeah, we've recorded.

233
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,880
I think we have like 13 in the bank right now.

234
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,640
It's like a crazy number.

235
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,120
Yeah. And none of those reference that you have a child.

236
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,800
None of them reference that I have a child and none of them reference

237
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,000
the coronavirus.

238
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,320
I mean, I guess they start to at a point.

239
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,000
But we like, yeah, that became the issue.

240
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,440
Like that's part we were doing the backlog and then, oh, God, this breaks out.

241
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,680
And yeah, so it's like a lot is going to be missing.

242
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,680
And I guess, well, that leads me to another point,

243
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,240
which is that we had to do this during the virus.

244
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,400
And I say I don't have like a real any like jokey material here.

245
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,800
It was just, you know, we were we were very nervous.

246
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,480
It was very crazy.

247
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,480
And it sort of impacted the way we rolled out this news.

248
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,000
Actually, if I could go way back, the plan for a while was

249
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,320
we were going to do an episode with Aaron.

250
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,840
Aaron was on the show back in the city.

251
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,960
Well, it hasn't been on in a while.

252
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,120
We're going to have her come on and introduce the news, like,

253
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,640
you know, say she was pregnant and that that could be fun.

254
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,000
Right. Then

255
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,280
the day before we were going to record her episode,

256
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,480
it became clear that Fry's Electronics was installing my video and closing.

257
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,000
So bump, Aaron, that's not happening.

258
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,600
Sorry, we got to go down to fries.

259
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,640
All right. So we'll reschedule it for a couple of weeks from now and should be good.

260
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,600
Then the virus defining event of our lifetimes happened.

261
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,440
And I'm like, I don't want to tell the audience we're having a baby now.

262
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,240
They're going to be so worried.

263
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,200
Yes.

264
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,120
I think it's like it's not a fun way to break that news.

265
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,160
So what I'm happy to say is that you don't have to worry.

266
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,280
You didn't have to worry. We didn't have to worry.

267
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,680
You know, he's fine. Everybody's fine.

268
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,400
The delivery was kept so separate as a separate wing of the hospital.

269
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,520
If you are pregnant right now or if you have someone in your life,

270
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,800
you care about who's pregnant.

271
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,880
I can't guarantee anything about the scenario in which the baby will be born.

272
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,000
But we at least are a case of, you know, you can

273
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,480
you can have a baby in coronavirus times and it can be safe and not insane

274
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,760
and still just as wonderful and magical as it's supposed to be.

275
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,960
Yes, that's I mean, that's yes.

276
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,000
Having baby is stressful enough, I would imagine.

277
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,480
So it's good. It's good because I think you guys had a nice timing where

278
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,600
and not the nicest timing, but like nice timing where it was like

279
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,640
they had a few weeks to figure out exactly what was good.

280
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,040
It wasn't like the day after it hit.

281
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes. Yeah, because there was so much I didn't know.

282
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,560
I went like when the state went on lockdown, I didn't know what that meant.

283
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,960
And then you hear

284
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,040
I think some news story was going around about like in France,

285
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,360
they aren't allowing the partners in the delivery.

286
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,160
And I was there. Let me be clear.

287
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,400
If I'd use the virus is like, yeah, I'd just rather not.

288
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,120
I just I don't feel safe.

289
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,800
I mean, I know it's not a law or anything, but you made them.

290
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,520
You made them quarantine in a hotel for two weeks to before they came back.

291
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,560
Sorry, guys. Enjoy the enjoy the Radisson.

292
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,640
I know, but I think like in

293
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,160
I think it's having a little in New York and may still be.

294
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,240
I don't know. I don't want to say all this and then have somebody

295
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,080
not be able to be with their partner.

296
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,200
I think delivery, but I places. Yeah, I just don't remember where.

297
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,280
I don't think it was widespread, but I think the news story was going around

298
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,400
enough that I started getting a certain kind of text that was like,

299
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,200
hey, just thinking about you and just really want to make sure.

300
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,800
I don't doubt that's people who who care.

301
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,320
But I just started feeling a lot of dread from people.

302
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,640
And I was like, I don't hospitals never said anything.

303
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,040
I think it's going to be OK. And it was OK.

304
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,400
We just had to have masks on for a lot of it.

305
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,720
And, you know, grandparents couldn't be there.

306
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,400
But I don't know. Besides that.

307
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,000
But you're also so tired.

308
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,280
I'm like, as much as it would have been nice to see everybody

309
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,320
and have that moment, but you're like, I don't know.

310
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,960
I'm not in a state to socialize.

311
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,960
I haven't slept in days.

312
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,200
So it all it's it's it's working.

313
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,160
It's it all worked out. I'm happy to say. Great. Great.

314
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,320
Yeah. Yeah. What was what else was on my?

315
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,360
Oh, sorry. Go ahead, Jason.

316
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,200
Oh, well, I was just going to say, now that you are, you know,

317
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,680
essentially spending a lot of time with a small cantankerous creature

318
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,920
who loves to sleep 18 hours a day, I just wanted to say, you're welcome.

319
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,800
You're welcome for the prep work.

320
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,040
You're welcome.

321
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,400
Dealing with me for three years has prepared you.

322
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,600
What's this voice?

323
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,480
What's this voice coming out of you?

324
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,320
Yeah, well, you're welcome.

325
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,400
A little more grandmother.

326
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,280
Harvey Fierstein over here.

327
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,720
It is Harvey Fierstein.

328
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,840
I did was Harvey Fierstein was not.

329
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,680
Oh, I just watched the the Steven Sondheim 90th birthday

330
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,640
celebration last night.

331
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,400
Harvey Fierstein, not on, but

332
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,480
the the version of Lady Sue Lunch was done by Christine Beranski,

333
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,640
Meryl Streep and Audra McDonald.

334
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,320
So still star studded, but I beat them by a week.

335
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,520
Oh, because you did.

336
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,600
Yeah. And this is archived on Twitch.

337
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,520
You did a stirring rendition of Lady's Lunch.

338
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,160
We did a little there was in case you didn't see it.

339
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,240
There was a Disney sing along telethon, not a telethon.

340
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,640
Well, yeah, I said it was money.

341
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,360
Kind of.

342
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,240
Yeah. But yeah, a lot of people sang Disney songs from home.

343
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,960
And we decided to do a little one ourselves right after it was over.

344
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,240
Yeah, Jason, I loved your Sondheim.

345
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,200
Mike played keyboards and did a little medley of goofy movie

346
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,680
eye to eye and the and the city walk saga theme.

347
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,960
I kicked it off with I'll Make a Man Out of You with the Johnny

348
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,560
Husband's super pronounced song from Mulan.

349
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,640
Yeah, that was a blast.

350
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,080
I let me say this.

351
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,600
Oh, that also leads me into sort of the next little step of the delivery story,

352
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,520
because that was a that was like it was right before.

353
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,280
Like it was really close to when we

354
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,120
went into labor, like not the night, but it came soon after.

355
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,280
And we've been having fun with these little things on Twitch.

356
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,120
And I did a thing where I made a car thing, Manhattan at home,

357
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,120
and I did a little DJ set with with Rex, my first son.

358
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,480
And I won't I won't neglect him.

359
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,560
Rex, if you're listening, I love you just as much as before a couple of weeks ago.

360
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,960
So anyway, that was a little fun thing we did.

361
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,640
So just with that in mind, let me paint the picture of the the delivery night.

362
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,040
I don't think you guys have heard this full thing necessarily either.

363
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:31,920
Basically, I think the day that we did that little

364
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,760
our little sing along thing, we had an ultrasound that from the

365
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,040
the doctor's point of view was very like, all right, so he's doing good.

366
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,320
And, you know, I think you still got some time and, you know, he's not too

367
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,760
not not getting too deep there and you should be good.

368
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,200
So we felt like, OK, so we have a little more time to prep and everything's fine.

369
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,240
I had a glass of wine that night.

370
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,480
And then like, you know, a little bit later,

371
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,000
a couple of nights later, we're

372
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,160
thinking about that ultrasound and like, all right,

373
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,440
he's not due for a couple more weeks.

374
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,280
I think we're fine, you know, chilling out with a little drink or something.

375
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,880
Sounds nice.

376
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,400
So I we decided to go treat ourselves to take out

377
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,080
and go to a place that we miss very much in quarantine.

378
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,960
The Tam O' Shanter, Walt Disney's favorite restaurant

379
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,680
and perhaps my favorite restaurant as well.

380
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,280
So we already take out from there.

381
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,600
And on the phone, they kind of upsold me.

382
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,440
They said, you know, we have cocktails to go.

383
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,000
And I haven't done that in these quarantine times.

384
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,440
And I was like, well, hey, we're chilling out.

385
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,160
This might be one of our last nights to chill out.

386
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,040
I will do that. I will get a maple old fashioned.

387
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,440
And my

388
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,840
how do I want to illustrate? OK, so

389
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,440
we get a maple of fashion.

390
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,960
We drive out there.

391
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,240
We're chilling out, playing a game of trivial pursuits.

392
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,160
And in fact, I went and found the card.

393
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,560
I found the question that was right before things started happening.

394
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,480
And I'll actually I'll ask you guys the question.

395
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,560
I'm curious if you guys know.

396
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:06,160
OK, what reveals the pirates skeletal shapes in Pirates of the Caribbean?

397
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,520
The Curse of the Black Pearl.

398
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,760
Oh, that's a good.

399
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,440
So what? So, yeah, because they're dead.

400
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,880
I remember this. They're dead in the movie and something

401
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,040
reveals that they're dead by showing you their skeleton.

402
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,960
Now I understand the question correctly.

403
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,120
I think so. I mean, I haven't I haven't seen that scene.

404
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,400
So I don't I don't know this moment very well.

405
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,480
Is it some sort of Jason? Go ahead.

406
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,280
I think I know it.

407
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,840
Is it the moon? Is it the light of the moon?

408
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,760
It is moonlight. Correct.

409
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,520
Wow. Great. You nailed it.

410
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,480
And that's the that's the toughest one.

411
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,680
That's if you're a little six, that'd be your question.

412
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,480
Much easier than who was Johnny Depp's inspiration for Jack Sparrow.

413
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,800
Right. Of course.

414
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,600
Which is

415
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,480
Joe Perry from Aerosmith.

416
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,120
Yes, as we as we all know.

417
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,160
Absolutely famously.

418
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,040
So anyway, you got the right answer, Aaron.

419
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,840
I asked that question and her water broke.

420
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,360
Whoa.

421
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,600
The moon controls the tides, boy.

422
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,240
I feel it was a question about moonlight.

423
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,880
Davy Jones's locker.

424
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,120
Um, yeah, it would now let me let me say this about that.

425
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,720
We took a delivery class that sort of

426
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,800
underlined something for me that I didn't realize.

427
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,640
They said, you know what?

428
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,120
It's not like it is in the movies.

429
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,960
It's not, you know, that you're doing something.

430
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,200
And then all of a sudden, oh, my God, my water broke.

431
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,400
It can be a really tedious process and it's preceded by contractions.

432
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,960
And maybe you don't even feel them and you don't know what they are.

433
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,360
And then, you know, your water breaking

434
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,200
might not be so deep, deep into the process.

435
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,560
Cut to us exactly like it is in the movies, like completely unexpected.

436
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,640
No question that's what it is.

437
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,040
And as I said, weeks to go from when it was supposed to be.

438
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,120
Don't worry about the you know, he's super healthy and it's all fine.

439
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,360
Just to say that. But it totally blindsided us.

440
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,320
We put the trivial pursuit down and I am at this point about halfway through

441
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,240
my maple old fashioned from the TAMO shanter.

442
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,480
A thought occurs to me.

443
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,680
I had been seriously thinking about had they not suggested a maple old fashioned

444
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,040
to me, I had been thinking about bringing the food home and making a Carthay,

445
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,960
Manhattan, and these are strong drinks.

446
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,320
I even thought about doing one of those little twitch things.

447
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,560
I was like, oh, that'd be fun to do.

448
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,600
Maybe I'll do one more of these little DJ sets and I'll like entertain the

449
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,880
power of some of our audience over this wonderful, very strong drink.

450
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:41,880
This maple old fashioned, I think saved my life, saved my baby's life, or at least

451
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,520
the experience, like thank God for this TAMO shanter, less strong drink because it

452
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,640
was totally fine. I was not driving intoxicated.

453
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,920
I oddly was going slow for me.

454
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,880
I didn't I didn't guzzle the thing.

455
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,840
But thank that would have been just a cursed Carthay, Manhattan.

456
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,440
The Pirates of the Caribbean, the curse of the Carthay, Manhattan.

457
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
What do you mean?

458
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,720
You guys aren't taking a lot of lifts right now.

459
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,880
I guess, yeah, worst case scenario.

460
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,120
There's like one stray one 50 minutes away.

461
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,440
He's in Sylmar.

462
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,920
Hurry up, hurry up.

463
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,960
That preserves the Carthay, Manhattan, luckily.

464
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,560
Yeah, preserves it in your brain and like you'll be free to sip.

465
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:33,000
I mean, maybe tonight you could have one like there's no association with it.

466
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,880
I would love to drink that.

467
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I also, again, uncharacteristically,

468
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,800
this every step of the pregnancy has pushed the drinking because I can't imagine

469
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,520
like the energy we're doing shifts and I got to stay up pretty late.

470
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,840
And I can't admit you combine that with drinking.

471
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,520
Oh, my God.

472
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,320
So, yeah, who God, who am I?

473
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,680
That's what's happened. Like what an identity crisis.

474
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,880
I'm not drinking.

475
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:00,800
Erin and I went to Disney World and we cheated and drank for days, months, really.

476
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,080
And on top of all this, I think we have to talk about this,

477
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,240
the original tagline of the show, no, yeah, applies.

478
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,200
It's just not factual anymore.

479
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,080
I know. I've been thinking about this since you said it.

480
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,520
I was the first thing I thought.

481
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,240
That's the first thing I thought of before anything like, oh, that's great.

482
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,280
They're having a child.

483
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,840
I thought, oh, no, this ruins the tagline of our podcast.

484
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,960
Yeah.

485
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,280
I think that's the first thing my parents said.

486
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,120
Is it really?

487
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,920
I think I always got an air and I have to maybe and they're like,

488
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,640
you got to change the tagline of your podcast.

489
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,080
Multiple friends and the guests of the show have brought this up.

490
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,680
Yeah, this was this was kind of the branding.

491
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,320
And not only that, I mean, like it's been a whole thing, too, because I think

492
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,680
the idea was that that's something that we say at the top of every episode,

493
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,080
because I really like that joke.

494
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,120
It was an undeniably funny joke.

495
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,360
Jason, maybe you thought of that.

496
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,960
I don't recall.

497
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,000
But the

498
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,560
the reason we changed the jokes at the beginning is kind of because as much as I

499
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,800
like that joke, I did not necessarily want to my personal brand to be childless man

500
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,680
in his 30s because I didn't know I really didn't know.

501
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,760
And I'd be lying if I said that the tagline

502
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,080
and the joke wasn't in my head a little bit in making this decision.

503
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,120
Like I like it's I think maybe there's a way you could view this,

504
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,200
where this baby that's in the other room is here because of the joke.

505
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,280
Why was like you were proving to the joke

506
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,280
that you were going to have a child and not be a show you

507
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,640
a 30 something theme park guy?

508
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,400
I will invalidate this joke.

509
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,840
I will have a child and hopefully there will be a world with no theme parks.

510
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,280
I know that's funny.

511
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,520
You say that I feel like maybe I only said this into my own head, into my own head.

512
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,600
I remember thinking, you know, if kids come

513
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,080
into play anywhere at this at during the course of this podcast,

514
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,880
I'm also seeing this podcast as a little bit of an insurance policy for us to still

515
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:15,040
have to go to them with some frequency.

516
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,400
Yes, that is a very good point.

517
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,640
I don't know who I said it to.

518
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,120
It would kind of be justified for me to leave and go to a theme park.

519
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,760
It is work at this point, which it looks like.

520
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,840
Boy, let's flash to when you thought of that joke before all this.

521
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,560
And we were just getting all this together.

522
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,840
But now, like this is this is a was where is like a technically a job that I have

523
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:44,600
that helps my son and that that factors in and that if I go to Disneyland

524
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,560
without him, it's still in his best interests.

525
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,840
Yes, it is.

526
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,120
He yes, it's not something some weird

527
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,320
thing that his adult father does that's just bizarre.

528
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,280
It is just pure work.

529
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,640
It's just purely for his benefit.

530
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,400
Yeah, you know, you guys can all go in on that at this at this point in time.

531
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,280
You're you're doing you're doing it for him.

532
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,560
Yes, we're all doing it for him.

533
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,120
You can all print print out that that that Simpsons moment, all the pictures of Maggie

534
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,360
do it for pictures of my son and mixed with pictures of the theme parks

535
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,200
that obviously we don't really like to go to that much.

536
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Right. We got it.

537
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,040
Yeah.

538
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,840
So, you know, you're we're talking about the joke.

539
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,680
And when we were I like the joke is funny, but I did that.

540
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,320
I was always built in in my mind and I didn't know who was getting to it first,

541
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,360
who was getting to baby first.

542
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,480
But I was always in my mind.

543
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,640
And that joke probably will have to change.

544
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,800
But this will be a perfect this podcast will be a perfect reason for us to not

545
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,480
change our behavior at all.

546
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,560
Absolutely.

547
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,760
And and yeah, I mean, I should amend what I said earlier that if I go to Disneyland,

548
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,760
it's in his best interest.

549
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,600
That is a statement that will apply in twenty twenty two.

550
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,320
Yeah.

551
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,280
Even if the park opens before the end of the year, not for me, I'm not passing.

552
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,120
I'm not passing anything to that kid.

553
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,320
Yeah, no, you're like one of these drugs has to be like a mirror, like one of these

554
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:20,400
clinical trials has to just be an incredible success for, I think, even me to go

555
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:27,360
that, you know what I call I don't want to say I literally this morning or a few

556
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:35,600
hours ago was like I made the claim like the first day the parks are open.

557
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:40,080
I if one of us has to be there, it's going to be me.

558
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,840
Yes, I like, oh, there's no way the other two would go.

559
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,680
But I have like I want to see this.

560
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,840
I want to.

561
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,160
But what's this, Jason?

562
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,320
What is the scenario?

563
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,720
And I don't want to get too off off off baby talk.

564
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,320
But what is the scenario?

565
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,160
It all depends on the scenario.

566
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,120
If we've had widespread antibody testing

567
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,920
and we know some sort of percentage of people who've had it and like like there's

568
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,400
a there's a there's a variety of ways maybe I do think about going.

569
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:14,040
But if it's like they open next week and you just got to stay away from everybody.

570
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,560
Are you going?

571
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:22,520
I I don't think in that scenario, I think I have spent a lot of this quarantine

572
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,800
reading like the the speculation and the industry watchers.

573
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,960
And I think Disney being as cautious a company as they are,

574
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:38,720
I think I don't think they would open until like the eyes were dotted and T's

575
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,960
were crossed. What do you mean?

576
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:47,960
Like like stuff was not super secure, even just the way like China has only reopened.

577
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:53,160
Shanghai Disney has only reopened the shopping district and one hotel.

578
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,840
Right. But they're they're gearing up, supposedly.

579
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,240
They're gearing up. But like, I don't know.

580
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,280
We'll talk about this in a little more on this.

581
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,200
But you are. Yeah, Jason, we'll talk about it.

582
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,640
Jason, I guess. Yes, Jason, I guess will be the cover.

583
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,440
Porter chances are like.

584
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,280
I just also like just as someone who's always been interested and fascinated

585
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,040
by these places in this industry, like I'm just curious to see what it's going to feel

586
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,640
like, you know, personally as a fan and then just like as someone who covers it.

587
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,600
I want to see how people behave.

588
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,200
I want to see how the parks behave.

589
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,920
I just want to see what it is.

590
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,600
I look I obviously share your fascination.

591
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,160
I am worried about your lungs, though.

592
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,440
I will say that.

593
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,240
Well, I think I have

594
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,120
I think I'm in pretty good health, shockingly.

595
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,320
I know the portrait I portray on this show, but I really don't have a lot of ailments.

596
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,000
My last physical was fine.

597
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,200
You got a deep call.

598
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,400
You have a deep cough sometimes, though.

599
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,040
That is has not.

600
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,760
I think that is the Southern California air, Michael,

601
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,720
because I have really not have it had it very much lately.

602
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,160
The air is so great.

603
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,960
It's so clean.

604
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:11,400
It's one I really it's actually been with like having a having a son and like it's

605
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,400
maybe think about childhood, obviously.

606
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,680
And I'm like I'm like unlocking old memories and stuff.

607
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:21,200
But part of that has been I keep walking around and thinking it feels like 1994 to me.

608
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
This feels like a type because I grew up here.

609
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,280
This feels like a type of weather I haven't experienced in L.A.

610
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,800
since I was a child.

611
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,600
Wow, it's not weather, but air quality, air quality.

612
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,240
Right. Yes.

613
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,560
No, there you can notice it.

614
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,360
I think I would probably notice it more if I was living in Hollywood.

615
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,280
But it's it's surely different.

616
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,280
Yeah, yeah.

617
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,480
You can feel a difference.

618
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,880
So as long as Jason doesn't have a banana in the morning,

619
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,120
that is the entire system.

620
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,680
Not afraid of covid-19, but not afraid of an early morning banana.

621
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,920
Early morning,

622
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,160
coffee before coffee before 7 a.m. or an early banana.

623
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,480
I'm extremely curious.

624
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,840
Obviously, it is no solid foods yet and there won't be for a little bit.

625
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,040
But I will be very curious.

626
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,760
I will definitely take a picture of the first time my boy successfully consumes

627
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,640
an AM banana. All right.

628
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,240
Well,

629
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,640
oh, no,

630
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,080
now you're now you're Monday-esque rivalry with my son will

631
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,200
kick into gear.

632
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,680
We will.

633
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,680
Oh, we got to have a contest to see that Jason and your son

634
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,760
eats the same thing and see who deals with it better.

635
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,800
But there will be there'll be those things that are like, I love mashed peas.

636
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,640
I've always been big mash pea guy.

637
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,880
Let's let's OK, we probably I don't know if we're going to come upon a new tagline

638
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,120
for the show, but let's talk, let's talk.

639
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:54,600
When is when is he getting involved in the show?

640
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:00,200
When is when is because because first of all, we appreciate like this is a great

641
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,240
storyline in year three, you know, this is a great hey, just like I love Lucy.

642
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,080
We have a little Ricky. We got a little Scotty.

643
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,640
Exactly. So that's good.

644
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:13,120
So but when you know, that's what's going to be good is like when you get to go on

645
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,800
all this stuff with him. Yeah.

646
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,960
Yeah. I mean, also, you know, because it's

647
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,880
like going to be very emotional and moving, but also for content.

648
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,360
He is content.

649
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:27,120
This is the we're witnessing the first moment right now of him being kind.

650
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:32,400
If you're listening to this son, you are content also context.

651
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,080
If you're listening this way in the future, everyone in the era your dad was

652
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,680
growing up in where had to be just voracious makers of content at all times.

653
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,600
Or they would everything would fall apart and they'd starve and die.

654
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,880
Hopefully it's different in your time.

655
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,160
I don't know when he's hearing this,

656
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,920
but yeah, I don't know.

657
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,080
I mean, it's going to be nice kind.

658
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,240
I mean, it's going to unlock episodes that we can do.

659
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,520
We can review changing tables.

660
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,480
We can do a changing. Yes.

661
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,120
Final four. Maybe you can join us to that.

662
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,960
I know what else is on the table here.

663
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,960
I

664
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,840
you can do.

665
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,360
Well, you know, you know, one thing I will say just with things that our

666
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,480
audience knows about, we already know the the first Halloween costume,

667
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,680
because Halloween is a big deal. Oh, yeah.

668
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,920
That's a major thing we've been looking forward to.

669
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,440
Having a baby.

670
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,760
He's going to be truffles the bear.

671
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,920
Wow.

672
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,680
Good.

673
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,120
We can't wait for that.

674
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,360
Great choice.

675
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,720
That's that's better than Christmas, I think.

676
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:42,200
Now you will be able to and I forget what what is the like pirate or a pirate

677
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,960
equivalent of the Bibbidi Bobbidi boutique?

678
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,960
Oh, yeah.

679
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,040
I don't recall.

680
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,000
There will be some whatever that is,

681
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:57,040
whatever like the equivalent for for little boys is now you will be able to do

682
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:03,120
some you will be able to first hand review experiences that were at off limits to us

683
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,040
as men in our thirties. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

684
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,760
Yeah, there's all these things that I'm not a creep if I go to now.

685
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,560
Legoland that opens that up.

686
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,000
Oh, perfect. Well, I'll be.

687
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,880
Yeah, we all can go to Legoland because there's a child with us.

688
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,800
Everybody can go. Yes.

689
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,840
It's we're going to be a lot less judged for going into a Chuck E.

690
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,920
Cheese now. Oh, oh, I didn't even think about that.

691
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:24,880
Yeah, yeah.

692
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:30,560
Although I say I'm more worried about going into a well times Chuck E.

693
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,960
Cheese than I am about anything in the covid era.

694
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,160
Oh, I saw I don't know if this is true.

695
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,480
This is a little bit of a tangent, but I saw a headline and I really I need to

696
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,440
read the article that in order to boost sales for Chuck E.

697
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,480
Cheese during covid that people they were renaming Chuck E.

698
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,880
Cheese on the Grubhub and stuff app on the delivery apps.

699
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,600
Yes.

700
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,520
So somebody ordered from Pasquale's Pizza

701
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,080
and Wings and realized it was Chuck E.

702
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,000
Cheese, which I love.

703
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,320
It was I think that was near in or near Philadelphia.

704
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,320
And there is a Pasquale's like there are Pasquale's pizza.

705
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,640
It like unrelated.

706
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,160
So they're like, oh, I wonder if it was like that place.

707
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,560
And then it was just like, nope, it was Chuck E.

708
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,960
Cheese in disguise.

709
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,120
Oh, my God.

710
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,400
Because there's been this syndrome of, you know, and I think the famous one in

711
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:25,880
L.A. is it's Steve Aoki as a pizza place and it operates as five different kitchens

712
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:31,480
on various food delivery apps and so for what and they they owned it.

713
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:31,760
Chuck E.

714
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,120
Cheese released a statement said, yeah, we're trying new things.

715
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,720
We're trying a new business model to kind of, you know, try to find a new

716
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:42,400
audience for our delicious pizza and wings and like you're so you're pulling the

717
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:47,440
Aoki scam. That's kind of a weird little scummy thing to be doing.

718
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,840
Hey, if people if it keeps people employed, whatever.

719
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,760
But I don't Pasquale's pizza and wings.

720
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,840
They should have. It should be Helen.

721
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,240
It should be Helen or Munch.

722
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,440
That's what I think.

723
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,280
You know, it's funny. It sounds too real.

724
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,240
It would have

725
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,560
like that's they are going for an audience

726
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,200
entirely of people who don't get that reference.

727
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,920
Like if it was us making that order, we would have had them in a second.

728
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,960
That's a good point.

729
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,560
Yes, I think I guess for whatever reason, your average American doesn't know the name

730
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,280
of the pizza chef that was discovered by Chuck E.

731
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:26,400
Cheese in the kitchen playing on the pie plates, his full name being Pasquale P.

732
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,360
Pie plate.

733
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,480
That's right. And again, if I could, you know,

734
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,280
allude to a world where my son is listening to this, hey, bud, your old man

735
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,240
spent a lot of time thinking about the various robots and the Chuck E.

736
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,920
Cheese is we know the full names.

737
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,680
You know, we love that it's Charles Entertainment Cheese.

738
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,840
I spent a lot of my life thinking about that fact.

739
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,640
And that's the kind of info I'm so excited to pass on to you, pal.

740
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:55,160
He's going to be such a tough guy that hates robots and loves sports.

741
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,600
Very, very possibly.

742
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:04,080
If things do go in an opposites manner, that could be the case.

743
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,560
I don't know. I hope he's not an opposite.

744
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,160
I've told you guys I am like keeping kind of a loose grip on the theme park thing.

745
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,800
I'm not going to just pounce on him and just throw info at him.

746
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,080
And then in 84, they added something called Horizons.

747
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,560
And that was a neat that was where you could sort of like a different past

748
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,080
of the future. And you sound like a robot butler.

749
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,680
And I'm not going to like I'm going to cool it.

750
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,200
I'm going to ease him into the waters on Disney stuff.

751
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,800
There's posters in his room already.

752
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,720
So he'll have like fond memories, hopefully buzzing around his baby brain.

753
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,400
As we talk about, of course, we have a baby brain scenario here.

754
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,080
And I'm excited about that.

755
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,520
I don't know. I'm not going to force it.

756
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,640
But of course, I would love him to be a theme park buddy.

757
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,760
Don't you are you playing, though,

758
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,600
like just at a low volume during the day, like an ambient Tomorrowland loop?

759
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,080
Oh, I haven't yet.

760
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,880
But that's really chill. That's actually very chill.

761
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,520
But also, you know, you're getting your planning the seed.

762
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,960
Like these are important times for a brain to develop.

763
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,160
Yeah, yeah.

764
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,320
And if he can have deep lodged memories

765
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,800
of the barely futuristic smooth jazz of Larry Carlton,

766
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,360
I mean, I'll be happy for many reasons.

767
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:20,080
But yeah, I mean, you know, you got to all you can do is try to be a nice guy

768
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,320
and raise a kid who's a nice guy, too.

769
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,720
And, you know, I'm not planning any weird.

770
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,160
I'm not going to make him hate.

771
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,080
I'm not going to plant some weird cult

772
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,040
thing in his brain where I say some keyword years later.

773
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,000
And now he's part of a kid army.

774
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,800
All I'm trying to do is implant the Tomorrowland music loop and hope it gives

775
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,800
him some nice. Yeah.

776
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,840
Also, you got to get us into that mom's panel.

777
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,640
You got to get us onto that.

778
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,640
I know that's that's where the real dirt is.

779
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,040
The raw intelligence.

780
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,800
I will blow the lid off that thing.

781
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,840
What I

782
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,000
will say this is going to be a Scott is not going to be happy that I'm going to

783
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,480
re bring this up, but I think Jason will be happy.

784
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:07,120
This gets us closer to an idea I had about a year and a half ago.

785
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,400
Hey, yeah, yeah.

786
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,760
Have we talked about this on the show?

787
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,800
The audience know this.

788
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,440
I don't think the audience has heard this yet.

789
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,480
This is an idea I had a while ago.

790
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,920
It was more of a bit at the time, but now it's getting closer to reality.

791
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:21,800
Yeah, yeah.

792
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,360
We're thirds closer because here's here's the genesis of it.

793
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,480
I think it was we went to Knott's Berry Farm with Doug Barnes of Season Pass.

794
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,040
We were talking about how a lot of what they call mommy blogs and get to go to

795
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,880
all the Disney events.

796
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:39,160
So I was trying to think of a way that would actually get us on Disney's radar

797
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,960
because doing a reverent podcast with swears is not going to work.

798
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,360
So I said, well, what if we had alter egos?

799
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,920
What if we started a podcast called the Disney Daddies

800
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,360
with a Z with the Disney Daddies?

801
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,960
And I think my my idea, my idea for at least the bit was that we were three

802
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:03,440
single dads with three sons each and they were all a handful and they were all a

803
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,840
handful and we love them, but they're a handful.

804
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,320
We love them.

805
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:13,040
And that phrase, maybe one of the hardest, the hardest laughs I've ever had.

806
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:17,360
Like Jason and I met Doug and Robert at Portillo's.

807
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,600
We hadn't met them before we talked.

808
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,400
And then I think we drove over to Knott's and I think I said that phrase to you.

809
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,600
And I do think you were like crying, laughing.

810
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,120
I guess I'm tooting my own horn.

811
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,840
But yes, I think that my memory was like you couldn't you couldn't catch your

812
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:34,480
breath, your lungs couldn't handle three single dads with three kids each, three

813
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:40,600
sons, three sons, that is all boys.

814
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,640
It gets worse.

815
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,320
The more sons you add, yes, gets more of a handful.

816
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,520
The more sons you add.

817
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,680
Oh, I would imagine I was wrong.

818
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,840
I said we were a third there were only a ninth there.

819
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:51,720
So we're not.

820
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,080
We're a ninth there.

821
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,320
We're a ninth there as far as the bid is concerned.

822
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,600
Now, will the Disney daddies rear their head at a certain other point before we've

823
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,720
completed the prophecy where we were all single?

824
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,400
Yes.

825
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,840
Sorry, Scott, in this prophecy, you're divorced.

826
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,760
Yeah, I know. Wait, I have to break up with Aaron for this.

827
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,160
Looks like a bad time.

828
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:16,680
But if it if it gets us into an extra panel, it'll get us into an extra panel.

829
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,640
And the joke I made a year and a half ago will come true, which is all that

830
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,040
matters.

831
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:28,480
But yes, we're one ninth of the way to actually be one ninth and three divorces

832
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,080
away.

833
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,200
Or I guess honestly, one, you could you could be the only divorce and then we just

834
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,040
never marry. We just have three kids.

835
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

836
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,200
Yeah, that's it.

837
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,480
It doesn't matter how you get there.

838
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,200
It's about that. It's about the destination, not the journey.

839
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,240
About the bit of the Disney daddies.

840
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,800
I approve this plan.

841
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:53,080
However, you know, like, hey, my my son cannot communicate barely anything.

842
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,600
He does not give his permission to be part of this.

843
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,680
I will only do this with still a fraudulent child.

844
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,560
All right. All right.

845
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,600
The real child is not any part of the so we still got three to go.

846
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:10,640
Statistically, like just the chances of us, say we each have three kids,

847
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,280
which that seems hard enough.

848
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,960
I love that. I love this one.

849
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:15,880
But oh, my God.

850
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:16,880
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

851
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,320
Dying up the numbers to three just yet.

852
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:24,040
Yeah, I think I suggested Jason get a dog and he almost passed out once.

853
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,400
So I don't know.

854
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,440
We'll see.

855
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,720
But even the chances of just all of them being sons.

856
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,520
So it's going to be probably pretty

857
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,880
impossible to completely fulfill the prophecy of the Disney daddy.

858
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:39,600
So it did happen if we somehow actually as much as yeah, there's the there's the

859
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,240
fake way we could do it and just start.

860
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,400
We could just buy a Geo cities and start to get this website off the ground.

861
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,240
But also, what if we that would be bizarre if we look back and like, oh, my God,

862
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,000
we all had three sons, it's like the what if you like better?

863
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:58,560
It's like the better call Saul like pre it's like the origin story of the Disney

864
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,360
daddy's is what podcasts the ride is watching it form.

865
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,520
We also if we were if we could all say

866
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,400
that we all if we could legitimately say the phrase my three sons, that makes sense

867
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,880
because we're all such big fans of William Frawley.

868
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,560
We're all big fans of I love Lucy.

869
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:19,400
And later, my three sons are going to force William Frawley on your child.

870
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,360
Oh, absolutely.

871
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:25,840
Stan, you know, it's important they learn the standards early on, you know, the good

872
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,600
stuff rather than Santa, I'm going to do William Frawley.

873
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,880
That's who brings presents every year

874
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,040
and also like tries to shove a bottle of whiskey in his mouth.

875
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,720
Put some air on you.

876
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,200
All right.

877
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,880
I think that's a great Christmas tradition in general.

878
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,880
Yeah, so I think, yeah, the podcast will look back ten years from now.

879
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,000
We'll all be not funny anymore.

880
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,120
There'll be no comedy.

881
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,760
It'll just be a blog, a GeoCities blog,

882
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:03,360
and we'll go and get free things from Disney, which is more like Apple at that time

883
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,720
owned by Apple. We're mad there was we're just mad there wasn't enough Mountain Dew

884
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:12,400
at the Caribbean beach, silly string battle.

885
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,440
It just wasn't they really skimped on refreshments this year.

886
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,040
I'm not like, hello, you're the most successful company in the world.

887
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,880
Can we get some Mountain Dew?

888
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,800
There's no hint of irony anymore.

889
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,400
There's no self-awareness.

890
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,840
It's just like I counted the fries at the hungry.

891
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,280
I counted the fries that you get with the cheeseburger at the Hungry Bear.

892
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:39,640
And you used to get 35 fries and now they're only giving you 27 or lower.

893
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,240
And I think this is shameful coming from the Disney company.

894
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,840
You call this guacamole.

895
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,000
I call it melted avocados.

896
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,920
The hand soap used to be pink and now it is dark blue.

897
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,280
I disagree with this.

898
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,960
It smells bad, too.

899
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,680
I really don't like it.

900
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,600
The Disney swan is disgusting.

901
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,520
It's shameful that it's next to the Disney dolphin.

902
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,800
I'm not keeping these up equivalently.

903
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,600
I'm one of the three goddamn Disney daddies.

904
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,840
Do you know who I am?

905
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:16,840
I'm on the list to get into this opening night PR event for Legoland.

906
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,320
I'm one of the goddamn Disney daddies.

907
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,920
Well, I don't see I don't see your three sons anywhere.

908
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,920
Oh, no, they don't come.

909
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,920
They don't get what they don't come to the things you get.

910
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,480
They're a handful.

911
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,480
They hate me.

912
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,200
They hate Disney and they hate me.

913
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,360
Doesn't make me any less a Disney daddy.

914
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,280
I don't know why I'm in New York now, too, if I'm a Disney daddy.

915
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,560
Because we're persnickety.

916
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,880
In all these years, we got a lot more persnickety.

917
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:46,480
Partially because of the handful and partially because we are the food lately

918
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,480
on resort has not been up to snuff.

919
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,000
This is going to be a fascinating

920
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,040
character study over the course of 10, 20 years, this podcast.

921
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,880
Yeah, yeah.

922
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,840
Decay, the mental decay.

923
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,440
I mean, it's very funny.

924
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:05,280
It's lining up with the decay of all media, like the rise of this,

925
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:11,200
the rise of podcasting, who knew the rest of media is just disappearing.

926
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,880
It's been referenced on the show before,

927
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,680
but there will be an episode that will be the Walter White in the crawl space

928
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,240
breaking bad moment when there was no going back.

929
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:25,600
Did it just happen in terms of our sanity with the father of the pride?

930
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,760
Well, that was, you know, that was that was a that was a push.

931
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,040
That was, you know, Walt, I'm trying to think what when he did like that was

932
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:37,640
maybe when he throws the explosion in the room with Tuco.

933
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,240
That was an early worse than that.

934
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,920
Yeah, that was an early one that was slightly breaking up, breaking us,

935
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:49,600
but also, you know, it put us on the dark path, but it wasn't no return yet.

936
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,120
I don't think I'm kidding when I say this,

937
00:48:52,160 --> 00:49:00,840
that I had a worse day doing the father of the pride marathon than I did

938
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,400
during childbirth.

939
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,680
That I believe I genuinely there was.

940
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,840
Yeah, there were there were there were

941
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,560
highlights or good things that happened.

942
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,080
I'm not sure Aaron would agree.

943
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,040
It's probably a different perspective for her.

944
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,920
But I would like I'm like, which day would I rather recall?

945
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,760
Absolutely. Yeah.

946
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:23,240
Even taking the, you know, the photo, the Polaroid moments, not into account.

947
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,720
It was father of the pride way, way more tedious.

948
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,760
We yes, in case you don't know what we're talking about.

949
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:34,680
Last week, we put out a Patreon that was us watching all 13 episodes of a Siegfried

950
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,960
and Roy cartoon called Father of the Pride.

951
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:43,800
And we did it in about what, 10 hours, 10 compact hours, less eight.

952
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,080
I don't know.

953
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,600
I feel like, yeah, that's about how long

954
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,440
labor was, actually.

955
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,880
It was like equivalent times.

956
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,480
Yeah, I believe that.

957
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,080
God, again, we're my son to be listening to this.

958
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,760
If you bailed, I understand.

959
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:04,680
And if you're asking why I do this or have done any of this, I don't know.

960
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,640
I couldn't tell you.

961
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,600
You'll be you'll be unsolving the mystery

962
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,760
of your dad or solving the mystery of your dad for for a long time.

963
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,760
It's in your hands now.

964
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,960
I picture him like at 17 listening to this and he's dressed like Mutt Williams

965
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,080
from Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.

966
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,880
Like he's a cool guy.

967
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:24,440
Yeah.

968
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,040
Heading towards the 2050s,

969
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,080
greasers are going to make a big come back loop back around.

970
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:30,360
Yeah.

971
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,120
100 year.

972
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:35,360
It would be like, yeah, like Streets of Fire, like that, like future greaser,

973
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:39,360
like Willem Dafoe, if you know what I'm talking about.

974
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,320
This movie Streets of Fire, I forget who I forget who directed it.

975
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,720
Somebody's going to throw his iPod in the iPod or whatever device he's listening

976
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:51,920
to this on, he'll he'll throw it in the trash before he goes out and wins state.

977
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,280
Yeah.

978
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:57,440
He took his football team all the way to state, right?

979
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,640
Yes. Is that the kind of thing you do?

980
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,760
Dad, I play basketball, you idiot.

981
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,040
You don't even know what sport I play.

982
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,120
Oh, my dad. Yeah.

983
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,560
He talks about robots or something.

984
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,080
I don't know. I don't like to talk about him, honestly.

985
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,280
And I'm right there.

986
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:23,320
My dad bought my dad, my dad bought an old smart one animatronic from the auction

987
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,040
down the street, and he's been trying to restore it for the last six months.

988
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,800
You could barely get him to talk to me.

989
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,120
I don't want to talk to him, but I could barely get him to.

990
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,920
He made me learn that name.

991
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:41,920
He ran flashcards of all the robots and didn't teach me multiplication tables.

992
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,840
He said, if you can't learn math from a ride, it's not worth learning.

993
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,160
He did tell me something about thanking the Phoenicians, though.

994
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,480
I guess I'm thankful for that.

995
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,680
And he laughed.

996
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,000
He laughed a really quiet chuckle to himself when he said it.

997
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,840
I don't know. A long time.

998
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,000
Dude's weird.

999
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,840
What can I say? Let's get high.

1000
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,360
Let's get high with some future weed.

1001
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,680
I probably am at the point where I should peace out.

1002
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,520
And this was all a lot of fun.

1003
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,400
And I'm glad we did.

1004
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:18,600
But I am going to part ways and I am going to do baby stuff.

1005
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,680
And I've made it about me and about my son for a while.

1006
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:26,560
Now, Mike and Jason are going to make it about you and your questions.

1007
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,520
Thanks for sending them in.

1008
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:33,040
I'm sorry I'm piecing out, but you survived,

1009
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:37,080
if I guess I'm right, the story of my child's birth edition.

1010
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,280
In all honesty, this has all been really wonderful.

1011
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:47,440
I am more psyched about this at this juncture than I imagine that I could possibly be.

1012
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,880
He's the best.

1013
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,200
You guys are the best.

1014
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,280
Aaron, you're the best.

1015
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,360
You're the audience. You're the best.

1016
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:54,480
Full of love and joy.

1017
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,600
And Mike, as you were saying, the irony is dripping away.

1018
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,600
This is where it starts.

1019
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,240
It's all earnestness from here.

1020
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,320
We could be earnest.

1021
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,560
I think the listeners would share.

1022
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,480
We would just say congratulations, Scott and Aaron.

1023
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:12,360
Yeah, very excited about the new edition, you know, in a non-ironic way.

1024
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,800
We don't have to make jokes.

1025
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,800
Be nice. Yeah, true.

1026
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,600
This could be a sincere moment.

1027
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,120
Oh, maybe this is the Walter White moment when there's no going back and we're not

1028
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,120
we're not ironic anymore. Oh, my God.

1029
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,520
I don't know about that.

1030
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,880
Oh, Jason.

1031
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:32,320
As Scott and Aaron were dealing with giving birth, I won an auction on eBay for

1032
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,320
an Islands of Adventure watch from 20 years ago.

1033
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,160
No, but that's not.

1034
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,200
There we go.

1035
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,400
Oh, I guess. Yeah, it's got you're kind of right.

1036
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,800
Yeah, it's not ironic.

1037
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,320
Yeah, it is.

1038
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,520
It's your favorite.

1039
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,120
I love it.

1040
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,080
That's your favorite place on the planet Earth.

1041
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,240
Yes.

1042
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:52,280
And look, you don't find Port of Entry based merchandise a lot.

1043
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,040
So I thought it was interesting.

1044
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,320
None of it's ironic.

1045
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,240
This is all stuff that we that we love.

1046
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,200
And you know what?

1047
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:04,960
I think like that childless man, the childless man in your 30s, I think

1048
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:09,920
I think that it's not a literal fact as much as it is a state of mind.

1049
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:14,040
I still feel like a childless man in my 30s, even with a child, because I think,

1050
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,680
well, you know, that that joke implies like a sad person, maybe he was obsessed

1051
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,960
all these things that nobody cares about.

1052
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,360
But how much joy have we gotten out of all of these things?

1053
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:28,400
And how much joy did it bring me in the lead up to to having it before there was

1054
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:33,400
this baby giving me joy? It's all it's all it's all fun and wonderful.

1055
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,320
And maybe I won't be

1056
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:41,360
talking in this particular way if I stop if the sleep gets tougher.

1057
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:45,560
Well, you know, who knows what's around the corner?

1058
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:52,080
But, you know, why don't we let's is it three child like men in their 30s?

1059
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,640
You know what I mean?

1060
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,640
Three Peter Pan, three Peter Pan, three Peter Pan.

1061
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,560
No, no, no, no, no.

1062
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,720
That is one I am scrubbing that.

1063
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,280
I've said this to you guys already.

1064
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,160
My son will not know of Pan.

1065
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,480
If you're listening to this, don't worry about it.

1066
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,680
I'm not talking about anything.

1067
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,680
There I don't want to hear anything about.

1068
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,280
I don't want to grow up. You're growing up.

1069
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,240
You're doing it.

1070
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,200
You're not a little boy forever.

1071
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,600
Don't be ridiculous.

1072
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:21,800
Your son's in the big top hat with the glasses.

1073
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,280
He's best friends with.

1074
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,080
I like those guys. They're fine.

1075
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,960
But I you know what?

1076
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,840
I maybe

1077
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,320
if we decide to tweak that as time goes on.

1078
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,320
But I think first of all, that's the least

1079
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,680
amount of letters that we could possibly have to change.

1080
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,080
That's only like that's only three.

1081
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,400
Yeah.

1082
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,000
And you could actually delete it such

1083
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,600
that the E just goes backwards two notches and you add the S's on the end.

1084
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,280
So I like it for clarity and brevity.

1085
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,480
But I also I like the ring of it, too.

1086
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,800
Yes, I mean, we could really take the word out.

1087
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,200
Three men in their 30s, also pretty funny.

1088
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,000
Yes, I know me having a kid doesn't excuse any of this.

1089
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,240
Also, I will say once we're all what do you consider late 30s?

1090
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,800
Is it 37 and on?

1091
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,120
What do people think?

1092
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,760
I think 37 and on.

1093
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,600
Yeah, because I think mid would be 34.

1094
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,400
We could say for now, we could say

1095
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,200
three

1096
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,960
men in their mid 30s.

1097
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,400
Mid is funny. And then late 30s is even funnier.

1098
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,760
So we can adapt it there as well.

1099
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,960
Just add a little bit of an extra like

1100
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,480
mid 30s is a funny, more specific thing.

1101
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,960
But late 30s, I think, is really is good.

1102
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,760
We can all try this together with a screen share.

1103
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:42,280
We could all kind of workshop it and just make sure we all feel good about the words

1104
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,160
forming as we adjust to the very important Twitter bio.

1105
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:46,840
Yeah.

1106
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,400
So we're going to do a lot a lot of work on this.

1107
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,720
But these are just some early ideas.

1108
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,520
Yeah. Yeah.

1109
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:58,320
Well, yeah, for now, from some childlike

1110
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,120
men in their mid 30s,

1111
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:06,320
one of which has a son in his less than two weeks, who is absolutely wonderful.

1112
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,160
I love him very much.

1113
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,920
I for now, I'm signing off.

1114
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,000
You guys do whatever you want to do.

1115
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,160
Thanks for bearing with me and audience.

1116
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:18,080
Amazingly, because we've been recording so much, I'll talk to you next week.

1117
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,560
It'll be like Scott.

1118
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,880
Scott's not doing anything.

1119
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,200
Yeah. Yeah.

1120
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,720
It's like none of this ever happened.

1121
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:30,120
It's like it's it's like, well, time travel to late March.

1122
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,000
Awesome. Hey, thanks, fellas.

1123
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,600
This was nice. Nice talk to everybody.

1124
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,040
Welcome back, Jason.

1125
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,960
A mic are here. We're back.

1126
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,520
We're back. Yeah, fine.

1127
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,160
I was fine an hour ago.

1128
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:47,800
I feel like, you know, how do we how do we top, you know, a baby announcement?

1129
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,080
We really can't, honestly.

1130
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,160
We really should have just we should have just done an hour and not

1131
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,680
you know what? I don't even want to do the mailbag.

1132
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,960
OK, well, this is a big turn.

1133
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,800
Yeah, I think we should just stop.

1134
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,320
I think we can't top it.

1135
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,920
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

1136
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,080
We're going to do the mailbag.

1137
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,360
We asked for questions.

1138
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,280
You had some things you wanted to talk about.

1139
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,400
I can chat.

1140
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:16,280
All I have to do is watch Better Call Saul season finale tonight.

1141
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,760
So I'm here. I'm ready to go.

1142
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,160
Uh, yeah.

1143
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,200
Well, I don't know.

1144
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:25,120
I have been spending some of the quarantine reading, you know,

1145
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:30,640
the theme park blogs, the theme park trades and, you know, in between people,

1146
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:36,840
you know, reaching reaching for content, I feel like there there has slowly been

1147
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:42,080
an uptick in like actual like, I guess, two categories.

1148
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:48,000
One is like people trying to estimate when stuff's going to open back up.

1149
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,120
Well, that's a guess.

1150
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:53,360
The guessing game of if you go on any of the, you know,

1151
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:58,440
mouse info Facebook page, it's not the real like if you go there,

1152
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:03,840
it's just endless speculating people just throwing out months that they think is

1153
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,800
the day that these parks reopen.

1154
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,320
It's it's yes, it's endless.

1155
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,840
It's endless when you're talking about people guessing.

1156
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:17,600
Yeah, I mean, I was reading Blue Loop a lot and like they had, you know,

1157
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:24,560
some longtime theme park industry journalists and watchers like speculating

1158
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:31,160
of what's going to happen and like it the these seemingly agreed upon thing is

1159
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:36,320
that like, well, they're going to, you know, kind of discourage cues for a while.

1160
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,360
Like tight cues, probably wear masks, you know,

1161
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:45,200
probably make people stand six feet apart, that sort of thing seems to be a given.

1162
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:49,680
If only because Shanghai Disney has slowly started to reopen.

1163
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,040
Well, yeah, they have not opened the park as of this.

1164
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:56,320
I mean, unless they go surprisingly open it up and what we're recording this like

1165
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,560
a week and a half before this comes out.

1166
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,240
Yeah, I mean, it's interesting.

1167
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,000
I don't know.

1168
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:06,120
Still the problem with this is that we're so early into this

1169
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,600
pandemic that I don't know.

1170
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,720
Like, yeah, like Shanghai could have opened

1171
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:18,280
and there could be a big resurgence in the disease and close before American parks

1172
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,480
even go, so I don't know. The whole thing is chaos.

1173
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:26,840
I don't I truly I'm sure Disney and Universal are having discussions

1174
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:31,320
because we've heard for sure that there was a survey sent out asking Universal

1175
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:37,120
people if they would be willing to do a covid test before going into the park

1176
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:40,480
and if they would be willing to wear masks, have those restrictions.

1177
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,960
So obviously internally, they're all gauging it.

1178
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:47,640
But I at a certain point, I was thinking, you know, maybe it'll be ready for haunt

1179
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,600
season so I can you know, I'm a guy who loves haunts.

1180
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,640
Maybe we'll be ready for haunt season.

1181
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:57,880
I don't I don't know that that's going to be I don't know that's going to happen.

1182
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,800
I really don't. I'm doubtful.

1183
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,320
I think, yeah, I feel like.

1184
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,280
I feel like I saw the shift in real time,

1185
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:13,600
like within a week of like, will it be ready for haunt season to early 2021?

1186
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,760
These places. Well, because especially because California,

1187
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,520
California is basically saying they don't think there should be any gatherings,

1188
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,960
large gatherings, sporting events, etc.

1189
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,160
concerts until twenty twenty one at the earliest.

1190
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:33,560
So yes, and this could this couldn't be more depressing after the joy of childbirth.

1191
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,280
The miracle of life.

1192
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,240
True, that's true.

1193
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,880
You know, we'll get to the questions, we'll get to the we'll get to the questions.

1194
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:47,280
The other category of stuff that you and I have texted about a bit is that

1195
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:51,040
universal construction still going full steam ahead.

1196
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,160
Yes, because it is OK.

1197
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:57,520
So Disney stopped doing construction and now construction everywhere has stayed

1198
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:02,760
working in places, even like in California and certain certain things that you

1199
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,240
wouldn't think are maybe essential.

1200
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,600
There's still construction going on.

1201
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:12,120
They're going to blow up the bridge over here by my apartment.

1202
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,680
Yeah, they have already.

1203
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,440
That's a whole thing.

1204
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,480
And I think that is not slowed down at all.

1205
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:20,480
But yes, Disney, Disney just today laid off a lot of their construction workers

1206
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:24,200
that they have on the payroll I read.

1207
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,400
Yeah. And I think mice chat just posted a big

1208
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,760
rundown of aerial photography of Jason.

1209
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:34,240
I saw all the mice chat photos today.

1210
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,960
Do you think I didn't wake up and first thing?

1211
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,480
Check mice chat dot com. Of course I did.

1212
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:42,360
They had an aerial photo of a Quinjet in the Marvel land.

1213
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:45,280
Yeah, it was like covered with like a blanket.

1214
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,080
I guess not a blanket, I guess like a tarp.

1215
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:50,200
I don't know. It's unclear if maybe there

1216
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,200
are a few people still doing stuff at Disney.

1217
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,280
But as far as like massive construction,

1218
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:01,240
it appears that all the parks have ceased to cease working.

1219
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,760
Not the case with Universal.

1220
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,160
I heard this.

1221
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,880
I think I was in a Twitch stream.

1222
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,880
A lot of my anecdotes now are about, well, I was in a Twitch stream and a nice,

1223
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,560
a nice viewer of the stream.

1224
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,440
Let me know that Universal was still building.

1225
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:20,680
And then we have a friend who lives right off of Lancashire, right by Hollywood

1226
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:24,360
Universal. And he was like, oh, yeah, Universal is working around the clock

1227
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,360
because you can see Nintendo land.

1228
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:30,640
You can see Mario Kart from Lancashire, this giant building and apparently he

1229
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:34,760
goes, yeah, I stand out when I take the dog out every night and watch the

1230
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,200
construction. So it is very interesting.

1231
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:43,960
My speculation is that Universal is owned by a telecom.

1232
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,760
It's Comcast Universal.

1233
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:49,320
They have a lot more money coming in than Disney does.

1234
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:54,680
So I kind of feel like Universal is like, you know, now is the time to strike.

1235
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,560
Now is the time we're going to get one up on Disney because they don't want to just

1236
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:02,080
keep building and we can just keep construction going.

1237
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:08,640
So I guess, I guess we can expect Nintendo land on the same timetable from whatever

1238
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:12,720
it was going to be. Yeah, they're going to open up with brand new stuff.

1239
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:15,400
It'll be two years out of a pandemic.

1240
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:19,560
And it's like Universal has new rides in every park.

1241
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:24,920
Yeah, because I don't I mean, I think that's the only way that will certainly help

1242
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:29,040
boost attendance because that survey they were sending out were like, how would you

1243
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,840
feel if half the park was closed?

1244
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,600
And I was just as a laugh reading that.

1245
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,680
It's like, are you still going to charge

1246
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:39,320
100 percent of admission with half the park closed?

1247
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:44,960
Because these places not really famous with doing like discount sales or

1248
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:50,280
slashing prices, you know, how would you feel if you had a bad time at the park?

1249
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,600
Yeah, my family, if we let you down,

1250
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:58,720
my family was looking towards like a trip to Florida when it was decorated for

1251
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:03,280
Christmas this year. And then I think we just kind of called it because like, well,

1252
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:08,520
at best it would be weird, like it would be a little too weird for a little while

1253
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,320
or a little too many hoops to jump through.

1254
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,000
There's just no way.

1255
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,600
There's just no true way to prevent the

1256
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:19,080
spread of an infectious disease when you're talking about a bunch of people

1257
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:25,080
cycling through buildings all day, there's just no way unless it was like

1258
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:30,520
unless like Space Mountain was like one person goes down the aisle and then a team

1259
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,560
member comes in and sprays disinfectant down the hall.

1260
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:38,440
Then the next person comes in like there's no real way to do it.

1261
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,600
I don't know. Who knows?

1262
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,960
The answer is I don't know. Haunt season.

1263
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:46,440
There's a look if I think I've been saying

1264
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:51,120
that they could just turn Mickey and Friends into a covid-19 testing site.

1265
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,600
They just throw up booths in front of the

1266
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,960
ticket booth in the Mickey and Friends parking garage.

1267
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:00,000
And they literally just do the crazy swab.

1268
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:04,680
That might be the only way I like feel kind of secure about that.

1269
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,960
And even then it's like, who knows that that's even that good

1270
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,880
of a way to gauge? Who knows?

1271
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:14,560
Sure. So we don't have any answers.

1272
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:18,080
You turn us not for answers, I hope.

1273
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,320
We're just we're just a couple of idiots.

1274
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:21,720
We're just a couple of idiots.

1275
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,960
But like, you know, if you're looking for a deep dive,

1276
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:29,320
start searching Universal Patents because they're out there.

1277
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,480
Oh, yeah, there's Universal Patents.

1278
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:37,000
Yes, there's a crazy ride that looks like it goes in water and then it flies.

1279
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,600
That's very exciting. All that stuff.

1280
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:42,080
Yeah. You know, like, look, you come to us for message board speculation

1281
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:47,120
and reviews of aerial photos of Disneyland posted on micechat.com.

1282
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:50,320
Yeah, that is what we're here for.

1283
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,520
And believe me, there was an helicopter

1284
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,120
video of somebody flying over Disneyland the other day.

1285
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,640
I watched the shit out of that. Sure.

1286
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:02,080
And I was I was I was like, oh, yeah, that's what the guy was very

1287
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:07,240
amused by the Splash Mountain show building and how it looks so different from from above.

1288
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,480
And you know what?

1289
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,720
He's 100 percent right.

1290
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:18,160
I zoomed back on that three times and went, wow, he whoa, it looks so different from above.

1291
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:23,080
So that's what I've been doing with my time while Scott's off having a baby.

1292
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:23,920
Scott's off. Yeah.

1293
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:28,280
Do you think he's still like, you know, while he's rocking the baby back to sleep,

1294
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,600
is he checking those mice chat aerial photos?

1295
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:35,640
Well, he yeah, I I haven't been texting him

1296
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,600
mice chat aerial photos.

1297
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:41,680
I don't know, because I feel like sometimes on the show we'll be like, hey,

1298
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,240
did you see this? And he'll be like, oh, what is it?

1299
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,000
What did I have to see?

1300
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,960
But then like then he's listening and watching all the same stuff we are.

1301
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,160
So that's true.

1302
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:56,000
I think there's a good chance he's he's seen that Quinjet with a blanket over it.

1303
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:01,760
I sent a very odd special of like circus acts in World Showcase.

1304
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,600
And I was like, you guys seen this one?

1305
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,760
He was like, yeah, we watched it last week.

1306
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:11,160
And I'm like, OK, we're all doing we're all doing this.

1307
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,480
I'd also like to say that I found the

1308
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,360
Disney Daddy's logo I made a year and a half ago.

1309
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,520
Yeah, it's great.

1310
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:18,840
We'll be posting that.

1311
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:22,040
And all I can say is a rainbow Comic Sans.

1312
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:27,080
It's yeah, it's rain rainbow Comic Sans as if I'm Karnak.

1313
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,160
And I was about to do a joke.

1314
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,840
So, yeah, Disney Daddy's, you will see

1315
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:36,560
that on the Twitter and eventually whatever we use the IP Disney Daddy's.

1316
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,280
I really should copyright it as well.

1317
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:42,400
Yeah, because I don't want I don't want that falling into the wrong hands.

1318
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,760
Print it out, put it in an envelope, mail it to yourself.

1319
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:48,920
Poor poor man's poor man's copyright copyright.

1320
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,280
Yeah, is that right?

1321
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:52,520
Yeah. So that just means you don't have to pay a fee.

1322
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,280
It's just like does that really work, though?

1323
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:58,160
I don't I feel like it worked back in the day where everything was mail based,

1324
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:02,640
you know, where you just everyone had a ton of catalogs for anything specific.

1325
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:08,200
I feel like I feel like poor man's copyright should be called lazy man's copyright.

1326
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:09,920
Yeah, I think that's right.

1327
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,960
Lazy dude's copyright.

1328
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:16,640
That's let's from now on, we're calling poor man's copyright lazy dude's copyright.

1329
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,000
Let's do it.

1330
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,800
OK, so what are we doing? Mailbag?

1331
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,680
What are you unless you mailbag? Yeah.

1332
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:23,920
Other stuff. Do you have any announcements?

1333
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,360
Do you are you having a baby or anything?

1334
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:31,720
No, I have lost I lost my eBay bid for the

1335
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:36,520
Incredible Hulk coaster in cast member uniforms.

1336
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:43,480
OK, which, yeah, I don't know that they I do wonder how they got a hold of it to resell.

1337
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,280
I got a notification from eBay today

1338
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:50,720
that the seller of one of the Michael Eisner signed eight by tens will give me

1339
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:58,040
a 15% off discount, bringing the total to, I believe, thirty eight ninety nine.

1340
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,640
I believe

1341
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,640
they could do better.

1342
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,200
I could make another offer.

1343
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,840
I could see if we get 30% off.

1344
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,200
But, you know, let's see.

1345
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,440
Maybe we will get to talk to the man himself.

1346
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:15,320
Maybe he has, you know, a picture of himself on an eight by ten wearing a Winnie

1347
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,560
the Pooh sweatshirt. Yeah.

1348
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,680
Michael, that would be the that would be the last thing we'll ask him on the

1349
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:26,160
interview. Do you have any eight by tens of you, preferably in the age range of

1350
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:32,440
thirty eight to fifty one, wearing sweatshirts with characters we like?

1351
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:38,200
Yeah, that is a thing I find endearing about him, that he looked like, you know,

1352
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,520
he would dress like a person going to the park.

1353
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:47,920
Yes, Eisner needs to look more like a dad, like a dad look like he needs more

1354
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:53,440
sweatshirts. He needs more like back like backward baseball caps.

1355
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,280
Liger. Yeah, Iger.

1356
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,280
Iger busy. He's busy right now.

1357
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:02,840
But I want to see like I want to see like War Room Iger, you know?

1358
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,920
Yeah. Get him in a spirit jersey.

1359
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,640
Spirit jersey. Yes.

1360
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:07,440
You know what would be good?

1361
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:12,080
Yes. Anything that didn't sell at the theme parks he should be wearing.

1362
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,520
Like, really, we're cutting the budgets here.

1363
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:17,480
Let's show in the company that he is

1364
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:24,080
participating as well swing by the Disney character outlet and.

1365
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:30,200
Like if the I'm so fly, Peter Pan shirts weren't selling, he should be in like an

1366
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:36,800
XXL I'm so fly shirt in a picture of him in like a war room meeting with Chaypeck

1367
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,800
in the board. That's great, because then all the business,

1368
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,840
like all the like wannabe CEOs out there will be like, oh, wow,

1369
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,440
I got to get one of I got to get

1370
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:52,600
like that Timon in that XXL Timonin Pumba sweatshirt that said grub time on it.

1371
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,160
Yes, he should he should have he should be

1372
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:00,800
wearing athletic pants that say Nutcracker in the Four Realms on the butt.

1373
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,440
He should be any sort of merch that clothing that is left over.

1374
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:10,280
He should be showing us what he's doing and proving it by wearing that.

1375
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,280
And then also fulfilling

1376
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:17,000
Michael Eisner's legacy of dressing more like a dad, more like a regular Joe.

1377
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:21,800
Yeah, because they're not going to move those pallets of Artemis Fowl baseball caps.

1378
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I don't think those are going to go fast.

1379
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,920
So I started.

1380
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:29,000
Yeah, I was just going to say Eisner, now that I think about it, you know,

1381
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:33,440
he owns this company that makes like Bojack Horseman and made to convert.

1382
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,800
He has a there's a picture of him wearing

1383
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,400
a Bojack Horseman hat and wearing a John Cena shirt.

1384
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,160
And this is from the last few years.

1385
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,960
So he is still doing it.

1386
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,360
And every man he's in the every man.

1387
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,440
Iger is trying to be too cool for school.

1388
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,360
He's trying to be James Bond.

1389
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,600
We don't want that, especially right now during a crisis.

1390
01:12:53,800 --> 01:13:00,280
We want we want Artemis Fowl, Nutcracker in the Four Realms, Lone Ranger.

1391
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:06,800
If he could wear Lone Ranger shoes, Lone Ranger boots, Toms.

1392
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,440
Oh, OK.

1393
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,760
Toms that look like promotional Toms that look like boots.

1394
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:15,440
Toms that have spurs on the bottom.

1395
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:18,800
If there's spur Toms that Iger could be

1396
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,160
wearing, I think that would if the whole board, honestly,

1397
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:27,600
chapec kind of dresses like an office guy, I think chapec could be helping out to

1398
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:33,160
and yeah, any of these movies and dig back, dig back into the archives.

1399
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:37,320
Mr. Boogity shirt for Bob Chapec.

1400
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:41,320
Herbie goes to Monte Carlo sunglasses.

1401
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:45,120
Anything, any of that stuff works pretty well, I think.

1402
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:48,560
Absolutely. OK, we're way over now on this episode.

1403
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,880
Let's just get to some questions.

1404
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,600
Let's get to some questions.

1405
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,040
All right, you got one queued up.

1406
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,520
Uh, hold on.

1407
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,280
Do you have one? I mean, I sure.

1408
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,480
Yeah. OK, go ahead.

1409
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:03,440
Jen DeMare, Jen DeMare, Maria.

1410
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,760
I'm sorry, I've butchered your name already.

1411
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:09,960
Mranardy, she asked if I'm allergic to bananas.

1412
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:14,040
And I don't think I am, but I will say this.

1413
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:23,160
I was told by someone via DMs that what I think is a banana allergy might actually

1414
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:30,560
be something in disguise, it might be an oral allergy that I have to ragweed.

1415
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:36,360
Oh, yeah, I don't know if that's true or not, but apparently that is

1416
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:40,000
sometimes if you eat a banana, I can just read what she said.

1417
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:43,120
She said the proteins of the banana are similar enough to those of ragweed

1418
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:47,760
pollen that it causes your oral mucosa to have a minor allergic reaction.

1419
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,440
It will likely happen with cantaloupe

1420
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,880
and honeydew and maybe chamomile tea.

1421
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,960
So I should try that and see if it's the same thing.

1422
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:58,840
So that actually sheds more light on what happened in the recent episode

1423
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:02,640
from Confrontation. I was discussing how I like cough a little bit eating a banana.

1424
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,720
And we tried to see if I was allergic by rubbing a banana on my hand,

1425
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,760
which is probably not the best way to do it.

1426
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,520
But nothing happened.

1427
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,600
I did not have any sort of skin reaction. Anyway, you were saying something.

1428
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,280
I was going to say, how do you fare come pollen season?

1429
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:17,960
Because I feel like like

1430
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:22,120
Jason and I are calling out like, oh, this is a bad year.

1431
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,400
I thrive during pollen season.

1432
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:25,240
You thrive.

1433
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:26,360
OK, I thrive.

1434
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,560
So I'm fine during then.

1435
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:29,920
What do you got?

1436
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:34,520
OK, I actually just came in through our email.

1437
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:36,120
This is from AJ Curry.

1438
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:41,240
Assuming no park hoppers, what's the ideal order to do the four parks on a Disney

1439
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,920
world trip?

1440
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:47,480
They say they're partial to Magic Kingdom, then Animal Kingdom,

1441
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:51,600
then Hollywood Studios ending in Epcot.

1442
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,600
I think that's a pretty good order.

1443
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,680
I think it kind of depends on where you're staying.

1444
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:01,520
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of variables to this question.

1445
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,960
Yeah, I mean, as a kid,

1446
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:08,840
you know, you go the family, you know, you usually hit up Magic Kingdom first.

1447
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:13,160
Although when we got a little earlier, a little older,

1448
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:16,800
we would usually get down into Orlando around lunchtime.

1449
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,120
So then by the time we dropped our bags at the hotel, had some lunch,

1450
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:24,560
I think we would usually do like a half day at Epcot because that's an easy park

1451
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:27,200
to like kind of just ease into, you know?

1452
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:32,520
Yes. I mean, Epcot is like I kind of consider Epcot the your safe house,

1453
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:35,520
your chill out house for the parks.

1454
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:40,160
So it's like maybe you did have an intense day at Magic Kingdom trying to do a lot

1455
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,240
of rides. You go to Epcot and you chill out.

1456
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:46,040
There's the most chill out zones at Epcot.

1457
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:47,600
That's what I like.

1458
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:52,520
So my real I mean, I would say like, you know, do Magic Kingdom, go to Epcot,

1459
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:56,240
do Hollywood Studios, go to Epcot, do Animal Kingdom.

1460
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:59,040
And then you guessed it. Go back to Epcot.

1461
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:01,280
Sure. It's like I like that.

1462
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:05,480
Now, I guess if the question is you have one day per park, if you if you don't do

1463
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:10,800
the hopper, if that's what the exercise, the mental exercise we're doing here,

1464
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:17,360
I think honestly, for me personally, what I would do is I would do Magic Kingdom

1465
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:22,200
first because it's similar to Disneyland, but I like Disneyland better.

1466
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,520
So it's sort of not as much of a priority.

1467
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:29,640
Then next, I'm probably going Hollywood Studios,

1468
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:33,280
even though Hollywood Studios has gotten more stuff over the years,

1469
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:38,040
then I'm doing Animal Kingdom and then I am probably ending on Epcot to just send

1470
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:42,920
the trip off on a nice, relaxed note.

1471
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,560
Yeah, I think that's right. Sure.

1472
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,680
Well, I think their order makes sense, too, of like Magic Kingdom and Animal

1473
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:53,800
Kingdom, like knock out that part of the property and then shift over to the other

1474
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,600
part of the property. Right.

1475
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,880
But I mean, I understand cost is always an issue.

1476
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:02,840
I think park hopping in Florida is such a joy.

1477
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:08,120
Yeah, that's sort of one of my favorite things is to have the flexibility there to

1478
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:13,680
do that is to be like, oh, wow, we realize Epcot is open two hours later.

1479
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,080
We should do the yeah, let's do it like that.

1480
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:18,480
There's a fun discovery there.

1481
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:23,400
So anyway, that's that's my feeling on that topic.

1482
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,200
I have a question here from Thomas Lipscomb.

1483
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:32,040
What other animatronics would you like to see turn into DJs?

1484
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:37,320
Now, we've talked a little bit, I think was on the anniversary show from Dynasty

1485
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:44,160
Typewriter about, you know, like an Eisner DJ, but he doesn't have an animatronic.

1486
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:50,080
So we really haven't fully gotten into animatronic DJ talk.

1487
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:54,000
Now, my answer is.

1488
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:58,960
The problem with my answer is it's mostly like all of them.

1489
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:02,120
Yeah, I can't think of a single animatronic.

1490
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:06,440
I wouldn't want to be a DJ, but let's maybe that's actually better.

1491
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,760
Unless you have a good answer.

1492
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,120
Let's figure out animatronics.

1493
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:12,040
We do not want to be DJs.

1494
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:13,600
I think easily Trump.

1495
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,720
I don't want the animatronic of Trump to be a DJ.

1496
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:20,120
Yeah, I think anything.

1497
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,600
Anything too scary, maybe?

1498
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:26,600
Like, I don't know if I want to be constantly looking at the alien encounter.

1499
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:27,920
Alien.

1500
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:30,400
Oh, wait a minute. Now, that's interesting.

1501
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,120
You're saying the terrifying, not the what's his name?

1502
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:37,720
And I can't think of the alien before the cute alien that they fry.

1503
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,640
Skippy. Not Skippy.

1504
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,680
You're saying it's truly like xenomorph.

1505
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:43,680
Ask. Yeah.

1506
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,400
Alien DJing.

1507
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:51,720
Yeah. No, I think I would want like Skippy and a hat and like a lot of wristbands.

1508
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,440
OK, let me let me throw this scenario out at you.

1509
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:55,520
It's alien encounter.

1510
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:59,400
It's the same room, but you can have a drink with you.

1511
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,880
And that alien is in the tube, but he's DJing.

1512
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:05,720
Oh, OK.

1513
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:09,480
And he's doing all the hottest hits of the day.

1514
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:15,480
If he's being cool, OK, maybe, maybe if he's being cool.

1515
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,280
I think he's being cool.

1516
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:23,960
I think he's playing the newest hits from Travis Scott.

1517
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:28,040
I'm trying to think of other hip artists that I could reference here.

1518
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,320
Hmm.

1519
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,800
Dua Lipa.

1520
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,360
Yes.

1521
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:36,280
Charlie X.I. Is that right?

1522
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,360
Charlie XCX. XCX.

1523
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:39,960
Sorry. XI.

1524
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,680
XCX.

1525
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,360
Yeah, Charlie.

1526
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,360
Sia.

1527
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,080
I know she's been around for a long time.

1528
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,080
Still hanging around. Yeah, she's great.

1529
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:51,520
She covers her face. I know her.

1530
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:52,720
So he's DJing.

1531
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:56,360
You have a fun cocktail because it's Magic Kingdom in Florida and you can drink there.

1532
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,400
So that's good.

1533
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:02,720
And then you're sort of it's sort of like an enjoyable show.

1534
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:07,680
But I will say probably once every few hours, the alien does break out and try

1535
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:10,320
to kill everyone in the middle of the DJ set.

1536
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:14,560
So you're listening to a Travis Scott song and then the lights go out.

1537
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:18,320
And then the alien attacks you while that song is playing.

1538
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,600
I actually think it sounds less scary.

1539
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,320
Yeah, yeah.

1540
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,960
Wait, no. So you're saying he does attack you.

1541
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:31,480
OK, I'm saying he has to occasionally attack, maybe not every show.

1542
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:32,760
I think it should go through.

1543
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:36,680
OK, maybe if it goes through the motions like he's going to attack and then he just

1544
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:44,280
his like little arm claw thing just stretches out and it's got an air horn.

1545
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:48,200
Or like a T-shirt gun or something like it's

1546
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:51,400
like, yeah, like he fools you.

1547
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:55,360
Yeah, it's actually a reggaeton horn.

1548
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:56,280
That's good.

1549
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:00,760
So, yeah. And then like when you hear him, like that's when the beat drops,

1550
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,480
it seems like he's going to attack and then the beat drops.

1551
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:06,080
Oh, yeah, that's good.

1552
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:10,760
And then like you hear him like scratching next to you.

1553
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:14,320
You hear him scratching a record for the DJ set?

1554
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:17,720
Yeah. Yeah, that's good.

1555
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,640
I'm trying to think that.

1556
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:25,360
I think that I was going to say the Yeti, the Yeti should be a DJ.

1557
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:27,920
But he doesn't have much movement, so I guess he's out.

1558
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:33,240
I will say I don't want the Yeti to be a DJ on Expedition Everest.

1559
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:37,560
Right. Just because he doesn't have the range of movement.

1560
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:44,000
But I do want the Abominable Snowman on the Matterhorn to be a DJ.

1561
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,960
OK, yeah, he moves around a lot, moves around a lot.

1562
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,040
He keeps the energy up.

1563
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,480
He can keep the energy up.

1564
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:54,280
And again, I'd love I would love to go on the Matterhorn while they're blasting one

1565
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:58,640
of my favorite modern artists like Travis Scott.

1566
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:01,880
Yeah, let's see.

1567
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:06,600
I'm trying to think of any other animatronics I don't want to be DJs.

1568
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:08,400
It's tough. All the other presidents.

1569
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,400
Yes, they should all be DJs.

1570
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:14,840
Maybe not George W. Bush.

1571
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,720
I'm still hung up on scary.

1572
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:22,440
So like any of the Harry Potter, like the Death Eaters or the Big Spider.

1573
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:26,600
Oh, I think a Death Eater DJ would be awesome.

1574
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,960
Yeah, you just don't like scary.

1575
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:31,400
You don't like scary DJs is what we're getting.

1576
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:36,120
I think he's got if he has a flat brim hat on, I think it humanizes him.

1577
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:37,760
Are you make some cute?

1578
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:40,960
Are you scared of dead mouse?

1579
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:46,160
Oh, dead mouse is a little because he's just the head.

1580
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:47,520
He has it, but it's not.

1581
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:48,600
Yeah.

1582
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,080
But I'm saying you can't see his face, so you do find him scary.

1583
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,880
Do you find Daft Punk scary?

1584
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:56,200
I don't think I find Daft Punk scary.

1585
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,680
Dead Mouse has the X's over the eyes usually.

1586
01:23:58,880 --> 01:23:59,400
Right. Yeah.

1587
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,000
So he's dead because he's dead.

1588
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,240
Yeah, because he's dead.

1589
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:03,920
Yeah. Yeah.

1590
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,760
What if you put dead mouse on Harry

1591
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,760
Potter and the Forbidden Journey or whatever the ride is called?

1592
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:16,680
That would certainly make it more foreboding for my taste.

1593
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:20,320
I think that that theater part of the ride, though, would be cool if that was a big

1594
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:24,960
DJ room and there was a strobe going because that part of the ride freaks me out.

1595
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,960
OK, yeah, yeah, it freaks me out, too.

1596
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:32,360
That could be a cool Horror Nights flip if she would loosen up a little.

1597
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:34,160
Yeah, come on, J.K.

1598
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,640
And make it a party.

1599
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:40,360
J.K. won't have any fun and let us have a party in Harry Potter land, which is what

1600
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:45,240
we're all dying for. Harry Potter and the Forbidden Party.

1601
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:49,760
It's like we it's like they have to have it's like she's mom and like we have to

1602
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:54,080
have it secretly there while she's not like she's not home.

1603
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:02,040
And then we can have we can have all the fun you can project, you know, you can

1604
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:05,360
play modern songs in Hogsworth.

1605
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:07,920
I was about to call it Hogsworth.

1606
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,000
Hogsmeade, I know what it's called.

1607
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:14,640
Sure. Is Hogsworth a character or did I just create a character?

1608
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:18,120
I think you just created some sort of pig based character.

1609
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:21,600
I just created a character called Hogsworth and he's got a monocle.

1610
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,280
He's got a top hat.

1611
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:27,680
He he's a ruthless businessman.

1612
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:30,720
Oh, he's a tyrant. He's a tyrant dictator.

1613
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,240
He's a dictator. Yeah.

1614
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:38,760
And he is on, let's say he's a mascot of a candy bar that I just created called

1615
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,880
Hogsworth Hogsworth's.

1616
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:43,920
It's a little smoky.

1617
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:49,880
It's it's almost like he tricks you into thinking there's pig in that chocolate bar,

1618
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,920
which is something you've been saying for a long time that you wanted a chocolate

1619
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:56,720
bar that made you fooled you into thinking you were eating pig,

1620
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:01,320
fooled me into thinking I was eating pork product in my chocolate bar.

1621
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:04,800
The commercial is like, you'll think you're eating pig.

1622
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:10,480
I am very, you know, I am sure, you know, people say, oh, he's a treat guy and he

1623
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:15,560
likes pork. I'm very conflicted about a lot of that, like chocolate covered bacon or

1624
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:20,160
maple bacon donuts. I feel like I've had good executions of it, but

1625
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:23,080
I feel like it's a thing that you can't skimp on.

1626
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:24,680
Like it can't be a thing.

1627
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:27,600
I'll be honest, I don't go wild for it.

1628
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,480
It's not my go to it.

1629
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,240
I'm not that into it.

1630
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:35,160
I'm kind of a sucker for like birthday cake flavored stuff.

1631
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:38,240
Well, now you're you know who you're talking to here.

1632
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:39,600
Well, yeah, I know you.

1633
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,280
I know you would agree on that.

1634
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:45,200
But like, I think we are a comic con and they were passing around like trays of

1635
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:49,520
like maple bacon donuts, and those were pretty good.

1636
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:50,720
Sure. I'll eat.

1637
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:54,320
Look, if we're at a party, a comic con and there's a tray of bacon based

1638
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,720
something, I will have it, I will try it.

1639
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:01,080
But it's never my top order because getting it wrong is it's it's bad.

1640
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:02,160
It's extra bad.

1641
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:06,520
Yeah, a bad birthday cake, a bad birthday cake thing is like whatever.

1642
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:09,600
You can stomach it, but it doesn't matter.

1643
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,280
All right. Do you have a question?

1644
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:13,360
I do. There's another email.

1645
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:14,720
This is from Justin.

1646
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:19,680
Justin says he he lives in New Jersey and recently moved for work next to the

1647
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:21,040
Atlantic City Airport.

1648
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:26,680
He bought an annual pass to Disney World right before everything got nuts.

1649
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:31,440
And his plan was to fly down for weekly Saturday day trips.

1650
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:34,400
And Justin was wondering if

1651
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:39,120
do we know anyone in the PTR community that is as crazy as he is?

1652
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,200
I don't think that's that great.

1653
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:46,440
Like the flight from Atlantic City is very quick to Orlando.

1654
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:48,200
I think it's very ambitious.

1655
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:52,280
And Justin, I think you might have the worst timing

1656
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:56,360
imaginable on that purchase.

1657
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:59,480
I think I think most of the podcast,

1658
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:04,600
the right listeners are just the resources away from being just as crazy.

1659
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:08,040
I don't think I don't know what your situation is,

1660
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:10,400
the flexibility in your life to be able to do that.

1661
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:14,560
I think with the right amount of money and the right flexibility,

1662
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:19,440
I think all of us would be like, we fly down to Florida once a month.

1663
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:24,760
The only thing to me that might be slightly crazy on that angle is that the only,

1664
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:30,400
I believe, the current domestic airline that only serves the only one that serves

1665
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,280
the Atlantic City Airport is Spirit.

1666
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:36,000
So I think the craziness might more come from like,

1667
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:40,640
do you really want to fly Spirit Airlines that much that often?

1668
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:43,160
The other things that fly in there are like

1669
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:48,080
New Jersey's Air National Guard and like charter flights from Caesars.

1670
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:51,800
Also, Justin is asking us this question.

1671
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,920
You got to know who you're talking to here.

1672
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:57,960
He has to bring something a lot crazier to the party than that.

1673
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:01,320
If he's thinking he's going to like out crazy us,

1674
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:06,560
like, have I like multiple times driven an hour and a half down to Anaheim and gone

1675
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:09,160
to like work on my laptop for no reason?

1676
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:13,240
Yes, I understand that's not a big of a commitment, but he's got to bring up

1677
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:18,160
something like, you know, I put out a put a third mortgage on my house

1678
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:21,680
in order to fund an annual pass.

1679
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:27,200
He's got to say like, you know, I I'm driving to Florida every time.

1680
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:32,800
I'm staying up 48 hours, going to the park for 12 and driving back with no sleep.

1681
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,320
That's crazy. That I would say is crazy.

1682
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:39,560
But once a month, taking a nice little flight and going to a theme park,

1683
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:43,560
you're a very normal person, sir, when it when he compares to people to listen

1684
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:47,200
to this show and the people who perform this show.

1685
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:48,520
Yeah.

1686
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:52,880
So I'm saying I'm saying, Justin, you're going to have to bring it, brother.

1687
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:55,800
You're going to have to really bring it

1688
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,400
if you want to be the crazy one in this henhouse, if you want to be the fox

1689
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,200
in this henhouse.

1690
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,840
Yeah, I mean, we sometimes we have gone down.

1691
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:12,000
We've made the mistake or had to go down Friday late afternoon, early evening.

1692
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:19,600
And that drive, I will tell you, the drive from the the drive to Anaheim from Los

1693
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:26,240
Angeles can be twice as long as that flight from the Philadelphia, New Jersey area.

1694
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:27,960
Yeah.

1695
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:32,440
Um, yes, I agree with what you're saying.

1696
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:35,280
So, yeah, Justin, try harder next time.

1697
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:38,000
That's what I'm saying. That's summing up.

1698
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:39,160
Let's see here.

1699
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,760
I have a question from Dave Lindquist.

1700
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:43,680
If you had a time machine and could use it

1701
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:48,120
only once to visit a theme park at any point in the past, what park and year

1702
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,680
would you pick?

1703
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:53,360
I mean, you got to go opening day Disneyland, right?

1704
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:55,920
You got it. You got to do that.

1705
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:57,840
I know that's a that's a trite.

1706
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:00,240
That's an easy answer.

1707
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:03,000
But you got to see the heels in the cement.

1708
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:05,720
You got to see the people being like

1709
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:10,240
paying a nickel to use a ladder to climb the wall.

1710
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:15,320
You got to see Walt walking around with Art Link letter.

1711
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:21,320
You know, you but don't you think there is like like there's got to be a day back

1712
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:26,760
in the 90s back when everything we like that's now closed is like open

1713
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:33,160
simultaneously? Well, look, of course, there are a million answers to this question.

1714
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:35,480
Yeah, I would also say there's there's

1715
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:41,600
opening day of Indiana Jones to hopefully get hit with the ice effect.

1716
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:42,800
That's true. Yeah.

1717
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:47,200
And in case no one knows what I'm talking about, the supposedly, according to the man

1718
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:51,000
who made the ride, Tony Baxter, for the first month or two,

1719
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:56,800
there was an effect on the Indiana Jones ride where they would drop ice on you

1720
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:01,520
just as you were entering the temple and seeing Mara or maybe after it.

1721
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,720
I'm not sure. I think it might be right after it.

1722
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:05,040
But it's around there.

1723
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,840
But the effect was essentially there was a

1724
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:15,360
like a I guess an industrial freezer in the ceiling that would create ice and then

1725
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:18,520
drop it on the front of your car to make it feel like the whole place was coming

1726
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:20,120
down. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1727
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:23,080
Wasn't it where you see the large boulder?

1728
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:26,400
Wasn't it that at that point and Indy's hanging from the rope?

1729
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:28,960
I believe it's earlier. I could totally be wrong.

1730
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,760
You can Google it while I'm talking if you want.

1731
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,400
But I believe it was at least before or after Mara.

1732
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,600
I think I think.

1733
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:42,680
But what happened was it's an incredible strain to put on that freezer and they

1734
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:45,040
just couldn't get it working consistently.

1735
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:46,880
So it's in there, apparently.

1736
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:47,880
It's still in the ceiling.

1737
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:49,760
It's just the effect doesn't work anymore.

1738
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:52,560
But, man, I am obsessed with this effect.

1739
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:54,720
I'm obsessed with the idea that there would

1740
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:59,960
actual physical stuff would drop onto the car at a certain point.

1741
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:01,600
So I like that.

1742
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:04,440
That is definitely on my top

1743
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:08,200
hundred theme park history days that I would want to visit.

1744
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:13,760
I feel like they wouldn't even get anywhere near that level of liability now.

1745
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:18,320
Yeah, you would think I wonder what I wonder what like fail safes they had in

1746
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:22,480
practice then to make sure like no piece of ice hit a kid in the front row of the

1747
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:26,840
car, because you would think that would be very possible.

1748
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:30,600
Yeah, I would want I would want to go to

1749
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:36,720
Disney land to see the opening of Star Tours where George Lucas was there with C

1750
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:39,080
3PO and R2D2.

1751
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:43,280
That like stuff like that, for sure.

1752
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:46,960
Yeah. And and the face character.

1753
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:49,000
Luke and Leia and Han, right?

1754
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:50,400
Oh, was that the same?

1755
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,480
I think that's the same day. Yeah, I think so.

1756
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:53,360
Yeah.

1757
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:56,240
So stuff like that is a big deal.

1758
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:58,920
I would love to see.

1759
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:03,440
Like, I would love to go visit knots before it was nots Berry Farm,

1760
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:06,640
like when it was a berry farm, when it was just a roadside.

1761
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:09,080
Like chicken pie restaurant.

1762
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:14,400
Yeah, I think we could both agree that we would both visit the roadside chicken pie

1763
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:16,320
stand.

1764
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:19,720
You guess she always made fried chicken.

1765
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,640
I guess she wasn't really a chicken pie place.

1766
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:26,840
Every time we go place, every time we go to knots, you put a comment card in the

1767
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:31,000
box that says, could you shut down the theme park and just focus on chicken pies?

1768
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:32,360
Please.

1769
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:33,760
Could you just?

1770
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:38,480
Yeah. Can you just make it a point to be a dirty roadside

1771
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:42,440
car hop focus on chicken pies and jam, please.

1772
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:43,840
So focus on chicken pie.

1773
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:49,240
This is distracting from your core mission to feed weary travelers going

1774
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:52,680
between L.A. and the and San Diego.

1775
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:59,080
Your your first bluegrass album is called Chicken Pies and Jam.

1776
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:01,200
As far as I'm concerned, when I finally

1777
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:03,920
force you to put out an album, that's after you sing.

1778
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:05,960
That's after you sing the old ones.

1779
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:09,040
Yeah. Like Bill Frawley, which will.

1780
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,960
I guess that episode hasn't come out yet.

1781
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:15,200
There'll be some fun singing of the old ones in a few weeks.

1782
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,960
That's all I will say as a tease.

1783
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:20,120
You know, we got to wait for the recording booth to open back up.

1784
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:24,280
We got to wait for Barry Gordy to have some availability.

1785
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,560
You will only work with Barry Gordy.

1786
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,840
Well, he's still kicking, right?

1787
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:30,040
I believe he is.

1788
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:31,200
I believe. Oh, is he?

1789
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:32,880
Yeah, I believe he's alive.

1790
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:34,360
Oh, I was trying to make it.

1791
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:35,800
I thought he died years ago.

1792
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,800
I'll look it up, but I believe he's alive.

1793
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,360
And I'll cut this out if he's not.

1794
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,120
He is 90 years old, my friend.

1795
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:44,520
Wow.

1796
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:49,520
Barry Gordy, and maybe he's not working, but we'll we'll pull him out of retirement.

1797
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:52,240
Yeah, we'll pull him out when he hears

1798
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:55,680
when he hears that Jason Sheridan from podcast, The Ride wants to start a

1799
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:57,400
recording career.

1800
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,320
He will he will he will get into action.

1801
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:01,600
He'll spring into action.

1802
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:05,240
I thought this day would never come.

1803
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,080
It's like I

1804
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:12,880
I love the ironic theme park podcast.

1805
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:18,800
I was going to say the last one I have is, of course, opening day of Hard Rock Park.

1806
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,200
Oh, that's a good one.

1807
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:21,680
Yeah, that can you imagine?

1808
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:24,880
Can you imagine walking around and seeing

1809
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:27,920
Winston, the punk rock dog?

1810
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:33,560
And can you think you'd have to tear me away from Knights and White Saturn?

1811
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:35,520
What is also great is that if we were

1812
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:39,920
there opening day, we would be one of about 200 people that visited and we would

1813
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:43,400
be able to get on all the rides a lot. Oh, yeah.

1814
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:49,400
So we would not be fighting crowds opening day of Hard Rock Park.

1815
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:50,920
Yeah. So I don't know those.

1816
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:53,720
Honest to God, if the time machine was

1817
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:56,240
giving me one day, that's probably opening Disneyland.

1818
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:58,120
But look, if I have the time machine

1819
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:00,680
for a couple of weeks, you know, I'm going all these places.

1820
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:02,360
Sure.

1821
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:05,960
All right. I got two quick ones to wrap it up.

1822
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:11,320
First one, Alice Carpenter, as all of these older Universal episodes have me

1823
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:13,880
searching eBay for some old Universal merchandise.

1824
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:17,880
What are some of the crazy merchandise for Universal that you stumbled upon?

1825
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,320
Well, I teased this earlier.

1826
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:24,280
I bought I paid twenty dollars for a watch, a rectangular watch, an odd,

1827
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:31,240
odd shaped watch that has the Islands of Adventure lighthouse on it.

1828
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:34,520
And so I'm waiting for that to arrive.

1829
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:37,720
I lost out on an auction for a red

1830
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:42,360
baseball cap that had Nancy and Sligo on it on the front.

1831
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:45,240
Yes. And on the back, it said Islands of Adventure.

1832
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:49,560
It must have been an opening around opening piece of merchandise.

1833
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:51,600
Oh, my God. I really tried.

1834
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:57,240
Was it it ended up going for I think maybe I just waited too long.

1835
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,960
It didn't go for a lot like 15 or 20 bucks.

1836
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:02,000
You lost it. I know.

1837
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:04,120
I know this is great.

1838
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:06,920
There is no I mean, we look we have a lot of fun on this show.

1839
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:08,680
I made a lot of offers.

1840
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,680
I made a lot of offers on that one.

1841
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,920
And then I think I just made too many.

1842
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:14,600
We talk about, you know,

1843
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,080
we've compared you to different cartoon characters.

1844
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:21,440
But I I think my favorite one to compare you to is Sligo.

1845
01:38:21,640 --> 01:38:27,080
Is I mean, look back in the spotlight, the modern the current Nancy comic.

1846
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:28,920
I am I am wonderful.

1847
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:31,360
I am desperately searching for this right now.

1848
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:35,800
It's Islands of Adventure, Nancy and Sligo baseball hat.

1849
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,280
Yeah, it's gone.

1850
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:38,440
This was ages ago.

1851
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:39,520
This is a while ago.

1852
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:40,360
Oh, my God.

1853
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:43,440
I am this is I've never been more panicked to try to find something.

1854
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:45,240
I know. I know. Right.

1855
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:46,520
There's it's not on.

1856
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:49,200
There's not a new one on eBay.

1857
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:51,680
Oh, my God, we have to find this.

1858
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:54,000
We have to all have one, too.

1859
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:55,720
Oh, that'd be great.

1860
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:57,440
Yeah, that'd be really good.

1861
01:38:57,640 --> 01:38:58,400
Oh, my God.

1862
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:00,520
OK, I guess I'm going to have to get back to this.

1863
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:01,400
I guess we'll start.

1864
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:02,680
Yeah, we'll start the hunt.

1865
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,280
You win because I don't have anything nearly as good.

1866
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:09,280
Universal we've talked about before doesn't is a little bit lacking in the

1867
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:11,960
crazy merch arena.

1868
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:13,600
Yeah, we just pay.

1869
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:17,560
I mean, we were there for the 20th anniversary of Islands of Adventure.

1870
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:19,840
And there was no anniversary stuff.

1871
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:21,480
I was shocked.

1872
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:24,680
Yeah, they didn't at least have a T-shirt.

1873
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,160
There's

1874
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:32,280
I see a Dudley Do-Right baseball hat with like Ranger character.

1875
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:33,840
Oh, no, no, no, it is Dudley himself.

1876
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:34,880
Sorry, it's Dudley. Yeah.

1877
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:36,360
He looks weird on the hat, though.

1878
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:40,800
I would know Dudley Do-Right is weird printing on this hat.

1879
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,960
These weren't the best Nance and Sluggos,

1880
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:45,200
which might have made it only the more valuable.

1881
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:46,760
I was going to say that makes it better.

1882
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:51,760
I don't think it had a buy it now option or else, obviously, I would have just done that.

1883
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:55,960
But because like even just going through the hats for Universal,

1884
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:59,960
I'm not seeing anything that like blows me away with its like kitschiness or its

1885
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:05,640
weirdness. Yeah, it's a little I mean, I kind of I like a lot of the merch that you

1886
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:10,480
find on eBay because it's so like square like it is.

1887
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:16,480
There's a lot of like they really tried the year T-shirts for a while.

1888
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:20,120
But yeah, I found an Annie hat, though.

1889
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:21,400
That's pretty good.

1890
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:25,800
Islands of Adventure orphan Annie white youth hat, which sounds like it's a racist

1891
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:30,360
thing, but no, it's just the color of the hat is white and it's for a child.

1892
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:32,480
It sounds us some way.

1893
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:34,280
It definitely sounds odd.

1894
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:38,840
White youth, white youth, saying white youth is really.

1895
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,400
You can't say white youth.

1896
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:43,080
You can't say what youth these days, folks.

1897
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:44,640
Folks, we're bringing it back.

1898
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:47,320
We're bringing back the phrase, we're bringing it back.

1899
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:50,120
The hat measurement and the color white youth.

1900
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:52,760
And we're going to make it happen.

1901
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:55,280
So this is a this hat looks like pretty pristine.

1902
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:58,040
I wonder if this is actually a newer item.

1903
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:02,280
There's like the yeah, there's some kind of hat stuff.

1904
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,480
But Universal really feels like

1905
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:10,120
whereas Disney will carve out 10 percent or 20 percent for retro and to cater to

1906
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:15,640
nerds like us, it feels like Universal is shooting for mainstream purchasing,

1907
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:21,560
you know, 99 percent of the time they're shooting for like grandma who likes cat

1908
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:27,400
in the hat, but she's not looking for some sort of vintage shirt to represent like

1909
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:31,480
the Blues Brothers show that happened 20 years ago in the streets.

1910
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:33,400
I know it's also happening now, but.

1911
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,360
Yeah, and maybe that's part of it.

1912
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:39,040
It's like licensing on some of those movies gets very weird.

1913
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:44,360
But like you would think it would be a given to have like a faded like the neon

1914
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:49,640
Universal Studios Florida sign, like the neon like just Universal Studios logo

1915
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:53,000
that you can see the statue of at Hollywood.

1916
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:55,160
You would think that would be a given.

1917
01:41:55,360 --> 01:42:00,640
Like Disney has like very a long time ago figured out like, oh, let's let's

1918
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:07,000
sell some Heather Gray beat up Mickey shirts like that's like an easy go to purchase.

1919
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:08,760
Yes, it fools my idiot brain.

1920
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:13,360
I go, oh, that that's cool and it looks cool and it makes me seem cool.

1921
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:20,000
Yeah, I I I went down a rabbit hole trying to find like they're they did have a little

1922
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:24,160
bit of older merch that you can find on eBay with the Universal Escape

1923
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:28,440
Universal short lived marketing

1924
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:31,280
logo, which I I don't want to give.

1925
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:33,080
I

1926
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:37,720
wait for her to be back back from maternity leave before I start giving

1927
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:43,040
Eric Gerdner T-shirt design suggestions, but a T-shirt with the in the Universal

1928
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:47,960
Escape style, maybe we just sell one of those and it's just to me.

1929
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:50,480
But I think it's my fancy.

1930
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:54,440
Yeah, is she two weeks out from out of childbirth?

1931
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:58,320
Yes, I think texture after we're done, though, with a couple exclamation points.

1932
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:01,840
Hey, I've got some ideas for new T-shirts to get on this now.

1933
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:03,600
I think you really should start now.

1934
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:07,560
Well, it's like Scott said for this for their son, for their son.

1935
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:09,080
Yes, that's what it's for.

1936
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:11,480
That's what we're doing that for now.

1937
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:13,640
I just found Rare Universal Studios,

1938
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:18,280
Islands of Adventure, Toon Lagoon, Popeye, Coin Medallion.

1939
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:19,480
This is interesting.

1940
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:22,760
Sixty three seventy five was purchased for.

1941
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:24,000
So that's pretty weird.

1942
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:25,960
Is that in like a little booklet?

1943
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:27,680
Yes. A little box.

1944
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:30,400
Yeah, I've come across stuff like that.

1945
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:35,200
Yeah, they did have collectible coins for like odd collectors going after like

1946
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:38,720
the Franklin Mint enthusiasts, right?

1947
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:42,400
The souvenir spoon

1948
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:44,080
enthusiast. Hey, bring that.

1949
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:46,080
Let's bring back tiny souvenir spoons.

1950
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:47,640
Maybe that's something we need.

1951
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,360
The spoon collecting market.

1952
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:50,400
Spoon collecting.

1953
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:54,080
Because, yeah, pins, I don't know, are pins as popular?

1954
01:43:54,280 --> 01:43:56,880
They tried. I mean, they have a lot of pins.

1955
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:59,600
They tried doing a little pin thing for a while.

1956
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:03,600
Right. But I think spoons, spoons is the way forward.

1957
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:08,040
I mean, there's fan blogs, there's blogs and podcasts just about Universal.

1958
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:12,920
Like the I think the market is there for a little bit of weird stuff.

1959
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:14,200
Yes.

1960
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:17,120
I mean, we've met some of the merchandise people from Knots.

1961
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:20,720
And they're all in on the company's history on like obscure stuff.

1962
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:24,240
And I am very impressed with what they do with the smaller.

1963
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:26,680
Yeah. You know, staff and stuff they have.

1964
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:30,880
They can't go hardcore, though, because like we want like circle Cloud nine and

1965
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:34,400
Circle K shirts, which I think they may have done a little bit a while ago.

1966
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:36,120
But those aren't always in circulation.

1967
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:38,240
And also we want the music of Knots,

1968
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:41,400
which doesn't seem to be anything that they'll do soon.

1969
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:45,000
No, because like Knots has like there's an original song.

1970
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,240
There's a lot of original music,

1971
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:51,760
but there's an original song on the Halloween overlay of the log flume ride

1972
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:55,680
of the I'm blanking on the name of it because I'm in a hot room and I can't

1973
01:44:55,680 --> 01:44:57,120
remember anything. Timber Mountain Log.

1974
01:44:57,320 --> 01:44:58,920
Thank you. Timber Mountain Log ride.

1975
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:03,840
There's an original song that that animal band is playing and I want it.

1976
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:07,760
I want to listen to I want to listen to I want to make a playlist of that.

1977
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:10,040
A Travis Scott song.

1978
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:12,560
All my favorites.

1979
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:16,520
It's just those two and they loop.

1980
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:23,600
Yes, the Travis Scott song I like and the Timber Mountain Log Halloween overlay

1981
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:25,960
music, Halloween overlay. All right.

1982
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:26,880
What else was your last?

1983
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:28,880
OK, we have last one.

1984
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:32,040
It feels fitting because I know you said you want to go watch better call.

1985
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:35,800
So this from user Draking Bad Draking Band.

1986
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,880
Nice.

1987
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:41,920
What's your favorite Disney resort hotel that you've never stayed in?

1988
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:43,760
This is a funny you.

1989
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:47,680
This is the you just picked like a very dry clinical question to end here.

1990
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:50,320
I figured it would inspire some conversation.

1991
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:51,720
It'd be a nice note to end on.

1992
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:52,720
It sure sure it would.

1993
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:58,400
But it wasn't like, you know, which which character would be.

1994
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:01,560
Oh, no. If you have one of those, we can end on one of those.

1995
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,640
No, I don't think I have one.

1996
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:06,080
I'll give you my answer, I think.

1997
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:08,280
And it was Disney specific. Is that right?

1998
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:11,680
They said Disney. Yeah.

1999
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:15,040
Yeah, I think I have stayed.

2000
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:17,880
I am very lucky I have stayed at all the big three.

2001
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:24,120
I've stayed at the three contemporary Grand Floridian and Polynesian.

2002
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:29,920
So I think that Animal Kingdom Lodge looks cool and I have I would like to stay

2003
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:32,600
there because it reminds me of Grand Californian.

2004
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:35,560
Very lucky I've stayed there as well.

2005
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:38,240
But I like I'm very fascinated by it.

2006
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:40,760
I haven't even actually been over there

2007
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,240
to that hotel.

2008
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:44,560
Oh, I ate a Boma once.

2009
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:47,000
Yeah, it's really neat.

2010
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:49,480
So, yeah, I think it's that I think that's my answer.

2011
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:53,800
But, you know, there's new ones opening up if if things open up.

2012
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,160
What's the new one called that's opening or opened Reflections Reflections?

2013
01:46:58,360 --> 01:46:59,520
Disney Resort.

2014
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:01,800
I mean, that looks interesting.

2015
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,160
Yeah.

2016
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:05,520
But yeah, I don't know.

2017
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:07,640
I would you have a big one?

2018
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:09,960
Well, I

2019
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:12,640
yeah, for practical reason, I

2020
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:17,000
and we my family have talked about doing this next time we go down.

2021
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:20,280
I've never stayed at the yacht or beach club.

2022
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:24,320
And that is the only way to get to the crazy pool nowadays.

2023
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:27,000
Like you used to just be able to.

2024
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:31,520
We would I mean, we would stay on site and we would like pool hop all the time.

2025
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:33,960
And if you stayed at a Disney hotel, that was kosher.

2026
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:37,440
And if you were cool about it, it was always kosher.

2027
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:40,320
And then it was just vacation clubs.

2028
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:41,600
Members could pool hop.

2029
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:43,560
So we got that perk for a few years.

2030
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:45,520
And then

2031
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:50,040
now I think they've even limited that pool specifically to like, yeah,

2032
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:53,000
vacation club members can still do some pool hopping.

2033
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:55,560
They cannot go to

2034
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:57,240
God, I'm blanking on the name.

2035
01:47:57,440 --> 01:48:02,720
It's like it's a big selling point for the resort.

2036
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:03,840
Hmm.

2037
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:05,400
I don't know.

2038
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:10,280
I what's funny about it is I didn't even think about Yacht and Beach Club or

2039
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:14,520
Boardwalk because I hang out over there so much in my brain.

2040
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:17,400
I felt like I have been there, but I have not stayed.

2041
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:19,440
Yeah, I have not stayed at either place.

2042
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:23,400
And I would love to do that, too, because that's what the boardwalk a couple of

2043
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:28,120
times and yeah, it's great that combined with Epcot Center like that combined with

2044
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:31,080
World Showcase, I don't should I?

2045
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:35,520
Is that the best plot of land on the Disney World Resort?

2046
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:41,600
Is that the best, coolest section, especially as our adult year as adults?

2047
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:44,160
As adults, I think, yeah,

2048
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:48,360
being able to walk to Epcot and Hollywood Studios and having that many bars

2049
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:52,560
and restaurants and nice hotels, it is pretty.

2050
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:55,480
It is pretty hard to beat

2051
01:48:55,680 --> 01:49:00,520
that as far as ambiance at night is hanging out on the boardwalk or hanging

2052
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:04,280
out at Yacht and Beach Club, walking into World Showcase, leaving.

2053
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:08,440
I think I said this on the episode when we on our recap of when we took our trip

2054
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:12,120
is that I was really wound up the day first day we got there just because I

2055
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:16,200
hadn't slept a lot trying to coordinate everybody getting into the park at the

2056
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:19,040
same time, blah, blah, blah. And I went over.

2057
01:49:19,240 --> 01:49:20,760
I sat at World Showcase.

2058
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:25,000
I had a drink while I watched the Bahamian.

2059
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:29,040
I and I remember going like having a sigh and I went, ah, yes.

2060
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:31,160
And then I walked World Showcase.

2061
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:34,000
So I met up with you, gave you a piece of bread that I had bought.

2062
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:36,880
And then we walked over Yacht and Beach Club boardwalk area.

2063
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:38,880
And I was like, this is the greatest.

2064
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:42,240
Yeah, the greatest place.

2065
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:48,160
So I guess Yacht Beach Club actually might be my answer to Storm Along Bay is the

2066
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:50,040
with the place I was trying to think of.

2067
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:53,000
That's the big like themed pool area.

2068
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:55,920
And you got the Cape May Seafood Buffet.

2069
01:49:56,120 --> 01:49:58,160
You got beaches and cream.

2070
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:00,240
You got all those restaurants.

2071
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:05,600
I've also never stayed like right in the middle of like the main building

2072
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:09,560
and contemporary like I stayed at Bay Lake Tower once.

2073
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:10,920
You know what? That's a good quote.

2074
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:12,320
You know, you're making a good point.

2075
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:17,920
I have maybe not stayed in that main building ever, even when I was.

2076
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:19,520
I got to ask my mom.

2077
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:24,720
There used to be two wings and they demolished the one to build Bay Lake

2078
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:27,320
Tower and the other is still there.

2079
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:28,280
That's you know what?

2080
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:32,160
You're bringing up a very good point that I maybe when I was a kid, we didn't stay

2081
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:36,160
in that main building and that still needs to be done at a certain point in my

2082
01:50:36,360 --> 01:50:39,200
vacationing. Yeah, I mean, you're right.

2083
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:43,600
I like those main those main lodge design, the wilderness lodge in Grand

2084
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:48,480
California, that means sort of like you come out into I don't know how much sound

2085
01:50:48,680 --> 01:50:52,680
travels into those rooms overlooking a giant concourse like that.

2086
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:53,680
But right.

2087
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:56,120
All right. So that's

2088
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:57,600
those are the answers.

2089
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:58,880
There's a few of them.

2090
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:05,160
And now the real final question, which animatronic would you not want as your

2091
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:06,720
surgeon?

2092
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:08,920
Oh, as my is that real?

2093
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:10,200
Are you serious? No, I just made that up.

2094
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:13,080
OK, you can answer, though.

2095
01:51:15,080 --> 01:51:21,720
Uncle Orville, it seems like he has doesn't have the right temperament for a surgeon

2096
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:24,360
to cantankerous, so right.

2097
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:28,880
I'd probably get along with him personally, but I don't know if I want him slicing me

2098
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:32,280
open. Yeah, I would like you know what?

2099
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:38,600
My answer for this is who I do want is the probe droid on Rise to the Resistance.

2100
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:40,360
Oh, yeah, he's ready to go.

2101
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:41,440
He's ready to go.

2102
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:43,720
He knows how to probe easily.

2103
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:48,000
You can easily program him to do open heart surgery or something.

2104
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:51,440
I assume that's my understanding.

2105
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:53,280
Anyway,

2106
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:55,000
we are over two hours here.

2107
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,880
How about that? Oh, how about that?

2108
01:51:57,080 --> 01:52:02,960
Great. So I guess I guess I guess we'll call it here.

2109
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:06,600
Send us more questions next when we ask for these next time.

2110
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:07,480
I don't know why I'm asking.

2111
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:10,000
You could send us questions whenever you want.

2112
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:11,600
Yeah.

2113
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:13,920
And we'll get to more mailbags.

2114
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:16,640
And also, we like answer stuff on Twitter or Twitter.

2115
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:18,520
So, you know,

2116
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:22,320
just just hit us up at all the different social medias.

2117
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:28,640
You have again survived the Jason and Mike portion of podcast, the ride.

2118
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:34,040
No big announcements as far as any children we're having, but hopefully a lot

2119
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:40,280
of fun and a lot of laughs follow us on all the social media, Instagram, Twitter,

2120
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:43,640
Twitch, it's all podcasts, the podcast, the ride.

2121
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:44,800
You know how to do it.

2122
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,160
You're probably following already.

2123
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:47,520
You know what you should do, too?

2124
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:51,840
While I'm doing this is rate and review us on iTunes.

2125
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:53,400
Yeah, we always forget to say that now.

2126
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:54,400
We always forget.

2127
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:56,320
Help us. It does help us.

2128
01:52:56,520 --> 01:53:00,680
I still a little bit unclear how it helps us, but supposedly it does.

2129
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:03,160
So rate and review us on iTunes.

2130
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:07,440
And yes, we will see you next week or next Wednesday.

2131
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:08,920
If you're a Patreon subscriber.

2132
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:10,440
Also, a quick plug.

2133
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:16,080
We have a paywall Patreon, a lot more fun stuff we're doing over there.

2134
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:19,040
You know, very special topics like the

2135
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:24,200
film that plays in the Eminem store in Las Vegas, specifically in Las Vegas,

2136
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:25,800
as it is Las Vegas themed.

2137
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,920
Yes, it's specifically Las Vegas themed the video, the film.

2138
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:31,960
So all fun stuff over there.

2139
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:36,000
And yeah, you got anything else you want anything to plug, Jason?

2140
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:36,720
No.

2141
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:39,560
Any eBay auctions you'd like to plug that you're trying to win?

2142
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:41,160
No, no.

2143
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:44,080
OK, well, then I think we can say goodbye.

2144
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:46,440
