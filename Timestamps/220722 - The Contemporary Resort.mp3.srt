1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,240
Warning, the following podcast may be teaming

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,240
with five-legged goats, honey booths, and duck tambou.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,400
People have got to know whether or not

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,220
their podcast is a crook.

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,680
Well, we're not a crook.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,960
We're covering the Contemporary Hotel

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,880
and we're Podcast The Ride.

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,680
In-house noises

11
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,100
Welcome to Podcast The Ride,

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,260
a podcast that's like a monorail of information

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,500
running right through the middle of your brain atrium.

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,220
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Mike Carlson.

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,700
My brain atrium is one of the most pleasant places to be.

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,180
I just want to say that now.

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,780
Mm-hmm, beautiful interior decorating.

18
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,020
Beautiful old murals,

19
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,620
but my atrium and the hotel's atrium,

20
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,740
both equally pleasant, I want to say.

21
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,260
Right, and- And I'm very excited.

22
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,620
Yeah, that metaphor makes a lot of sense.

23
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,500
Jason Sheridan, hi.

24
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,900
And my atrium is more like the layout of the building

25
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,860
or design of the building, I guess I should say,

26
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,780
which is to say brutalist.

27
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,980
Mm-hmm.

28
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,180
Whoa, a hot take.

29
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,980
Hot take early in the podcast.

30
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,260
Dark thoughts, I guess.

31
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,460
Brutalist brain of Jason Sheridan.

32
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,140
Maybe that's what we just abandoned the episode

33
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,060
about the hotel and get in, dig in deep.

34
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,020
What is so brutal?

35
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,620
What is he talking about, folks?

36
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,420
Please, Michael, I have 17 pages about the contemporary.

37
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,900
Yeah, a lot to get.

38
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,260
There's a lot of pictures, granted.

39
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,060
The fuel of that brutalist brain of yours

40
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,540
with that apricot LaCroix. With the apricot, yeah.

41
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,700
It's delicious, I saw it in the fridge,

42
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,820
I was like, oh, I gotta try the apricot.

43
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,740
Brutalist brain fuel.

44
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,460
Today's episode is about Disney's contemporary resort,

45
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,140
one of the original two Disney World hotels

46
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,700
that opened in 1971.

47
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,740
Of course, the big, grand, futuristic hotel

48
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,020
that the monorail actually runs through.

49
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,660
And this is a video one, so if you're watching this,

50
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,940
or if you go to the Forever Dog YouTube,

51
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,540
you can see that I've brought my pride and joy,

52
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,460
which you can just hear.

53
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,100
You can hear that, that's all you get if you're listening,

54
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,660
is me pounding on it.

55
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,540
But if you're watching, I brought in my contemporary toy,

56
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,220
which I'm very proud of.

57
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,220
I lit it up from the inside, it doesn't come that way.

58
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,500
All you have to do is have a wire running not hidden

59
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,740
through the part where the monorail goes through.

60
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,580
I love this, this is one of my favorite items that I have.

61
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,180
I'm so excited that there is a big physical contemporary

62
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,380
that you can own.

63
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,060
Like a toy for the dorkiest child.

64
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,900
Oh yeah.

65
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,740
It could ever be.

66
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,500
It is, I've seen this, you've had this for a long time,

67
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,500
obviously, and it's something that I am jealous of,

68
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,820
and I haven't yet, until now, thought,

69
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,340
oh, I should buy this on eBay.

70
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,700
There's nothing stopping you.

71
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,740
It's not a rare item, you looked it up,

72
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,780
you can get it in a bundle with the other.

73
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,420
200 bucks, I think, for the monorail, the contemporary,

74
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,660
and maybe a spaceship Earth toy as well.

75
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,220
You're talking vintage,

76
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,780
because they still sell the contemporary.

77
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,060
Oh, you can get this thing?

78
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,020
I think you can get a newer version of this.

79
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,020
Oh, interesting.

80
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,980
And I'm on top of this.

81
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,220
Mine is just fine the way it is,

82
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,660
it doesn't need to be newer.

83
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,740
Well, you've got the real deal,

84
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,540
you've got the real deal vintage one.

85
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,340
I don't know, this might be from like four years ago,

86
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,340
I have no idea.

87
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,420
I like it, is the point.

88
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,260
It's dusty as a motherfucker,

89
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,980
but there's so many nooks and crannies,

90
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,340
every little hotel, oh, my fingers get in,

91
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,700
everybody else's frame, the contemporary's in,

92
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,140
I don't know, this is a very strange gesture I'm doing.

93
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,220
Look, look at the rooms.

94
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,340
They get very dusty in these little sleeves,

95
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,420
so the upkeep is difficult,

96
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,140
and I might start sneezing a lot during this episode,

97
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,340
not COVID, as far as I know, yet.

98
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,940
This is like great sort of play sets,

99
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,220
great play sets and toys,

100
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,900
and I don't wanna get off on a tangent here,

101
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,740
I don't wanna get off on a rant.

102
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,700
You about toys and play sets?

103
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,860
Just quickly, yeah.

104
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,940
This company, NECA, that makes the turtle toys I buy,

105
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,340
they're gonna make a turtle sewer,

106
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,900
that's the big rumor, we've seen pictures of it.

107
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,420
But I feel like contemporary,

108
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,420
as far as Disney World locations,

109
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,340
that's kind of number one, maybe,

110
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,540
as far as you want a play set of,

111
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,260
because it's so iconic.

112
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,720
Obviously, the castle's cool, but Disneyland got a castle.

113
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,460
This is so unique to Disney World.

114
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,220
I feel like maybe it is my main play set

115
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,660
from Disney World that I would want.

116
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,740
It's so Disney World specific,

117
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,780
so specific to that early, it's the Vacation Kingdom.

118
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,700
It's an emblem of the Vacation Kingdom,

119
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,260
but it's still iconic to this day.

120
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,940
This has ended up being in the background

121
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,500
of kind of all my Zooms for the seven years

122
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,440
that this all has been going on,

123
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,680
and let me tell you, it is a conversation starter.

124
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,920
The conversation goes, oh, yes, the Disney Hotel

125
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,200
is one of the hotels that used to be there,

126
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,040
and then that keeps going for two minutes,

127
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,880
and then the second part of the conversation,

128
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,320
the other person says, oh.

129
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,400
So if you wanna start that conversation,

130
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,880
get one of these and get it into the background of your Zoom.

131
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,360
If you wanna befuddle someone.

132
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,060
Yeah, yeah, if you wanna make them wish

133
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,040
they hadn't asked the question.

134
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,440
If you had just a collection of different hotels,

135
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,680
maybe that would actually make more,

136
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,000
you're like, well, I collect models of hotels.

137
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,400
That I've stayed at.

138
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,220
Yeah, I mean, I sort of do.

139
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,360
There's just not that many of them,

140
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,840
because I have a little mug of the Bonaventure Hotel,

141
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,920
which is the futuristic, the John Portman Hotel

142
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,960
with the elevator pods in downtown LA.

143
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,840
I have a ceramic mug of it, essentially,

144
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,200
that I use to hold pencils.

145
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,520
But that's, as far as I know, it's not like a big area.

146
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,400
Is brutalist architecture in little forms

147
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,240
you can put on your desk.

148
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,320
If we put it out there, I mean, we have a lot of listeners,

149
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,040
some that work in toy companies,

150
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,760
I assume people that obviously have made doll,

151
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,260
Michael Eisner doll for us.

152
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,600
I'm not calling for a custom built hotel or anything.

153
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,760
I'm just saying, maybe if we put that out there,

154
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,440
people, we could realize that there's a market

155
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,360
for hotels that we like,

156
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,320
that you wanna display a miniature version of.

157
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,680
So look, if somebody wanted to,

158
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,660
there's so many buildings to choose from

159
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,860
in the Peachtree District in Atlanta.

160
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,720
I would take any of them.

161
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,960
It doesn't need to be the Westin or the Sheraton,

162
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,880
whatever you want.

163
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,600
This is like your Ninja Turtle level fandom.

164
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,480
I need every cartoon character

165
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,800
that they made in the original cartoon.

166
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm like, I gotta get all these,

167
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,800
because I never dreamed it would happen.

168
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,520
If there was a line of hotels,

169
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,440
you would have to get it all.

170
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,720
You would have as crazy a display as I have.

171
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,500
Actually, yeah, if there truly was,

172
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,960
I'm trying to think of other ones.

173
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,720
I mean, this wouldn't be in the line.

174
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,600
This is in the 10th release.

175
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,700
But we stayed in a Hyatt Regency near Disney

176
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,800
in Garden Grove that had a really good atrium.

177
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,560
And I'd love to have that in the current color

178
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,120
and in the original peach.

179
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,600
Exactly, that's how you do the toys.

180
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,200
You do a variant that has the different colors.

181
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,080
And then they could have a Comic-Con exclusive hotel.

182
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,400
Maybe it was only painted a certain color for a year.

183
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,520
Not only the hardcore hotel fans know.

184
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,960
And that's the one you get at Comic-Con,

185
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,920
because it's only they made 500 of them.

186
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,080
I'm finally in your world.

187
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,920
I'm locked in.

188
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,420
I just want to point out that the presence

189
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:35,240
of a customized toy has Mike immediately gassed up.

190
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,160
You're saying that my energy rose.

191
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,120
My energy rose naturally.

192
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,440
Scott perked up a little at the talk

193
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,360
of brutalist architectural hotel designs.

194
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,520
You perked up a little bit, but Mike, he's got the juice.

195
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,680
I like to toyify things.

196
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,680
So sometimes when I'm talking to people about toys,

197
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,920
I try to figure out exactly what their completest collector,

198
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,680
what would unlock their completest in them.

199
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,760
Because a lot of people like toys

200
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,280
and some have just a few of them.

201
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,840
And only a few people I know are like kind of completists.

202
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,000
But I believe everyone has something

203
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,200
they would be a completist about.

204
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,040
Oh yeah.

205
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,880
That's interesting.

206
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,840
Think about that at home.

207
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,720
What is the, you think you're not a toy person,

208
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,200
but if they made toys of that.

209
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,040
Exactly.

210
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,400
And tell us in the comments, what would you want?

211
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,760
What deep obscure thing?

212
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,600
Exactly.

213
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,840
So yeah, Jason, you collect some toys.

214
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,680
I collect some toys.

215
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,840
Will there be a specific, like islands of adventure,

216
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,100
high level toys based on just like the rides

217
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,980
and the iconography of islands of adventure?

218
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,980
I think if they had like, you know,

219
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,780
were Christmas villages big where you grew up,

220
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,740
like a tabletop Christmas,

221
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,620
like your parents would pull out the pieces and stuff.

222
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,620
If they had a full islands of adventure

223
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,100
with like each piece sold individually

224
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,900
of each like a landmark and you could,

225
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,900
you know, put them on a table with like fake snow,

226
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,140
with like cotton snow and light it up.

227
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,140
Oh, that sounds nice.

228
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,980
Yeah.

229
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,340
So, so yeah, as we said, yeah.

230
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,020
What would be your completest thing?

231
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,580
I have four or five completest things.

232
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,140
They're reissuing.

233
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,420
They make yours.

234
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,380
Yeah, in the last few years they are.

235
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,980
Yeah, this is, I'm all on my lonesome here.

236
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,060
It's just me and you contemporary.

237
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,220
See on the video, I can kind of nuzzle it.

238
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,940
I think there are, there are more,

239
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,660
we're getting, the only thing standing in the way of this

240
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,580
is that plastic prices and things are rising.

241
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,340
Shipping is rising, but price wise,

242
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,740
that's the only thing because they're a company

243
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,980
that's more obscure and more obscure

244
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,100
as far as what collectibles people are making.

245
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,980
So I don't think this is out of the realm of possibility

246
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,100
that someone would make a hotel, a model line.

247
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,940
Yeah.

248
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,820
Start cranking them out.

249
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,660
Yeah.

250
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,940
I, exactly one person is your customer.

251
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,780
I know on Yelp, I have seen crafters make

252
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:00,020
like desktop organizers or lamps

253
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,180
that are replicas of the lamps that some of these,

254
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,460
like craftsman style lamps in the style of the ones

255
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,140
in the Grand California or lamps in the style

256
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,260
of what you would see at the Animal Kingdom Lodge.

257
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,100
Would you be completest if you could purchase

258
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,820
all of the sort of light fixtures in an old Pizza Hut?

259
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,860
Oh yeah.

260
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,700
Tiffany lamps.

261
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,520
Tiffany lamps.

262
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,360
Oh absolutely, yeah.

263
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,340
If I could recreate the Canaan Road Pizza Hut

264
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:29,900
where I was having a Batley from Eureka's Castle

265
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,420
and then I spilled it everywhere,

266
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,340
but I still have very fond memories.

267
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,460
I'm drinking your soda.

268
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,300
It's my Batley.

269
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,140
That's your Batley.

270
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:38,980
Sounds like Lovitz.

271
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,820
Or Chuck E. Cheese.

272
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,780
Oh yeah.

273
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,860
That was Batley, I don't recall.

274
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,020
I don't remember what Batley sounded like.

275
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,820
He would say, I meant to do that, I believe.

276
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,180
I think that's what he would say.

277
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,740
Let's see, that again sounds very Lovitz to me.

278
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,580
Was Lovitz the voice of Batley?

279
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,340
I think I did say I meant to do that.

280
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,300
Didn't Batley say I meant to do that?

281
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,900
I don't remember a single other fact about Eureka's Castle

282
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,860
besides that the puppet spilled my soda

283
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,540
in the Agurah Hills Pizza Hut.

284
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,380
Yes, Batley would say.

285
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,300
Sit down Pizza Hut.

286
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,440
He would say, I meant to do that.

287
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,060
Yeah, Batley.

288
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,580
We haven't talked about Batley on the show yet.

289
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,660
No, yeah, Eureka's Castle could be.

290
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,620
There's plenty of opportunities in Eureka's Castle.

291
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,500
Yeah, play sets, all that.

292
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,300
I just bought, because we were on sale,

293
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,060
for like $4 each, I bought these little pieces

294
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,660
to connect and make a little Seinfeld apartment.

295
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,500
Okay.

296
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,860
It cost like 25 bucks.

297
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,500
Is it an empty apartment?

298
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,660
No, well they have little like peg pieces of the characters,

299
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,220
which I'm not, that's fine,

300
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,740
but I wanted just the apartment.

301
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,580
Okay.

302
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,400
You're more about the space, you want that?

303
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,580
Yeah, I was excited to have this space displayed.

304
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,540
Does it have the bike back there?

305
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,660
I actually haven't put it together,

306
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,460
so it might be painted on.

307
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,300
Okay, does it have, so you don't know,

308
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,180
it doesn't have his wall of VHSs, or you have to check?

309
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,020
I'll check, I'll check.

310
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,860
Let me know, let me know.

311
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,460
I haven't put it together yet, yeah.

312
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,020
Or do an unboxing.

313
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,140
Let the audience in on it.

314
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,940
We haven't done a lot of hotels.

315
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,580
We did a hotel sector in the City Walk saga.

316
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,940
We covered Sloppy Telly's Sheraton and Hilton,

317
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,820
but this is the first of the Disney's, I believe,

318
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,180
right in front of us now.

319
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,020
Right.

320
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,100
And I feel like there's a whole year on hotels, probably.

321
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,940
Oh yeah.

322
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,580
If we wanted to entertain ourselves

323
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,540
and perhaps bore some percentage of the audience.

324
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,740
Not this one though,

325
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,300
because this, there's a ton going on here.

326
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,100
There's entertainment, a ride goes through it.

327
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,420
We're almost talking about rides.

328
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,540
A ride goes through what we're talking about today.

329
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,540
I mean, that made a very, very clear impression.

330
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,420
Maybe even before I went,

331
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,140
was the pictures of the monorail

332
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,740
going through the Contemporary.

333
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,340
Yeah, which still seemed very futuristic at the time.

334
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,540
It feels futuristic now.

335
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,820
You don't see this all the time.

336
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,140
This is one of the great feats of man.

337
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,140
To have a monorail.

338
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,620
Eighth, ninth, tenth wonder of the world.

339
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,460
Yeah.

340
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,300
At this point.

341
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,060
I don't know how many they're up to.

342
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,420
Well, they're really only seven, right?

343
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,740
And Andre the Giant is the eighth

344
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,540
and China is the ninth, wrestler-wise.

345
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,300
But I think technically eight.

346
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,140
Okay, okay.

347
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,580
I don't think there's been an official declaration

348
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,420
of an eighth wonder of the world.

349
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,060
We have to decide if people are allowed in the list or not.

350
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,380
But the seven, yeah, the seven,

351
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,660
I think the seven was set in stone before.

352
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,220
No, iconic part of the early Disney world skyline,

353
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,820
because they didn't have all those other areas yet.

354
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,900
Primarily it was that Magic Kingdom zone

355
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,700
and you only had two hotels at the time.

356
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,940
Grand Floridian came later.

357
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,820
So when you went there, this is what you saw.

358
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,580
You saw the future.

359
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,100
It was nothing. And later spirits.

360
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,860
Yeah, and this was, by the way,

361
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,900
supposed to be a massive hotel district.

362
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,460
The unbuilt, the Persian hotel,

363
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,380
we eventually, there is a hotel called the Venetian,

364
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,940
but Disney had plans for a hotel called the Venetian Hotel.

365
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,420
Oh, really?

366
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,300
There are all these unbuilt hotels

367
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,900
that were gonna be themed after world destinations.

368
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,060
Okay, yeah, yeah.

369
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,620
So yeah, it was a much more,

370
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,140
usual the blue sky is very ambitious

371
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,860
and then we end up with less.

372
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,060
I mean, there's still talk that they'll,

373
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,900
there's been talk that they'll,

374
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,740
because right now there's only-

375
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,580
There's still room.

376
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,460
There are apparently a lot of sinkholes in this area

377
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,540
and that scuttled some progress.

378
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,500
Yeah, that's true.

379
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,700
Florida is swampy and maybe long-term,

380
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,980
not the best building area.

381
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,260
Love to eat steel girders.

382
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,100
Just the earth takes them back.

383
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,740
But they finally connected, right?

384
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,860
We talked about this before on the show.

385
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,100
They finally connected the Magic Kingdom to Grand Floridian.

386
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,580
Grand Floridian, it only took 50 years

387
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,820
to get that project done.

388
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,420
It feels like that was probably supposed

389
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,380
to happen much sooner.

390
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,220
Yeah.

391
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,140
But they really took their time.

392
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,700
It took a half of a century to do that.

393
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,540
Priorities.

394
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,820
They also in the last decade have made it much more clear

395
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,860
and safe that you can walk from the contemporary

396
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,180
to the Magic Kingdom.

397
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,180
Yeah, but yeah, I would say like,

398
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,820
when I think about, oh yeah, it would be awesome

399
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,580
if there was like 10 hotels or something around this,

400
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,140
but I don't know.

401
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,420
I kind of like that it takes a couple minutes for you

402
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,100
to see that you're like a big picture of the next hotel.

403
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,820
I like that there's three.

404
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,300
The space makes it feel, especially when I was a kid,

405
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,100
much more like kind of magical.

406
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,780
When you get little lengths of monorail ride in between

407
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,220
if you were stopping every minute, it might get annoying.

408
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,580
Right, so yeah, I'm sure they could build cool stuff

409
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,860
around it, but I kind of like there's only three.

410
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,860
I kind of think it's cool and it gives like,

411
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,500
yeah, the space gives it a little bit more

412
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,140
of a anticipation.

413
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,460
I keep saying especially as a child,

414
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,740
but we all know what I'm talking about,

415
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,420
especially as now an adult.

416
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,340
Continually, but as a kid, I remember being like,

417
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,220
you're peering out and you're like, oh, it's over there

418
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,140
and I can see it in just a little.

419
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,460
That feels like if you were stopping every two seconds

420
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,500
and it felt like you were just going in a big mall

421
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,300
or something like that, that would be less fun.

422
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,020
All three deluxe hotels, because they say,

423
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,140
I think the view and they justify it being close

424
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,220
to the Magic Kingdom.

425
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:14,140
Does anyone want a hazard guess on a nightly rate

426
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,300
a month from now in August?

427
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,380
Oh, from now?

428
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,180
Yeah, I'll guess.

429
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,020
So.

430
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,020
$565.

431
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,860
Okay.

432
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,900
I looked up the price of what it is

433
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,500
if you want a theme park room, so I'll refrain.

434
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,900
This is an expensive hotel.

435
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,740
What are you seeing?

436
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,900
So what I was seeing for middle of August,

437
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,900
so a month out, for a main tower, this guy

438
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,020
that we're looking at, main tower theme park view,

439
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,100
$741 a night.

440
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,420
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

441
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,460
Main tower lake view, $680, garden wing, $493.

442
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,860
So getting closer to reasonable in those garden wing rooms.

443
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,700
Closer.

444
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,540
Closer.

445
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,380
Technically.

446
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,500
I spoke with my mother before doing this episode

447
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,180
and she said that they pay, what, $60 in the 70s,

448
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,020
I believe, for a night.

449
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,740
And I believe we stayed there when I was little

450
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,820
and it was more than that, but Lindsey and I stayed there

451
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:14,060
like eight years ago, or maybe I guess 10 years ago

452
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,580
at this point, and it was half what you're saying.

453
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,140
It was like 300, the Luxo hotels were all kind of like

454
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,820
$300 at that point.

455
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,620
You have a park view, where'd you stay?

456
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,460
Point on the.

457
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,580
Well the problem is it was one of the other towers

458
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,660
and I was stupid and I didn't realize it wasn't even that.

459
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,500
They probably confused you in all the text.

460
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,340
They did confuse me.

461
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,540
Now I wouldn't be confused, now I'm savvy,

462
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,980
but at the time it was the first time back

463
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,540
going to Disney World and I said, let's splurge a little,

464
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,980
let's do two at Grand Floridian, two at Contemporary,

465
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,460
it's a little expensive, not that expensive.

466
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,540
But then we got there and I was like,

467
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,300
oh shit, it's in one of the extra towers.

468
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,660
What's the point, that's stupid,

469
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,100
we may as well have been in an All-Star.

470
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,940
Gotcha.

471
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:53,940
One of the wings demolished around 2007, 2008

472
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,940
to build the Bay Lake Tower, then opened in 2009.

473
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,940
Yeah, so that was a little bit of a bummer.

474
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,020
Here's the other bummer about the price of it also,

475
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,060
and you find this at a lot of Disney hotels,

476
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,700
is like, oh it looks cool, like they say,

477
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,060
they make a toy of it, it looks good on the outside.

478
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,700
You get into the room and it is like

479
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,220
the most basic-ass hotel room you've ever seen.

480
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,780
These seem like just really, it's just a box.

481
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,620
These are not extraordinary.

482
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,460
Yeah, the one in the main tower.

483
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,380
Now a great view obviously if you get on that balcony.

484
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,260
Yeah, and I think the other ones are probably nicer,

485
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,780
the ones in the, what are you saying?

486
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,620
The Garden Way.

487
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,380
Yeah, they're built in the 70s

488
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,740
and clearly not like super rehabbed

489
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,100
other than putting the pictures of the Incredibles in there.

490
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,420
I'm sure we know about the way that this was built,

491
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,740
the way that the rooms were installed,

492
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,100
which is like drawers and a dresser,

493
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,100
that a crane, that the rooms were all built off-site,

494
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,640
fully built, like with wallpaper and tubs and everything.

495
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,780
Beds, furnishing, all fully built,

496
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,660
that this was built in conjunction

497
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,020
with the United States Steel Corporation.

498
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,780
The architect Walter Beckett is credited

499
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,260
with a lot of the design.

500
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,540
Welton Beckett is the guy actually, the first.

501
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,380
Welton?

502
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,980
Not Walter.

503
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,860
I don't believe so.

504
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:26,220
You might be getting close to Walter Becker from Steely Man.

505
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,940
I think it's Welton Beckett.

506
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,060
Here's Scott's architect corner

507
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,860
because what this guy designed and built,

508
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,260
these are like, especially LA, major icons of LA,

509
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,060
the Capitol Records building was this guy

510
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,780
the Cinerama Dome, the dearly currently departed,

511
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,300
but coming back with a lot of gross sounding food.

512
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,140
You're right.

513
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,020
Cinerama Dome, the Pan Pacific Auditorium,

514
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,980
which was this old LA landmark, this old theater

515
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,620
that now is just, there's a park and a gymnasium there,

516
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,980
but it used to be this like grand theater.

517
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,320
It's what the gates at Hollywood Studios

518
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,080
and California Adventure are based on,

519
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,620
those like big art deco with the stripes going around them

520
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,700
and a big setting in the film Xanadu,

521
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,900
also important for that reason.

522
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,860
Wow.

523
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,020
So iconic imagery from the sky, contemporary included.

524
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,660
Also the Reunion Tower in Dallas, which is the big,

525
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,500
one of my other favorites,

526
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,700
I would collect every one of these.

527
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,860
I was gonna say, they should do a line of just this guy.

528
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,700
Yeah.

529
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,100
Oh my, just start here.

530
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,940
Oh, if I can have a little Capitol Records,

531
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,140
someone must have made.

532
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,820
They have to have made a little Capitol Records.

533
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,700
Yeah, the Capitol Records building.

534
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,540
Yeah.

535
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,300
I mean, if you haven't seen it in LA,

536
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,340
driving down the 101, yeah, incredible piece of art

537
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,260
that looks like a stack of 45 records.

538
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,660
Now you're getting gassed up.

539
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,620
Now you're getting, yeah.

540
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,620
Oh yeah, look at this.

541
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,780
Can I get a miniature Capitol Records building?

542
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,660
I, it looks like, unless these are one-offs,

543
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,860
it looks like you can get.

544
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,700
Oh. Wow.

545
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,820
Why have I not done this?

546
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,660
You can for sure get that.

547
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,220
Oh yeah, that's a toy set.

548
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,060
Yes.

549
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,900
And there's like a Lego-y version.

550
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,100
I'm doing this.

551
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,060
I'm getting, I don't want Congress.

552
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:02,900
Get out of there.

553
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,060
Congress, not the building.

554
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,860
That's a defiled building.

555
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,900
Yeah, yeah.

556
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,940
I don't want anybody ever storming the Capitol Records,

557
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,060
but don't ever storm a Weldon Beckett building, damn it.

558
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,980
Oh, I was gonna say, I also want a set of the,

559
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,180
if it's an orb on a pole, that's,

560
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,060
any of the like observation towers,

561
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,060
Space Needle is kind of one of them.

562
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,300
The, what's the Knoxville, the Sun Sphere,

563
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,700
the Wigsphere from the Sixth Sense.

564
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,900
Oh yeah, okay, not like the orb

565
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,140
that the salty prince and Donald Trump,

566
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,700
everyone was touching the little orb.

567
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,020
No, a bigger orb, yeah.

568
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,460
I'd love to, no, I'd have that orb too.

569
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,300
You'd have the orb.

570
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,140
Kind of any, yeah, any of history's great orbs.

571
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,980
You'd ponder that orb.

572
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,820
I would, yeah, yeah, if we could all,

573
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,220
they should make it available for us to touch.

574
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,060
Sure.

575
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,900
I agree.

576
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,500
We could all take a trip to Saudi Arabia

577
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,340
and touch the orb.

578
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,740
Give us the orb, let us touch the orb.

579
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,940
A fact I always liked about the constructing of this area

580
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,500
is that they built a factory on what is now the,

581
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,260
like, the Port Orleans Resort area.

582
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,820
They built a factory to construct all these rooms.

583
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,660
Okay.

584
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,020
And, yes, Orlando has a very interesting interview

585
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,860
with a historian named Jim Corvus,

586
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,300
and they were trying to debunk the idea

587
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,740
that Disney's plan was when they needed to redo these rooms,

588
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,780
they'd pull them out of the contemporary

589
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,260
and put them back in.

590
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,100
Mm-hmm.

591
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,940
And.

592
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,180
Wait, do we finish saying that that was how,

593
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,060
that they, like, they were all airlifted on a crane.

594
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,900
They're modular.

595
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,020
And slid into the space where,

596
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,380
that a hotel room was carved out for.

597
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,220
Yeah.

598
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,340
So that in theory, if you wanted to update them,

599
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,620
you just do it in reverse.

600
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,660
Or if you had an unruly guest,

601
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,940
you could just pull them out in the middle of the night.

602
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,780
Yoink.

603
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,140
Dump them somewhere,

604
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,340
or, like, airlift them into, like, Disney jail,

605
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,020
which also should have been a modular building like this.

606
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,340
Because you could also see with different lighting,

607
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,340
this looks like some sort of mega jail,

608
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,100
or, like, the Marvel Universe Villains Fortress,

609
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,980
like, the Raft.

610
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,820
Oh, yeah.

611
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,340
Which is where they put the supervillains in.

612
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,220
Yes, yes.

613
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,940
So it's, like, the greatest hotel ever,

614
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,580
and it would also be the greatest prison of all time.

615
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,620
And you could, yeah, if there were, like, you know,

616
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,100
like, upper right corner ain't so bad,

617
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,900
but you really punish people

618
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,180
if you put them down in the basement.

619
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,420
So, yeah, you should, like, pluck people out.

620
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,340
Like, a big War of the Worlds machine.

621
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,180
Right, so, like-

622
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,100
Yeah, you're here now.

623
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,340
So, like, if you're going through it,

624
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,700
it's like, Baron Zemo is in one of the rooms, and then-

625
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,380
And he's talking to the lizard in another room.

626
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,780
The lizard's next door, right, and then,

627
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,180
I don't know, the rest of the bad guys are there, too.

628
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,940
It's important to have friends.

629
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,860
Oh, that's the Joker.

630
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,700
Sorry, that's the Joker in the red.

631
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,540
Joker's in there, too.

632
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,740
It's Joker and Catwoman.

633
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,900
They're all in the contemporary jail.

634
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,540
But, yeah, that was another, like, blue sky, I feel like, idea.

635
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,700
Well, I don't know that they ever,

636
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,700
because the thing is, once they put them in

637
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,100
to the contemporary,

638
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,580
they settled into the structure of the building,

639
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,500
and then they were pointing out in this interview, like,

640
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,900
yeah, they weren't gonna ever take them back out.

641
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,420
They built balconies.

642
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,940
Like, they built things around it.

643
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,540
They built support. It would be very hard to do it.

644
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,780
It'd be impossible.

645
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,780
You know, it's easier just sending

646
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:15,100
a couple of wallpaper installers up with rolls of wallpaper.

647
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,820
I like wallpaper installers.

648
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,100
That was the example they gave.

649
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,700
Like, you know, it's easier just sending, like,

650
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,780
carpet guys up.

651
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,460
Well, that's what I mean, like, a blue sky idea of, like,

652
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,580
oh, yeah, then it'll be cool.

653
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,180
Like, we'll be renovating half of the rooms or whatever

654
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,220
by pulling them out, and then we'll just do it offsite.

655
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,620
But, like, that's, who knows how far along

656
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,380
that actually got?

657
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,780
Because it does seem crazy and practical.

658
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,740
Yeah, to yank entire rooms out,

659
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,820
like you're, like, picking something,

660
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,860
you're grabbing a booger out of your nose.

661
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,580
Yeah, no, it seems insane to do that.

662
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,700
So, yeah, I don't know.

663
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,340
So they didn't do it. It didn't work.

664
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,100
They also, like, this whole, it was intended as this project

665
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,700
with US Steel to prove the efficiency and cost-effectiveness

666
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,620
of US Steel, and it was estimated, US Steel said

667
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,940
each room will cost $17,000, and then each room

668
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,780
only cost $100,000.

669
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,620
Wow, yeah.

670
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:14,620
So that's more than five times in 1971 dollars,

671
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,980
so that's a lot.

672
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,380
So they're still, so the prices now are still paying off,

673
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,220
though, probably.

674
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,060
That's right.

675
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,460
They're still paying off. How much does a hotel cost?

676
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,500
It was awful, like, when all the furniture

677
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,580
was made of asbestos, you know?

678
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,940
Yeah, so I get it now.

679
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,380
You a stealer liar, you can't trust the word of US Steel.

680
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,580
Can't trust US Steel.

681
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,900
US Steel, I think I read something once that Disney

682
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,380
had to take over getting this done,

683
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,420
because US Steel was so far behind,

684
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:45,420
and there was a fact somewhere that by, like, 1970,

685
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,620
they had all the convention space booked for 1972.

686
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,140
So it's like, we can't open late, okay?

687
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,980
There were rooms for the people to stay in.

688
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,620
It's like the version of the Jimmy Fallon sketch

689
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,700
where he says move, and he's the IT guy.

690
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,260
That's what Disney said to US Steel.

691
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,260
They were like, okay, I'm tracking this, hang on.

692
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:10,020
Okay, Disney is Nick Burns, your company's computer guy.

693
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,140
Exactly, so Disney is, yeah, they would say, like, move,

694
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,100
because we have to finish, well, I'll do it.

695
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,540
I'll do it myself, basically, is what the Disney company

696
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,420
would have to say to US Steel.

697
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,300
I don't know, this makes it much clearer to me, at least.

698
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,460
I don't know if the listener likes this.

699
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:27,500
Somebody later, like, so when driving with their husband

700
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,380
or wife who does not listen to the show,

701
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,260
half hour into a long drive, like,

702
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,780
what do I have to talk about?

703
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,460
Oh, you know what I found out is that US Steel is like,

704
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,660
the guy bungling the computer,

705
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,220
and Disney is like Nick Burns.

706
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,300
Nick Burns, Jimmy Fallon character.

707
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,180
Makes sense to me.

708
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,860
Three more hours of silence.

709
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,860
Why did we take this trip?

710
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,700
Let's just turn around.

711
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,540
How many people break up?

712
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,140
How many people, honestly, in the audience,

713
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:55,140
have broken up after trying to explain this dumb podcast

714
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,380
to whoever they were dating or whoever they were married to

715
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,820
and they were like, I can't do it anymore.

716
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,860
I understand, they went to City Walk.

717
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,580
I get it, it's funny, ha ha, 19 episodes, really good.

718
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,420
When you like it.

719
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,260
What a bit.

720
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,740
Maybe I would laugh at the punchline

721
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:12,260
if I understood any of the subjects in the setup.

722
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,460
That might help.

723
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,900
Maybe we should be together then.

724
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,180
That's great.

725
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,580
Thanks for telling me all those facts.

726
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,100
You didn't make eye contact once, you fuck.

727
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,820
So we apologize if that happened,

728
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,660
but honestly, I don't know.

729
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,140
Somebody exactly this.

730
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,940
You may recall, I listened to the show to escape.

731
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,100
Remember the dark days.

732
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,100
Not a mirror held up to me in my life.

733
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,180
Now I'm praying a fucking crane

734
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,620
dumps a modular hotel room ahead.

735
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,900
I wish my room right now was removable by crane.

736
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,100
That's also so funny to think about.

737
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,460
We gotta redo these rooms.

738
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,500
I've called the crane people.

739
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,380
What are you fucking talking about?

740
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,820
Just buy some new couches and put them on a truck.

741
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,140
Or you go down to the lobby and you're like,

742
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,660
oh, my son actually threw up in the closet

743
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,540
and I just wanna, is it possible to get somebody,

744
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,700
oh yeah, hold on one second.

745
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,860
They hit something on the button

746
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,020
and all of a sudden the room is just plucked

747
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,780
out of the hotel to be cleaned.

748
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,660
Yeah.

749
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,500
Wow.

750
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,900
That's great.

751
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,340
That's a fun cartoon idea.

752
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,700
If it was that efficient, yeah.

753
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,660
This is what a god could do.

754
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,500
Yeah.

755
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,980
So I mean, I'd like to see it, but I'm practical.

756
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,220
Not terribly practical. Doesn't make sense.

757
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:34,740
Luckily, across this hotel wide,

758
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,500
they chose aesthetics that would surely last

759
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,060
beyond 1974 or so.

760
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,660
They showed the name contemporary,

761
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,220
which requires you to stay contemporary.

762
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:54,020
And they kind of made the entire hotel look like the,

763
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,980
speaking of Seinfeld sets and constructing them,

764
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,860
the Merv Griffin set that was pulled out of the dumpster

765
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,500
and assembled in Kramer's apartment.

766
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,340
Yeah.

767
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,700
The whole hotel looks like that.

768
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,260
Where like, I obviously love old color schemes

769
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,420
and retro vibes, but boy was this an aggressively

770
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:19,420
just like early 70s, just like steeped really hard.

771
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,500
Like it's not one teabag of 70s aesthetic.

772
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,340
No.

773
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,660
It's a thousand all in one little cup.

774
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,980
Well, interesting and comes back around

775
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,100
in like cycles of design, fashion and taste.

776
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,660
Feels dated, I could only imagine back then,

777
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,660
this feels dated immediately.

778
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,500
Yeah.

779
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:43,140
In the way that mid-century modern is kind of,

780
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,900
I don't know, I will say timeless.

781
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,340
It feels like it's always in fashion.

782
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,820
It's like converse all-stars.

783
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,140
You mean you're talking like more 60s?

784
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,020
Yeah, like more like 60s style.

785
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,900
That never seems to fully go away.

786
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,540
Yeah, that I'm sure that had ebbs and flows

787
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,580
as far as people like recognizing it as cool probably,

788
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:04,420
but nothing like the inside of the contemporary,

789
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,340
like his age.

790
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,740
I can't think of a thing in Disney

791
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,060
that's aged worse maybe than the inside.

792
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,420
I'm trying to think, I mean, obviously stuff

793
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:14,060
has been redone, Disneyland Hotel has been redone,

794
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,780
but it still has its kind of 50s-y

795
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,620
or whatever year it was built in vibe.

796
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,460
Yeah.

797
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,820
But yeah, I can't think of anything.

798
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,140
If I could read a little, there's a big article,

799
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,420
several big articles on a website called Passport to Dreams

800
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,340
if you want to see a lot of contemporary

801
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,060
and read a lot of history of it.

802
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,500
And they really broke it down nicely, the early vibe.

803
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,820
A bizarre amalgamation of 70s pop and Mexican hacienda

804
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,620
where dramatic reds, oranges, yellows, and browns

805
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,780
overflowed from every nook and cranny.

806
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,620
Yeah.

807
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,540
Yeah, that's the vibe.

808
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,860
Interesting, I didn't even think about it like that.

809
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,140
Which is a play that I would love to go walk around.

810
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,220
I'd for sure love, I would love if it existed

811
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,300
and if they'd never changed it,

812
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,820
but just like for regular people.

813
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:05,380
And it does, this Southwest vibe is really fascinating

814
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,940
because you look at this hotel,

815
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:11,380
you look at the outside of it, what makes them think,

816
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:16,020
make it feel like a future Pueblo?

817
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,020
Like, how did they land there?

818
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,340
Well, I actually found the answer for that

819
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,420
because I'm staring at the Mary Blair murals

820
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,580
and like, how did this get here?

821
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,020
Like, what is the thinking?

822
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,740
And there was thinking.

823
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,460
There's an article, there was.

824
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,300
They weren't sure.

825
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,300
They had a justification

826
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,940
and I don't know if I fully agree with it,

827
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,260
but there's an article in Design Observer.

828
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:42,100
And the idea was that Mary Blair's whimsical art style

829
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:47,100
and unique color palettes are very warm and friendly

830
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,140
and inviting and the characters in those murals,

831
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:55,220
which they are in a lot more early day stuff.

832
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,900
The restaurants have them, the do not disturb sign,

833
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,060
the soaps, they're kind of everywhere.

834
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,900
So very cute.

835
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,900
Cute Mary Blair, big eyed.

836
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,860
So that is meant to counterbalance

837
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,820
the kind of intense, brutalist architecture.

838
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,660
Sure, soften it up.

839
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,500
The balance, yeah.

840
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,580
Warm it up, yeah.

841
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,420
Right.

842
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,140
Yeah, I mean, it's interesting.

843
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,620
It's very bold for sure.

844
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,620
It's still good.

845
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,460
Yeah, yeah.

846
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,180
Don't let my negativity make you think I don't like it

847
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,060
because I do like it.

848
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,260
But it's the idea of something that is contemporary.

849
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,140
I mean, the restaurants and some of the amenities

850
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,180
have kept pace with changing taste, I think.

851
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,460
But I did have to laugh because it's like,

852
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,140
we're updating the rooms to the Incredibles.

853
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,340
Our hotel called The Contemporary will now have rooms

854
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:44,260
based on a movie from 2004 with an art style

855
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,100
from decades before that.

856
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,580
And then they redid the downstairs lobby

857
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:55,540
and that is all concept art and design stuff

858
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,100
from the development of The Contemporary.

859
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,780
So that contemporary is the past.

860
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,740
Right, right.

861
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,100
So we've kind of given up on the present and the future,

862
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,420
much like much of our culture.

863
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,860
Like, yeah, you don't want to think about the future

864
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,700
too much.

865
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,540
It's old stuff now.

866
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,360
Yeah, yeah.

867
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,860
Which now, I don't mind that stuff.

868
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,380
I mean, I like anything anytime they turn to it.

869
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,660
No, I think it looks great.

870
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,740
The lobby looks great.

871
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,940
The Steakhouse 71, new in the last few months,

872
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,220
it also looks great.

873
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,060
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

874
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,620
There is a bone to pick and it's not my bone I'm picking.

875
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,180
I guess it's a past guest of the show, Dennis McNicholas,

876
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,380
who talked about Frontierland with us a little while ago.

877
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,340
He loves The Contemporary, loves to stay there,

878
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:44,340
and is a big fan of how they have redone the lobby recently

879
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:48,140
with this kind of nod to their 70s,

880
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,660
the original aesthetic.

881
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:54,660
But if we could pull up a photo called Rock Pillows,

882
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,880
Rock Pillows is the photo,

883
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,100
and this is one detail that Dennis liked a lot

884
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,500
if you're watching the video version.

885
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,500
So yeah, it's very, it's kooky cut out art

886
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,060
in Southwest colors on the wallpaper in the back,

887
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,060
and then big long sectionals.

888
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,800
And then along the couch,

889
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,960
there are these kind of odd, angular-shaped pillows.

890
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,960
They look hard, they look like rocks,

891
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,840
but they are quite soft.

892
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,280
If we show the close-up,

893
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,280
can we show Rock Pillow 2, beautiful, thank you, Margot.

894
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,840
I mean, that's fun, right?

895
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,280
You know, that adds some life to the couches.

896
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,720
We like our fake rocks.

897
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,560
I don't think we knew that they came in pillow form,

898
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,640
so we like this.

899
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,560
However, Dennis was there several weeks ago,

900
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,920
and the general style of the room remains,

901
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,640
but the Rock Pillows are gone.

902
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,480
No!

903
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,000
Why, Disney, why?

904
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,840
What?

905
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,580
You've taken so many nice things from us.

906
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,640
Why must the Rock Pillows, gotta be Chay Peck.

907
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,160
Chay Peck didn't understand it.

908
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,160
Well, my gosh, are there different pillows there,

909
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,120
or the pillows have been removed altogether?

910
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,560
There are no pillows, it's just blank.

911
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,560
Imagine that long couch with not a single pillow

912
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,760
causing distinct marks in between.

913
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,800
I think I have an explanation for that.

914
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,040
I believe these pillows,

915
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,280
I think something was going around when this opened.

916
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,120
Bugs?

917
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,400
I think those were chained to the couch.

918
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,240
Yeah, you pointed that out, yes.

919
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,680
And I think they were getting roasted.

920
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,400
Even Mr. Morrow pointed out that a bunch of new

921
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Vacation Club stuff opened at the Contemporary,

922
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,000
and he went through a lob, and he's like,

923
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,680
oh, the pillows aren't chained down like in the Contemporary.

924
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,600
And I was like, what the fuck does that mean?

925
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,800
And Jane's like, oh, they chained pillows to the couches

926
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,080
so they wouldn't get stolen.

927
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,960
Yeah, I'd steal it, I'd be the first to steal it.

928
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,960
I understand, I'm the perpetrator.

929
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,040
Maybe somebody got past the chained system

930
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,240
and took all the Rock Pillows.

931
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,480
Chay Peck has sort of a Minority Report style console,

932
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,400
like technology console, and he knew you were about

933
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,160
to heist this thing in a couple months or whenever we go.

934
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,120
Probably.

935
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,960
And he was like, you know what,

936
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,920
let's just take them off the table.

937
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,240
So next time I go, I'm gonna be arrested for mind crimes.

938
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,080
That's right.

939
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,200
It's the future Chay Peck.

940
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,240
That's right, yeah, he's gonna arrest you for that.

941
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,640
Chay Peck, did you know this was coming?

942
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,960
A middle finger?

943
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,840
Did you know I was gonna commit this profanity

944
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,680
on a web broadcast?

945
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,520
He did know.

946
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,920
What do you think of that, huh?

947
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,760
He did know you were going to Disney Jail.

948
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,280
Banging on the Contemporary with my finger.

949
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,040
Now I'm just imagining Scott pulling a pre-cock

950
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,400
out of a vat, pulling up.

951
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,800
That was, you dirty rat, who was that?

952
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,120
Was it Bryce Dallas House?

953
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,480
It was someone's first big role.

954
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,320
Was a pre-cock?

955
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,840
Was a pre-cock.

956
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,680
I gotta look this up.

957
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,560
Oh yeah, I forget.

958
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,440
But no, that's gonna happen in Orlando with Scott.

959
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,640
Gonna pull someone out of a tank.

960
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,920
Mind crimes, this is ridiculous.

961
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,160
This world of arrests for things that haven't even been done

962
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,000
and no change.

963
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,820
Well, it's real.

964
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,240
Bring back the rock pillows.

965
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,240
We want our rock pillows.

966
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,240
We do want the rock pillows back.

967
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,160
Couldn't they at least put them

968
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,360
in like a little glass display case?

969
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,360
Okay, she had already been in stuff by this point.

970
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,840
It's Samantha Morton is the quote,

971
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,480
most talented of the three pre-cocks.

972
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,320
Oh okay.

973
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,160
I don't recall them having differences.

974
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,240
I can't remember the movie.

975
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,800
I just know about the main premise.

976
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,760
So there is a best pre-cock.

977
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,600
Agatha.

978
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,440
It's Agatha.

979
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,160
We gotta get Agatha out of here.

980
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,000
Okay, gotcha.

981
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,260
So if you start buying pre-cock action figures,

982
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,520
Agatha's the one.

983
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,640
I don't know if they've done Minority Report.

984
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,800
I would probably get, again,

985
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,120
I don't get a lot of Toys and Things,

986
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,240
and it's not like I've seen that movie a zillion times,

987
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,800
but to have pre-cock action figures would be pretty sweet.

988
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,840
Yeah, that would be cool.

989
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,760
I think they should just do a full cruise collection.

990
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,000
I don't know if he's into those action figures,

991
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,960
but like the eyes wide shut.

992
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,080
They make light of what I do.

993
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,100
This isn't for children.

994
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,080
This isn't for laughs and frivolity.

995
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,920
This is serious.

996
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,320
We're saving the planet one film at a time.

997
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,120
But come on, Tom.

998
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,280
Eyes wide shut figures?

999
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,120
Come on.

1000
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,520
At least one sixth scale, hot toy style.

1001
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,760
Masks to put on, all of them.

1002
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,200
I just watched it for the first time.

1003
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,920
Oh boy.

1004
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,760
It's good.

1005
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,600
It's something else.

1006
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,720
It's a good movie.

1007
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,080
Keeps you up at night.

1008
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,920
It's weird.

1009
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,640
Don't watch that right before you go to bed.

1010
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,480
It is a weird one, but it's great.

1011
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,960
You could have the note, like the note he gets about

1012
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,840
to do an investigation. Oh yeah, cease your inquiries.

1013
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,680
Yeah.

1014
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,120
Cease your investigation.

1015
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,600
Oh yeah.

1016
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,120
So yeah, Southwest Vibe that they have continued

1017
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,960
to stick to a little bit.

1018
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,240
And one thing that has never disappeared

1019
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,880
is that huge Mary Blair mural.

1020
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,840
I don't know what you call it exactly.

1021
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,200
The Grand Canyon Concourse mural.

1022
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,640
It's what I've seen it referred to as.

1023
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,080
If you don't recall, Mary Blair,

1024
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,640
the artist mainly associated with It's a Small World

1025
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,640
and the kooky perennially 60s design of It's a Small World.

1026
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,140
And this is one of the other big places

1027
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,880
where you see Mary Blair in the parks.

1028
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,800
It's one of her last projects I think

1029
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,600
for the Disney company.

1030
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,360
And it's really nice.

1031
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,960
It's all these cute villagers and a goat.

1032
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,160
I didn't know about the goat.

1033
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,680
Yeah, the five legged goat.

1034
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,000
The five legged goat.

1035
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Yeah, he's another kind of nerdy reference, I feel like.

1036
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,240
The real ones know.

1037
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,080
Yeah.

1038
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,880
So tired dynamite goat, wired.

1039
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,080
Yeah, exactly.

1040
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,200
The dynamite goat, everybody knows that.

1041
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,960
I have a lot of them listening to this.

1042
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,200
No, go to the grocery store

1043
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,360
and ask about the dynamite goat.

1044
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,360
They'll know, anybody.

1045
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,840
What's the dynamite goat?

1046
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,960
And they'll go like a big thunder.

1047
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,880
Everyone will say in unison,

1048
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,640
big thunder mountain on the lift hills.

1049
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,200
Turn and face it while you go around the bend

1050
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,240
and the thrill will be a little more intense.

1051
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,040
Did you read the justification?

1052
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,880
I did, yes.

1053
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,760
Yeah, I thought that was really interesting

1054
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,760
that it was a purposeful quote unquote mistake

1055
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,320
and it's meant to represent the idea

1056
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,960
that nothing man makes is perfect.

1057
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,960
The Southwest Native American drives

1058
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,760
that she was studying and being inspired by,

1059
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,560
she was paying homage to that idea.

1060
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,400
Pretty cool.

1061
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,240
Yeah.

1062
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,080
I did not know that.

1063
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,320
She's wrong, they made the exterior

1064
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,040
of the contemporary hotel, which is perfect.

1065
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,440
Yes, so that's the one, yeah, perfect thing.

1066
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,000
I mean, it makes sense

1067
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,320
that that would be inside of a perfect structure.

1068
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,160
Yeah, yes.

1069
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,360
It's perfect to ironing.

1070
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,000
It's very ironic that in a perfect place.

1071
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,360
You know what else I like about,

1072
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,680
here's something to say if we're,

1073
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,840
if just to move, if we're moving fully on

1074
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,680
from the outside of the contemporary.

1075
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,960
We don't have to.

1076
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,800
Yeah, absolutely.

1077
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,400
We can just have this episode be the outside.

1078
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,160
The outside of the contemporary is the name.

1079
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,080
I have thought about that as the way

1080
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,720
to tackle Spaceship Earth, that it is exterior.

1081
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,560
Yeah, yeah, I hear that.

1082
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,720
Like talking about it as an icon.

1083
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,440
And the mural as well.

1084
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,760
Oh, sure, yes, yeah, everything on the outside.

1085
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,320
And then inside is a whole other thing.

1086
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,240
The inside is five more episodes.

1087
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,720
That is a great idea.

1088
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,560
Great, great.

1089
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,560
You guys, I know you guys are proud of me

1090
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,120
when I am pitching the topic, Microdivisions.

1091
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,520
Another relationship just ended

1092
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,280
because somebody realized that they were gonna have

1093
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,800
to listen to that in the car with somebody.

1094
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,440
They're like, well, that's enough.

1095
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,080
I'm getting out before they do that.

1096
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,560
I'm sorry, the Epcot ball is getting

1097
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,360
an inside and outside episode.

1098
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,080
It's not the Epcot ball.

1099
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,640
I know if you're riding shotgun,

1100
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,160
you're supposed to get control of the iPhone.

1101
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,600
I can't abide by that rule anymore.

1102
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,120
There's too much content.

1103
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,480
These maniacs put out too much content.

1104
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,520
I have to keep up.

1105
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,120
I'll get behind it, I'll get spoiled.

1106
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,720
You think I want to, you think I wanna hear all this?

1107
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,040
No, it's a chore at this point.

1108
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,240
Compulsion.

1109
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,880
It's a chore at this point.

1110
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,120
I have a problem.

1111
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,680
They promised that Scott would eat a bowl

1112
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,920
of fruity pebbles and I've been waiting.

1113
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,880
I want him to eat the fruity pebbles.

1114
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,120
When is it gonna happen?

1115
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,760
I'm begging to hear Weiger and Mitch talk about their cum.

1116
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,040
I'm begging for that and it's awful.

1117
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,880
I hate it.

1118
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,360
Well, we have nothing to say after that, Jason.

1119
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,680
You made us, yeah, you threw.

1120
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,520
Too far, my friend.

1121
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,640
We're gonna have to take a five minute break

1122
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,720
while we think about their cum.

1123
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,560
Yeah, sure.

1124
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,400
Too far.

1125
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,760
To talk about something as pleasant as those guys cum,

1126
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,320
again, the outside of the building,

1127
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,160
which you know what's great is any perspective that you get,

1128
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,200
any view that you get where Space Mountain is also in it.

1129
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,840
This almost, if you're in the Magic Kingdom

1130
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,320
or you're in their Tomorrowland,

1131
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,920
it almost feels like this building, the Contemporary,

1132
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,400
is elsewhere in Tomorrowland or on the horizon.

1133
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,520
It almost feels like the back wall facade of Tomorrowland.

1134
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,720
It blends so well.

1135
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,640
Space Mountain looks so beautiful

1136
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,360
and is kind of a good pair,

1137
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,200
a good match with the Contemporary.

1138
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,440
I like to think of them as being married.

1139
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,480
I like to think of them as partners.

1140
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,480
They're a little far away.

1141
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,160
I guess in the right perspective.

1142
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,560
Not from their, they're big buildings.

1143
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,800
They're as far away from each other

1144
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,560
as I am far away from you and you.

1145
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,640
I guess that's a good point.

1146
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,480
I just would, if they were married.

1147
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,320
They're not close enough to kiss.

1148
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,920
I want them kissing is what I'm saying.

1149
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,280
If I picture the two buildings married,

1150
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,920
I think they should be able to reach over

1151
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,800
and give each other a little kiss.

1152
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,440
So maybe they're married but they have separate bedrooms.

1153
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,880
They're one of those couples.

1154
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,600
Yes, like Disney would want in the early 70s.

1155
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,940
There's a little moat, I think,

1156
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,440
that makes sure that's like having a privacy curtain

1157
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,840
like you'd have in a hospital

1158
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,920
or in a married couple bedroom in 1971.

1159
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,760
That's good.

1160
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,580
They've never consummated.

1161
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,980
The two buildings have never consummated their love

1162
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,580
but they are married.

1163
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,420
And now again, it makes perfect sense.

1164
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,300
Now it's a perfect way to describe it.

1165
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:57,620
Unless you want to think of the monorail.

1166
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:02,620
Think of the monorail as Space Mountain's sperm.

1167
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,420
Okay, what about this?

1168
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,260
Entering the contemporary.

1169
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,340
What about this?

1170
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,940
Space Mountain and the contemporary are married

1171
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:13,580
but Space Mountain is unable to have a physical relationship

1172
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,740
for whatever reason.

1173
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:15,740
I don't want to say why

1174
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,700
but Space Mountain cannot be physical.

1175
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,500
So Space Mountain has allowed the contemporary

1176
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,420
to be physical with the monorail.

1177
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,780
Oh, I see.

1178
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:27,060
And Space Mountain gets to watch the contemporary.

1179
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:31,340
You're describing some sort of agoraphobic open marriage.

1180
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,460
Well, well, well, now who are the filth mongers?

1181
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:37,660
I'm being very tasteful in the way I'm describing this.

1182
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,700
In a way, Mike has presented the most.

1183
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:44,460
Well, although, is that dirty or is it clean?

1184
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,300
What I'm describing is very-

1185
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,980
Well, if it keeps everyone happy,

1186
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:51,140
if everyone abides by the boundaries set up.

1187
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:54,380
I think that they're all very on board with the rules

1188
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:57,140
because it's been going for 50 years at this point.

1189
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,460
The relationship's been this way for so many years.

1190
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,660
The scene where they land,

1191
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:04,100
if these are people and not hotels we're talking about,

1192
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:07,460
so it's a scene where a woman is walking through the park

1193
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,700
and then you go wider and see her bow

1194
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,260
and he's in a bubble.

1195
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,980
He's in a big plastic bubble

1196
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,020
and they're having a nice stroll together.

1197
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,260
I'm beginning to think about marriage,

1198
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,820
but you are aware, obviously, of my condition.

1199
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,060
What if I were to propose an arrangement?

1200
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,460
I stay in the bubble and you get railed

1201
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:31,660
by a man of my choosing.

1202
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,580
Well, this is a relationship people have.

1203
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,820
It's the only way it works.

1204
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,900
No judgment, this is a relationship people have.

1205
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,140
If it works for everyone, I think it's fine.

1206
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:42,820
Those early contemporary vacation kingdom marketing materials

1207
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,700
really looks like they're trying to get the money

1208
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,460
of traveling couples who have quote, arrangements.

1209
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,020
You're saying it's appealing to swingers?

1210
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:57,020
I'm saying if you look at the pictures in these brochures,

1211
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,180
and also there's the Magic Kingdom.

1212
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:02,580
The characters and the attractions are so small

1213
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:07,580
compared to parasailing, compared to putt-putt boat.

1214
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,020
I'm still, okay, I'm confused.

1215
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,420
Can you show us a photo?

1216
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,260
That parasailing and putt-putt golf

1217
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,260
are being advertised as a...

1218
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,580
Well, look at this.

1219
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:22,180
These are young couple, these are people on vacation

1220
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,020
at a resort.

1221
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:23,860
Hot singles.

1222
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:26,060
Hot singles in your area.

1223
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:27,940
Hot swingers, hot singles.

1224
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,620
I don't know if they're necessarily courting

1225
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,180
the swinger demographic, but I see what you're saying.

1226
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,540
These might be monogamous couples.

1227
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:36,860
I think you're putting a lot on them to say that...

1228
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:37,700
Let me see the thing again, Jason.

1229
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,540
Yeah, sure.

1230
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,420
Could I hold it in my little hand?

1231
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:42,820
My little hand?

1232
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:46,020
Yeah, you can see there's small shots of each part.

1233
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,300
First of all, there's two pictures of families

1234
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,180
in this picture.

1235
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,340
Oh no, three pictures of families.

1236
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:54,420
Wait, how many children are in what Jason just took?

1237
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,260
But what's the biggest photo?

1238
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,540
There are four children in this picture

1239
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,380
that Jason's talking about.

1240
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,100
In the montage you're describing, there's four children,

1241
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,460
and you're saying that this is an ad

1242
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,100
to come and get a third at a Disney World Hotel.

1243
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,100
This is a later.

1244
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,500
It's starting to fade away.

1245
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,300
The attractions, all the parks are in this one.

1246
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,860
All you're responding to is the fact

1247
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,620
that very prominently there's a man

1248
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:15,460
who is in very good shape with his shirt off

1249
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:18,100
on whatever this parasailing thing with a woman.

1250
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,580
Who he may be completely monogamous with.

1251
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,180
One piece bathing suit also.

1252
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,620
It's not even scandalous by Disney standards,

1253
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:26,820
Waltz standards.

1254
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:29,220
And then the other pictures are of the parks.

1255
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:32,140
So basically it's advertising parasailing

1256
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,980
for hot young couples.

1257
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:34,860
That's what I would say.

1258
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,900
I don't know that there's any sort of swinging subtext.

1259
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,140
Well, it's just there used to be so much emphasis

1260
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:43,140
on the former, what is now California Grill,

1261
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,300
the former Top of the World Lounge,

1262
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,700
where it's like, come, eat a nice meal,

1263
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,700
get hammered, see some singers.

1264
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,780
Put your keys in the bowl.

1265
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,140
Put your keys in the bowl.

1266
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,780
They're open till 2 a.m.

1267
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,260
Nothing at Disney World is open.

1268
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:58,660
I wanna see if you can find the most swinger's energy ad.

1269
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,980
And you don't have to do it now,

1270
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:04,420
but for the future, I wanna see if there is one

1271
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,620
that really gives it off,

1272
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,380
because I don't know that that's the one.

1273
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,460
It has parasailing in it.

1274
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,220
It doesn't parasailing in it. Sexy as sport.

1275
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,660
Jason, are you sort of like,

1276
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:14,700
you have a parasailing fetish?

1277
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,900
I have a parasailing?

1278
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,580
Like, yeah, someone sails up, hello there.

1279
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,540
We saw you across the beach.

1280
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,220
We like your vibe.

1281
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,980
Oh no, the boat's motors are crossing.

1282
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:29,940
Blah, entire arrangement falls apart, fires.

1283
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:34,300
But even just in the text of those early, early,

1284
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,620
Disney World is now open,

1285
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,660
the vacation kingdom of the world,

1286
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:40,260
they're emphasizing the vacation element.

1287
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:44,180
Come take a vacation, not come to the theme park.

1288
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,380
It's almost an afterthought, and especially back then,

1289
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:50,300
the parks closed so early.

1290
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,380
My family was all, we took my grandparents down.

1291
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,540
They're still close to early.

1292
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:56,700
In 91, and like in November of 1991,

1293
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,340
the parks are closing at like 6 p.m.

1294
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,020
Yeah, but they still, I still find that,

1295
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,900
I'm like, why isn't it open later?

1296
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,300
Anytime I'm there, I go, what?

1297
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,580
Well, in the late 90s,

1298
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,660
the Magic Kingdom was open until like midnight.

1299
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:09,500
Like Disney Land is.

1300
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,380
Yeah, I think that's still, maybe that happens in the summer,

1301
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:15,100
but all the parks should be open till midnight all the time.

1302
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:15,940
It's really strange.

1303
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:16,780
Yeah, that's what I want.

1304
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,180
What a hassle it is to book reservations and everything.

1305
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,020
Yeah, because then you go,

1306
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,980
well, if I'm gonna split the day,

1307
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,620
I like staying till midnight.

1308
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,420
That's the fun, so.

1309
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:29,140
I do still take Umbridge with the idea

1310
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:32,020
that advertising that you can have a drink there

1311
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,460
equals everybody come fuck.

1312
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,620
Well, no, they counteracted that

1313
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:40,060
by making the most disgusting cocktails you have ever heard.

1314
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,580
Yeah, yeah, let's talk about the cocktails.

1315
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,140
Can we talk about the gross food?

1316
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,140
This is the gross food section of the show,

1317
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,180
and I have a lot.

1318
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,860
No, everything in this list is horrendous.

1319
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,060
Now, I don't know if,

1320
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:55,020
I don't even remember where mine are pulled from,

1321
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,780
which restaurant, I guess it doesn't matter.

1322
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:02,860
I pulled a lot, the website RetroWDW

1323
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,580
had scans of a cookbook series called

1324
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:06,900
Thought You Would Never Ask

1325
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,740
and Thought You Would Never Ask Part Two,

1326
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:14,340
which collected recipes from restaurants in Central Florida,

1327
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,380
which included Walt Disney World.

1328
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,820
Okay, well, it's all Central Florida old recipes?

1329
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,420
Oh, who collects these things

1330
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,340
and talks about them, these freaks?

1331
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,860
Oh, I don't even wanna meet the person

1332
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,180
who put this on the web.

1333
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,020
Strange.

1334
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:33,980
Anyway, let's talk about it for now.

1335
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,020
Let's talk about everything in them.

1336
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:39,260
Tomato stuffed with fiddle leaf fern.

1337
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,980
Yeah, I don't know, fiddle, what is that?

1338
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,060
Okay, I looked it up.

1339
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:47,060
Fiddle leaf fern is kind of like a spiral shaped fern growth

1340
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,580
that you can use in cooking.

1341
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:53,020
I have never ever seen food with fiddle leaf fern.

1342
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,020
Eating a fern?

1343
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,620
Hey, I might eat a fern.

1344
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,580
It did include, what else is it?

1345
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,180
I'm not a brontosaurus.

1346
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,220
No.

1347
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,460
Onion, two sticks.

1348
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,300
Never will be.

1349
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:08,700
Six tomatoes, two sticks of butter, nutmeg.

1350
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,980
Everything on it back then had nutmeg in it.

1351
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:15,060
Like, a lot of the cocktails involved nutmeg.

1352
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,620
Drinks do too, yes.

1353
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,980
I mean, I like a nutmeg in a drink.

1354
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,260
I'm not against that.

1355
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,580
But wait until you hear some of these combinations.

1356
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,180
All right, go ahead.

1357
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:27,700
I think the grossest one I found was called French 75.

1358
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:31,100
Which is a drink that is not always like this.

1359
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:31,940
Yeah.

1360
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:32,780
This is a specific French 75.

1361
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:33,980
I think I've had a French 75

1362
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:36,180
and these are not the ingredients as far as I know.

1363
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,620
However, how much money we wanna put on Mike

1364
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:39,460
thinking this sounds like French 75.

1365
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,580
Mike will love this.

1366
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:44,460
And this isn't even the one with sherbet in it.

1367
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,580
French 75 from the cookbook.

1368
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:52,860
One and a quarter ounce gin, two ounce sour mix.

1369
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,220
Okay, normal.

1370
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,500
Two and a half ounces champagne.

1371
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,060
Okay, still pretty normal.

1372
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:01,180
Dash of rock candy syrup.

1373
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:02,180
Great.

1374
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:06,140
The suggestion of how to acquire rock candy syrup

1375
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,940
is melt down rock candy with a little water.

1376
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,740
That's so you have to make your own rock candy syrup.

1377
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,820
I've never had rock candy syrup.

1378
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,820
I like an occasional piece of rock candy.

1379
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,740
I don't know how you guys feel about rock candy.

1380
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,380
Can't recall having rock candy.

1381
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,460
I know I have.

1382
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,300
Jason?

1383
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,140
I like it okay.

1384
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,140
Yeah, it's a little bit of a chore.

1385
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:27,980
Yeah.

1386
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:28,820
You've gotta suck on it for a while.

1387
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:29,980
It's a vacation treat.

1388
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,420
I feel like it's a thing that candy shops on vacations.

1389
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,380
They have it in its sugar.

1390
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:36,820
Once in a while, if I was getting bulk,

1391
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,900
I'd have a little piece of it.

1392
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,740
But it's a little bit like,

1393
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,860
yeah, it's just like a little crystal.

1394
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,100
So I guess you would melt it down.

1395
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:43,940
I don't know.

1396
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:44,780
It's a sugar.

1397
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:45,780
I don't know what's the.

1398
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:48,260
I guess it does just end up being a syrup

1399
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,380
at the end of the day.

1400
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:51,020
It's strange to see in a recipe.

1401
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:53,380
Scott, do you have the monorail drinks in front of you?

1402
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:58,020
Yeah, you got four colors of monorail pink.

1403
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,820
Gin, pineapple and orange juice,

1404
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,940
grenadine syrup and heavy cream.

1405
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:02,780
Heavy cream.

1406
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,620
No, fuck.

1407
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,460
No.

1408
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:06,980
Heavy.

1409
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:10,340
Monorail red, tequila, galliano, grenadine,

1410
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:13,020
pineapple juice and lemon bar mix.

1411
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,700
I bet that's good.

1412
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,140
Yeah, well, yes, you.

1413
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:18,820
I bet that, but which part of it is bad?

1414
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,380
Well, for you, the tequila.

1415
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,220
Yeah, no, I know that.

1416
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:24,420
You can get away from that with all this sugar.

1417
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,260
But I mean.

1418
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,700
It'll be like there's none.

1419
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,140
Which part of it do you guys not like about that drink?

1420
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:30,340
Look, I don't want any of the.

1421
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:34,180
I don't want the sour mix in the French 75, much less.

1422
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:35,740
So you don't like a whiskey sour?

1423
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:36,580
Not so much.

1424
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,020
I try to get as little of, and margaritas,

1425
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:42,900
if we can get down to it's like a, it's juice.

1426
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,060
It's a splash.

1427
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:44,900
Yeah.

1428
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:45,740
Not sour mix.

1429
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,060
Okay, cause sour, yeah, okay.

1430
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,260
But I'll have a whiskey sour.

1431
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:51,700
I don't like it too sour.

1432
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,660
But I guess that depends on the strength of the mix.

1433
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,340
Lemon bar mix is fascinating.

1434
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,340
Is that like a powder?

1435
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,180
I don't know.

1436
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,020
I can't picture how that comes.

1437
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:01,340
And grenadine is God's nectar.

1438
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,540
I love it.

1439
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,700
Grenadine is the greatest.

1440
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,580
Grenadine is like the Shirley Temple.

1441
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:06,420
Yeah.

1442
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:07,780
Yeah, the greatest drink.

1443
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:09,660
The greatest drink known to man.

1444
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,500
I'm sorry.

1445
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,340
Are you still a Shirley Temple drinker?

1446
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,620
God's juice, God's juice I call it.

1447
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:14,540
I double checked.

1448
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:17,180
Galeano is a sweet liqueur.

1449
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:18,620
So this is like the sweetest.

1450
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:19,460
That's the issue.

1451
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:20,300
I think pick one of the.

1452
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,580
I would never have a drink with more than one of these.

1453
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,220
A sweet liqueur added to all of that

1454
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,100
I think does seem like it's a little crazy.

1455
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,180
Cause grenadine goes a long way in the drink.

1456
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:30,020
But grenadine is so.

1457
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,900
Lemon bar mix goes the longest way.

1458
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:32,740
Yeah, maybe.

1459
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,660
Monterey yellow has coconut cream.

1460
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:35,700
That's the weird one in there.

1461
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:36,780
And then Monterey purple.

1462
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:37,620
Yeah.

1463
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:39,820
I like to eat wine and grape juice.

1464
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:40,940
What are we doing here?

1465
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,060
For Andy and wine.

1466
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:42,900
Wine and grape juice?

1467
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,740
Wine is unspecified.

1468
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:45,580
Don't worry about it, wine.

1469
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,860
Cause wine is made from grapes.

1470
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,100
Why do we need more grapes?

1471
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:48,940
And just grape.

1472
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,540
I don't, I'm not drinking grape juice for any reason.

1473
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,060
I like grape juice, Jason.

1474
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,180
Yes, I do like grape juice.

1475
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,980
I like the grape juice that's called wine.

1476
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,620
Okay, I like wine too.

1477
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:01,980
It seems like a lot of grapes.

1478
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,180
I have some non-alcoholic drinks.

1479
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,180
Did you pull these?

1480
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,220
Maybe not, what do we got?

1481
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,300
Okay, let's see.

1482
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:11,580
Bay Lake Thirst Quencher, a refreshing intermission

1483
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:15,020
featuring lime sherbet garnished with pineapple,

1484
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:19,020
fresh mint leaves, and topped with delicious lemonade.

1485
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,620
Just think there's a lot going on there.

1486
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:23,260
Yes.

1487
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:26,220
But not as much as an orange sunshine.

1488
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,460
A delightful combination of freshly squeezed

1489
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:31,820
Florida orange juice, blended with an egg yolk,

1490
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:34,620
sweetened with a spoonful of orange blossom honey,

1491
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:36,420
seasoned with a hint of lime,

1492
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,620
and a touch of grated nutmeg.

1493
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:39,820
These folks. I bet that's good.

1494
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:40,660
I bet that's good.

1495
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:42,260
They love nutmeg.

1496
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:43,580
I bet that drink's good though.

1497
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,020
And zero alcohol content.

1498
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,340
Zero alcohol so you don't get that stupid buzz

1499
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,180
that we don't want.

1500
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,020
You get all the sugar and none of the buzz.

1501
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:52,740
You just wanna feel a little bit of sugar,

1502
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:55,180
little bits and blaps in our brain.

1503
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:56,660
Yeah, you just wanna have fun.

1504
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:58,340
Do you think that one sounds bad?

1505
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:01,140
I don't, I just think there's just too much going on.

1506
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,780
I mean, egg yolk. Egg yolk?

1507
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:06,100
Egg whites, if you froth, it becomes meringue.

1508
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,540
Egg yolk, I don't know, it might be interesting.

1509
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:12,180
Cause egg yolk isn't like it's sugar thing.

1510
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,020
It isn't.

1511
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,780
So it's four different forms of sugar

1512
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,500
and then egg yolk.

1513
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,900
And no alcohol.

1514
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:19,940
I bet it's interesting.

1515
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:20,780
I'll make that one.

1516
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:21,620
Can I make that one?

1517
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,460
You should make it.

1518
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,260
Yeah, I'll drink it if you make it.

1519
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,020
It's probably as an episode.

1520
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,540
And now a guy's in the car and he's been like,

1521
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:28,660
oh, I gotta keep listening

1522
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:31,180
so they can make that dumb drink.

1523
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,100
Now I'm into, that's the significant other.

1524
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:33,940
They come back.

1525
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:34,780
Fine, okay.

1526
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:39,780
I do wanna hear this guy in his 30s drink egg yolk.

1527
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,740
I also, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt

1528
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:45,660
that that is like real honey, like fresh honey.

1529
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:49,860
I hate artificial honey or like honey in packets.

1530
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:50,980
I just don't like it.

1531
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:55,660
The lowest I will go will be the bear shaped bottle.

1532
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:58,260
Oh, so you don't think that's high quality?

1533
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,780
I will descend to the bear.

1534
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,300
Well, it can be either.

1535
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:06,100
I've seen like raw from the farm honey in those bottles,

1536
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,620
but I've also seen just like the Kroger crap brand.

1537
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:10,260
So there's multiple bears.

1538
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,780
There's different bear bottles

1539
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,500
for different qualities of honey.

1540
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,460
Yeah, the bear bottle will trick me.

1541
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:20,020
I'm saying like the nasty little lemon honey tea

1542
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,260
and the tea bag already has honey flavoring in it.

1543
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:23,900
That's gross to me.

1544
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:26,180
Can we look into how many different bear bottles

1545
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,860
there are for honey and severe?

1546
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:28,900
Well, I'll take any of them.

1547
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:29,740
I'll take any of them.

1548
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,540
I know that, but I'm saying for our purposes,

1549
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,020
figure out mascot wise,

1550
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,220
figure out what the different bottles are,

1551
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,060
the plastic or the glass.

1552
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:36,900
Oh, the skew numbers.

1553
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:37,740
Yeah.

1554
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:40,940
Yeah, and figure out like what's the high quality bear

1555
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:42,140
and what's the brand and.

1556
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:42,980
Sure.

1557
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:43,820
Yeah.

1558
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:44,660
I think we can do that.

1559
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:45,500
All right.

1560
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,820
Which one of their little honey spigot hats is the cutest?

1561
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:49,660
That's right.

1562
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:50,820
Yeah, there's a lot here.

1563
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:51,660
There's multiple episodes here.

1564
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:53,900
A Burbank farmers market usually has a honey booth.

1565
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,460
That's where I've bought honey in the past.

1566
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:56,700
You've been to the honey booth.

1567
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:58,540
Honey booth.

1568
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,380
I mean, I could, we could dig into what the honey booth is.

1569
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:02,900
I know that, okay, that is a funny phrase,

1570
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,900
but that's kind of a standard farmers market stall.

1571
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:06,740
I don't think that's that.

1572
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:07,580
I have no doubt it is.

1573
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:09,940
Does it consist of you dipping your entire.

1574
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:10,780
I just want us.

1575
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:11,780
Into open pots.

1576
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:15,460
Look, did I have a long conversation with the guy of like,

1577
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,020
well, what do you think the differences

1578
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:19,500
between the poppy honey and the buckwheat honey?

1579
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,580
He's like, well, the buckwheat honey

1580
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,820
is gonna have more of an interesting flavor, I think.

1581
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:24,860
I was like, oh, okay, well,

1582
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:26,420
I'll try the buckwheat honey, I guess.

1583
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,500
Like it's, language is so important, folks.

1584
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,900
Cause like, if you think about this, it's like,

1585
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:34,860
if you just said I bought honey at the farmers market,

1586
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:36,700
we move on, we go back to the hotel.

1587
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,220
But Jason says, I went to the honey booth

1588
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,380
at the farmers market and I could talk about it

1589
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:43,180
for 10 more minutes, but I mean, we won't.

1590
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:45,260
I'm just saying the language is so important.

1591
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,620
He said full fat Sprite

1592
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:47,700
and I've brought it up in every episode.

1593
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:48,540
Every episode.

1594
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:50,780
You five-timered it like immediately.

1595
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:51,620
I'm knowingly five-timered it.

1596
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:52,980
And that one, of course, Sprite,

1597
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:55,380
they for years advertised as fat free.

1598
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:56,380
I fucked that one up.

1599
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:58,540
Full sugar Sprite, full calories Sprite.

1600
00:58:58,540 --> 00:58:59,380
I don't know about it.

1601
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:00,220
Too late, it's full fat Sprite.

1602
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:02,060
Why are you, don't know, we love full fat Sprite.

1603
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:03,180
You know, it's short and sweet.

1604
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:04,380
You get what I'm saying.

1605
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,940
It's not diet, you know?

1606
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:06,780
Not diet, yeah.

1607
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:11,460
So anyway, honey booth, honey bears coming soon.

1608
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,740
Honey bears episode.

1609
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:16,260
There's some other, I was looking at just food

1610
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:19,460
that you could get in 70s contemporary.

1611
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,020
I mean, they're all pretty bad,

1612
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:22,180
but let me just cut to the chase

1613
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:24,260
and bring up ham and rice salad.

1614
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:29,100
These are three characters from different universes.

1615
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,340
They don't belong in the same multiverse.

1616
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:34,620
Ham, rice, and salad, it's not a fun mix.

1617
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,500
Ham salad, though, is something

1618
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,340
that has been around for a long time.

1619
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,180
Ham can be in salads, or it's in combo.

1620
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:40,300
I don't like it.

1621
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,420
No, I don't.

1622
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:42,260
Not a big fan of it.

1623
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:43,100
I'm not a big ham guy in general.

1624
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,140
Wait, are you talking about like a chef salad,

1625
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:47,620
or are you talking about chopped up ham with mayonnaise,

1626
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:49,860
AKA ham salad?

1627
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:52,380
Oh, ham salads like chicken salad?

1628
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:55,300
Ham salad, tuna salad, chicken salad.

1629
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,420
They're all in the same family.

1630
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,260
I've never had ham salad.

1631
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,100
No, oh god.

1632
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:02,540
That, yours, what was yours, the full title again?

1633
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:05,340
Oh, the full title was ham and rice salad.

1634
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,860
That could really go in any possible direction.

1635
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:10,540
Could, I don't know if there's any results.

1636
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:15,420
There's things on here that, like, duck tambu.

1637
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,180
That sparked my interest.

1638
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,140
Well, what's duck tambu?

1639
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:20,260
There are almost no results for duck tambu.

1640
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,100
Duck tambu.

1641
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:24,660
Nobody bothered to save the recipes for any of this.

1642
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:25,500
No.

1643
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,940
Let this die in the 70s.

1644
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:28,500
Let the past die, kill it.

1645
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,780
What's the last Jedi line?

1646
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:30,620
Kill it.

1647
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:31,900
Yeah.

1648
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,100
They burned all the books.

1649
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:38,580
Yoda burned all the ancient contemporary cookbooks.

1650
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:41,580
Great ham and rice salad, it was not.

1651
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:43,540
Now no one will ask.

1652
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:46,660
You'd never ask, now no one will ask.

1653
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:47,660
And no one missed them.

1654
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:49,980
Also spaghetti salad.

1655
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:51,660
What do you mean?

1656
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:54,660
There is a very funny, there is one menu for the contemporary,

1657
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:57,740
I believe that listed as Italian spaghetti.

1658
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:02,380
I was just like, oh, maybe there is something to that idea

1659
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:05,660
that food didn't taste good until the 1980s in America.

1660
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:09,540
Or it's just so much salt and lard.

1661
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,540
That was the stuff that tasted good, you know?

1662
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:15,420
Which by the way, so the restaurant up here in the video,

1663
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:19,340
here I'll pop off the little, up here in the floating,

1664
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:22,860
the top portion and I'll lock it back in, bang.

1665
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:25,580
At the top of the contemporary of course

1666
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:29,500
is the California Grill, which opened in the 90s

1667
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:32,180
and remains a really fantastic restaurant

1668
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:34,060
and a great place to have some drinks.

1669
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:38,380
And that feels like a, that is staying contemporary.

1670
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:41,900
That is like, people are eating avocado now.

1671
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,460
There's this thing, sushi.

1672
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:45,140
Flat bread pizza.

1673
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:46,140
Flat bread.

1674
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,060
Yes.

1675
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:50,220
But I think of bread as being a big puffy loaf.

1676
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:51,060
What do you mean?

1677
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:51,900
It's thin.

1678
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,820
Someone who, whatever culinary mind at Disneyland

1679
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:59,820
discovered flat breads and just distributed them wide,

1680
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,820
bought a massive, like they got a huge bonus.

1681
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:06,260
Like you're saving us so much fucking money on bread costs.

1682
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:07,780
It seems fancy to them.

1683
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:08,620
They bought it.

1684
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:10,860
These fucking suckers, these fucking rubes.

1685
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:14,340
I do love the, I will pay, I don't even look at the price.

1686
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:16,460
If it's a flat bread and it's at Disneyland

1687
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:21,460
and it's next to wine, I'm like, oh shit, that was $84.

1688
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,820
It wasn't good.

1689
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:24,940
I've probably been suckered.

1690
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,820
I'm a sucker for deep dish of course,

1691
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:28,700
because I'm from the Chicago area.

1692
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:33,700
But flat bread is so manageable pizza-wise.

1693
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:35,060
So if you're not, you don't want to spill.

1694
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:36,460
Appetizer, it doesn't have to be your main.

1695
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:37,780
Yeah, it doesn't have to be your main.

1696
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:38,900
It could be your side.

1697
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,220
So it could be anything.

1698
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:44,260
And it is a, depending on what you're doing,

1699
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,740
it's very desirable.

1700
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,540
I feel flat bread.

1701
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:50,940
I think, I am a sucker if the flat bread has like

1702
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:55,940
Goat Cheese or Manchego and or Figs, I'm like, well,

1703
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:59,580
I am pulling out my monocle and my ascot for this

1704
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,020
and we must have it.

1705
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:03,500
Some honey, some balsamic, something going on.

1706
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,780
Yeah, absolutely.

1707
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:08,660
I'll do a once a year anchovy, honestly.

1708
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:09,700
On a flat bread?

1709
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:10,540
Sure.

1710
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:11,860
They do at Disney?

1711
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:12,780
I don't know they do that at Disney,

1712
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:16,700
but I'm just saying, like I'll go crazy on a flat bread.

1713
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:17,540
That's what I'm saying.

1714
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:18,860
Sure, anything goes.

1715
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:21,300
Yeah, you can put honey on it and I don't care.

1716
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,140
It could be the cheap shit.

1717
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:24,340
It could be the good stuff that Jason got at the honey bar.

1718
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:25,780
You're the most bulbous bear.

1719
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:32,580
But so that's the top of the contemporary now,

1720
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:35,060
which is great.

1721
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:38,140
I got a last minute time there when we were all down

1722
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:40,180
together a couple years ago.

1723
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:42,660
Oh my God, like top of the world.

1724
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:44,740
The former name of the establishment.

1725
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:47,460
If you're watching fireworks up there

1726
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,660
and they're piping in the music

1727
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,860
and you got yourself a great drink

1728
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:53,980
and you got yourself a great gal,

1729
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:56,340
which I had and a baby on the way.

1730
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:59,220
I was really just like, wow, life is,

1731
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:04,220
I was like, absolutely effervescent up at the time.

1732
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:07,460
I am anytime.

1733
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:08,300
Was that the telephone girl?

1734
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:09,140
You were having a great time.

1735
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:10,460
She got to drink shit.

1736
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:11,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1737
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:12,380
She's drinking club soda.

1738
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:15,340
Why is she less.

1739
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:16,180
Another lemonade.

1740
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:17,460
Solitary than me.

1741
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:18,900
I feel like that was a day we had,

1742
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:21,740
we went to that lounge that just opened at Grand Floridian

1743
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:22,900
and then I think, was it the same day

1744
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,460
or am I mixing up my days?

1745
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,500
I don't think it was.

1746
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,380
We may have done it that same day.

1747
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:30,420
So we got to go to that Grand Floridian lounge

1748
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:33,860
on the balcony and then went to top of the world

1749
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:35,220
later that night.

1750
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:36,060
That's a day, right?

1751
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:37,780
They're just touring the.

1752
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:38,620
That's all you need to do.

1753
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:39,440
You don't even.

1754
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,280
Trader Sam's there.

1755
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,300
Yeah, Monorail Bar Crawl.

1756
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,060
If you're like Disney World's too expensive,

1757
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:47,100
it is too expensive, but you can go to the hotels.

1758
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:47,940
And not stay there.

1759
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:48,780
Not stay there.

1760
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:49,620
You can leave.

1761
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:50,440
And you can get the magic.

1762
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,280
You can get a little piece of magic.

1763
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:52,660
You can get so much magic.

1764
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:54,020
We felt all the magic.

1765
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:56,780
And this building glistening in the night as you leave,

1766
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:57,620
wonderful.

1767
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:59,780
I felt the magic back in my hotel room

1768
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:02,900
where I was napping while you all were doing that.

1769
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:06,060
And then I got up and got dressed and went,

1770
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:08,740
think I'm gonna eat chicken guy a second time.

1771
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:13,980
That's Jason's own calendar when we're on vacation.

1772
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:14,820
I'm a wild man, folks.

1773
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:17,260
Jason does his own thing when you're on vacation with him.

1774
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:18,260
I just want to make that clear.

1775
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:20,060
If you ever go on vacation with Jason,

1776
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:23,860
do not expect him to be with you 70% of the time.

1777
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:24,820
Wait, no.

1778
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,140
We did a lot of stuff together.

1779
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:26,980
We have done a lot of stuff together.

1780
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:28,580
We all broke off a lot.

1781
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:31,140
Yeah, but I think that you are more than most people

1782
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:33,660
just end up doing your own, you're on your own thing.

1783
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,220
Depending on what the vacation is.

1784
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:36,300
Sometimes, yeah, yeah.

1785
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:39,140
Comic Con, I think we're a little bit more together.

1786
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:39,980
Yeah.

1787
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:41,380
There's lines to stand in.

1788
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:42,980
There was lines to stand in, which we like doing.

1789
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:43,980
Well, yeah, that's true.

1790
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,580
And Comic Con, if you try to say,

1791
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:46,900
I'll meet up with you later,

1792
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:49,260
that's like the biggest pain in the ass.

1793
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:50,100
It's impossible.

1794
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:52,300
I never saw them again for the rest of my life.

1795
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,140
But if I tell Jason, oh, we're going to the wire,

1796
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:56,060
we have a passes to the wire lounge

1797
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:59,500
where you get free little tacos and a free,

1798
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,380
what's the T-shirt?

1799
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:03,700
Oh, wait, I have multiple freebie Mr. Mercedes T-shirts.

1800
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:05,860
Mr. Mercedes T-shirts.

1801
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,540
Jason got it at the wire lounge multiple times,

1802
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:11,340
which is a, there's all these parties at Comic Con

1803
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:14,220
and some are easier to get into than others.

1804
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,900
And this one is like sort of hard to get into,

1805
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:19,540
but not that hard because it's got free stuff in it.

1806
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:20,900
And a couple of years in a row, we went there

1807
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:25,820
and Jason each year got a free Mr. Mercedes T-shirt,

1808
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:26,660
a show I've never seen.

1809
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:27,820
What the hell is Mr. Mercedes?

1810
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:30,380
Okay, Mr. Mercedes was a Stephen King novel

1811
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:31,940
that was turned into a TV show.

1812
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:34,260
I believed for the short-lived,

1813
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:38,660
either AT&T or DirecTV Channel, and now it lives elsewhere.

1814
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:39,500
I think it lives on Peacock or something.

1815
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:42,540
Whatever confusingly named channel has Louder Milk,

1816
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,380
which is also confusingly named.

1817
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:45,220
Right.

1818
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:46,260
And they don't explain it.

1819
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:50,980
Their posters were just like, AT&T Network,

1820
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:52,220
what's that, never heard of it,

1821
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:54,300
Mr. Mercedes and Louder Milk.

1822
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:56,500
Then it's a picture of a guy and a picture of another guy.

1823
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:57,660
Why aren't you watching it?

1824
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:59,300
They told you everything you needed to know.

1825
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,780
Right, and then there's a picture of Jason with the shirt on,

1826
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:03,500
wearing it to bed, I assume.

1827
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:04,380
Yes.

1828
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:05,340
But yeah, no, we would do that.

1829
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:07,500
But yeah, I feel like on theme park vacations,

1830
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:08,700
we do a lot of stuff, but then yeah,

1831
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:11,620
you're on your own timetable often.

1832
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:12,460
Napping, napping.

1833
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:14,940
Well, we all would have gathered, I think,

1834
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:18,540
previous time to check out some great entertainment

1835
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:20,180
up at the top of the,

1836
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:22,940
we all would have made a point of getting the table,

1837
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:25,700
getting some big plates of ham and rice salad,

1838
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:29,660
some rock candy and gin drinks, and enjoying,

1839
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:33,540
this is a quote from Imagineerding.com

1840
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:37,020
about the former top of the world bar.

1841
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:40,780
Where else could you enjoy roast duck with orange sauce,

1842
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:43,660
veal Romanoff and rose petal salad,

1843
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:46,180
while being entertained by the likes of Carol Lawrence,

1844
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:48,300
Jack Jones, and Phyllis Diller?

1845
01:07:49,180 --> 01:07:51,980
Amen, I cannot answer that question.

1846
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:55,860
I don't know where else you could eat literal rose petals

1847
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:58,500
and watch Jack Jones, who I Googled

1848
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:01,900
and is the singer of the love boat theme, apparently.

1849
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:04,620
Which seems like that would have been a guy on your radar.

1850
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:06,700
It does, yeah, yeah.

1851
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:08,340
Yeah, why am I passionate about,

1852
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:09,700
oh, now I'm not gonna produce the name,

1853
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:14,220
the Believe It or Not Joey Scarberry, I wanna say.

1854
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:17,260
Believe it or not, I'm walking on air.

1855
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,780
I'll get into Jack Jones, but yeah,

1856
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:24,620
lots of, you know, you can see Sherry Lewis and Lamb Chop.

1857
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:25,820
I mean, God bless her.

1858
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:26,660
Oh, man.

1859
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:27,480
I would have loved to have seen.

1860
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,600
Nothing but adults, because it's a bar.

1861
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,160
So adults at a bar drink rock candy and watch Lamb Chop.

1862
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:34,880
That's the ad stuff Jason's talking about.

1863
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,880
You're getting adults there.

1864
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,920
And was Sherry Lewis just doing

1865
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,080
her Lamb Chop show for adults?

1866
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:44,160
I don't know if it was a blue Lamb Chop.

1867
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:48,520
I don't know if it was a profanity laden Lamb Chop ad.

1868
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,640
Have I talked about seeing Sherry Lewis in person?

1869
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:51,680
I don't think so.

1870
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:54,360
Well, she opened, the first Target in our area

1871
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,920
that opened in the mid-90s.

1872
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,760
Sherry Lewis and Lamb Chop were at the opening,

1873
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:03,760
and we made a point to go see Sherry on Barrington Road.

1874
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,720
Miss Chop.

1875
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:09,040
Miss Chop, we were big Lamb Chop fans in the house,

1876
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,560
and we saw her, and really all we did

1877
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,640
was stand in the parking lot and saw her

1878
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,400
maybe cut her ribbon, I don't know.

1879
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,720
She didn't really do a ton.

1880
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,440
It wasn't amplified?

1881
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:21,120
My memory is that it was not.

1882
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,240
Which is like, oh yeah, I can see the little

1883
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,660
red hair lady.

1884
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:28,360
So yeah, we were big Lamb Chop.

1885
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,200
My parents are moving, and I was just sent a photo

1886
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,760
of the three Lamb Chop puppets that we had as kids.

1887
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:36,840
My mom wanted to throw them away and said they're dirty,

1888
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,640
and I said, no way.

1889
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,880
You are not throwing these away.

1890
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,680
You put those dirty puppets in the trunk

1891
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:43,520
and you drive them out of here.

1892
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,680
That's right, so I said, I want those dirty puppets.

1893
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:48,280
Bring me my dirty chops.

1894
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:50,720
Dirty chops, and they're on the way,

1895
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:54,000
so I will get the Lamb Chop puppets to add to my collection.

1896
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,160
So then we all have one and we can all do

1897
01:09:56,160 --> 01:10:01,160
a funny, a bawdy Lamb Chop nightclub act.

1898
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,400
That's right.

1899
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,240
Jason, who do you call?

1900
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:05,080
What's that?

1901
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,040
I thought they were all Lamb Chop.

1902
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:09,400
No, no, it's Lamb Chop, Hush Puppy, and Charlie Horse

1903
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:12,000
are the three main Lamb Chop characters.

1904
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,800
I thought it was three Lamb Chops, okay.

1905
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,960
No, no, no, no, three, yes, the three characters.

1906
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:16,800
The big three.

1907
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,260
I guess Hush Puppy.

1908
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:19,100
The triumph.

1909
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,520
Hush Puppy or Charlie Horse.

1910
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,080
The holy trinity of Louis verse.

1911
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:27,600
Yeah, the names I kept coming across, Mel Torme,

1912
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,640
I saw mentioned as like doing 10 days or eight days there.

1913
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:32,760
The other.

1914
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,400
Sold out for 10 days.

1915
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,240
10 nights.

1916
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:36,080
Torme.

1917
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,760
Okay, the other name I saw,

1918
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,480
I saw people saying Phyllis Diller,

1919
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:43,480
but then I saw like a, you know, events guide

1920
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:46,280
of what was going on at the Contemporary at the time,

1921
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:48,280
and they mentioned Phyllis McGuire,

1922
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,960
and I was like, who is Phyllis McGuire?

1923
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,220
Phyllis McGuire was part of a three sister group

1924
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:55,840
called the McGuire Sisters.

1925
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,560
She only died in 2020.

1926
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:00,520
She was the longest living McGuire Sister,

1927
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,640
and I pulled up some of her music on Spotify,

1928
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:06,640
and I just wanna, Margot, can you play

1929
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,960
that McGuire Sisters song,

1930
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:11,280
because it's shocking revelation

1931
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,320
about where we know this song from.

1932
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,160
Interesting.

1933
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:20,640
A couple of pretty gals.

1934
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,240
Pizza at suppertime.

1935
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,880
When pizza's on a bagel,

1936
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,320
you can have pizza anytime.

1937
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:45,480
All right, you can cut it, Mark.

1938
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:46,320
Thank you.

1939
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,160
Wow, what a revelation.

1940
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,040
What a revelation.

1941
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,120
I had no idea the Bagel Bites song

1942
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:55,160
was based on an ancient, old-timey hit.

1943
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:57,360
Wow, did they pay royalties?

1944
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,720
I'm assuming they had to pay the McGuire Sisters.

1945
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,560
It's a parody song, essentially.

1946
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,120
It is a parody song, so maybe they didn't.

1947
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,560
Oh yeah, maybe parody law.

1948
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,240
You could hear, you could go to the Contemporary Hotel

1949
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,960
and hear an un-pizza bagelified version

1950
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,640
of the pizza bagel song.

1951
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:18,600
Oh man, you could hear Phyllis McGuire sing that song

1952
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,400
in a haze of cigarette smoke.

1953
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,560
Wow, that's interesting.

1954
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,800
So obviously they were not performing that

1955
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,520
after the pizza, they probably stopped performing

1956
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,840
many years ago, I assume.

1957
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,240
I don't know.

1958
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,080
They weren't like 80 years old doing that?

1959
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,080
I don't know if they were all alive

1960
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,400
when the pizza bagel started.

1961
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,320
They didn't get to enjoy pizza bagel mania.

1962
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,240
Yeah, they didn't get to go on tour to do the song,

1963
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:44,680
is what I'm saying.

1964
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:46,120
They should have been able to go into the...

1965
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:48,320
Contacting the McGuire estate.

1966
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,360
Hey, did any of these wonderful singers

1967
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,880
get a chance to sample a pizza bagel?

1968
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,880
When they walked God's green earth,

1969
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:58,160
when they were all still around,

1970
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:01,440
did they get God's bounty, that being a pizza bagel?

1971
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,200
Also, when they were writing the jingle,

1972
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,520
they were like, I can't crack this.

1973
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,520
There's no way we can write an original song

1974
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,560
about eating pizza on a bagel.

1975
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,960
We must take an old song and rewrite it.

1976
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,200
Like, I guess it's...

1977
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,600
Maybe it was just there was a deadline

1978
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,560
and it was like Elton John's candle in the wind

1979
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:20,280
and he was like, let's just rewrite an old one.

1980
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,520
And they're like, let's rewrite the old honey

1981
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,400
on whatever the hell they were saying.

1982
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,400
This could also be a thing where older people would go like,

1983
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:30,040
yeah, you fucking idiot, it's that Sugar song.

1984
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,040
Oh yeah, sure.

1985
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,880
It was a classic, yeah.

1986
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,960
Well, if you're old in the audience

1987
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:37,280
and you know the Sugar song

1988
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,680
and that's something that was obvious to you, let us know.

1989
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,640
Yeah, also, Margo, could you bring up

1990
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,760
that picture label, Jimmy Rogers?

1991
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,920
I couldn't find anything on Jimmy Rogers

1992
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,960
besides this one old photo.

1993
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:52,360
And this kind of sums up early contemporary,

1994
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:54,400
like the early five. What a wonderful photo that is.

1995
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,960
Thickest mustache I've ever seen.

1996
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:00,000
The thickest hair.

1997
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,720
Both hair and mustache are three inches deep.

1998
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,800
Thickest eyebrows.

1999
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,560
That logo on the back wall though

2000
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,240
is my favorite thing I've ever seen.

2001
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:14,240
It's a bunch of cascading octagons.

2002
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,960
I haven't counted the sides.

2003
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,760
From red to yellow.

2004
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,160
It goes through all the colors

2005
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,280
that were available in the early 70s.

2006
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:26,280
From dark red to lighter red to orange to yellowish orange.

2007
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,360
And then there's just a big circle

2008
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,360
that looks like a weird Petri dish

2009
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,120
made out of carpeting or something.

2010
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,920
Like a little like.

2011
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:33,840
Those are all microbes in there.

2012
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,680
Microbes or I guess sperm, I'm sorry, apologize.

2013
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:40,240
But yeah, it's so weird the whole image

2014
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:42,240
but it's such a great, I don't know.

2015
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:44,400
It looks like carpeting on the wall.

2016
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,360
It's a vibe.

2017
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,200
That's a vibe in there for sure.

2018
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:50,000
And world class entertainment.

2019
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:56,440
And you know, Connie Stevens, Vic de Mone.

2020
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:00,000
Those are names that I may have heard before.

2021
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,840
I couldn't tell you for sure.

2022
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,440
Everybody just, all entertainers around that time.

2023
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:08,040
It was just kind of trust.

2024
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:08,880
That is a name.

2025
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:09,720
That's somebody, right?

2026
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:10,560
Yeah, no it is.

2027
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:11,800
No, for no I ever.

2028
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:12,800
Oh come on, Vic de Mone.

2029
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:13,880
He did, whatever.

2030
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:14,720
I'm not gonna look it up.

2031
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:15,560
It's Vic de Mone.

2032
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:17,160
Vic de Mone sounds like a person that does.

2033
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,160
You know Vic de Mone.

2034
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,960
If there's somebody named Vic de Mone,

2035
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,560
they're a singer and they're a good singer.

2036
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:22,400
Of course.

2037
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,220
That's all there is to it.

2038
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:24,060
And they're in the Contemporary.

2039
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:26,240
First 10 sold out shows.

2040
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:27,640
Yeah, this is stuff we've talked about.

2041
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,280
Like we're Disneyland and Disney World.

2042
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,400
Like it was, I don't know that Vic de Mone

2043
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,880
was like the hippest thing in that year.

2044
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,760
Like he might have been hipper things going on

2045
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,040
in the 70s music wise.

2046
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,400
I just guess, but.

2047
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,760
So like Woodstock.

2048
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:44,520
Did Woodstock have any effect on the career of.

2049
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:47,680
No, well Vic de Mone, no.

2050
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:48,920
I don't think it was like,

2051
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:51,480
Steven Stills wasn't playing at the top of the Contemporary,

2052
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:56,400
but they were certainly trying to draw a certain crowd

2053
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,040
that they're not courting as much anymore.

2054
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,880
Well, if you wanted to rock,

2055
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,580
there was still a place for you.

2056
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:06,100
And that place is called the Teen Pool.

2057
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:12,100
Unlike other, sometimes kids go to their own pool,

2058
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:15,220
separate from the adults or the adults have their own pool.

2059
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:17,260
The Contemporary, a rare scenario

2060
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:20,820
where teens are cast off have their own pool

2061
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:24,180
because there they can play rock music.

2062
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:29,060
Because it would be too jarring to hear a bunch of bread.

2063
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:32,580
Imagine if you're just a good American Vic de Mone

2064
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:36,020
loving man and then you get blasted by bread.

2065
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:36,860
Ah!

2066
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:38,340
What is this?

2067
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:40,700
Well, you're a kid, look, you might not be ready for this,

2068
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:42,860
but your kids are gonna love it.

2069
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:45,660
Your teens are gonna love it while they're swimming.

2070
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:48,100
Those teens at that Teen Pool are up to no good.

2071
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,820
They're smoking cigarettes, unlike us at the adult pool

2072
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:54,580
who are also smoking cigarettes, but it's good when we do it.

2073
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:55,420
They're better cigarettes.

2074
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:56,940
We do it with class.

2075
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:58,220
Yeah.

2076
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:02,300
Also just the Teen Pool just seems like a real

2077
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:05,700
pervert trap.

2078
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:09,740
It's that if you were trying to run a Chris Hansen operation.

2079
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:11,100
Oh, I see.

2080
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:11,940
Yeah, yeah.

2081
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:13,340
We put up a Craigslist ad saying

2082
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:15,380
there was the opening of a Teen Pool.

2083
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:20,260
Hey, half of the top 10 Billboard charts

2084
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:21,940
are over at the Teen Pool

2085
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:25,140
with people they've crossed state lines with.

2086
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:27,460
Oh yeah, the 70s with a Teen Pool

2087
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:29,940
that played rock music, oh my God.

2088
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:32,780
Get every rock and roll artist away from there.

2089
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:33,980
Jesus, I didn't even think about it.

2090
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:35,260
Show us the logs.

2091
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:37,100
Show us the Teen Pool logs, folks.

2092
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:38,140
Who went to the Teen Pool?

2093
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:41,100
There was more wholesome stuff going on for kids to do.

2094
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:42,700
It seems like people were very fond.

2095
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,700
If you were a kid who went to the Contemporary,

2096
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:49,820
while your parents went upstairs to swing, to swap keys,

2097
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:52,540
you could stay in the Fiesta Fun Center.

2098
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:55,220
The arcade was kept at the Southwest theme.

2099
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:58,180
The Fiesta Fun Center, which had,

2100
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:00,460
there was a movie theater for just a dollar.

2101
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:02,620
You could see classics like Love Bug,

2102
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:04,780
Mary Poppins, or Song of the South.

2103
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:05,620
Oh good.

2104
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:07,540
Whoops, moving on.

2105
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:10,140
There was also a big shooting gallery

2106
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:12,420
that seemed legit and imagineered.

2107
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:14,660
I mean, Disney building a shooting gallery.

2108
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:17,260
That was gone by the time I went for the first time.

2109
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:19,740
Yeah, well you just had an arcade

2110
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:21,140
and the Southwest of it is gone.

2111
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:25,540
I went in 80, 89 or 90 for the first time.

2112
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:27,340
Yeah, so that was gone.

2113
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:30,700
There also, there was a big mural on the wall

2114
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:33,820
that had representation of the three caballeros

2115
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:35,220
in keeping with the theme.

2116
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:38,900
And the caballeros had girlfriends who were only,

2117
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:42,060
that's the only media in which these three caballero

2118
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:43,140
girlfriends appear.

2119
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:45,580
Yeah, like Chipette caballeros.

2120
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:46,420
Yes.

2121
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:48,380
Of whatever their names are.

2122
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:49,580
Do you have a photo of that?

2123
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:50,420
I don't with me.

2124
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:51,580
Just a note, okay.

2125
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:52,420
Yeah.

2126
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:53,260
We'll find them.

2127
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:56,420
Maybe there's some, yeah, record of like

2128
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:58,220
what those characters' names were.

2129
01:18:58,220 --> 01:18:59,820
They just, actually I do have a photo

2130
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:02,340
and they just look exactly like them,

2131
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:06,980
but you know, the way you try to find

2132
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:09,580
just your exact equivalent.

2133
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:10,820
Right, like the Chipettes.

2134
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:14,220
I mean the Chipettes are mirror images of the Chipmunks.

2135
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:15,300
Yeah.

2136
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:18,420
Yeah, that arcade, my memory of the arcade

2137
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,980
is basically one thing.

2138
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:21,820
Yeah.

2139
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:24,340
And it's one of the most exciting things ever

2140
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:26,980
as far as Disney World memories,

2141
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:29,020
is they had, and let me find it,

2142
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:30,980
I have the picture with me here,

2143
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:33,260
the only time I have ever seen

2144
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:35,860
the real Ghostbusters arcade game.

2145
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:38,380
Okay, that was not, what's the deal with that?

2146
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:39,380
It was not a common?

2147
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,740
I never, I guess not.

2148
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:43,100
That's one of those things as a kid

2149
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:44,660
where you walk in and you go,

2150
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:47,020
this is a complete, like I've never seen this before

2151
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:48,460
and I would never see it again.

2152
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:51,860
I have a similar memory of an arcade

2153
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:53,820
like in another beach town where I was like,

2154
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:56,020
holy shit, what's this Ghostbusters machine?

2155
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:57,140
Never saw it again.

2156
01:19:57,140 --> 01:19:58,540
Really, interesting.

2157
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:01,100
Because the same, the only other arcade cabinet

2158
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,460
that I've never seen again

2159
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:05,340
was a Bucky O'Hare arcade cabinet.

2160
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:06,700
And that was at the Little Caesars,

2161
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:08,100
which became the Caesar Land,

2162
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:10,780
which is still a topic we need to get into one day

2163
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:12,340
when we can find somebody from corporate

2164
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:13,500
that has the materials.

2165
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,740
We don't, this is just nothing to go on.

2166
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:16,380
Because there's very little, as far as

2167
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,900
pictures, there's just some people from the Chalmers,

2168
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:20,620
only Little Caesars that was like a Chuck E. Cheese,

2169
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:21,460
essentially.

2170
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:24,340
So yeah, Ghostbusters, I wonder if it was not

2171
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:26,260
widely available, which is crazy

2172
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:28,340
because it was such a popular cartoon and movies.

2173
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:30,100
It could have just been overtaken.

2174
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:33,140
Like they made it when the show was wrapping up.

2175
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:34,620
Maybe. And it's like the Turtles game

2176
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:36,300
and the Simpsons game and the X-Men game

2177
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:37,900
just like overtook.

2178
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,700
I guess, but you would think,

2179
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:40,540
Ghostbusters, you know,

2180
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:42,620
did you ever, you played like Simpsons and Turtles,

2181
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:43,900
the main arcade games.

2182
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:44,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2183
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:47,260
X-Men was around, whether you played it or not.

2184
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:50,860
But Ghostbusters was, do you ever recall seeing this?

2185
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:51,700
No, no. No.

2186
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:52,660
Yeah, not a common one.

2187
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:53,500
I guess you're saying, yeah.

2188
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:54,320
Once.

2189
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,780
So I wonder what happened with it.

2190
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:58,780
So, but that's like, that's almost as powerful

2191
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:01,060
a memory as like going on any of the rides

2192
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:01,900
for the first time.

2193
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:03,380
It's to me.

2194
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:06,100
It's going like, oh my God, Ghostbusters arcade.

2195
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:07,860
Did you not know that the game existed?

2196
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:09,100
No, you didn't know anything.

2197
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:11,100
This is the old, you remember the old days of everything.

2198
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:13,740
Toy wise, like you didn't know what toys were available.

2199
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:14,820
You'd go into Toys R Us and go,

2200
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:16,860
I hope they have Sonic the Hedgehog toys.

2201
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:19,420
I mean, unless you saw a commercial, you wouldn't know.

2202
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:21,180
So when you'd go into a new arcade,

2203
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:23,380
you would find games you never saw before

2204
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:24,860
and it would blow your little mind.

2205
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:25,700
Wow.

2206
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:26,520
So.

2207
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,260
So was it great?

2208
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:30,460
I remember it being really fun.

2209
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:32,620
I think it was a side scroller where you would shoot

2210
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:35,140
your proton pack stuff at Ghosts,

2211
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:37,300
which is what a game like that would be.

2212
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:38,140
Yeah.

2213
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:40,860
But my memory was it did live up to it,

2214
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:43,340
but I think I didn't get to spend too much time there.

2215
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:44,780
My parents probably were like,

2216
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:46,140
we should go to Disney World.

2217
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:49,460
The thing we paid for and have been planning to do.

2218
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:50,460
We shouldn't sit here.

2219
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:51,300
For some time.

2220
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:53,100
Although I think maybe timing wise it was bad,

2221
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:55,300
because I did end up beating the X-Men arcade

2222
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:56,820
with some kids because it was broken

2223
01:21:56,820 --> 01:21:59,260
and that was at Grand Floridian.

2224
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:00,200
Okay.

2225
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:04,180
So a bunch of strangers and I one night

2226
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:07,140
teamed up to beat Magneto and it was a wonderful moment

2227
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:08,660
and we never saw each other again.

2228
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:09,860
Geez, wow.

2229
01:22:09,940 --> 01:22:14,500
And this wasn't immortalized in some kind of Washington

2230
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:15,740
crossing the Delaware type thing.

2231
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:16,860
Not as far as I know.

2232
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:17,780
It is in my mind.

2233
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:20,140
When the heroes stood up to injustice.

2234
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:20,980
Yeah.

2235
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:21,800
Did what was right.

2236
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,940
Great moments in Disney World arcade,

2237
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,180
or arcade moment, I guess.

2238
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:28,380
Disney World, great Disney World arcade moments,

2239
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:31,360
which I bet a lot of kids have a certain age.

2240
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:32,660
I don't know if kids are still as excited

2241
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:34,400
about arcade games as they are,

2242
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:37,820
or they were when we were kids, but I could be wrong.

2243
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:38,660
Because it's still there.

2244
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:39,500
Arcade is still there.

2245
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:41,460
Do they have tickets now?

2246
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:44,020
Some places have tickets, some places have real cards.

2247
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:45,380
Right, I think they have some sort of

2248
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:48,100
like Chuck E. Cheese style thing there.

2249
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:48,940
I could be wrong.

2250
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:50,140
At the contemporary, I'm not sure.

2251
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:50,980
To redeem.

2252
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:55,420
Let's start, let's get our remaining details that we like

2253
01:22:55,420 --> 01:22:57,600
because there's a big thing that we haven't gotten to

2254
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,140
and I can only assume it will be the closer.

2255
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:00,980
Yeah.

2256
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:02,460
So toss out anything else.

2257
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:06,140
Can you bring up that concept art picture, Margot?

2258
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:07,920
I had never seen this before.

2259
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,760
I think this is early what the contemporary

2260
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,800
could have looked like.

2261
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:12,640
It's very different.

2262
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:15,720
Well, is this from, because the idea of this type

2263
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:19,560
of building was in the original Epcot plans,

2264
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:23,000
and I don't mean the park Epcot, I mean the city Epcot.

2265
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,180
Like there was this idea of a general building vibe

2266
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:29,480
that I believe was supposed to be a mall.

2267
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:33,280
Like it was the shopping center in Walt's Future City,

2268
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:37,080
which it does continue to have this extremely mall vibe,

2269
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:38,680
which probably speaks to why I dig it.

2270
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:42,120
This looks like part of a city, this art.

2271
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:47,120
This might be Epcot design and this also may have been

2272
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:51,520
when the original name was in play, which I really like.

2273
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,640
Tempo Bay.

2274
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,720
Tempo Bay is a.

2275
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:56,800
Tempo Bay's a great name.

2276
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,000
I maybe would have, I maybe like it more, I don't know.

2277
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:00,840
Tempo Bay.

2278
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:01,960
Do you think it fits?

2279
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:05,480
I mean it fits with a place with lots of young couples

2280
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:08,240
who are looking for new experiences on a vacation

2281
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:09,200
they'll never forget.

2282
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:11,800
Hey, get on my tempo, baby.

2283
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,480
Press against my chest and feel my tempo.

2284
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,320
Oh God.

2285
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,000
I don't think there's anything gross about it.

2286
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,840
That's a heartbeat is what I mean.

2287
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,680
I said the same thing as you did,

2288
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:22,680
but you saying it made me recoil.

2289
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,880
Yeah, Tempo Bay is a cool name.

2290
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,320
This looks much more like a Marvel prison or something,

2291
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,560
this art.

2292
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:34,160
This looks a lot less inviting, but it is cool.

2293
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:36,800
I'll give this back for a prison.

2294
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:37,640
Avengers.

2295
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,920
If you're out there about to build a prison

2296
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,360
and you listen to this show.

2297
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,120
Yeah, if you're a part of the prison industrial complex

2298
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:47,160
in America and you're looking for fresh, innovative ways

2299
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:49,600
to make some money and build new prisons,

2300
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,680
listen to podcast the ride

2301
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,720
and then just steal an old Disney concept.

2302
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,880
If you're part of the prison industrial complex

2303
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,000
and you subscribe to our Patreon,

2304
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,880
then we think you're great.

2305
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,920
Yes, we're against the prison industrial complex

2306
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:05,760
unless you were paying us $8 a month, then we're on board.

2307
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:09,160
They could build the Marvel super villain

2308
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:10,840
holding pen somewhere.

2309
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:11,880
That would be fun.

2310
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,000
That'd be a fun ride.

2311
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:13,840
Yeah.

2312
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:16,800
Everybody gets out and they just use old contemporary,

2313
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,640
old Tempo Bay concept art.

2314
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:19,480
Yeah.

2315
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:20,320
Why not?

2316
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,880
Tempo Bay.

2317
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:24,840
Margot, will you pull out that matchbook image?

2318
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,680
It's a very Jason request.

2319
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,520
Pull up the matchbook, please.

2320
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,840
This little simplified version of the contemporary

2321
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,240
shows up on a lot of stuff.

2322
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:35,080
Oh, yeah.

2323
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:36,960
And it's still used.

2324
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,480
Can you switch to the menu too?

2325
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:41,560
They will tile it too.

2326
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:42,480
Oh.

2327
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:46,320
I mean, this looks like the Overlook and the Shining.

2328
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:47,160
Oh, yeah.

2329
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,000
Oh, yeah.

2330
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,680
God, that'd be great as wallpaper,

2331
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:52,240
as computer wallpaper, anywhere you want it.

2332
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:53,080
Yeah.

2333
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:53,920
So I think-

2334
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:56,480
As a shirt, as a kooky Lasseter shirt.

2335
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,760
They did hit on some stuff that it's like,

2336
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,600
yeah, this works for a place called the Contemporary.

2337
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,960
This is kind of timeless.

2338
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:06,040
Works in a lot of eras.

2339
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:07,160
There was also an era though

2340
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:09,560
where it was unmistakably 80s.

2341
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:11,680
There's a picture 80s contemporary.

2342
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:14,960
And there is an inherent maulness to it,

2343
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,360
that it is a big open atrium.

2344
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:17,200
And then look at the-

2345
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:18,040
Oh, yeah.

2346
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:18,880
Oh, boy.

2347
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,720
I mean, this is what I see in my dreams.

2348
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:24,800
This is a neon sign in kind of cursive

2349
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,960
that says Contemporary Woman.

2350
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,720
And then all those pipes up there,

2351
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:31,600
that's what the Space Mountain is like in Tokyo.

2352
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,720
This is still there.

2353
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:34,560
I think so.

2354
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:35,400
This gift shop.

2355
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:36,240
And it's pretty much in the same-

2356
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:37,600
I think the pipes are still there too.

2357
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:38,720
Yes, I believe the pipes are.

2358
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,360
The lighting is absolutely different,

2359
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,640
but the gift shop is still there.

2360
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,600
I don't think they're selling the same things.

2361
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:47,280
They're not selling like big thick denim shirts.

2362
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,120
I don't, it looks like-

2363
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:50,680
Big cloth flowers for ladies to wear.

2364
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:54,640
They aren't selling like bizarre, a top that's very long.

2365
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:59,000
And the skirt doesn't start until like past your hips.

2366
01:26:59,000 --> 01:26:59,840
Right.

2367
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,800
Bizarre proportions.

2368
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,360
But the last time I was in there,

2369
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,200
I remember being like,

2370
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,640
oh, where's all the merchandise that says contemporary?

2371
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:08,240
And they're like, we don't have any.

2372
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:09,080
And I went, what?

2373
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:09,960
Yeah. Oh, shit.

2374
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:11,560
Bring back the rock pillows.

2375
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,320
Give us something to buy.

2376
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:15,760
Maybe that's different in the last couple years.

2377
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:16,760
But that was a while ago. I also don't think

2378
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:19,240
that you can rent, I believe these,

2379
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:20,560
there was also Contemporary Man

2380
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,680
and you could rent tuxedos there.

2381
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:23,880
You walk into a store, it looks like this

2382
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,200
and rent a tuxedo.

2383
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:26,040
Oh my gosh.

2384
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:26,880
We would have done that for a show.

2385
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,240
Imagine how weird that tuxedo is

2386
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:30,280
and there's probably like a little coke vial

2387
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:31,440
deep in the pocket. Oh, right.

2388
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:34,360
Cause top of the world lounge, the detail, it says,

2389
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:38,440
somewhere it said like jackets required for men.

2390
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:40,280
Like that's, it was a nice place.

2391
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,840
So you go rent it from the contemporary for contemporary men.

2392
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,640
Potentially go rent it when you're getting

2393
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:47,440
your shipped box of oranges.

2394
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:48,840
The ultimate.

2395
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:49,680
The ultimate.

2396
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:51,120
That's a 15 timer.

2397
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,840
Well, it's the big thing we're waiting for,

2398
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:55,280
the ultimate 15 timer about the contemporary.

2399
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:58,080
Well, I don't know that we fully addressed it,

2400
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,680
but you want, let's get to it.

2401
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:00,520
Let's do it.

2402
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:01,360
Richard Nixon.

2403
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,360
Richard Nixon. Richard.

2404
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,200
No house, Nixon.

2405
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,000
You might know this already,

2406
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,960
but this is the contemporary hotel

2407
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,960
and the, specifically the adjoining convention center

2408
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:15,920
is where Nixon said, I am not a crook.

2409
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:16,840
That is right.

2410
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:20,120
That is the ultimate little piece of trivia.

2411
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:20,960
That is a good one.

2412
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:21,800
People love that.

2413
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:24,040
Normal people like that.

2414
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,960
Yes. That one won't put them to sleep.

2415
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,040
Right. You say that to people.

2416
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,360
Say it and then stop.

2417
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:31,520
Then don't say anything else that you've heard today.

2418
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,640
Yes. Regular folks that don't give a shit

2419
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:35,400
about any of this go, wait, what?

2420
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,160
Yeah. It's a thing.

2421
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:39,640
Like every president has a couple of phrases

2422
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:41,360
you can just say, you know,

2423
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,640
ask not what your country can do for you.

2424
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:45,520
Tear down this wall.

2425
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:48,960
Like I am not a crook quickly became Richard Dixons.

2426
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,200
It would be like, you'd be like, yeah,

2427
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,240
did you know when Bill Clinton said

2428
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:52,920
that he didn't have sexual relations with that woman,

2429
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:55,080
that was at Knott's Berry Farm.

2430
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:55,920
You'd be like, what?

2431
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:56,760
He was?

2432
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:57,600
Boysenberry Festival.

2433
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,680
Yeah, Boysenberry.

2434
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:00,560
He had some Boysenberry on his shirt if you look.

2435
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,440
If you look close, yeah, it was a purple tie

2436
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:04,360
so you couldn't tell that much, luckily.

2437
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:06,560
He planned for that because, you know, he was smart.

2438
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,960
Say what you want about the guy, he was smart.

2439
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:08,800
He was smart.

2440
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:09,640
Boysenberry tie.

2441
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:11,680
Sloppy boy, but he was smart.

2442
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:15,320
Read my lips, no taxes, Cedar Farm, George H.W. Bush.

2443
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:18,160
Yeah, it happened.

2444
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:21,080
Another notorious quote, you ever think about

2445
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:23,440
how we are in our lives very often

2446
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,480
near where one of the most notorious,

2447
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:26,800
this was probably, I am not a crook,

2448
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:29,880
one of the most notorious until the great presidential quote,

2449
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:34,280
grabbed him by the pussy, that is the NBC studio.

2450
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:38,760
That was mere steps from Jay Leno's Tonight Show studio.

2451
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:42,080
We so often, like I'm getting off the freeway

2452
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,560
and pass right by that.

2453
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:47,400
Yes, right where the Billy Bush situation happened.

2454
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:50,120
If you watch the full video, it happens,

2455
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,800
they leave the bus and they walk into the building

2456
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,900
they're going into and they pass by an old timey car

2457
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:57,240
that is at the entrance of Jay Leno's Tonight Show studio.

2458
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:59,480
This can only be a Jay Leno.

2459
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:00,320
Oh, I never realized that.

2460
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,480
Duesenberg or something.

2461
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,880
Watch the tape, watch the tape.

2462
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:06,680
Not the part that, that happened

2463
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,880
and he still got elected, but if you wanna see

2464
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:10,760
an old Duesenberg, the real point of the tape.

2465
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:13,040
Wow, Jay's car is in the tape?

2466
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,000
It is, it's complicit.

2467
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:18,480
If the car had said a big ah-oo-ga,

2468
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:22,160
if Jay had honked his horn at the right time,

2469
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:24,840
it might have startled Trump and Billy

2470
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:26,000
and it wouldn't have happened.

2471
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,840
And then he would have gotten elected even more easily.

2472
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:29,680
I was just gonna say there would have been no difference.

2473
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:30,800
What future am I describing?

2474
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,320
Yeah, the thing you're describing isn't even

2475
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:34,760
that big of a deal after the fact

2476
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:37,640
that it didn't do anything and he still became president.

2477
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,440
As opposed to I'm Not a Crook, which is,

2478
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:42,360
it's not like it hurt him, but it's certainly

2479
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:44,080
like synonymous with the.

2480
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:44,920
Yeah, the whole thing.

2481
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:46,000
The collapse, because it happened

2482
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,080
within the year of him stepping down.

2483
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:50,960
Let's say some, all right, so the full picture here.

2484
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:51,880
Sure.

2485
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:54,640
November 17th, 1973, Jason, you were talking about

2486
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:58,640
like what this was, the specific event

2487
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:00,360
that was happening in the convention center.

2488
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:03,120
It was a one hour press conference

2489
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:07,040
with the Associated Press Managing Editors Association.

2490
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,960
Now think about that.

2491
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:12,200
What president, after Nixon, is going like,

2492
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:15,400
I'm going to go talk to the Associated Press Editors

2493
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:16,760
for an hour.

2494
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,560
Yeah, I mean, only during an hour.

2495
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:21,560
Trump can improvise six.

2496
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:22,400
That's true, yeah.

2497
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:23,240
Sure, no problem.

2498
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:26,240
As long as it's a bunch of hooting and hollering.

2499
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:27,080
Yeah.

2500
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:28,440
He's actively giving COVID to.

2501
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:29,280
That's right.

2502
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,480
But he was being asked about making money

2503
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:35,000
in public service and the full quote,

2504
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,160
I've earned every cent and in all my years

2505
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:41,000
of public service, I've never obstructed justice.

2506
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,840
People have got to know whether or not

2507
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,160
their president is a crook.

2508
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:45,840
Well, I am not a crook.

2509
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:48,280
I've earned everything I've got.

2510
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:50,160
Anyway, he said that November 73,

2511
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:53,440
stepped down in August in 1974,

2512
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,520
so turned out he was a crook.

2513
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,160
He was a crook.

2514
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:59,840
Now this plays into the observation

2515
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,520
that I wanted to make about this.

2516
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,480
I don't have the clip of it,

2517
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:06,400
but here, you kind of did a Nixon-y thing there.

2518
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:10,560
If I was going to try to do what I think

2519
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:13,840
kind of accurately it was and how he said it,

2520
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,280
this is my best attempt.

2521
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:16,120
They've got to know whether or not

2522
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:17,160
their president is a crook.

2523
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:18,000
Well, I'm not a crook.

2524
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,440
I've earned everything I've got.

2525
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,320
That's maybe kind of a dry.

2526
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:24,240
And then over the years, probably within the year,

2527
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:27,640
but what it's become in pop culture,

2528
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:30,200
and I invite you guys to all do this together.

2529
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:31,240
I think you know where I'm going with it.

2530
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:34,480
Here is what the world has turned the quote into.

2531
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:35,320
Yeah.

2532
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:38,320
I am brother crook.

2533
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:39,920
He does that.

2534
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:40,760
Yes, it's this.

2535
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:42,560
The people think this.

2536
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:43,400
They picture him on.

2537
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,080
He's always, it's a priest side.

2538
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:45,920
That's my thing.

2539
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:47,200
It's priest side.

2540
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,400
And then I shake on my jowls.

2541
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:50,240
I am not a crook.

2542
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:51,080
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2543
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:52,400
Suck it to me.

2544
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,440
It's always, I'm not a crook.

2545
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:56,840
Suck it to me.

2546
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:58,040
Shakers.

2547
01:32:58,040 --> 01:32:59,720
This is like, but this happens all the time.

2548
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:02,160
Luke, I am your father, isn't the quote.

2549
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,120
Yes, yeah.

2550
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:05,240
These things get changed.

2551
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:06,920
The fact that people so really confidently

2552
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:08,800
and probably to entertain people at a party,

2553
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,000
look what I can do.

2554
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:10,840
Luke.

2555
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:13,040
He doesn't say Luke.

2556
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,120
No, he doesn't say it.

2557
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,120
He says I.

2558
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:17,640
Do you want some more gin and nutmeg special?

2559
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,840
But yes, there's no M.

2560
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:22,080
Well, I'm not a crook, but it's.

2561
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:24,440
I am brother crook.

2562
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:25,280
I am not a crook.

2563
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,480
I mean, how many times did Rich Little say,

2564
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:31,720
I am not a crook at one of his sold out shows in Las Vegas?

2565
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:32,560
Still, I think.

2566
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:33,400
Still doing it.

2567
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:36,000
As with our episode, it's what he builds to.

2568
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:37,840
The opener and the closer for Rich Little,

2569
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,240
I think, at this point.

2570
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:41,560
Some bands open and close with their hit song

2571
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:44,200
and Rich Little, I'm sure does Nixon or Johnny.

2572
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:47,400
He does either Johnny Carson or Nixon first and last.

2573
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,520
What if Nixon hosted the Tonight Show?

2574
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:50,360
He absolutely does that.

2575
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:51,640
Nixon was Carnac.

2576
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:53,640
That's actually a little heady maybe for the.

2577
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:55,400
Yeah, too many things.

2578
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:56,600
And it's a little disrespectful

2579
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:58,920
because honestly, Johnny, that's Johnny's show, so.

2580
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:00,320
You know, he was the king.

2581
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:01,760
Nobody ever did it better.

2582
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,800
We'd do the golf swing and.

2583
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:04,640
You know what?

2584
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:05,480
Everybody would watch it.

2585
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,160
It doesn't matter where you walk life,

2586
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:09,360
you're from, what politics you are.

2587
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,040
People love.

2588
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:11,880
Piscopo.

2589
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:15,280
People die mid talking about Johnny Carson all the time.

2590
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:17,960
They're just in the middle of the sentence.

2591
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:18,800
Do the listen.

2592
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:19,640
Okay.

2593
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:21,040
Wait, go ahead.

2594
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:21,880
No, I don't think I'm gonna.

2595
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:23,640
You probably have some funnier thought than I do.

2596
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:24,600
My thought isn't that funny.

2597
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,800
I just like, do the listeners know,

2598
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:29,680
do they watch enough interviews with old band

2599
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:31,920
that have this reverence for Johnny Carson?

2600
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:34,240
Do they know even what we're talking about?

2601
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:35,360
That's my question.

2602
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:38,800
That's what you're questioning in this episode?

2603
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:40,000
I'm just wondering.

2604
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,640
Once in a while I step out of my body

2605
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:43,800
and I go, wait a minute here.

2606
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:46,040
People tuned in for Mickey Mouse.

2607
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:48,840
And they're like, what is this?

2608
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:51,120
Johnny Carson put off you for 40 years.

2609
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:53,520
I think either you have to not have those moments

2610
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:56,000
or you need to have them 70 times an episode.

2611
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,840
That's true.

2612
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:57,680
That's how to proceed.

2613
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:59,400
Today I'm stepping away.

2614
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,080
I'm floating above myself.

2615
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:01,920
I'll give you credit.

2616
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:04,320
I think that is a valid question to answer.

2617
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:05,160
I'm just wondering.

2618
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,480
I think at a certain point it just became so ubiquitous

2619
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:11,400
if they may have heard it and just tuned it out.

2620
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:12,240
It's just like.

2621
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:13,280
Weird wild stuff.

2622
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:16,760
CNN documentaries or time life compilation commercials

2623
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:17,600
or whatever.

2624
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,080
I was gonna ask in 20 years or 30 years

2625
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:22,000
are people gonna be like, oh man,

2626
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,560
the thing you gotta remember.

2627
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:27,360
When Corden said he was stepping away,

2628
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:30,280
I mean the music stopped, the car bowl carrier was over.

2629
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:32,560
Everyone gasped when they heard there's not gonna be

2630
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,520
another crosswalk dance-a-thon off.

2631
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:36,760
Yeah, I think.

2632
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:38,240
When the Foo Fighters,

2633
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:41,120
because remember there was seven of those guys.

2634
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:42,920
They all fit into one car.

2635
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:44,320
You couldn't believe it.

2636
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:47,240
And the spin-off shows when it would just be celebrities

2637
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:48,920
and they weren't singing their songs.

2638
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:50,840
Who could have thought of that?

2639
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:53,480
Wait, I mean you got Quantico

2640
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:57,000
and then you got Quantico in the field?

2641
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,960
Ariana Grande and Seth MacFarlane together

2642
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,560
singing Little Shop?

2643
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,400
Get out of town.

2644
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:04,240
Get out of town.

2645
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:05,080
Hold on.

2646
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:08,120
Wait a minute, they had Arrow and then they had Supergirl

2647
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:11,200
and then you're telling me there's these legends of tomorrow

2648
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:12,720
I gotta know now?

2649
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:14,400
And it really blew people away.

2650
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,040
And all these guys knew each other.

2651
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:17,720
The characters all knew each other

2652
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:19,760
and that was revolutionary.

2653
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:22,920
It's gonna happen.

2654
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:24,400
I don't know what you were referencing

2655
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,440
with Seth MacFarlane and Ariana Grande.

2656
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:27,840
Well, Scott.

2657
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:28,680
I shouldn't have asked.

2658
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:31,600
Well, there is a spin-off of course.

2659
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:33,760
Carpool Karaoke is not just limited

2660
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:35,400
to the James Corden show.

2661
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:38,000
It is also its own show on Apple TV I believe.

2662
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,520
In one of the episodes, Seth MacFarlane is driving

2663
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:42,800
and Ariana Grande is sitting shotgun

2664
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:45,000
and they sing like Sud and Les Seymour.

2665
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:45,840
And Les Seymour.

2666
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:46,680
Yeah, and they sing it together.

2667
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:48,120
Wait, no spoilers.

2668
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:50,360
Well, they have the plant, there's like a plant.

2669
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:51,200
Big reveal in season two.

2670
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,040
Plant in the backseat I think.

2671
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,240
You're either gonna sing Little Shop of Horrors

2672
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:56,520
like the girl group does

2673
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,000
or you're gonna sing Sun Les Seymour.

2674
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,280
If you're talking Little Shop

2675
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,200
and you gotta condense it to a show.

2676
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:03,280
I've been reading interviews with Seth MacFarlane

2677
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:05,520
talking about the state of musicals these days.

2678
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:08,840
And I do wonder Jason, if you concur with his feeling.

2679
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:11,640
He feels like we're really not in a good spot musical wise.

2680
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:13,600
He believes like Rodgers and Hammerstein.

2681
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:14,800
Like that's the top of the level.

2682
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,960
And we still, the songwriting is not there

2683
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:20,000
as far as the last couple of decades of musicals.

2684
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Yeah, I mean, I think, yeah, I don't know.

2685
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:26,760
There's some good ones, there's some bad ones.

2686
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:28,600
I did like watching the Tonys.

2687
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:31,080
I was kind of like, yeah, I don't know any.

2688
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:34,480
There's some stuff where it feels like there's musical

2689
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:39,640
the speed run, like quick where you can just have someone go

2690
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:42,080
something is going to happen.

2691
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:43,680
That's all you have to do.

2692
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,720
But he's saying the best stuff is still in the past

2693
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:49,800
and we have to get back to more traditional songwriting.

2694
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:53,400
It certainly seems like the Broadway and the West End,

2695
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:54,920
the way they book stuff,

2696
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:57,520
it is just like a lot of the same stuff comes up.

2697
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,120
Scott, do you have an opinion about this?

2698
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:01,160
I think it's interesting that Jason's just earnestly

2699
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:04,200
answering Seth MacFarlane's question through you.

2700
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:06,640
I'd love to get, you know, get back to fourth grade.

2701
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:08,080
That's a pretty interesting point.

2702
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:09,840
Let's get Seth on and talk about it.

2703
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,000
And only that.

2704
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,520
Yep.

2705
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:16,480
Okay, here's a Nixon thing I found out.

2706
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:18,720
Do you know what might have brought him

2707
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:20,840
to the Florida area?

2708
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:22,760
Oh, actually I don't.

2709
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:25,200
Why did this thing happen here and why did he go there?

2710
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:28,160
He was fresh from a vacation because he,

2711
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:31,120
much like Trump, had a Florida White House.

2712
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:34,000
He had a place where he went like 50 times

2713
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,440
during the presidency.

2714
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:37,280
And this was three and a half hours south

2715
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:40,040
in Key Biscayne, Florida.

2716
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:44,240
Beachfront property.

2717
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:46,800
He got it really cheap from like mob hookups

2718
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:49,480
and Jimmy Hoffa affiliated people.

2719
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:53,080
And he was in a neighborhood of like other crooks,

2720
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:57,160
including, he was really good friends.

2721
01:38:57,560 --> 01:39:02,040
Nixon's Florida neighbor was a guy named Robert Abplanalp.

2722
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:05,000
One of the most complicated names I've ever seen.

2723
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,080
Robert Abplanalp, who was the inventor

2724
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:09,520
of aerosol spray can tops.

2725
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:10,360
Wow.

2726
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:14,160
And that made him enough money to be Nixon's neighbor

2727
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:15,320
in Florida.

2728
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:19,720
And in fact, so okay, this is 73, I'm not a crook.

2729
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:21,520
Oh wait, oh, this would have been the beginning, I'm sorry.

2730
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:25,000
When the Watergate break-in became a story

2731
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,280
and leaked to the press, where was Nixon?

2732
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:33,200
As it broke, Nixon was on Robert Abplanalp's private island

2733
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:36,360
in the Bahamas called Walker's Cay.

2734
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:38,120
The air, not Moosha Cay.

2735
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:40,160
Not Moosha Cay, which is what I'm saying.

2736
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:43,640
So like, there's a lot of notorious Cays at this point.

2737
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:44,480
Yeah, really.

2738
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:46,080
There's Fire Festival Cay.

2739
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:50,400
There's David Copperfield Monkey Cay.

2740
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:54,200
Now we know there's Watergate aerosol spray can Nixon Cay.

2741
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,640
I wonder if it's still in the family.

2742
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:57,480
I don't know.

2743
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:58,320
That's an interesting question.

2744
01:39:58,320 --> 01:39:59,960
Is it still owned by the Abplanalps?

2745
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:04,040
I think it may have been slowly desiccated by hurricanes,

2746
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:06,800
which is the fate of a lot of these Cays.

2747
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,760
But anyway, it could be a future ordeal

2748
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:10,040
is stepping through every Cay.

2749
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:10,880
All the Cays, yeah.

2750
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,440
And discovering how many crimes

2751
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:16,320
and which crimes every Cay is associated with.

2752
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:17,400
All the crimes.

2753
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:22,920
By the way, usually pronounced key, C-A-Y, key.

2754
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:25,680
Like the Florida Keys.

2755
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:27,160
But sometimes spelled K.

2756
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:28,000
Yeah.

2757
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,240
Did I say it right or wrong?

2758
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:31,080
So you're saying it should be,

2759
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:32,680
actually we've been calling it Moosha Cay this whole time.

2760
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:34,320
It should be Moosha Key.

2761
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,040
Yeah, I only learned this recently.

2762
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:38,560
A lot of times pronounced key in that area.

2763
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:39,480
Interesting.

2764
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:40,320
Moosha Key.

2765
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:44,080
I'm not 100% on which is and is not pronounced key.

2766
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,200
Well, people have been confused now.

2767
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:49,320
They always knew Moosha Key is David Copperfield's

2768
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:51,800
private island that had monkey butlers or whatever.

2769
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,960
Keys or Cays?

2770
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:53,800
I don't know.

2771
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:54,640
Keys or Cays?

2772
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:55,480
I don't know either.

2773
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:57,000
I don't know if it's a key or a Cay.

2774
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:00,800
And anyway, so that's the,

2775
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,640
wait, there was something else.

2776
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:02,800
So he was down there.

2777
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:07,800
And that property in Florida had a helipad

2778
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,760
that was built by the Department of Defense.

2779
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:16,360
So America paid for Nixon to have a helipad.

2780
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:18,680
And then he sold the property and made a profit on it.

2781
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:23,160
So that's iffy, right, to sell the helipad

2782
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:24,480
that the government built.

2783
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:29,280
And it looks so Florida shady and criminal

2784
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:32,360
that this property was used in both Miami Vice

2785
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:33,200
and Scarface.

2786
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:34,040
Great.

2787
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:35,560
The place where Nixon used to live.

2788
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:37,600
And I assume Nixon associate G. Gordon-Lytte

2789
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:40,280
was on a Miami Vice episode, I think,

2790
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:41,880
because he was a celebrity.

2791
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:42,720
Oh, okay.

2792
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:43,560
G. Gordon-Lytte did the break in.

2793
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:44,560
Got the acting bug.

2794
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:46,200
Yeah, and he, you know, there's a,

2795
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:47,680
I was gonna say great, I don't know, it's great.

2796
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:49,920
But there's a Conan O'Brien with Conan,

2797
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:52,120
Don Rickles, and G. Gordon-Lytte.

2798
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:52,960
I don't know if you've ever seen that.

2799
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:54,040
No, no.

2800
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:56,400
But G. Gordon-Lytte was a crazy person

2801
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,160
that got put in prison for the break in.

2802
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:01,080
But worth investigating for many reasons

2803
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:03,720
because he became a celebrity, had his own radio show.

2804
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:07,520
Al Franken always bragged about being friends with him.

2805
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,400
Al Franken, you'd be like, I am friends with G.

2806
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:10,800
We call him G.

2807
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:11,640
What?

2808
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:12,460
That's what we call him.

2809
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:14,040
I swear to God, he'd always talk about this

2810
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:16,880
when I was listening to the Al Franken show in college

2811
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:17,720
on Air America.

2812
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:19,160
The clues have always been there

2813
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:23,120
of your ability to stomach hours worth of.

2814
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:26,320
Oh yeah, I would listen to all of Air America

2815
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:27,160
when I was around.

2816
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:28,480
People you disagree with.

2817
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:31,400
Well, I always, I mean, the SNL connection with Al

2818
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:34,120
was a good line into politics.

2819
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:36,640
A good straight line into, I guess I'll listen to Al

2820
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:40,720
talk about G. Gordon-Lytte for an hour and a half in college.

2821
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:41,560
I guess I could have done,

2822
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:43,440
been doing better things with my time.

2823
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:46,680
But we've talked about before the G. Gordon-Lytte calendar

2824
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:49,120
of women in bathing suits holding guns.

2825
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:50,960
We have, on this show we've talked about that.

2826
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:51,800
I think we have, Jason, you know what I'm talking about.

2827
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:53,080
Yeah, we have talked about that.

2828
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:56,160
I mean, nowadays those people are just congressmen, so.

2829
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:58,600
Yeah, yeah, no, it's not so, G. Gordon-Lytte

2830
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:01,280
seemed like a sort of a freak show at the time,

2831
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:03,560
but now it's just, everyone's like that.

2832
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:06,840
But anyway, I've lost the, G. Gordon-Lytte

2833
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:09,640
was on Miami Vice and shows like that.

2834
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:11,240
I don't know that he was on that show specifically.

2835
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:15,240
Johnny Carson reference audience might be at G. Gordon-Lytte.

2836
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:17,960
I was back in my brain.

2837
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:20,080
I was back in my brain.

2838
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:21,480
That's what I'm saying, keep it that way.

2839
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:22,320
Zip it up.

2840
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:23,140
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

2841
01:43:23,140 --> 01:43:24,060
Just keep it, don't even.

2842
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:24,900
You're right.

2843
01:43:24,900 --> 01:43:25,800
You'll only freak yourself out.

2844
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:26,640
You're right.

2845
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:27,480
If you look at the whole picture.

2846
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:29,800
They're all getting, everyone's getting ready for this,

2847
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:33,080
for the Plumbers, for that new Prestige mini series

2848
01:43:33,080 --> 01:43:34,680
coming up about Watergate.

2849
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:37,200
So they're gonna be talking about, is it out?

2850
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:38,400
The Julia Roberts one.

2851
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:39,480
No, that's Gaslit, isn't it?

2852
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:40,880
Oh yeah, yeah, but that's out now.

2853
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:43,160
But that has that one guy playing G. Gordon-Lytte.

2854
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,440
Okay, so there's Lydie in the air.

2855
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,640
Lydie is back in the zeitgeist.

2856
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:49,240
We're getting our lids blown off.

2857
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:52,440
The man passed away a few years ago at like 100.

2858
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:55,600
Which is, of course that guy got to live to 100.

2859
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:58,280
But yeah, yeah, Lydie is in the zeitgeist.

2860
01:43:58,280 --> 01:43:59,120
He's around.

2861
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,320
I believe you.

2862
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:03,200
I believe both of you, it's Lydie Mayne out there.

2863
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,560
There are a lot of weird, it's so weird

2864
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:09,040
that people were like, yeah, he's a celebrity now.

2865
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:09,920
Isn't it fun?

2866
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:12,400
Well, it was, cause look,

2867
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:14,680
Watergate was hot.

2868
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:17,920
Nixon made it hot with great catchphrases like this.

2869
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,880
And there's one more observation I have about this,

2870
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:22,320
which is that if he was at the Contemporary,

2871
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:23,240
and I think he was in and out,

2872
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:26,280
I think he did that hour, got grilled, and then he left.

2873
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:28,320
He did not use the Contemporary

2874
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:32,000
in its vacation kingdom amenities.

2875
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,120
But this was the first scenario of a president

2876
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:40,120
being very near his own robot in the Hall of Prejudice.

2877
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:40,960
Oh, very good point.

2878
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:41,800
Very good point.

2879
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:44,720
He was the first sitting president when that was built.

2880
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:46,800
And I don't think he went into the park,

2881
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:49,200
but he was within a mile.

2882
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:51,240
He could have taken a 15 minute walk

2883
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:53,640
and been with his own robot,

2884
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:55,960
which is something I wonder about all of the presidents.

2885
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:58,400
Do they ever think about what's up with their robot?

2886
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:01,640
Do they ever ask, can I go check out my robot?

2887
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:03,480
Or are they over it, cause they're the president?

2888
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:05,160
Of course there's a robot of me.

2889
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:07,280
Yeah, I mean there was Reagan, what do we have?

2890
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:09,000
Reagan was in Epcot.

2891
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,920
There's footage of Reagan in Epcot, I believe.

2892
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:12,720
Nixon at Epcot too.

2893
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:13,560
Nixon at Epcot.

2894
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:16,680
Yeah, but Reagan gave a speech at the.

2895
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:18,320
Was Clinton at Epcot too?

2896
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:22,040
Clinton was at the Disney Institute for some reason.

2897
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:26,120
Carter, I looked this up, sitting presidents at Disney World.

2898
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:29,680
Carter and Obama both did speeches in front of the castle.

2899
01:45:29,680 --> 01:45:32,320
But I don't know, so they were the closest.

2900
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:35,320
So I don't know if they ever took the stroll.

2901
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:37,360
You would think they would wanna get that photo.

2902
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:39,240
Disney would have always wanted to get that photo up

2903
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:40,800
with the robot and the president.

2904
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:43,760
They still haven't done, I mean now I get it

2905
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:47,240
why they're trying to like, they're not publicizing

2906
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:49,400
the Hall of Presidents anymore, really.

2907
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:51,680
That's not like at the front of the pamphlets

2908
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:53,080
to go to Disney World.

2909
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:54,520
It might have been in the past.

2910
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:56,560
Yeah, they're bringing the parasailors back.

2911
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:58,760
Yeah, the parasailors front and center.

2912
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:01,280
By the way also you can go see Cheer-Boo

2913
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:03,480
depending on what your preference is.

2914
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:05,800
I'm just saying, if there was a robot of me somewhere,

2915
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:06,640
I would just see it.

2916
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:07,480
I would be there every day.

2917
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:08,320
I would hammer around with it.

2918
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:09,160
Yeah, yeah.

2919
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:10,000
You put your arm around it.

2920
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:13,160
You do the photo with like, hey, how you doing?

2921
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:15,560
And maybe, maybe if nobody's looking

2922
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:17,960
or if people are looking, you give a little kiss.

2923
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:20,640
Yes, I would kiss my robot.

2924
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:21,960
You would kiss your robot every day.

2925
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:23,520
How often would you kiss your robot?

2926
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:24,920
Probably twice a day.

2927
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,840
Twice a day, up in the stakes.

2928
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:28,200
I mean I'd ask the Imagineer to make sure

2929
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:31,160
that it wasn't gonna like, like the oil wouldn't get on me

2930
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:32,240
or it wouldn't spark.

2931
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:33,720
I would like to think that they don't have a bunch

2932
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:36,440
of oil at the ready at their lips.

2933
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:38,480
Yeah, but don't you think the oil's leaking

2934
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:42,520
in the pores of the rubber, of the face skin rubber?

2935
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:43,360
Could be.

2936
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:44,400
It would be an exciting day

2937
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,240
if you were watching the Hall of Presidents

2938
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:49,480
and then one of them, and then James Polk started just

2939
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:53,400
black biling, like as if he had like an alien

2940
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:55,240
about to burst through his chest.

2941
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:56,720
Oh yes, Penguin, uh-huh, uh-huh.

2942
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:58,920
Because you would think, because it has to be lubricated

2943
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:02,880
because the rubber on the face is moving so much.

2944
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:05,360
It has to be some level of lubrication, I would think.

2945
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:07,560
But we don't know if it's black or if it's clear.

2946
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:09,280
We don't know if it could be clear.

2947
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,560
We don't know how the presidents are lubricated.

2948
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:12,920
That's true.

2949
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:14,600
I would guess it's probably clear.

2950
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:15,600
That would make sense.

2951
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,760
I would think, because it would start exploding.

2952
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:19,840
It should be red, I mean.

2953
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:20,680
Sure.

2954
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:21,500
Because if something goes wrong,

2955
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:22,800
at least you got an interesting show.

2956
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:25,360
Are there less fluids now with the electronic ones

2957
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:28,120
that aren't hydraulic, because they're not hydraulic anymore

2958
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:29,040
than newer ones.

2959
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:29,880
That's a good question.

2960
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:32,600
I mean, you still have to, I don't know, by the way,

2961
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:34,560
anything I'm talking about, you still have to get

2962
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:37,640
big pieces of rubber that get moved, changed out

2963
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:39,520
because they get worn out.

2964
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:41,760
So they still have to move.

2965
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:43,120
So I don't know, maybe not.

2966
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:44,080
I'm not sure. Send the face.

2967
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:45,920
Send the face to the flea market.

2968
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:47,760
We're done with this one.

2969
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:49,900
I told you when I went to D23, like in 2017,

2970
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:51,960
they showed, in the Imagineering section,

2971
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:56,080
there was this giant mater mouth from the Cars ride.

2972
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:59,600
Just the rubber from his mouth that moves,

2973
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:02,760
that has to be changed every couple months or something

2974
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:03,600
because it gets worn out.

2975
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:04,440
And it was crazy.

2976
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:07,160
And I was like, oh yeah, everyone's face has to be replaced.

2977
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:09,760
Everyone has to have new rubber faces, I think.

2978
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:11,760
If they do want to get rid of the Hall of Presidents,

2979
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:15,160
just go all out and pump tons of red hydraulic fluid.

2980
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:17,240
Don't say that it's going to happen,

2981
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:18,880
but just go out with a viral event.

2982
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:20,680
Kill the presidents off is what you're saying

2983
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:23,280
in a blaze of glory instead of just quietly shutting it down,

2984
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:25,000
which is what I think will happen eventually.

2985
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,680
Reservoir dogs just blow out.

2986
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:30,480
They all dot, like weaken their knees,

2987
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:32,200
program them all to just collapse.

2988
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:33,040
Give us a show.

2989
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:36,080
And red pours out of them.

2990
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:38,120
And program screams.

2991
01:48:38,120 --> 01:48:38,960
Get acu...

2992
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:40,640
I'll do it.

2993
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:42,240
I'll give you as many...

2994
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:44,840
What do you think Franklin Pierce would have screamed like?

2995
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:46,080
Ah!

2996
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:48,760
I'll try to do 46 different screams.

2997
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:51,560
And then some of this kid lighten off fireworks in there.

2998
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:54,640
Some kid gets some Florida fireworks

2999
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:55,480
and he's just in the background,

3000
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:58,500
lighten them off while this whole spectacle's going down.

3001
01:48:58,500 --> 01:48:59,840
And then that'll be the big deal.

3002
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:01,280
You could sell it as a ticketed event,

3003
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:03,200
the final hall of presidents,

3004
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:04,840
and then build Jason's sleepy hollow ride

3005
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:06,000
that he keeps talking about.

3006
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,440
That's a five timers at this point.

3007
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:09,760
Even though it was a real blue sky.

3008
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,040
Yeah.

3009
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:13,200
You brought it up this time.

3010
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:14,040
That's true.

3011
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:14,880
Yeah.

3012
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:16,200
It can be, we all share the times.

3013
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:17,760
We all share the times.

3014
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:19,760
Okay, final thoughts about Contemporary,

3015
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:21,280
which we wanted to sink down.

3016
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,120
I love it.

3017
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:24,200
Yeah, I mean, getting off, we didn't even say like...

3018
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:26,240
It's so comforting having it in front of me.

3019
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:29,400
I could just sit and describe sitting on the monorail

3020
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:31,640
and going into the station.

3021
01:49:31,640 --> 01:49:35,080
And the warm memories I have

3022
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:37,520
of just stepping on the carpeting,

3023
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:40,240
feeling the air conditioning in there.

3024
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:43,120
These are some of the most pleasant memories I have

3025
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:46,000
from the first 18 years of my life.

3026
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,480
There's something about,

3027
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:51,280
there was nothing like stepping out inside the hotel

3028
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:53,520
and the feeling you got when you would do it.

3029
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:55,520
It's the most sincere I've ever been on the podcast.

3030
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:56,920
It's the best.

3031
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:58,600
Truly, and I still feel that way.

3032
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:02,280
I'm not sure if it's for sure tied to nostalgia,

3033
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:04,680
but I do wonder if you were an adult and you've never been,

3034
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:06,680
if you still have this kind of feeling of like,

3035
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:08,000
whoa, this is awesome.

3036
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,360
Yeah.

3037
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:12,200
Scott, do you know about the...

3038
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:14,800
The Top of the World Lounge is what they started to call

3039
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:16,160
at the top of Bay Lake Tower.

3040
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:18,040
That's the DVC only.

3041
01:50:19,240 --> 01:50:20,400
I tried to go, we couldn't go

3042
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:22,520
because we had just booked the room.

3043
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:24,520
It was only for DVC members.

3044
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:27,400
And now it is called Top of the World Lounge,

3045
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:30,280
M-Dash, a Villain's Lair.

3046
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:31,120
No, I don't know about that.

3047
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:34,520
Because it's got villain themed drinks and snacks and stuff.

3048
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:35,640
Oh, I like that.

3049
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:40,120
There were guys, I don't know if this was permanent or what,

3050
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:44,480
but there were actors, improv actors walking around.

3051
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:47,240
As if it was a Villain's Night Off.

3052
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:48,800
What villains? Who was there?

3053
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:50,960
You know, the Kang, the crew.

3054
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:51,800
Maybe?

3055
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:53,280
Maybe Hades?

3056
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:56,800
But I think they were more Disney-bounded dressed.

3057
01:50:56,800 --> 01:51:00,400
They were more like, they were doing bits and all.

3058
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:01,240
Interesting.

3059
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:02,060
Oh, okay.

3060
01:51:02,060 --> 01:51:02,900
You can hang with villains there?

3061
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:03,740
I like that they...

3062
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:05,280
Was there anyone named Vic singing?

3063
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:07,360
Vic?

3064
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:08,200
Vic.

3065
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:09,040
Vic de Mone.

3066
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:09,880
Vic de Mone, yeah.

3067
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:10,720
Remember?

3068
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:12,000
From earlier.

3069
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:12,840
Vic from earlier.

3070
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:13,680
Vic de Mone.

3071
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:15,240
Oh, and Vic de Mone.

3072
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:16,880
I have lost track of the old time,

3073
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:19,400
we said so many old timey singer names.

3074
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:20,240
Vic Jason did that.

3075
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:23,000
And I was back thinking,

3076
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,360
does everyone on these blogs mean Phyllis McGuire

3077
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:28,840
when they keep saying Phyllis Diller?

3078
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:32,200
Another gotcha moment from Michael to Jason.

3079
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:36,720
The gotcha press has added again.

3080
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:41,280
Can we, Marco, can we just pull up,

3081
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:43,560
it's just called, I think it's just 70s contemporary.

3082
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:46,020
Can we just look at a nice photo here as we,

3083
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:49,480
cause this is the, I mean, look at that just twinkling.

3084
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:50,320
Oh yeah.

3085
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:53,440
It's early Disney World's dusk.

3086
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:56,120
A glow inside, severe on the outside,

3087
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:58,960
but warm and glowing on the inside.

3088
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:03,040
And to pull up in the monorail,

3089
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:08,040
like such comfort, such great then modern technology.

3090
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:11,600
I mean, it's a beautiful place, a calming place.

3091
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:13,680
Yeah, it is, I mean, everything is so expensive,

3092
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:14,520
but you can still, right,

3093
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:17,160
you can just get on the monorail still, yes?

3094
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:18,000
Yeah.

3095
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,080
Yes, so I just like, if you're like,

3096
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:21,120
ah, Disney's too expensive,

3097
01:52:21,120 --> 01:52:22,880
a big pain in the ass right now,

3098
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:25,840
get on that monorail and take it in at dusk.

3099
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:27,800
Drive over there.

3100
01:52:29,060 --> 01:52:30,840
Do it, go get something in the lobby.

3101
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:31,680
You can go to Mickey,

3102
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:33,840
we didn't even talk about Mickey's Kitchen.

3103
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:37,040
It's a great show, it's where I got kissed.

3104
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:38,000
What?

3105
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,320
I got kissed by Minnie at the buffet,

3106
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:41,480
at the character buffet, yeah.

3107
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:42,880
I have a picture of it.

3108
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,200
It's on my Instagram.

3109
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:45,280
I have a picture.

3110
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:48,280
Well, you got it, all right, we'll tweet that out.

3111
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:51,680
I was trying to go out on like a nice idyllic image here,

3112
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:53,160
but you have-

3113
01:52:53,160 --> 01:52:54,200
I was kissed by Minnie Mouse.

3114
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,040
Much more of one.

3115
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:56,240
The contemporary, that has nothing to do

3116
01:52:56,240 --> 01:52:58,840
with my affection for the place though, I swear to you.

3117
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:01,480
It's a nice thing, it's good, I liked it.

3118
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:04,160
You aren't just recalling, you hated it.

3119
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:05,320
You would have done a negative,

3120
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:08,720
like looks like shit stained on the outside,

3121
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:12,200
the 70s relic, what a garbage place

3122
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:13,320
is what you would have said

3123
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:15,160
until this magical kiss happened.

3124
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:19,100
Yep, and the performer made the smooch sound.

3125
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:20,180
That's the important thing,

3126
01:53:20,180 --> 01:53:24,580
is that the person inside the suit made that noise.

3127
01:53:24,580 --> 01:53:27,700
Can you add, can you do a Nixon

3128
01:53:27,700 --> 01:53:30,380
and then add a smooch to the end of it?

3129
01:53:30,380 --> 01:53:31,340
Would you- The time hole episode.

3130
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:33,060
Real Nixon or the caricature?

3131
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:34,580
Whatever way you wanna go with it.

3132
01:53:34,580 --> 01:53:36,740
Hurr, hurr, hurr, hurr, hurr, hurr, hurr, hurr, hurr,

3133
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:39,420
I am not a crook, mwah.

3134
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:41,220
Beautiful. Perfect.

3135
01:53:41,220 --> 01:53:44,140
And that's the entire history of the contemporary,

3136
01:53:44,140 --> 01:53:46,940
condensed, what a wonderful place, so fun to talk about it.

3137
01:53:46,940 --> 01:53:49,940
You survived podcast, The Ride.

3138
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:51,980
You can find us on the socials at podcast the ride.

3139
01:53:51,980 --> 01:53:55,420
I assume there'll be a photo of a mini mid-kiss

3140
01:53:55,420 --> 01:53:56,900
or just in the general vicinity of when it happened.

3141
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:59,460
I believe she's got her snoot on my head.

3142
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:03,060
I think so, I'm looking, trying to find it.

3143
01:54:03,060 --> 01:54:04,460
Oh yeah, here it is.

3144
01:54:04,460 --> 01:54:05,500
I mean, take a look.

3145
01:54:07,180 --> 01:54:09,460
This is for the sheepish face that you're-

3146
01:54:09,460 --> 01:54:10,620
Well, because I didn't really-

3147
01:54:10,620 --> 01:54:11,700
Well, well. Believe it or not,

3148
01:54:11,700 --> 01:54:14,380
I didn't really want the performer to kiss me

3149
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:16,500
getting rid of the kayfabe of the podcast.

3150
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:19,780
She also isn't, it's a little false nose.

3151
01:54:19,780 --> 01:54:23,540
But she didn't turn sideways with her mouse mouth

3152
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:24,860
and go like, woo.

3153
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:27,420
So you didn't want it, is what your reality.

3154
01:54:27,420 --> 01:54:28,260
No, I was sheepish.

3155
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:30,020
This photo, I look sheepish

3156
01:54:30,020 --> 01:54:32,300
because the performers shoving their plastic nose

3157
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:33,540
on my face when they block.

3158
01:54:33,540 --> 01:54:36,100
Get it in front of, put it in front of my camera.

3159
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:39,100
You have mouthful of eggs Benedict during this.

3160
01:54:39,100 --> 01:54:41,820
Gee, I don't know.

3161
01:54:42,780 --> 01:54:44,540
Do I look like a little stinker?

3162
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:46,140
Do I look like a little stinker in that photo?

3163
01:54:46,140 --> 01:54:46,980
Yes.

3164
01:54:46,980 --> 01:54:48,260
What's the caption also?

3165
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:49,620
I said, they're not allowed to talk,

3166
01:54:50,460 --> 01:54:52,540
but they are allowed to make a loud kiss sound effect.

3167
01:54:52,540 --> 01:54:53,780
That's what I wrote.

3168
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:55,780
May 9th, 2013.

3169
01:54:56,860 --> 01:54:57,700
Who knew?

3170
01:54:57,700 --> 01:54:59,860
You'd be talking about it for years.

3171
01:54:59,860 --> 01:55:01,780
A snoot you'd never forget.

3172
01:55:01,780 --> 01:55:02,620
That's true.

3173
01:55:02,620 --> 01:55:04,580
Merch is available in our T-Public store.

3174
01:55:04,580 --> 01:55:07,380
Perhaps a shirt that says a snoot you'll never forget.

3175
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:09,060
And for three bonus episodes every month,

3176

You can also get one more bonus episode

3179
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:18,260
on our new tier club three,

3180
01:55:18,260 --> 01:55:21,860
where I believe by now we will have the results

3181
01:55:21,860 --> 01:55:24,500
of the audience requesting to have Eva Anderson

3182
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:26,500
talk about whatever she wants.

3183
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:29,980
Do you wanna know how that panned out and what it was?

3184
01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:32,340
Oh, and you know what, Eva gave us postcards.

3185
01:55:32,340 --> 01:55:33,700
Oh yeah.

3186
01:55:33,700 --> 01:55:35,820
Marco, can you pull up that image?

3187
01:55:35,820 --> 01:55:38,020
I took a screenshot of it to put it on the screen.

3188
01:55:38,020 --> 01:55:38,940
It's the one last image.

3189
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:40,420
This is the most contemporary,

3190
01:55:40,420 --> 01:55:43,740
we got presents in this episode with Eva.

3191
01:55:43,740 --> 01:55:44,980
Why did we get them?

3192
01:55:44,980 --> 01:55:47,180
What did we do to deserve them?

3193
01:55:47,220 --> 01:55:50,660
Oh, you'll have to go to club three to find out.

3194
01:55:50,660 --> 01:55:51,500
Beautiful.

3195
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:52,340
Beautiful.

3196
01:55:52,340 --> 01:55:53,460
Both garden wings.

3197
01:55:55,940 --> 01:55:56,780
What an ending.

3198
01:55:56,780 --> 01:55:59,420
Oh, I didn't realize, I thought you were still going.

3199
01:55:59,420 --> 01:56:00,580
Both garden wings.

3200
01:56:00,580 --> 01:56:01,420
Both garden wings.

3201
01:56:01,420 --> 01:56:02,260
Ended in a fifth turn.

3202
01:56:02,260 --> 01:56:03,100
Both garden wings.

3203
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:04,220
Both garden wings.

3204
01:56:04,220 --> 01:56:06,700
That's gonna be our send off from now on.

3205
01:56:06,700 --> 01:56:08,740
Jason yelling both garden wings.

3206
01:56:08,740 --> 01:56:09,580
Forever.

3207
01:56:10,940 --> 01:56:11,980
Dog.
