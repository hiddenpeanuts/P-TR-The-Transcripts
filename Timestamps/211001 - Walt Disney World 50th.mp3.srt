1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog!

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Warning!

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,160
The following podcast contains 50 years of dream wish magic that will enchant you, workarounds

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,800
for that pesky US Constitution, and multiple members of the Nixon administration.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,320
It's the 50th anniversary of Walt Disney World, and we're looking back at its creation here

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,720
on Podcast The Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, hosted by three theme park fans who should be enjoying Disney

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,920
World's 50th birthday, but instead we're in a gigantic fight.

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,720
I'll tell you why, I'm Scott Gardner, and I think of it as 50 years of magical dreams.

11
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,880
But Jason insists that it's more like 50 years of enchanted wonder.

12
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,120
Don't even fucking look at me.

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,920
God, well this is not...

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,880
Alright, fine, we'll all turn our backs to each other, and that's how this will be did.

15
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,680
Should be joyous and fun, but I guess it won't be.

16
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,320
Mike Carlson is out of his mind.

17
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,320
He thinks that it's 50 years of wishful enchantings.

18
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,880
It is 50 years of wishful enchantings.

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,520
It's crazy to not even imagine.

20
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,360
All the enchantings that have happened over the 50 years, that's the thing that takes

21
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,360
precedent.

22
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,800
Yeah, but it's...

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,840
But I mean, the basis of so many of the rides is a dream coming true.

24
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,720
And if you want to tell me that those dreams are not magical, then we're not looking at

25
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,120
the same Disney World, I guess.

26
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,160
I guess we're not.

27
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,080
But all the different robots that have...

28
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,920
I'm trying to think of a way to say enchant singular, and it's not working again.

29
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
It doesn't.

30
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,320
It's impossible.

31
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,200
I think I'm quick sometimes on this show, but not when it comes to enchant.

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,600
No, it is a wedged word.

33
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,480
You can't enchant.

34
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:10,400
Think about all the animatronics that enchant you daily in the parks.

35
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
Enchant.

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Yeah, the ice...

37
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,240
Yeah, the contemporary resort.

38
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,520
Look at it, it will enchant you.

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,200
That's all thanks to the good people at US Steel.

40
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,400
We can all agree that US Steel is great, and thank them for all the Disney World magic.

41
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,560
I think that's where we can find common ground today.

42
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
It all feels...

43
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,320
You're right, we can settle this hedge, but with our common interest in US Steel.

44
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,320
We love US Steel.

45
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,560
Whether you're into magical dreams, enchanted wonder, or wishful enchantings, none of it

46
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,480
would be possible if it wasn't built on the back of steel.

47
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,280
Sure, they almost didn't get the two hotels open in time.

48
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,720
They promised, but they figured it out.

49
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,240
There's a lot to do.

50
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,640
We have a lot to do here.

51
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,560
We're celebrating Walt Disney World's 50th birthday, 50 years of magical dreams.

52
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,080
I'm just going to assert it.

53
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
Magical dreams, that is it.

54
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,480
And that's the only way we can move forward.

55
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
I win.

56
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,480
Yeah, and it's today.

57
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,920
It felt like we had to do...

58
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,800
As this episode is being released, October 1st, it is 2021.

59
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,640
This was 1971, of course.

60
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
Can you believe it?

61
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,680
It feels...

62
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,320
It feels insane.

63
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,640
Mainly, I'm like, oh, that's what something that's 50 years old feels like.

64
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,320
Well, then I guess a lot of music and things I'm interested in are ancient.

65
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,160
Yeah.

66
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,560
It made me...

67
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,480
That occurred to me.

68
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,040
But we should look at the positive side of it.

69
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,120
It is the 50 wonderful years.

70
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,960
Yeah, yeah.

71
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,480
You should...

72
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,240
Stop thinking about your own mortality, really, which is what this is about.

73
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,680
Don't think about that.

74
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,280
And don't think about when you first went.

75
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,200
It was only like, what, 20 years?

76
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,240
That's, I think, the weirdest, because if you like...

77
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,480
I don't know if you guys are doing this at all, remembering other anniversaries

78
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,400
and how long the amount of time seemed for a 20th or a 25th.

79
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,280
Who could even imagine that amount of years?

80
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:03,880
No.

81
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,880
When you have only barely hit two digits in your age.

82
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,840
And now 50?

83
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,720
Yeah.

84
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,000
I mean...

85
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,440
Where has the time gone?

86
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,320
Where has the time gone?

87
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,480
It's like at the blink of an eye, you know?

88
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,080
It's like, yeah, 91, it's the 20th anniversary.

89
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,240
Which one is the...

90
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,040
Is Castle Cake?

91
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,320
I've already forgotten.

92
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,840
That's for the 25th.

93
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,440
So 96.

94
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,520
That's just that.

95
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,360
25 years since the Castle Cake.

96
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,400
25 years of Disney magic.

97
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,840
25 years of Castle Cake.

98
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,960
Grab yourself a slice of memories.

99
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,280
Will Sandy Patty, the gospel singer, be back to sing a medley of the original song

100
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,200
25 Years of Disney Magic mashed up with Zippity Doo Dah?

101
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,600
In 2021.

102
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,920
I have a feeling no.

103
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,400
I have a feeling no as well.

104
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,360
I guess they've returned.

105
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,480
I think when we talk anniversaries, I start to like human...

106
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,560
What would you say?

107
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,760
Humanize the amount of time.

108
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,440
Yeah.

109
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,640
So when you say 50 years, I think of a 50 year old person.

110
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,840
And I go, well, that's sort of...

111
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,560
Look, that's on the back nine at least.

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,240
You know, that's not...

113
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,240
Even if you lived too long.

114
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,840
Sorry.

115
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,240
And you probably were over 50 for that reminder.

116
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,760
Look, we're getting there.

117
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,240
I'm just saying, like, best case, you know, now you can live to 90.

118
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,000
But still, it's like I start to think of that and go, it's an older and older person.

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,120
That's OK.

120
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,080
Nothing wrong with it.

121
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,080
But it does.

122
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,680
You do feel like, oh, OK, now we're getting serious here.

123
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,600
Well, are there...

124
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,200
Let me just look up celebrities born in October 1971,

125
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,800
because that'll be just a living manifestation.

126
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,600
Oh, my God. Snoop Dogg.

127
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,240
Oh, my God.

128
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,600
So when you look at Snoop Dogg, Snoop Dogg

129
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,280
equals...

130
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,400
That's a good example.

131
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,000
I usually...

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Disney World should be so lucky to be in Snoop Dogg shape.

133
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,360
Yeah, sure.

134
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:50,800
I...

135
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
Sacha Baron Cohen, good.

136
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,200
Winona Ryder, good.

137
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,040
There's a lot of...

138
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,240
Yeah, sure.

139
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,600
Yeah, specifically, I think October...

140
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,600
All these people are really...

141
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,680
That's the age of them.

142
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,320
Hmm. Well, that's the fact that I don't know.

143
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,480
They're all looking good for their age.

144
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,040
They all look great.

145
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,200
As are you, Disney World.

146
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,520
Yeah. I'm not worried anymore.

147
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,560
Now, Chris Kirkpatrick from Nsync.

148
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,160
That's...

149
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,320
Seventy one, really?

150
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,040
Yeah, people in Nsync are 50 years old.

151
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,760
What?

152
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,000
That doesn't seem right.

153
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,400
That can't be true.

154
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,880
Chris Kirkpatrick, he doesn't look as good.

155
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,640
He's aged prematurely from worrying for decades now that

156
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,520
he's going to get his ass kicked.

157
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,440
By Eminem.

158
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
Of course, yes.

159
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,040
Worse than those little Limp Bizkit bastards.

160
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,400
That's right. That's right.

161
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,280
Oh, yeah.

162
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,800
Wow. Seventy one. You're right.

163
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,120
Somebody in Nsync is going to be 50.

164
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,080
That's not right.

165
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,360
That doesn't...

166
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,160
Now I'm back to being upset.

167
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,960
Yeah, that was weird.

168
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,800
I was upset.

169
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,040
Now I was good.

170
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,320
Then I'm... Now I'm upset again.

171
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,120
I will say I don't think that he's like the physical specimen

172
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,000
that some of the other people in the list were.

173
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,600
Yeah.

174
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,480
But I don't look at him.

175
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,800
First of all, I don't look at him.

176
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,840
But if I end up looking at him accidentally,

177
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,200
like right now on this Wikipedia,

178
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,640
it doesn't seem... All those pictures from August 2008.

179
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,080
I don't know. I don't know what to think.

180
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,200
This Chris Kirkpatrick thing is throwing me for a loop.

181
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,640
He's at the... If we're on the same page,

182
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,840
he's on the screening of Gone Country 2 in August 2008.

183
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,920
Yeah, and I'm just distracted because of all my fond memories

184
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,400
of Gone Country 2.

185
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,000
Of course. Yeah, yeah.

186
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,400
I know.

187
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,680
It's hard to focus on him when you're thinking of one of your favorite movies.

188
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,800
Yeah, Gone Country 2.

189
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,880
I'm sorry. Oh, I mean television shows, obviously.

190
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,680
Oh, is that right?

191
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,120
Yeah, I was kidding.

192
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,960
I of course know that it's a CMT reality show.

193
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, OK.

194
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,440
With, of course, Sebastian Bach and...

195
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,400
Dee Snider.

196
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,280
Dee... Yeah, and Jermaine Jackson and Lorenzo Llama.

197
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,160
Country.

198
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,920
Oh, country stars.

199
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,040
I think that's the idea.

200
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,320
I think it's all people who are going country.

201
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,560
Right.

202
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Oh, I see.

203
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,160
And it's named after...

204
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,880
And I do like this song legitimately, an Alan Jackson song called Gone Country,

205
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,000
which is making fun of like a singer, songwriter,

206
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
something that might have been like doing a folk thing.

207
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,040
And then they decide, you know what?

208
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,040
I'm going to make some money and I'm going to go country.

209
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,760
So it's probably based...

210
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,480
Maybe that's the...

211
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,440
We got to look into Gone...

212
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,800
We have to look into this now and do a whole thing with it.

213
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,520
Obviously.

214
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,800
Sure.

215
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:12,960
Sure we do.

216
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Alan Jackson, of course, does the Five O'Clock Somewhere with Jimmy Buffett.

217
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,200
Yeah.

218
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,760
Of course.

219
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,480
Wrote that song.

220
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,280
And that's different.

221
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,760
That's not a folk singer going country.

222
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,400
That's not the target of Alan's scorn.

223
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,200
No, of course not.

224
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,160
And Alan wrote that.

225
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,520
That's Alan's song, not Jimmy.

226
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,960
He just invited Jimmy on.

227
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,600
And Jimmy's...

228
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,800
One of Jimmy's only chart topping appearances.

229
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,280
Oh, I think, yeah, maybe his biggest hit technically, yeah.

230
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,600
When he was appearing.

231
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,480
You're kidding.

232
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,560
Why haven't the charts been kinder?

233
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,160
To the song Fruitcakes?

234
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,080
To Math Sucks.

235
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,440
Didn't submit them on time.

236
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,600
Didn't submit the song for consideration on time.

237
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,800
They're on Island Time.

238
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,520
Yeah.

239
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,320
I just forgot.

240
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,960
Charts sounds like numbers to me.

241
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,760
You know what I think.

242
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,280
Get out of here, numbers.

243
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,080
Math sucks.

244
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,480
Okay, so picture Snoop Dogg in your mind.

245
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,200
Picture a lineup that's Snoop Dogg, Chris Kirkpatrick, and Walt Disney World.

246
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,440
Yeah.

247
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,160
And that is those are the faces of 50.

248
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,520
And I think they should feel good about themselves.

249
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,160
50 years.

250
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,240
First of all, before we go into the past, because I think we're going to do some talking about

251
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:25,760
how it all got started, how things were before the 50 years began, right before the clock began,

252
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,280
and how the whole place got started.

253
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,080
What do we know about what they're doing to celebrate the 50th?

254
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,320
What's happening here in 2021?

255
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,840
I can sum it up in a paragraph.

256
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,320
Go ahead.

257
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,360
A very short paragraph.

258
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,080
Okay.

259
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,040
Okay, all the weenies, all the big icons at each park have a little light show,

260
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,480
have a little lighting.

261
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,120
I saw this.

262
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,080
New lighting.

263
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,320
They're beacons of magic, of course.

264
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,200
Yeah.

265
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,400
Yeah.

266
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,840
So everything's that you mean the castle, the...

267
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,480
Tree of Life.

268
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,360
...the spaceshipers...

269
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,240
Space Earth.

270
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
...Tower of Terror and the Tree of Life are all...

271
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,640
They light up gold sometimes.

272
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,140
Yes.

273
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,680
Ratatouille is opening at Epcot.

274
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,820
Good.

275
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,280
Ride from another place.

276
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,340
Showing up.

277
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,280
And then there are 50 golden statues scattered about the parks.

278
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:19,440
And now I'm not the most religious man, but my knowledge of the Bible is that golden idols

279
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,480
usually don't end well.

280
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,480
They're all going to get struck by lightning.

281
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:24,980
Yeah.

282
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,800
They will anyway.

283
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,840
It's Florida.

284
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,040
That's true.

285
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,600
That's true.

286
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,880
I'm sure there are storms.

287
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,000
Lightning conductors?

288
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,160
Maybe that's what they're there for.

289
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,880
Lightning rods?

290
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,520
Lightning rods.

291
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,600
To keep it away from the guests.

292
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,960
So guests don't get hit by lightning.

293
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,960
So Timon gets hit and not a guest.

294
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,460
Sure.

295
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,240
Yeah.

296
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,960
Are any of them literal golden calves?

297
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,320
Are any cows...

298
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,120
Oh, oh, uh...

299
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,240
Is it Clarabelle?

300
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,000
I don't think Clarabelle.

301
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,040
I think they had the foresight to not have a literal golden calf.

302
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,400
Home on the Range characters?

303
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,520
I don't think there's a lot of Home on the Range or Brother Bear appearances.

305
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,000
Not a lot.

306
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,720
I guess the Disney cows are not that popular.

307
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,800
They don't tribute that cow with Mickey Mouse ears on the side.

308
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:07,760
Right.

309
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,160
Yeah.

310
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,240
Who I don't, despite us doing the epiz...

311
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,800
Mini Moo.

312
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,520
There it is.

313
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,000
Right, right, right.

314
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,720
Took me a second.

315
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,920
That's what I want the statues to be, is all nods to the most obscure things that we like.

316
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,360
Like Mini Moo the cow.

317
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,160
Like Leonardo Columbus, who of course led the tapestry of nations parade.

318
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,680
I mean, we'd love to see a Dream Finder, obviously.

319
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,320
Yeah, yeah.

320
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,040
We'd love to see Sandy Patty at the F.

321
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,000
The Gospel Singer.

322
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,480
The Gospel Singer.

323
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,400
Sandy Patty and Sandy Dunk.

324
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,880
Or no, Sandy Dunk is a more Disneyland celebrity, I guess.

325
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,800
I'm going to say, yeah, I don't want Sandy Dunkin.

326
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,440
I don't want a golden Sandy Dunkin anywhere.

327
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,280
I know you're upset about Sandy Dunkin, but...

328
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,780
Always.

329
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,960
They make a beacon of magic of Mini Moo's grave.

330
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,520
Does Mini Moo have a headstone over by the Fort Wilderness campground?

331
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,120
Oh wait, that's right, isn't it?

332
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,920
There is a...

333
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,280
There's a plaque at least, I think.

334
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,480
That's correct, yeah.

335
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,440
And a cow grave has to be fairly big.

336
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,600
So there's enough real estate to light it up.

337
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,480
Gold, sure.

338
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:08,980
Yeah.

339
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:09,920
Very nice.

340
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,560
They should do it.

341
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,120
They should do it.

342
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,000
They need to do it.

343
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,520
So we'll look into that too.

344
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,080
Is that where you're done with your summation of events?

345
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,200
Yeah, because Charon and Guardians were delayed at least a year

346
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,680
due to a pandemic halt of construction.

347
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,240
At least.

348
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,120
I'm being generous.

349
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,800
Yeah, who knows?

350
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,360
It's really mysterious when those things will finally get finished.

351
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,600
Scott, there is something they announced today that I'm very excited about.

352
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,080
I know.

353
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,720
You know what I'm talking about?

354
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,000
We might be thinking the same thing,

355
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,160
and I credit the Facebook group for making me aware.

356
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,480
And I feel like, is Jason maybe not aware?

357
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,560
Because you might be talking about it already.

358
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,040
I made Jason aware of this already if we're talking about the same thing.

359
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,200
Which is a food item.

360
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,720
I've gotten it a couple times, yeah.

361
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,280
Multiple people have sent this to Jason today.

362
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,400
Very good, everyone.

363
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,400
And do you want me to read it?

364
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,280
Yeah, go for it, yeah.

365
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,040
Uncle Orville's great big beautiful tomorrow Sunday.

366
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,880
Chocolate and vanilla soft serve brownie hot fudge and whipped cream

367
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,920
topped with red, white and blue sprinkles served in a bathtub.

368
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,360
A little bathtub full of ice cream.

369
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,760
This is the most Jason-y thing.

370
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,560
Clock's ticking.

371
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,320
I got a trip coming up and it might have to be my first time.

372
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,960
Where is it?

373
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,240
There was a big announcement of all these food items.

374
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,360
They do say where the things are.

375
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,520
It's at Anti-Gravity's Galactic Goodies.

376
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,800
Okay, is that in Tomorrowland?

377
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,040
Yes.

378
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,840
I believe it is, yeah.

379
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,280
I believe it's the ice cream windows that kind of connect to Merchant of Venus.

380
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,280
I think that's right.

381
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,720
I assume it's also in Tomorrowland.

382
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:38,960
Yes.

383
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,640
Look, the acknowledge has to stop somewhere.

384
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,160
I don't know the shop names.

385
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,800
I'm sorry.

386
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,800
I'll try to.

387
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,520
We'll come up with some awful reason to have to learn them.

388
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,120
I wild away precious hours of my youth at Merchant of Venus.

389
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,520
It used to be the shop for Alien Encounter.

390
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,000
Jason's wild youth at Merchant of Venus.

391
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,160
Crazy stuff.

392
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,040
No, wild.

393
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,080
W-I-L-E.

394
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:01,600
Oh.

395
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,720
Wild.

396
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,200
Wild.

397
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,760
But wild.

398
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,560
It was wild, I'm saying.

399
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,520
Oh, it was wild.

400
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,640
Yeah, absolutely.

401
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,200
Yeah.

402
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,720
There used to only be two places.

403
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,560
The whole property, you could buy Star Wars stuff.

404
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,600
MGM Studios and Merchant of Venus.

405
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,040
Can you imagine?

406
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,320
No, I can't.

407
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,360
Well, then a lot of magical dreams have come true.

408
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:19,760
Yeah.

409
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,680
Make that much more, it's everywhere.

410
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,480
It's everywhere now.

411
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,560
So that's good.

412
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:34,720
There was an entire block of snack announcements, many of which seem bizarre and disgusting to me.

413
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,040
Yeah.

414
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,040
The one that jumped out, I have the tab open, is the Mission to Mars.

415
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,200
There's all these snacks that tribute things that aren't there anymore, classic things.

416
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,600
And Mission to Mars, this extinct attraction.

417
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,000
What do we think here?

418
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,200
It's up in the upper right.

419
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,800
Burger topped with bacon and macaroni and cheese.

420
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,600
Sure.

421
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,040
On a bun dusted with crushed cheese flavor puffs.

422
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,920
It just seems like to hold it.

423
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,000
You're asking for trouble.

424
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,200
You know, here's my thing with that.

425
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,400
Obviously, that's one of those like fun, we're enjoying the excess, we're going to pile stuff on.

426
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,280
I will say that generally with Disney World Fast Service,

427
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,320
I'm not so sure they'll nail that, if that makes sense.

428
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,480
The best you're ever going to see it is in this photo.

429
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:20,720
Yeah.

430
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,280
Oh, yeah.

431
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,080
They posted.

432
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,400
Yeah.

433
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,280
So when they get, I could imagine like a different place, maybe going like, you know what?

434
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,240
It's pretty gross, but it's fun to eat that once in a while.

435
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,200
But I don't know, a Disney World hamburger with a lot of, I don't know.

436
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:41,360
Yeah, I don't, I think part of it is a lot of the food items like this are for Instagram.

437
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,960
Well, yes, yes.

438
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,360
And some of them, like Scott and myself and Griffin all tried the big chicken sandwich

439
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,520
when we were down at Disneyland for the day and enjoyed it.

440
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,440
Griffin got the peanut butter and sandwich with bacon.

441
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,560
That seemed like bad news.

442
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,680
Yeah, but you and I both like the chicken sandwich.

443
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,160
I did.

444
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,960
Yeah.

445
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,080
You just need a strategy.

446
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,440
You have to go in with a strategy.

447
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,320
You got a knife and fork, at least I had a knife and forked it for a while.

448
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,880
Right.

449
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,720
Winnowing it down until it was a slider.

450
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
A manageable, yeah, slider sandwich.

451
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,840
Do we talk about how then the person came up to take our trays and said,

452
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,760
are you finished with your experiments?

453
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,120
No, but I forgot about that.

454
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,920
I like that.

455
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,400
We were all questioning, do we like this?

456
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,840
Because it's all over the map.

457
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,760
We liked our thing, but it was kind of difficult.

458
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,240
Griffin was maybe on this, maybe didn't dig what he was eating.

459
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,320
And then that, are you finished with your experiments?

460
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
All right, sealed the deal.

461
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,520
This place is good.

462
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,120
Just with that one line.

463
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,120
Yeah, that is good.

464
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,040
A Disney-fied language for taking your trash away.

465
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,760
That's great.

466
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,320
Love it.

467
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,120
You know what?

468
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,240
We didn't talk about this either.

469
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,080
We were back in Galaxy's Edge and someone was still doing the

470
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,000
cave fabe of it in Dock Andar, where I had a country bear shirt on.

471
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,680
And she was like, ah, what is that creature on your shirt?

472
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,800
And I was like, oh, well, it's a bear that does a show.

473
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,160
She's like, ah, yes, he has some sort of instrument.

474
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,840
Or and I was like, yes, he does.

475
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,080
And then I was like, I asked the question about the lightsaber.

476
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,040
And they're like, ah, the Galactic Federate.

477
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,440
There's a slowdown in the shipping of the galactic freight.

478
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:22,800
And we don't have the master Skywalker's lightsaber in stock right now.

479
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,560
And I was like, hey, OK.

480
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,040
And I was like, I was trying to play along a little bit.

481
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,040
I was very tired at the end of the night, but I was like, oh, good.

482
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,840
Somebody's still doing it.

483
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,440
Because even opening day, it felt like people were over that.

484
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,160
Begrudging.

485
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

486
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,320
Quick to go.

487
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,600
That's all fun, though.

488
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,880
Yeah, I know. I liked it a lot.

489
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,560
I guess there aren't bears in Star Wars.

490
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,920
I never thought about it before.

491
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,720
Yeah, there's not.

492
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,280
Yeah.

493
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,760
Things that look kind of like bears, but not bears.

494
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,080
But they're missing it.

495
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,520
Somebody should get some bears.

496
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,960
Eventually there will be bears.

497
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,440
Yeah.

498
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,880
Ship of bears should crash land next season on the Mandalorian.

499
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,440
I am hoping when I order that ice cream Sunday that I will order it.

500
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,920
And in addition to calling out my name that it's ready,

501
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,560
they will scream no privacy at all around here.

502
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,280
At the very least, you can do it.

503
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,800
Yeah, I certainly will.

504
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,440
And then raised it up so people knew why you were doing it.

505
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,880
You could get a big applause.

506
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,440
Yeah.

507
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,080
Could you bring it?

508
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,960
Yeah, you should bring it on the actual show ride.

509
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Could you eat the Sunday in the theater?

510
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,600
It's kind of a crapshoot with a lot of theme parks, food or drink, you know, sort of thing.

511
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,760
You could smuggle it in your sweatshirt.

512
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,200
I mean, yeah, that would certainly be progress for me having a great time.

513
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,320
I mean, yeah, then he could see the tub and then hold up the tub to the tub.

514
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:40,640
Yeah.

515
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,360
That's worth waiting 12 minutes to eat the ice cream.

516
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,560
Eat the melting ice cream.

517
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,280
If the show's not ready to go right when you walk up to it.

518
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,840
The brownie will inevitably only get staler.

519
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,040
I'd like to see you have one of these a day and try different places to eat it.

520
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,440
One on the People Mover, one in Carousel of Progress.

521
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,480
Yeah, look, there's a lot of sweets to cover in.

522
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,520
Yeah, you're right.

523
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,400
Scott's got a list of more things, I assume.

524
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,520
There are more.

525
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,800
While we're on it, I just want to say the thing I'd maybe like to see,

526
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,240
and you don't even have to unless you want to give a photo for this to be done with,

527
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,920
but just a picture of you shrunk down bathing in the tub.

528
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,280
Oh, wow.

529
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,560
Oh, yeah.

530
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,680
Well, I'm not the most Photoshop savvy, so I can provide the elements

531
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,560
and if someone could make the new creation.

532
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,960
You know, you probably could do is just put the Sunday with the bathtub on a table

533
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,120
and have somebody who you're with.

534
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,960
You try to get like a forced perspective where you're far away in the distance.

535
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,240
So it looks like your head is just poking out of the bathtub.

536
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,120
You could do probably a very simple version like that.

537
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,920
That's more up.

538
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,600
Yeah, I like a practical solution.

539
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,400
It's more of my speed.

540
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,920
We love practical effects here.

541
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,880
We always talk about that.

542
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,760
And that's what this is.

543
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,440
This is not CGI.

544
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,360
This is practical.

545
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,200
This is the way that special effects should be done.

546
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,360
So that's good.

547
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:03,840
Yeah, yeah.

548
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,000
But I'm not going to say if somebody wants to do that.

549
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,400
Sure.

550
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,920
OK, don't do it.

551
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,600
And if Jason wants to do a little pose of like arms up behind the head, like, ah.

552
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:13,920
Yeah.

553
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,480
Yeah.

554
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,960
I mean, they should sell like the big Uncle Sam red, white and blue hat.

555
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,120
Like that feels like they're leaving money on the table,

556
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,840
not making more exclusive like Carousel of Progress based more Uncle Orville.

557
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,240
Well, all of them, all of them.

558
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
The mysterious disappearing child,

559
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,800
like a shirt about like, where did the third child go?

560
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,840
You know, they are leaving money on the table.

561
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,760
You can use that phrase even if the money is only like forty two dollars.

562
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:40,720
Yeah.

563
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,760
Are leaving the forty dollars on two dollars of my money.

564
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,640
Yeah, it would be yours.

565
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:44,880
Yeah.

566
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,380
Yeah.

567
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,520
The wall we've got money on.

568
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,840
We've talked before about having the John collection,

569
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,280
the clothing John wears through the through the eras.

570
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,080
And then he would you would buy all of them.

571
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,440
There's one pretty funny piece of Carousel of Progress merch,

572
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,840
and it's a vinyl mation, but it's the Mickey or vinyl mation one.

573
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,080
Yeah.

574
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,120
And it's John like wearing all four outfits like at once, like he's split in the fours.

575
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,680
And I do respect the attempt, but like it's not the prettiest looking like toy.

576
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,160
No, the vinyl mations with the Mickey shape are already sort of unappealing looking.

577
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,480
Yeah.

578
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:20,800
Yeah.

579
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,080
To make it weird.

580
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,120
A bunch of those.

581
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,560
That's like if the Johns from all the eras from the 20s and the 40s and all of them, like all

582
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,560
like collided in some temporal catastrophe.

583
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,520
Like the thing.

584
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:33,760
Yeah.

585
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,600
Like people kind of go so hard by the thing.

586
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,240
They all tried to show up at the same era.

587
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,040
They got these things, time machines now,

588
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,080
and they all tried it at the same time and landed in the same spot.

589
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,680
And we all say like they all say, kill me now.

590
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,080
This is painful.

591
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,040
I don't want to live.

592
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,200
You have no idea the pain it is to exist like this.

593
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,760
I ruled that electricity now more than ever.

594
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,560
Oh boy.

595
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,560
A great segue into the experimental prototype community of tomorrow.

596
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,120
Yeah.

597
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,680
Yeah.

598
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,720
I mean, yeah, let's let's get into let's let's let's go backwards.

599
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,440
Let's say this carousel of progress can turn back to 1971.

600
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,920
You know, this was Walt's dream and just like the carousel of progress and it was a crazy

601
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,760
dream and had he lived, who knows what he would have done.

602
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,920
Who knows what bizarre tendrils the dream knows what sort of Howard Hughes living on

603
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,880
top of a casino we could have seen Walt Disney do.

604
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,720
It's something in reflecting on the 50 years and on Walt's relationship to the place,

605
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,000
which just to reiterate, if you don't know the timeline, Disney World opens in 71.

606
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,400
Walt Disney dies in 1966.

607
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,720
He was alive for the some of the planning.

608
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,480
It was it was all his dream.

609
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,720
He wanted to buy Florida land and do something there.

610
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,280
And it was it was kind of this ultimate vision.

611
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:07,120
This like, you know, Disneyland times 100 and just that he didn't that he didn't overlap

612
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,440
with it.

613
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,240
He never got to go there.

614
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,640
And I've just thought about how this felt like Walt getting one in at the buzzer, you

615
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,160
know, the fact that he's making movies about it and talking about it, essentially on his

616
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,720
deathbed.

617
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,400
I learned literally on his deathbed.

618
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,080
It's one of the last things he was talking about.

619
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,960
I mean, how many people like did something this significant right before their death?

620
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,800
Yeah, it's a good question.

621
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,440
I don't know.

622
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,200
Yeah, it does feel right, right at the last second.

623
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,960
We've got David Bowie album, Lazarus or whatever it's called.

624
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,880
Yeah, yeah, I haven't really heard it.

625
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,160
I like David Bowie a lot.

626
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,640
I didn't really hear it, but I like that it happened.

627
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,120
It's sad.

628
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,160
Covering with me.

629
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,360
I think I saw a music video.

630
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,400
It makes me sad.

631
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,960
I came up on my shuffle a couple of days ago, one of the songs and I go too sad and I turned

632
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,680
it off.

633
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,240
Part of it.

634
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:00,560
Yes.

635
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:00,800
Yeah.

636
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,280
Yeah.

637
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,400
The right down to the wire.

638
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,480
It's not like weird and like tin machine bad or anything.

639
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:06,960
No, no, no.

640
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,680
Not the worst.

641
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,080
But yeah, he took care of the worst decades.

642
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,400
Yeah.

643
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:10,880
Yeah.

644
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,680
But sometimes.

645
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,720
Yeah, I'm never in the mood to hear his death album.

646
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,720
Yeah, makes sense.

647
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,200
Well, then and how often is that the case for your Johnny Cash's?

648
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,600
Yeah.

649
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,200
When Campbell's who will come up in a little bit that they're making these sad warrens.

650
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,600
Yvonne.

651
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,480
Warren's Yvonne.

652
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,960
Walt Disney, though, gave us the right before he went out, gave us the place that's given

653
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,280
us all the joy, the most joy.

654
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,960
It's why we're all here.

655
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,120
It's why I know you guys.

656
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,040
It's why everyone's listening to us.

657
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,840
Thank you, Walt.

658
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,360
Let's just give Walter a big thank you wherever you are.

659
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,840
Thank you.

660
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:53,360
We do have to mention begrudgingly gave us the East Coast Disneyland as it was all been called.

661
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:53,920
OK, yeah.

662
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:02,160
Because his real passion project was the experimental prototype community of tomorrow,

663
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,400
the original Epcot.

664
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,760
Progress City.

665
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,160
Progress City.

666
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:12,160
Thank you, Walt, for inadvertently giving or like kind of just begrudgingly giving us

667
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,720
Disney World because you wanted to be the king of a city.

668
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,040
Yes.

669
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,320
So I was curious because I know little bits in peace.

670
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:28,720
I watched the Epcot like one hour presentation a while ago,

671
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,360
but I wanted to look up more stuff about Progress City.

672
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,200
So I got this book from the library.

673
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,280
It's another Sam Genoway book called Walt in the Promise of Progress City.

674
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,480
You got a tabbed up book here.

675
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,280
I got a tabbed up.

676
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,320
A book on our hands.

677
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:50,880
And also the book, I believe also a reference point for there's a very good Defunctland episode

678
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,920
about Progress City.

679
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,400
Oh, yeah.

680
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,520
And I read the Progress City, like the main chapter about it in this book,

681
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,080
and I stopped because it was giving me the Willys.

682
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,880
Whoa.

683
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,160
Wow.

684
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:10,880
Because I mean, like less Willie giving is the first quote I came across.

685
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,120
How much Willie giving can you take?

686
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,200
Well, I mean, I got to brace my it is the season for it.

687
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
It's the scary season.

688
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,920
Well, and this is the you notice it's October and the next week,

689
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,600
maybe we start giving you the Willys.

690
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,720
Yeah, that's true.

691
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,600
So watch out if you hate Willys.

692
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,080
Because if you hate Willys, watch out.

693
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,080
Do you think we should save some of it because we want to do a full

694
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,000
walkthrough of the Epcot special.

695
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,800
Do you think we should save some of the progress?

696
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,360
City stuff.

697
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,800
So we'll touch on it.

698
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,520
Really, it's it is interesting.

699
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,800
It's really in depth.

700
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,760
But the funniest thing, if you follow the threads back long enough to

701
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:57,680
the genesis of Disney World, there's a quote in this chapter that is kind of

702
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,080
like a very early touchstone.

703
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,680
And it says Walt Disney said, I don't believe there's a challenge anywhere

704
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,440
in the world that's more important to people everywhere than finding

705
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,160
solutions to the problems of our cities.

706
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,960
Now, that's a very boring sentence.

707
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:21,920
And but clearly kept this man up at night because Walt just hated what

708
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,320
cities had become like it were just overwhelming.

709
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,400
He especially hated traffic despite the fact that he was a man who

710
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:37,440
constantly worked with automobile companies and built his studio in the suburbs of Los Angeles.

711
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,600
I think Jimmy Buffett hate I hate traffic, too.

712
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,800
Don't you hate it when you can't get a place fast?

713
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,680
You know, I hate to pit them against each other, but Jimmy Buffett has he's about

714
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,600
reinventing lifestyle, too.

715
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,440
And he has a brand of physical properties and there's a lot more of those than there

716
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,880
are Disney places.

717
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,000
You know, that's true.

718
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,280
We're talking sheer numbers.

719
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,600
Yeah, he's lived longer, too.

720
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,320
And might be immortal.

721
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:02,720
We'll see.

722
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,240
But like everyone was very complimentary to like the urban planning that kind of went

723
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,240
into the genesis of Disneyland to the point that like Ray Bradbury, the author, a close

724
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:20,240
friend of Walt's suggested he run for mayor of Los Angeles to like get stuff done.

725
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:27,040
And then Walt said, why would I run for mayor when I am already king?

726
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,840
So I know that's kind of a joke, but also you can tell.

727
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,840
You can tell it's kind of not.

728
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,040
Yeah, yeah, half and half.

729
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,000
Yeah, complex.

730
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,640
Sure.

731
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,760
If you made it that far and you and there was something as risky as Disneyland and it

732
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,680
worked and worked spectacularly and everybody's telling you how well it's working.

733
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,240
It's what I was.

734
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,640
We were talking about earlier or some other episode where it's like there's obviously

735
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,600
a pattern for like major success when you're like in a company and it's like a major success

736
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,480
and you become very, very rich and well known.

737
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,720
You start to like set your sights on something that feels like it's way out of what you

738
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,800
started like Jeff Bezos wanted to just like destroy small bookstores and make a lot of

739
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,760
money and figure out a way to like ship people things fast.

740
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,760
And then all of a sudden he's going to be a moon man.

741
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,160
He's going to be a Mars traveler.

742
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,360
And you're like, wait a minute, that's not.

743
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,080
And Walt Disney's like, I wanted to put sound with cartoons.

744
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,440
Also, I want to fix cities, cities need fixing.

745
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,080
And you're like, huh?

746
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:31,280
Why don't you want you make robots, you make robots for us to look at.

747
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:37,280
But he aims way bigger and then the company doesn't know what to do after he dies.

748
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:37,840
Exactly.

749
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,080
They come up short and we just get a new theme park place and that's great.

750
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,760
So and maybe better.

751
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,640
Yes.

752
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,040
Yeah.

753
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,920
I think so.

754
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,320
I don't know.

755
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:46,400
Yeah.

756
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,720
What state would progress city be in today?

757
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,400
It could be really weird.

758
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,880
Well, I mean, look at the look at the states of the other municipalities they built.

759
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,920
Toontown looks like shit.

760
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,160
They haven't painted that thing in years.

761
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,840
They're demolishing it in front of the guests.

762
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,920
They're demolishing it right in front of our eyes.

763
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,800
It's clearly rife with divorce and missing people and stuff.

764
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,280
There's private investigators popping up all over the place.

765
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,400
Everyone's rushing to become a private investigator.

766
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,200
That's what's happening.

767
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,840
No one wants to be a building painter or a bricklayer.

768
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,840
A five and dime.

769
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,720
They got rid of it.

770
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,280
Yeah.

771
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:19,600
Right.

772
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,040
All over the place.

773
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,000
Factory worker.

774
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,560
But it is fascinating because, yeah, as a kid,

775
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,120
and then, of course, Walt wanted to build another park.

776
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,880
It's cool, too.

777
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,200
Sure.

778
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,400
You don't know about any of this.

779
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,880
Right.

780
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,640
This is very strange.

781
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,840
But yeah, it is interesting.

782
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,120
Yeah, I'm trying to think where to start on my end or where to throw it.

783
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:45,680
I know that obviously with Disneyland's success, there's the desire to do another one.

784
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,960
People are telling him that east of the Mississippi is a whole other world

785
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,360
that you are not really taking advantage of.

786
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,120
There's less flight at the time.

787
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,880
Probably most Disneyland guests come via driving.

788
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:05,200
And there's maybe the desire to, well, if we put something over on the other side of the country

789
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,040
and that's accessed via driving, maybe we get a whole other crowd.

790
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,320
So he's scouting places in the late 50s and early 60s.

791
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,400
And I didn't know some of this stuff, like where he was looking.

792
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:18,880
Yeah.

793
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,280
Yeah.

794
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:25,280
That Niagara Falls was a possibility, which today is like trashy tourist insanity.

795
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,600
And it's pretty, it makes a lot of sense that just thematically that you could end up there.

796
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,760
But I think, you know, weather is a roadblock for a lot of these places.

797
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,560
I saw a story about St. Louis.

798
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,440
Yes, I saw that, too.

799
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,160
Being on the table.

800
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:42,560
It was called, what was, Walt Disney's Riverfront Square.

801
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,240
Well, that was the indoor one.

802
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:44,400
Oh, yes.

803
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,000
They were going to build a giant multi-block like indoor theme park.

804
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,320
Wow.

805
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,720
Right. But that was before that was before Disney World as well.

806
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,280
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

807
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:51,760
Yeah. Yeah.

808
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,000
Okay.

809
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,040
Oh, wait. Now that wait. Yeah. I caught a little.

810
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:00,000
There's some attraction that was maybe repurposed from that.

811
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,120
Does that ring a bell?

812
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,960
Like, yeah, what ended up getting built that was there were Disney World originals came from.

813
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,840
It was going to maybe Hall of Presidents could be.

814
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,520
I mean, that's obviously an extension of great moments of Mr. Lincoln.

815
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,720
But like the Country Bears was an opening day attraction.

816
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,880
So happy 50 years, Country Bears.

817
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,680
We'll get to you soon.

818
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,880
But that like that was for that weird resort Mineral.

819
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,520
Mineral King.

820
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,000
Yeah.

821
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,160
Yeah.

822
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,600
Do so.

823
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,880
There were all these oddball plants.

824
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,720
I also want to say Disney opened up a bowling alley in Denver.

825
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,800
I barely caught this.

826
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,760
I don't know much about it, but that didn't really satisfy anybody.

827
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,120
And they didn't really embrace the name.

828
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,600
They didn't say definitively this is Disney's bowling alley because it wasn't really good enough.

829
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,720
And didn't do well enough.

830
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,680
I missed that.

831
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,040
That was just like one sentence.

832
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,320
And I looked at a book, too.

833
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,360
I looked at a book called Reality Land with David Koenig.

834
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:51,920
Yeah, maybe.

835
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,160
Yeah.

836
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,880
St. Louis.

837
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,240
Do you know more about that place?

838
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:56,720
Because I don't.

839
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,360
Well, I have some notes about this from one of these articles.

840
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,840
The only thing I saw about it is that he was getting down the road a little bit.

841
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,560
But if you're going to be in St. Louis, you're going to have to deal with Bush at some point.

842
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:21,120
Like the Bush family, the beer and the head of the Bush family told Walt he was crazy to build a theme

843
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,520
park in St. Louis and not sell beer.

844
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,080
Right.

845
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,000
And thus he cut off the negotiations.

846
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,840
I will not have be I guess he I make fun of this whole we got to trust Walt's wishes and not have

847
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,480
beer in the park.

848
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:41,680
But I guess if that's where he was at in the 50s, how dare you, Bush, give me a revenue stream,

849
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,280
a constant giant revenue stream for the park I want to build?

850
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,000
It does seem like there was a lot of conflict in the man about the image of Uncle Walt and the

851
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,840
family friendliness and the clean, no smoking, no drinking sort of thing.

852
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:04,800
And then the Walt who has to live his life and go about his life and drinks scotch and smokes

853
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,680
Chesterfields.

854
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:06,960
Yeah.

855
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,280
Yeah.

856
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,080
Which he like it's funny if he was that protective about it because I don't get the sense that he

857
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,440
was like a drunk.

858
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,800
Right.

859
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,920
Am I wrong?

860
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:21,040
I feel like he just like did what anybody of that age in that time would have done.

861
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,200
I don't there's not a lot of I don't I haven't seen a ton of documentation of like and then like

862
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,400
Walt had to be escorted out of the tam o' shanter or anything like yeah it seemed like it was just

863
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,560
one video with that.

864
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:39,760
It's only there was TMZ back then eight millimeter cameras running separate sync sound off a

865
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,880
different little pack.

866
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,640
Walt like shirtless across the street where the party city is now just like screaming

867
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,880
you let me back in there I'm Dopey's father.

868
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,200
I'm a Dopey.

869
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,960
I'm the king of party city.

870
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,120
That's where they got the phrase from.

871
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,400
That's what the brand is named after.

872
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:56,880
Wow.

873
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,920
Just yelled it one day.

874
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,480
So yeah I don't know I've never seen anything.

875
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,200
Yeah he was just as drunk as every other older man of the time probably I guess.

876
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,480
I think I don't know weird though.

877
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,080
What you got anything else about that St. Louis?

878
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,440
Well the St. Louis thing I think there's a couple like legends because like what the

879
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,440
beer thing is one thing but then there also I think was a report that it was basically

880
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,120
Disney was going to pay for the rides and attractions but they wanted St. Louis to pay

881
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,120
for the building itself and then they St. Louis didn't want to do it.

882
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:31,520
St. Louis redevelopment the corporation and then declined to pay for the building so Disney

883
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,160
was like we're out.

884
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,680
They're always looking for like.

885
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,600
Classic yeah they want other people to pay for stuff they want to pay for everything.

886
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,720
Eventually that happens in Orlando we're like okay we'll do it but we want roads widened

887
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,760
and we want to be able to govern however we want and change the structure of a city's work.

888
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,840
We want the laws we want to make the laws here.

889
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,160
So yeah.

890
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,240
So they don't go to any of those places and they end up in they start ending up in Florida.

891
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:04,400
I think Walt realizes there's a lot of property there and that it's maybe kind of cheap there

892
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,800
and it is like considered this vacation place and people are retiring there.

893
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,600
He determines he doesn't want to be on the coasts because he doesn't want to deal with

894
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:20,240
hurricanes and he doesn't want people in the park in bathing suits.

895
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,920
There's another little morality.

896
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,280
Well he didn't get that wish.

897
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,160
You know I don't look Walt there's a lot of he's a problematic figure in some ways he's

898
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,640
a great figure in some ways but I can really get on board with this no bathing suit policy.

899
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,720
Can really appreciate that I like to keep that keep that clean.

900
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,240
And had some good ideas.

901
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:46,240
Yeah yeah that was natural you know disasters and weather patterns also like made him not go

902
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,440
with like New York or New Jersey DC Baltimore areas because the park would have to be seasonal

903
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,720
and closed part of the year.

904
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,480
Oh yeah which almost everything is we've talked about parks there but that's pretty much the

905
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,720
deal I gather from great adventure and those kind of things.

906
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,920
Yeah I think as the years have gone on more and more stuff have

907
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:10,720
invested in Halloween and Christmas endeavors but very limited usually not seven days a week.

908
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,120
And then maybe February is a bust.

909
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,000
Right.

910
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,320
Yeah.

911
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,360
They just don't do anything.

912
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:24,480
So they they settle on this plot of land that is pretty much swamp.

913
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,040
I think he also didn't want to like kill off a bunch of orange groves and I think he just

914
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,160
sensed that people would not be willing to get rid of orange groves because that's the pride of

915
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,600
Florida.

916
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,960
So we end up with this land that is not a lot.

917
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,440
One fact I learned from this book Reality Land is that there was a helicopter trip where

918
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,800
they went and saw the site and he said I think that's it.

919
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,600
That's the site.

920
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:51,120
The helicopter stopped to refuel and they people got out and heard the radio and heard on the radio

921
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,600
that JFK had been assassinated.

922
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,800
I have that too.

923
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,640
That freaked my shit out.

924
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:04,240
I was so like it wasn't until they landed in New Orleans later that day that supposedly that they

925
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,040
they heard the radio that JFK had been killed.

926
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,160
Geez blissfully only people unaware.

927
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,920
Little helicopter bubble of happiness.

928
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,520
That was his first time seeing the Florida property in person that day.

929
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,600
That's a weird confluence of stuff.

930
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,800
That's that's pretty nuts.

931
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,680
Yeah that is crazy.

932
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:31,360
And which I've seen at least the book I was reading or articles are sort of like it was a sign more

933
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:36,240
than ever that Waltz needed to forge ahead with his vision of a new better America.

934
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:36,800
Like I don't know.

935
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,640
I think that's random.

936
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,240
I think I don't know that it was like this is the end of an era and I need to be the person to take

937
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:44,800
us out.

938
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,000
I need to reverse the brain of this president being blown up.

939
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,080
It's only I can do it.

940
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:56,800
The narratives not just of the 50 years of Disney World but the creation of it and the

941
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,960
shifting narratives of not just what they were going to do and how they set out to do it and

942
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,320
most than the biggest now after 50 years what Walt intended to do are wild.

943
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,080
Like if you try to find a straight line you are not going to find it.

944
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,000
I found another book that there's a book called Walt Disney World the first decade.

945
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,360
It's a big coffee table book.

946
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,680
You can find it very easily very cheap on eBay.

947
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,560
I have that I think.

948
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:27,840
And yeah and it's you can borrow it from the internet archive like an hour at a time from

949
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:34,560
their digital archive and in the introduction to that they are already 10 years later erasing

950
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,240
the narrative about progress city.

951
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:42,400
There is this the slightest mention of it and then they're like but of course you know we wanted a

952
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,000
vacation place for children of the vacation kingdom of the world like they the narrative is

953
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,200
already shifting by the time Epcot the park is built.

954
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,680
Yeah of course.

955
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,880
Mostly water skiing.

956
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,320
That's mainly what it was about.

957
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:54,820
Yeah.

958
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,320
Leisure.

959
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,000
A leisure place.

960
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,720
Yeah the myth that I mean I guess it makes sense because like you're not going to put in the book

961
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:09,120
like and then this mad man decided to build a city but we decided no that's silly.

962
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,680
So we gave you figment and then or whenever figment opens.

963
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,180
Yeah.

964
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:22,000
But yeah I get I mean all this all this yeah the the cartoon character of Walt is a very

965
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,120
it's still I'm trying to think like we were just talking about Walter not which is funny

966
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,360
that he's being drawn he's at Knott's Berry Farm because there's a lot of crazy stuff about

967
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,240
him but no one's paying any attention so but you can still buy a little Walter not

968
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,720
like a little Walter not character.

969
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,160
I don't know if you can buy it or can you?

970
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,720
Oh I thought that's what you said I thought it was a piece of merch.

971
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,760
No there's like a bust in the but that's in the weird that that's in the independence hall.

972
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,800
I thought they were selling it.

973
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,440
Weird thing.

974
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:58,160
The there's a funny thing there which is there's like there's like some general like political

975
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,000
stuff like here's you know you can buy little postcards of all the presidents up through

976
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,480
Clinton when this series stopped being made or you know just a little patriotic even just like

977
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,560
sparkly USA or whatever but one thing Aaron noticed was a like a big plush area with red

978
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:21,120
white and blue stuffed animals and there were plush donkeys and plush elephants and actually

979
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:25,760
I think I phrased that wrong because there were a lot of plush donkeys and they spot for plush

980
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,840
elephants and there were zero they were a long sold out.

981
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,960
Oh okay got it.

982
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:38,080
So if you're a democrat pursuing the independence hall in Buena Park plenty of donkeys for you

983
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,960
but if you're if you're raising a young republican who you want to give an elephant to.

984
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,200
It makes sense it makes sense because you're going to Buena Park you really have to be looking

985
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,960
out for independence hall it's not right in the in the action.

986
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,680
Yeah.

987
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,040
So no you gotta like yeah it's it's this weird if you don't know knots yeah it's like across

988
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,280
the you have to go through a tunnel across the street and end up at a perfect recreation of

989
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,640
I still independence hall.

990
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,880
Couldn't quite explain how to get there I know vaguely where it is but don't take my word for

991
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,040
it like I wouldn't be able to direct you I don't think.

992
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,920
You're going through secret passageways like turn Washington spies themselves.

993
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,040
You want to feel like you're living in turn.

994
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,960
But speaking of of secrecy and kind of doing things on the slide and this is some of the stuff I

995
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:31,120
wanted to talk about so I mean yeah there's the progress city plans but he there's you know I

996
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,520
think there's a lot of stuff that Disney wants to do there he's not even sure what he even says

997
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,440
that's by enough space to hold all the dreams that haven't even been dreamed yet.

998
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:46,400
But the the main thing it was what Disney is still fighting all the time in Anaheim in

999
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,800
California which is which is space and the fact that they bought because it was such a crazy

1000
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,240
plan Disneyland so they bought what they could and as soon as Disneyland was open and working

1001
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:04,720
lots of shady stuff popped up on the outskirts and that's the thing I you know now I feel like

1002
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,720
yeah it feels shady around there and there's your like but I feel like it's mainly like

1003
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,280
yeah we're cheap of hotels I do wonder it seemed like it was like much shadier maybe in the 50s

1004
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:22,400
60s like way more low rent yeah yeah or just like odd opportunistic weird dirty shitty places

1005
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,920
charging too much money I don't really know yeah I mean it's hard to say I think there was a lot

1006
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:34,560
more motel kind of things but I think there was a lot more hotel motel places everywhere and a lot

1007
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,680
of the older pictures have like featuring a cocktail lounge with the singer Mickey Harry

1008
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:47,120
like you know there was just an expectation of like roadside motel and like stuff to do yeah more

1009
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:52,400
chain hotel stuff there now I would imagine that that real estate people would eventually be

1010
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:58,240
were getting bought out by bigger places yeah over the years so even in the last 10 years I feel

1011
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:05,600
like there's been a lot more like suite hotels or like right mid-range hotel like nicer mid-range

1012
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:10,480
hotels kind of popping up I wonder if anyone has it that would be fascinating to know what businesses

1013
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:16,000
were on that street for the first 10-20 years that really would be fascinating cruddy shit that

1014
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,400
opened up around Disney yeah or was there anything cool like who not like maybe well there was I

1015
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,920
think in some episode I discovered there was a Nixon's hamburgers yes yes exactly Nixon

1016
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:33,360
had a hamburger place his brother what was he yeah so that sounds good I don't know so you

1017
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:39,120
can't hate on Nixon burgers but no no you but mainly he just didn't want that probably he

1018
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,960
wanted like he didn't want it to be that there is your magic kingdom here and then as soon as you

1019
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,920
walk outside of it there's a bunch of nuisance stuff and stuff that where they have to regulate

1020
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,640
the height lines and it might intrude on the park visually he doesn't want any of that he wants pure

1021
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:59,360
wilderness around him so I like that he doesn't go let's buy twice the space he buys it's like

1022
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:06,000
125 times it's something so crazy yeah well I'm making that up no I'll tell you what it is it's

1023
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:13,040
twice the size of the island of Manhattan a line that everyone from the book publication people to

1024
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:20,320
the uh celebrity guests on that opening day uh special yeah have been told to say yeah that's

1025
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,600
in there a lot there's some like uh you know some listeners might be hearing some of this early

1026
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,920
Disney World stuff for the first time or you're hearing certain elements of it for the 100th time

1027
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:36,800
and uh I was watching the 15th anniversary special uh with Aaron my wife who at some point said like

1028
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,920
how many more times do I have to see him in front of this fucking map I've seen so much footage of

1029
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:48,720
Walden the big map yeah pointing and it's the drears size and choice vanattans and 24 man look

1030
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:54,880
at me I'm just five miles tall and I they do they use this stuff a lot and probably as she

1031
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,680
intuited because it's some of the only footage of him associated with the Disney World there's not

1032
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,400
a lot marrying him to the place because he didn't really get to be involved right there's no he's

1033
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,680
not walking walking those streets or anything yeah yeah nope no pictures like that uh so he

1034
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:16,160
wants to buy up all of this land uh but if he does it it's gonna raise red flags and the land value

1035
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:22,480
is going to skyrocket uh and he's it's gonna be anaheim all over again so he has to invent all of

1036
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:32,400
these shady made-up companies to start buying up all of the land on the cheap uh which is this one

1037
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,120
they don't hide from this is like part of the charming mythology that they themselves yes they

1038
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:43,360
like out even though if you break it down it's pretty iffy right I think so for sure yeah yeah

1039
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,880
but this is part of the this is one of the iffy things that yeah is you're saying like they're

1040
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:52,800
like isn't that cute yeah those people are getting ripped off like scott said they're gonna feel like

1041
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,200
they got ripped off if they find out later on that i'm gonna get ripped off they didn't you know

1042
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:06,080
charge the uh buyer enough uh yeah yeah you are withholding information from the person you're

1043
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:12,640
buying the land from you were not you were not being honest about what your thing is so I wanted

1044
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,920
to know a little bit more about this jay-z you might have found some of this too but I was like

1045
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:22,000
what were these companies and there's one that has a little charming spin that they love to say

1046
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,680
the ones that I saw some of them are just like did they just pick like these names because it

1047
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:33,280
didn't sound like a white guy buying in a white guy's company they also had the thought that

1048
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,000
you're having as well yes yeah because one of them is the latin american development and

1049
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:45,360
yeah yeah yeah no that sucks yeah yeah yeah yeah no for sure I think they're like this will throw

1050
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:50,560
them off the scent mm-hmm they'll never know that the whitest man is buying this well disney co

1051
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:58,240
what do we what words can we throw in that also has the ring of king feature syndicate of like very

1052
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:03,520
bland very boring by the time you've heard the full name so you stop investigating all right sure

1053
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:10,080
latin american what was it uh to hamahawk properties yeah no it seemed right definitely yes

1054
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:17,360
but then you're having fun then they throw out mt lot company mt lot yes now that's like a cute

1055
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:27,200
disney thing I do like that I can't be mad about that I like nnt theme park company not a or nta

1056
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,240
theme park company like that would be funny isn't that cute like they're kind of telling

1057
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:37,920
them what the what it is but they're not saying it use not like the last name not not oh yeah

1058
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:45,520
that's better yes not a theme park run that together as one word maybe put like a que on it

1059
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:52,080
and then while like name well dresses up as the care guy who owns it like shaves his mustache off

1060
00:48:52,080 --> 00:49:00,400
and he puts on a wig hello there or he could just like if he doesn't want to shave he's got to be

1061
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,680
on tv the next week he does it as a lady and he's got like a handkerchief in front of his

1062
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:12,800
nose oh right right right oh my the vapors yeah yeah see that's cute I can't breathe

1063
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:18,800
the other thing is bad this is this would be cute just to like wink at everyone buying the land

1064
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,520
I'm just you know we did voices we know he did mickey of course yeah that's true another voice

1065
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,480
though perhaps not there's one clip of him in a sound booth that I also like the map I've seen

1066
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:36,720
him doing the like ah I forget what he's doing they did it one time if I'm giving them the benefit

1067
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:41,120
of the doubt of the land buying I think a lot of the land they were buying you could describe as

1068
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:46,880
hostile land like nature does not want man to be here it's filled with alligators and bugs

1069
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:55,600
and swamp yeah you know uh and I think like some of it maybe like still not used for that reason

1070
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:03,680
I think they own some land that is not developable developable uh and then but just hold it because

1071
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:09,680
it's you know blocking other stuff from yeah infringing a lot of sinkholes maybe subterranean

1072
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:15,040
sinkholes at places uh I believe that's why some of the other hotels that were supposed to be around

1073
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:21,120
the seven seas lagoon as much as they try to shoot a depth test or a girder down there the earth keeps

1074
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:25,040
eating them really there's a there was a phrase in one of these articles where it was like all right

1075
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:30,880
they had to get started and he had to drain the land and I was like Jesus yeah that's so intense

1076
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,360
where did they drain the swamp it makes sense but for for just looking and I go that seems hard

1077
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:44,880
yes yeah um yeah there's in terms I love the stories of the inhospitable nature of it I saw

1078
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:54,400
I saw a story about um I several stories that involve the need to show up with a gun because

1079
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:01,760
you may have to shoot a snake to bits this happened more than once these kind of boring

1080
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:08,080
stiff shirts going down there to deal with like let's do our redistricting and get 3d creek open

1081
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:16,720
it but they also have to be like Indiana Jones's like this is some wild stuff I saw one story about

1082
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:23,120
people having some functional meeting in a trailer and then stepping outside of it oh my god the

1083
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:29,200
biggest snake I've ever seen bang bang bang shooting the snake to bits this is such a brutal

1084
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:34,880
I've never really thought about it was blowing a snake to kingdom come um and then the guy goes

1085
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,120
back into the into the bungalow and says you gotta come out you're gonna see I just had to shoot this

1086
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:45,520
snake it's nuts he brought him out wow that is huge thing comes back to life it was not dead oh

1087
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:55,200
my god kill it kill it Michael Myers snake oh yeah her whole movie not actually dead and then

1088
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,960
oh just just this is the same story about a guy who I I mean that's a I've got more stuff about

1089
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:07,360
this gentleman general joe general joe potter but uh but he for sure is just like like snakes would

1090
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:13,280
just like dive down from tree branches you'd be hit you're like out in a out in a fan boat

1091
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,920
trying to get away to the land and then oh my god snakes he just got to be ready to snipe them

1092
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:25,840
just get attacked by snakes 24 seven that's insane it's so crazy you look back at old movies and

1093
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:32,160
stuff for old like catalog you're like wow they sold guns at hardware stores and it's like oh uh

1094
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,280
stories like this it's like oh I see why they sold a small caliber gun at a hardware store next to

1095
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:43,600
like the hedge clippers for the snakes you know would they even world like I can just imagine

1096
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:50,320
they're all like short sleeve dress shirt guys big like big cigarette or cigar gun don't even

1097
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:56,080
like like cigar doesn't even fall out of their mouth as they just unload around at a snake

1098
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:02,960
barely wins which is that the best way to do it no it can't be right no it's like a grabber they

1099
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,920
are yeah what a tough target that is and then like clearly the blowing the snake to bits and

1100
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,600
then you didn't get it indicates that that person doesn't know the the anatomy of a snake not that

1101
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:19,760
I do but I'm not being called upon to shoot one no yet but yeah he's like he's like I don't know I

1102
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,560
got the the tail and the head but then like you probably missed like vital organs that keep it

1103
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:28,160
alive yeah I'm not an advocate for snake killing it's their land I mean they should have been

1104
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,480
there they you know it's their land uh stolen from the snakes um but the all the guys should

1105
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:38,560
have just had flamethrowers like the thing like in the thing like currussle the thing they should

1106
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:43,840
just all have been equipped with a big tank on their back and a big flamethrower I guess like

1107
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:50,720
the end of once upon a time in Hollywood aliens too aliens yeah lighten up the inside of the belly

1108
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,840
a lot of movies so they just like step outside to get like continue smoking and then they go ah

1109
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:02,960
shit and they just shoot up the swamp with with the fire I saw that story about

1110
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:12,320
Dick Irvine and Admiral Joe Fowler getting swallowed by a gigantic crocodile bigger than them

1111
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:17,840
but luckily they brought flamethrowers right right lit it up from the inside until like that until

1112
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:23,680
I got until all the heat forced them back out of the mouth in sort of a monster scenario yeah yeah

1113
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:29,840
so started guardians of the galaxy too when Jarax ends up in the alien's belly and he gets out I

1114
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:34,800
guess he cuts himself out he doesn't flame throw his way out yeah same thing except for Joe Potter

1115
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:42,880
Joe Potter or Joe Fowler what former military man wants to be yes clear about this sorry yeah

1116
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:53,360
Admiral Joe Fowler is not uh General Joe Potter both uh very important in the genesis of Disney

1117
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:59,120
world yeah I remember this uh weirding me out the first time that I went to Disney world because I

1118
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:04,080
knew Disneyland and I knew that there was the Mark Twain and I knew Mark Twain is and that's

1119
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:09,600
American and it's this nice nice boat named after Mark Twain and you go down there and the boat is

1120
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:15,520
called the Admiral Joe Fowler just kind of what's with the scary military and then later this other

1121
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:20,880
boat ends up both of these military guys who helped build Disney world now there's boats named

1122
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:26,960
after them yeah something about seeing the military word this is no slight on anyone serving I think

1123
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:31,920
it just like the just the word they just like remind it always reminded me of war when I'm

1124
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:38,880
trying to get on a nice boat yeah well it was in the air when Disney world was being built and

1125
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:46,000
conceived so the helicopters that's what this episode was about in Vietnam for context this

1126
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:53,920
was a different time what you have to understand is then yeah Fortunate Son plays yeah yeah yeah

1127
00:55:54,560 --> 00:56:02,800
this might not tell the tale and on Spotify in a white room with people love it's gonna be

1128
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:08,320
speaking of aging and everything it's gonna be sad when people are too old to make documentaries

1129
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:13,440
about the 60s and they can't drop all of these no yeah yeah 60s songs into them anymore that's a

1130
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:19,600
good point I don't know people might forget gimme shelter that's a good point although the

1131
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,040
rolling stone again I said Jimmy Buffer might be immortal Mick Jagger might be immortal

1132
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:33,600
he's showing up gotta show him I'm no charlie look at me go that was certainly a slight to their dead

1133
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:42,640
drummer I think for sure not me not this year oh I'm not going out like Stan Cheryla he was my

1134
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:48,880
friend too oh I just got many a rowdy night with a Donald and Stan Cheryla I just got some fresh

1135
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:59,600
blood injections because it's easy sleazy that is he might have made the only song that is actually

1136
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,920
that is the song of the weird era where we thought the pandemic was over and then not

1137
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,720
he gave us the anthem of the most specific sliver of time and it makes sense that the

1138
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,920
anthem was really stupid yes it's all been a very stupid time why you better believe I

1139
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:20,160
listened to easy sleazy after I got my second shot we all were on the drive back windows down

1140
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,960
yeah I don't know has this come up on the show yet I don't believe so I don't think I think people

1141
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:30,800
already I had to dive for what was even the name of that song I had to when you said easy sleazy I

1142
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:36,720
know exactly yeah but I didn't remember the name Mick Jagger has a solo song yes it's not a rolling

1143
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:41,360
stone song because they want any part of it they released a song called living in a ghost town at

1144
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:46,400
the start of the pandemic right which was not related to they didn't write it for the pandemic

1145
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,880
but it just it lined up perfectly and they released that but then Mick Jagger released a solo song

1146
00:57:51,600 --> 00:58:02,320
called easy sleazy right well may we had to wear a mask it's all these like streamed lines of yeah

1147
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:09,280
I took a cooking class it's like basically like yeah like a Jimmy Fallon sketch

1148
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:14,160
but Mick Jagger wrote it as a serious song I'm obviously he's kidding a little bit but yeah if

1149
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:20,320
you haven't heard it please listen to this now easy sleazy that's what general joe potter and

1150
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:26,080
admiral joe faller that's what they described as like murking snakes like they're in their dead

1151
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:32,400
shots you know they served you know can you tell him easy sleazy easy sleazy that's what they would

1152
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:39,840
say I would like to talk about general joe potter um uh Fowler can get his time feel free I just

1153
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:48,320
him as the the snake killer I mean just what a cool sort of like I uh just apocalypse now

1154
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:54,240
she'll know it all figure fictional yeah and all of its yeah this guy is credited I never knew any

1155
00:58:54,240 --> 00:59:02,240
of this really till today that this guy is credited with the big infrastructural plant like

1156
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:10,080
like the big moving of heaven and earth that it took to turn swampland into a vacation destination

1157
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:17,680
and he was given this task because of his military experience where he helped plan the invasion of

1158
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:24,160
Normandy he's like figuring out supply count and how are you gonna move these massive vehicles

1159
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:30,960
from here to there he laid the infrastructural groundwork for normandy and not it was like not

1160
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:36,000
that distant of a memory it hadn't been that long no it was not even building this castle not 50

1161
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:42,880
years no no less than 50 really recently yeah and then it was like yeah he was planning normandy then

1162
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:48,880
he was planning out where all these tourists were going to take a shit yeah equally important of

1163
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:55,200
course they did have to make sure that his office was very far away from the um you know non-fiction

1164
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:01,280
movie department because still some bad blood with werner von baron oh sure yeah that's a very good

1165
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:11,520
point I he uh uh he was the governor of the Panama canal zone fake that's fake that's his

1166
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:17,520
that phrase or thought about it or what was going on in the Panama canal in the 50s literally he

1167
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:23,200
went his jobs were he was that and then like I think I might retire and then I'll just consult

1168
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:27,680
on the New York world's fair and that's where he met Disney but he went from the he was it was the

1169
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:33,280
the fair and then right before that he was in charge of the Panama canal where he was responsible

1170
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:38,480
there were 40 000 people living in the Panama canal zone and one of the things that he had to

1171
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:44,880
deal with on a daily basis was malaria and it's why among the many things that this guy did for

1172
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:50,320
Disney world he helped figure out how to keep mosquitoes away this is all things videos about

1173
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:54,720
this why are there no mosquitoes in Disney world and a lot of it is due to this guy because he's

1174
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:59,920
like I was there I was there in the Panama canal I saw people die every day in front of me they'd

1175
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:06,960
throw up their insides and then but he like the the thing that he knew was if there's water you

1176
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:12,480
got to keep it moving still water you're getting mosquitoes left and right so not only all these

1177
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,640
bodies of water we got to keep things pumping everything's got to be rivers and streams and on

1178
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:23,760
the flow and even he consulted on the roofs to make sure that water wouldn't get caught on a roof

1179
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:29,680
and fantasy land because then mosquitoes would start showing up he figured out garlic powder

1180
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:35,920
that was that is I think still used to keep mosquitoes away it's a garlic thing like a vampire

1181
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:46,240
he was also he fought the vampire he was in transylvania yeah from 1960 to 1963

1182
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:55,440
I have a thing on that on the swamp and the bugs yeah so Bay Lake which is on the other side of

1183
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:00,640
the contemporary connects to the seven seas lagoon okay they had to do what they call everything is

1184
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,640
that thing that's it's it's surrounding all the hotels and it's in front of the magic kingdom that

1185
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:10,960
is that's the seven seas lagoon and then it's connected to Bay Lake which is a larger body of

1186
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:17,600
water and it had to have a lot of work done this is from that Disney world first the first decade

1187
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:23,760
book to restore the lake to a pristine state meant draining three and a half billion gallons of water

1188
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:30,000
and removing an eight foot thick layer of muck covering the lake bottom but underneath all that

1189
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,120
muck was a pleasant surprise pure white sand which is spread along the lake shore to create

1190
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:42,560
beaches do not go on the beaches in 2021 now with the lake basin refilled it was stocked with 70,000

1191
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:47,280
fingerling bass not only did this add fishing to the list of recreational opportunities in the

1192
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:55,840
vacation kingdom it aided in insect control so a few birds with one stone whoa the fish help with

1193
01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:01,920
that's crazy yeah and still but just fish in there that's what so but we don't know if that's a

1194
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:09,280
general joe invention maybe it's not credited specifically to him but it does seem in his

1195
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,680
purview yeah yeah i think that's absolutely something he was he was part this is like

1196
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:20,720
that is like a heady stuff all of this this is like changing the fabric of the land so what do

1197
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:25,040
they call the thick terraforming the thing you have to do in space to be able to live anywhere

1198
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:30,160
like this is a mild version of terraforming that had to be done before the 100 skyway and the tea

1199
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:35,360
party could get built yeah and if wall was alive he would be in the bezos like i'm sure i'm assuming

1200
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:40,960
bezos and musk are all talked about like terraforming mars that's gotta be that has

1201
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,600
to be part of it if you want to live up in one of these places you have to change the makeup of

1202
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:50,160
what is possible on the actual surface yeah because musk is like well you have to terraform it

1203
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:57,920
then people are like oh what does that involve uh you know it's uh what else uh yeah yeah i was

1204
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:02,000
talking to royland the other day he has no further information about sometimes you listen to him

1205
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:08,240
talking you go is this guy know anything buddy you know what he did sell a flamethrower so that was

1206
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:14,480
cool wait what he sold a flamethrower you could buy yeah but it didn't really work and it was

1207
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:19,360
kind of like not that different than the one you use to kill weeds yeah yeah but there was you know

1208
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:25,040
the boring company they they make little tunnels and he sold a flamethrower a couple couple years

1209
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:31,600
ago that's that's pretty sick it's pretty honestly i gotta say where i'm sitting that's pretty sick

1210
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:36,240
pretty sick bro uh just take a flamethrower to mars and i'll probably just like carve it up

1211
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:41,120
and build tunnels boring company done barcode is gonna do it live in tunnels on mars yeah

1212
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,160
it's got calms all kyle mooney character you're doing there

1213
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:55,280
but the character's right let's be honest it's a correct character um so oh oh also in terms of

1214
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:03,200
like bizarre nature uh like okay other things that were there at the time gators armadillos

1215
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:08,160
uh and i heard a quote from marty sclar that one of the first times he went they were on a boat and

1216
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:12,720
they passed by what became discovery island the weird abandoned zoo and that the only thing that

1217
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:20,640
was there at the time was an illegal hunter shack just like a weird tin facility of people trying

1218
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:26,800
to hunt deer deers boars and turkeys something about that island man just people want to

1219
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:34,240
trespass on it like it's just the allure of it you know oh yeah yeah then and now um something

1220
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:40,400
magical on there i guess uh but yeah this is illegal hunting shacks and snakes you gotta shoot

1221
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:48,480
up uh what a bizarre what a bizarre place um and not only all that not only just like the the taming

1222
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:55,840
of nature that had to be done there's also all of this weird infrastructural stuff yes because

1223
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:03,600
like and i'm out of my depths to talk about like the zoning and the city stuff but they like

1224
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:10,720
they should have been bound to all of these rules that anything in a city would have been

1225
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:15,280
bound like like like there's all this zoning stuff that they didn't want to have to answer to

1226
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:22,400
yes so they invented a city structure to not have to do any of that is that basically correct well

1227
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:29,600
and they would use the the epcot movie as like and we might build a city you know they might

1228
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:36,000
that you would use it as like a carrot to dangle so we need all the cities owning stuff we need

1229
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:43,200
control we need control like it's unusual for a resort property to have full control of like

1230
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:50,240
localized area this is what i have it says disney lawyers employed chapter 298 in the florida code

1231
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:54,720
which allowed for the creation of independent drainage districts aimed at promoting the

1232
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:59,760
development of florida's swampy lands thus in may 1966 the reedy creek improvement district was

1233
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:05,040
born the rcip would have near total control over the land a problem though is that the united

1234
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:11,280
states constitution guaranteed certain legal and political rights to all citizens even those within

1235
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:17,680
a drainage district disney's solution was to create fake company controlled municipalities only

1236
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:22,080
permanent residents would be permitted to vote and disney would grant permanent residency only

1237
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:28,080
to a select group of employees and managers who were also loyal to the company which is insane

1238
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:32,720
yes and this gets you into some stuff we were talking about this on the second gate with

1239
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:37,920
celebration florida you guys made me aware of this thing that i didn't know that they've had

1240
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:49,200
employees live in trailers on the property so that they can vote and they will vote the way that the

1241
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:56,880
company wants yes in this fraudulent election to circumvent the u.s constitution i love that yeah

1242
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:02,720
from that passage by the way there was a problem though the u.s constitution states what a problem

1243
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:09,440
the disney lawyers also kept telling well like this was this problem with the epcot city it's like

1244
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:17,040
you can't let people live here permanently or they will want to vote and control the city they live in

1245
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,120
so it's like well they'll live here temporarily and it's like

1246
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:28,240
so that would temporarily everyone lives everywhere temporarily you can't make these

1247
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:34,480
people gerbil like you can't make these people animals in a zoo like the human zoo yeah he had

1248
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:43,200
this other i also just saw this that he uh he he wanted to basically uh progress city would have

1249
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:49,200
had no retirees you can't be retired there because you have to have a job you got to be working and

1250
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:55,040
contributing to progress city or to disney up the road or something on this land and maybe in the

1251
01:08:55,040 --> 01:09:00,560
future i will build another city where retirees are allowed but not progress city because if you're

1252
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:08,080
retired you're making no progress yeah and it it's wild and um that's where now we're getting loony

1253
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:15,040
no no retiring here it does and again it's so funny to think about because you're talking

1254
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:21,360
about committees maybe think of this section for the getaway book uh roy set up a central committee

1255
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:27,120
to work on the amusement park walt was not included in the group there's mark and there's an

1256
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:34,560
anecdote in here for mark davis of like walt was focused on the city he did he the secondary project

1257
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:39,600
was the amusement was the east coast disneyland and he would get annoyed if people tried to take

1258
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:44,400
too much of his time to talk about the park i also think that that has i mean i think there's people

1259
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:49,840
have written about i think it has something to do with why the park isn't drastically drastically

1260
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:53,920
different than disneyland because he was like yeah yeah just make a very similar park like he was

1261
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:59,360
because he was not so invested he was here he didn't care he was he was much more about new stuff

1262
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:04,000
so instead of being like a totally new different park he was like yeah yeah you guys do whatever

1263
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:10,480
you want so either some world where there aren't other magic kingdoms like at all or they're just

1264
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:14,480
like well there are but they're touches them there yeah exactly like it's just like yeah because they

1265
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:20,160
they were talking about tokyo before like way before it ever got built like there was already

1266
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:25,920
some chatter of other parks elsewhere yeah but i doubt well all any anytime i've ever read about

1267
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,440
walt he seems like a guy who's like very adamant about one thing until they go hey you know we can

1268
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:33,680
make a bunch of money and it should be and he goes all right fine so like yeah like they're

1269
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:39,600
probably he would have like franchised disney out and focused on his city and then terraforming

1270
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:44,960
venus or something you know well i'm going to a different planet than this bezos character

1271
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:50,560
i'm gonna figure out some life elongating schemes so that he is still around i mean he was you know

1272
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:57,120
like okay wait well they're all the frozen the cryogenic stuff is not true he's not frozen but

1273
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:01,360
was he looking into cryogenics at least that's a good question that i don't know the answer to

1274
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:06,560
because our current billionaires are doing this and this is a minor fascination with myself as

1275
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:11,600
well reading about all this futurism stuff about life you freezing yourself yes me freezing myself

1276
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:16,800
uh i just read that larry king for years had said he wanted to freeze himself but his family talked

1277
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:24,560
him out of it so larry is not frozen and but yeah right though i don't actually know do you ever seen

1278
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:29,520
if walt expressed the desire to actually have himself frozen or that's just i hate some of his

1279
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:39,360
behavior at the end of the his life definitely seems like a man who wants to you know leave

1280
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:44,880
a lasting impression like he it seems like he feels like the specter of death is following him

1281
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:53,120
frankly like some of his behavior so i have to think at some point he thought like how do i out

1282
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:59,680
live this sure because i the funclan talks about like he was drinking more at the end of his life

1283
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:04,960
well sure and he went in for some surgery and that's an unrelated surgery and then they found

1284
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:10,560
the cancer right because he had a horrible cough but yeah there's no like document like documentation

1285
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:15,760
i don't know i don't know of i don't know exactly yeah saying like and i'd like to be frozen can we

1286
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:20,720
get a freezer and put me in there it could be in one of those two biographies according to mental

1287
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:28,400
floss.com that somebody maybe not him i think he was on his deathbed and someone from the studios

1288
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:34,720
called cryogenics place and asked a lot of questions a lot of very interesting questions

1289
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:40,400
and that apparently uh the okay wait he never specified it in writing and when he died the

1290
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:47,120
family didn't go for it two weeks later they froze the first man oh really so this was the first wow

1291
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:53,600
so he was maybe in contentia if he had like gotten it out and verbalized it he could have been the

1292
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:59,200
first man frozen that's pretty crazy not not just to be frozen he could have been the first wow that

1293
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:03,680
is crazy uh that would have i think that would i don't know which company that was i don't know

1294
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:07,520
if they're still around i mean there's there was an expose because baseball player ted williams was

1295
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:14,880
frozen and there are two ways i understand to be frozen one is your whole body gets frozen or they

1296
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:20,560
separate the head and just freeze the head i think correct maybe i'm wrong about it being ted williams

1297
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:25,440
but there was the um there was an expose on one of these places and they just had like heads hanging

1298
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:33,120
around people mistreating the heads yeah and just like a fucking sleazy creepy weird fake biz i don't

1299
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:37,920
know if it's totally fake but like truly not some sort of professional thing where yeah they take

1300
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:43,920
these like human bodies that have just passed away uh they treat them well i don't know if it's that

1301
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:49,920
story but there's a simple there's some cryonics kind of situation that i liked because it was up

1302
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:55,360
in in chatsworth which is closer to where i'm from where like there's a forest line there's a cemetery

1303
01:13:55,360 --> 01:14:00,560
where they got some space at the cemetery to do some experiment on there were 10 bodies in there

1304
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:04,960
and then it was all investigated and looked into after the funding had been cut and people walked

1305
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:09,920
in it was just this horrifying room of like melting it just wasn't like oh my god yeah

1306
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:14,400
refrigerated treated probably and i drove up there not like it was a whole podcast about it

1307
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,000
i don't remember specifics very well but i was like i gotta drive up there just to like know the

1308
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,080
vibe like even to feel what it's like to go off of a road and then get into a building where this

1309
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:30,960
ice and corpses melt that is the creepiest shit it is i know a family friend was living with someone

1310
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:39,520
who was frozen and was there at the end and was like weird x-files shit of like people lingering

1311
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:46,320
in the final few weeks like just like this weird shadow company lingering while the

1312
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:53,360
the gentleman was like slowly passing away and it is just hearing a little bit about it you go this

1313
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:59,680
is just so creepy i don't know i would be fascinating to know how many of these places

1314
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:05,680
are still around i think by and large the community that is actually trying to end aging

1315
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:09,680
which is really what a lot of these people's premise is that like you're trying to deal with

1316
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:14,640
diseases and like trying to cure diseases but really the thing is aging aging is the thing

1317
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:20,080
our cells get weak and they can't fight things off anymore so i don't i think that freezing is

1318
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:25,040
going out of fashion pretty fast we're not this has been if we're talking if the first man was

1319
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:31,120
frozen frozen in 66 is what we're discovering uh that's older than disney world yeah uh happy

1320
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:35,840
56th birthday freezing yeah i don't think it's going too well for you i think the proof would

1321
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:41,360
be in the pudding and the pudding is melting yeah yeah i think there was another story a few years

1322
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:48,640
ago about like a cryogenic startup where like oh no the power went out and all everything melted

1323
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:54,640
like it's like the best minds are not focused on this you know there's a lot of other things

1324
01:15:54,640 --> 01:16:00,000
yeah i guess perhaps if somebody is i wonder what the best cryogenics place maybe they do have a

1325
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:04,720
corpse that has been preserved and once they figure the aging thing out they can do it but it

1326
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:09,840
feels like they're all about it feels it doesn't feel nearly as good as the austin powers technology

1327
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:16,720
i don't think that's possible at all pods do you think anyone uh ever looked into freezing

1328
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:24,000
themselves because they watched the first 12 minutes of austin powers didn't continue to watch

1329
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:29,440
the fun comedic romp that ensued they just saw it as like a technological leap forward i watched a

1330
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:35,920
sci-fi thriller the other day something about power it was about the power probably a free

1331
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:40,480
thing it was called the power of freezing power for you yeah i think it's got to be one person

1332
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:46,480
who got away maybe it was larry maybe larry king watched it i i'd like to be frozen now please

1333
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:54,320
one frozen since you mentioned it i believe disney's remains were cremated and are in one

1334
01:16:54,320 --> 01:17:00,560
of the forest lawn cemeteries in the san fernando valley which again we're not that far from i i

1335
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:06,560
enjoyed a uh a nice iced tea earlier today in the shadow of the hospital where he died

1336
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:12,480
oh sure it's not well they've got that walk up starbucks in the yeah they've got it i just

1337
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:18,240
rode my bike it was very pleasant i didn't go there and think about well now i feel bad i didn't go

1338
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:24,080
there and think about wall here while we're doing this episode i should have like bud you know

1339
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:27,680
bent down and said a little something said a little something poured out some of the ice

1340
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:34,240
team can i see the drop tile ceiling where he explained how the city was laid out in his last

1341
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:40,560
week yeah yes that well this was another general joe potter thing that he went to see him on his

1342
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:46,080
deathbed in the last couple weeks and that he's using the ceiling and saying well then that's

1343
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:51,600
going to be over there and that'll be the hub you see and he's like pointing at an empty ceiling

1344
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:58,960
and saying this plan this is nuts so yeah yeah this i can't even imagine that it's truly surreal

1345
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:04,560
austin powers is more real than what you just described to me now like mere mere feet away

1346
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,960
from where we are right now in his defense terraforming swampland building a major

1347
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:15,600
international vacation destination they got pretty close they got pretty close oh yeah what he did

1348
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:22,000
easiest stuff yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah where they landed and i thank them for it it's truly

1349
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:28,160
wonderful but the metaphor i kept thinking about is like if you set out to make a thanksgiving dinner

1350
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:35,760
and very quickly you abandon the raw turkey and the entree becomes mashed potatoes and that is

1351
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:41,120
the main course the mashed potatoes are the main course the secondary the side dish is now the main

1352
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:45,440
course and over the course of 50 years the mashed potatoes just get more and more elaborate

1353
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
and also more and more you're like sweating while you're saying this you're getting like really

1354
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,640
worked up talking about these mashed potatoes because all the stories about it's like yeah the

1355
01:18:54,640 --> 01:19:00,080
this this this was secondary the the amusement park theme park was secondary jim hill i think

1356
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:10,320
pointed out that essentially it was the icon the weenie was the magic kingdom to drive uh people's

1357
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:17,600
eye to drive traffic tourism dollars tourists to the florida property when the city was going to be

1358
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:24,000
the main focus it probably makes sense to get people down there with something to do sure yeah

1359
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,360
amusement park and not just like come to the city with no olds with old people come to the logan's

1360
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:36,880
run city yeah no retirees i mean the subtext of that is they killed the old people right yeah i

1361
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:43,600
think so they were euthanized you think yeah yeah here's the general frozen general will freeze you

1362
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:48,400
here we'll show you the freezing machines and no they're actually they're they're turbines wall

1363
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:53,600
just big fans wall marty spotter writes in his book walt entered the office and said we need a way to

1364
01:19:53,600 --> 01:20:00,880
get rid of the old people not me no the ones not in control the ones who haven't done anything with

1365
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:06,640
bob gur was like well i just built a big fan and i just roll them in i don't know

1366
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:14,000
let's call it the magical chamber of dreams yeah sounds good that's got a nicer ring to it than

1367
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,920
euthanasia and then we got went to the shore we went to the sherman brothers they needed a song

1368
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:25,360
for the fan yeah went to the magical machine yeah there's some animator somewhere who's like well i

1369
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:30,480
i animated the two cats in the arista cats and then i well i helped him come up with death panels

1370
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:39,280
he said you've got talent help me with some numbers issues do it all the way you solve

1371
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:48,400
health care is to not have old people we don't have to support them oh man um speaking of

1372
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:57,200
insanity though there was all this like um how okay so jason you said it that uh they finally

1373
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:01,760
they start getting the project off the ground they're gonna build something and the uh the

1374
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:06,640
state is kind of well i don't know you need to follow these rules and you got to uh you know

1375
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:11,360
you should abide by this and that well let's show you this movie and this movie has walt in it he's

1376
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:16,240
gonna talk about his dream and then it melted everyone's icy hearts and now like okay whatever

1377
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:21,040
you need what would you like to do and suddenly disney had the power they had no uh state or

1378
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:25,920
county regulation on buildings airport construction they could have built an airport though they never

1379
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:30,160
did uh a distribution sale of alcoholic beverages didn't have to apply for the regular stuff for

1380
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:36,720
that and they even had the right to build a nuclear power plant anyone know that i hadn't heard that i

1381
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:43,680
hadn't heard it either yeah they were like and still and this is like a florida law legislature

1382
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:48,880
thing and i don't think it's all companies i think it is like on the books in florida that if the

1383
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:56,400
walt disney company wants to build a nuclear power plant on that property they can do it and it for

1384
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:02,960
sure still does exist because every once in a while a state senator will come around and say

1385
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:08,960
maybe that should be out of there even though it doesn't seem likely that here in 2021

1386
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:15,040
disney is going to suddenly build a nuclear power that's not doesn't seem like the way the

1387
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:19,760
winds are blowing they did build a nice solar power plant with the shape of mickey's ears

1388
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:24,400
that's cute and nice and forward thinking nuclear power they're probably not going to do

1389
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:29,600
however even though it was just this minor thing that i think the senator kind of dropped ultimately

1390
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:35,760
disney still sent in lobbyists so like to keep the option open yeah yeah yeah yeah still put

1391
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:40,160
in money to say actually we would like to still have that right you gotta have a little wiggle

1392
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:47,520
room you know you gotta let industry grow i mean that is the give and take of all these parks but

1393
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:53,680
like especially the stuff about disney world because wall was encouraging his you know i think

1394
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:59,360
we said earlier like the florida property will give us projects for decades and he encouraged

1395
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:06,960
the imagineers to like think past your lifetime and that's a good i think that is you should tell

1396
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:11,440
artists that you know that i think that is good but then it's funny to see the way the parks are

1397
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:16,960
executed where it's like you are lucky of attraction you have a handful attractions that last 20 30

1398
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:25,120
years or so and then the other thing is he wants industry to fund all this stuff to to make all

1399
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:29,440
this stuff and they're not thinking past their lifetimes industry is thinking about lining their

1400
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:37,440
pockets and the way you line your pockets changes as industries evolve and change so it's like

1401
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:46,320
oh i don't that he was a man of conflicts for sure could he have built an atomic bomb also

1402
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:55,280
might i mean i don't know the full blow a bunch of dust off of a big book in the florida state

1403
01:23:55,280 --> 01:24:00,400
legislature but yeah is it possible on the books is like what was allowed to build one

1404
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:06,560
nuclear bomb every decade and like would he have hit would he have hit universal orlando with the

1405
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:14,480
bomb during construction that was legal according to some sort of charter sorry you know business

1406
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:19,840
cost to be one business so they want to keep it open for that reason if they want a torpedo sea

1407
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:25,360
world or sesame place is expanding let's get these fuckers out of there yeah if they wanted

1408
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:32,320
to build a big drill machine yeah it can like go in a subterranean fashion under one of their

1409
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:39,120
yeah like um like uh cranes ships that he would use from the technodrome to the surface area level

1410
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:43,440
yeah they'd have that big drill on the front they got disney got real nervous when ninja turtles

1411
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:48,480
started using that because they're like that's really close to our copyright they locked them

1412
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:53,840
down locked them down in mgm studios in the early years yeah good point let's cut a deal you come

1413
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:59,360
dance around in our parks and we won't say anything about this subterranean machine you blew the cover

1414
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:05,120
on you know um while they were fighting the state they were also benefiting a lot of the

1415
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:10,880
developments in the state because the florida highway system was being rapidly like expanded

1416
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:16,480
and built like interstate four and the florida turnpike and then where they built where they did

1417
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:22,080
it was proximity to uh yeah yeah to those roads thinking like you know there wasn't really there

1418
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:26,720
wasn't a major airport yet no in orlando so yeah those highways are super important to them and

1419
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:32,080
why they put it there orlando was still mccoy air force base and then gradually shifted to more

1420
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:38,480
and more civilian flights and it's still the the three-letter code for orlando is mco it's still

1421
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:44,320
i never knew that it's still a holdover front it was an air force base but with the drawdown

1422
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:50,320
as vietnam was wrapped up that air was no longer in there needed an air force base on florida wow

1423
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:57,120
and now yeah no white room with land and get on the mickey's magical express

1424
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:04,480
white room flame i guess not anymore well for a short while longer oh is it still going right i

1425
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:10,000
thought it was still going to the end of the calendar year okay i apologize for not knowing

1426
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:18,960
um so where where are we now i mean this is all such madness what they had to do this

1427
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:25,840
it's also like in addition to yeah terraforming essentially they're also

1428
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:32,960
they they got to do hotels for the first time and they've never they've never done that because

1429
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:38,480
the disneyland hotel was this other corporation running it and they were just licensing the name

1430
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:44,320
initially now disney runs a ton of hotels they did not at the time they had to learn some stuff

1431
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:50,640
about it i saw this weird fact that there was a in the lead-up to disney world opening in like the

1432
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:59,200
year prior they saw that a guy was opening a little hilton inn on i drive he was like prepping it

1433
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:05,440
he's an independent owner and disney went to the guy and said hey can we run your hotel for you

1434
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:10,800
as practice like this is this odd little where you'd go to the hotel and you wouldn't even know

1435
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:15,680
that disney was running the joint and did for like 18 months after the opening of disney where they

1436
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:20,480
they made got this big deal we won't just leave you out to dry this will be our hotel for a little

1437
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:25,360
while we'll just like learn and watch and figure it out and train people in here and then uh so

1438
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:30,640
that they were more able to do contemporary and polynesian that's great that is why like was like

1439
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:36,240
were the imagineers like dressed up did they running it like how were they incognito like

1440
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,120
oh yes hello nothing to see here

1441
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:48,960
uh yeah i think so um yeah yeah doing like uh broad uh like custodial characters and like

1442
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:56,640
john cleese and faulty towers all fake english accents and stuff yeah yeah uh yeah conical

1443
01:27:56,640 --> 01:28:02,000
prat falls uh the stupidly large key rings well yeah they had to see how guests would react to

1444
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:07,200
prat falls from the hotel staff they just needed to know all the different angles of it day to day

1445
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:12,000
prat falls are going to happen at some point in the calendar year so if a bell boy is holding

1446
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:17,200
too many bags and the bags open how will the guest react you wouldn't know unless you tried

1447
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:21,520
unless you ran it and tried that if there's like a monkey running around who like took the little

1448
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:25,920
bellhop costume and put it on and then was running wild in a room yeah something i assume happened

1449
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:32,080
in a disney live action film around that time was yeah it was dunc- dunston checks in based on an

1450
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:37,520
old older movie which is the movie you just described just assume it's if it if it was in

1451
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:42,160
the late 60s and kurt russell was in it there's probably a monkey movie oh yeah kurt russell was in

1452
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:50,880
uh chimp hotel from 1962 yeah yeah very popular that jane goodall research you know was just

1453
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:56,480
hitting and you know susan placette and kurt russell in chimp hotel walt disney presents

1454
01:28:56,480 --> 01:29:00,640
chimp hotel which is coming back on disney plus there's going to be a full yeah three season

1455
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:07,680
arc of it um yeah the follow followed up of course by uh the the bananas bellhop yeah right of course

1456
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:13,760
yeah well you start with season one you don't have three negotiate contracts so yeah of course so

1457
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:18,000
yeah well we're excited about that i didn't know that i didn't know they were like testing hotel

1458
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:25,040
running a hotel there's a whole like even like hiring up was apparently pretty difficult because

1459
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:30,800
just like this notion everything that they figured out in california and what was by now in motion of

1460
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:36,320
like it's the disney look and the disney way of being and its cast members and its friendliness

1461
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:41,200
and all the cus like just like hiring people i think they had trouble shifting people to like

1462
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:47,840
teaching the disney way just sort of creepy thing to bring up i guess but just this like

1463
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:51,920
manifested itself in that people would show up at disney say i want a job and they wouldn't really

1464
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:58,960
know like what the kinds of jobs they were even filling speaking of monkeys there was a guy who

1465
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:04,240
was like you're hiring okay great went to his truck brought out a little train monkey and did a

1466
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:11,280
little act and thought like this is so i can do this in disney world great amusement parks yeah

1467
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:17,520
yeah carnivals this is an amusement are you not amused wow is like an organ grinder type of a

1468
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:22,880
situation or yeah i think so wow how yeah just thought like you could use this couldn't you

1469
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:29,200
he was right they should have it still yeah they there hasn't been a live monkey in a part of an

1470
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:35,520
animal kingdom i assume for a long time yeah but not in like a city environment that's true yeah

1471
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:41,280
costume right that's what we want it's kind of crazy to think about um you know uh not that

1472
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,960
central florida was a total backwater but it was a bit off the beaten path because

1473
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:54,880
they had to build a factory where like uh port orleans is now to construct the modular hotel

1474
01:30:54,880 --> 01:31:01,280
rooms for the two hotels oh yeah but then they had to build the monorail like the concrete beams in

1475
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:07,360
tocoma washington and then get them across the country wow so it everything is they're kind of

1476
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:13,360
learning it as they go along and with hiring i guess that's how they ended up with uh like

1477
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:19,760
about 5 000 cast members on opening day when they ended up with 10 000 guests so that's a

1478
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:29,440
cast member for every for every two guests wow yeah yeah yeah jeez yikes um yeah i think like

1479
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:33,440
i think a lot of it was very difficult like they didn't like who's going to build the monorail

1480
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:39,520
who's around that can do that just like all the functional stuff and they'd only done this

1481
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:45,040
once before i was also reading how they everything at disneyland was built

1482
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:51,840
sort of in this bob gurway that we talk about where i don't know i did it and i did a little

1483
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:57,120
drawing and here's how it worked i worked it out and then it was there there was no plan and put

1484
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:01,920
there was no like here's a book of how you do this ride or that ride because it all just sort of

1485
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:06,480
happened and kind of nobody thought it would happen again so reproducing everything i think

1486
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:11,280
was a big hassle yeah yeah it is because obviously now like they probably could get

1487
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:18,400
they probably have like down to the centimeter every single ride in a database yeah oh yeah

1488
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:23,920
have to i mean exact dimensions of everything and every uh character in it and every exact

1489
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:29,360
paint color and yeah you could 3d print a disney park right in like a couple days but it is fun

1490
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:35,920
it is like hey did you take notes on how we built the other one no no i thought about that

1491
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:40,480
i do yeah i guess we should have saved some of the drawings huh that was that one okay well i

1492
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:48,400
kind of remember how it is i think osha comes along after the opening of disney world oh right

1493
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:54,320
yeah i'm not saying it's because of the opening of disney but it they weren't subject to it for a

1494
01:32:54,320 --> 01:33:00,720
while right right so yeah that is why it's just wild because so much stuff i mean just not even

1495
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:05,120
taking it out of theme parks i just like you go you drive through a city you go how do they figure

1496
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:09,040
out how to do a city how did you figure out how to make one of these tall buildings i feel like

1497
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:13,760
such an idiot yeah because i'm like if you really think about just logistically how our world has

1498
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:20,000
been constructed i go i'm the dumbest person alive i have no clue how to do this and then in

1499
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:26,000
in the span of human history it's relatively it's not long that this stuff was all created and so

1500
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:31,920
it's interesting getting a little like microcosm of it from disney world going yeah this it is

1501
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:37,680
funny how you just take so many just like mundane things for granted just because they exist and go

1502
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:44,720
they always knew how to run a hotel or build a monorail but they did not they truly were kind

1503
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:50,560
of clueless i know i think that all is yeah streets yeah what streets huh i'm like the dumbest man

1504
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:55,200
alive if i really start to think about stuff when i go i don't know how this works i don't know how

1505
01:33:55,200 --> 01:34:00,320
i passed by a pothole then i was like why aren't why isn't it all potholes that was our streets

1506
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:08,560
built there aren't potholes everywhere all the time exactly yes um so dumb i'm dumb i'm yeah i'm

1507
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:20,240
real dumb jason no not i'm reasonably dumb yeah i i i don't think i could uh yeah build a city

1508
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:27,280
or anything like that but i read a little and i cannot apply it in real life no application for

1509
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:35,200
the yeah um i well what have we missed on the way to opening day because we got we want to

1510
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:41,760
get to opening day roy you gotta give it up to roy o disney because he he kind of made it all

1511
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:48,080
hat he had first off he had to put up he was good with uh his brother's crazy schemes uh and then

1512
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:53,440
you know kind of resigned himself to like we gotta do this and i want to do this in his honor

1513
01:34:53,440 --> 01:35:00,480
well i postponed his retirement postponed his retirement yeah uh also died a few months after

1514
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:07,840
opening day of disney world in december of 71 yes like my work here is done and then like heaven

1515
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:16,480
took him away he slept for the first time in 40 plus years or so and it was instant yeah yeah well

1516
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:22,080
and the whole the engineering story i believe goes into this how he was always the money guy

1517
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:28,240
and then this was his chance to get involved with the artists and the engineers and like the people

1518
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:33,680
doing the fun stuff and he apparently had a lot of fun he saw the other side of it he saw the stuff

1519
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:40,960
that walt got to do he got to do it and i think he died with a with a lot of joy and he of course

1520
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:47,600
is why it is called walt disney world right his first moves was to we'll put the full name in it

1521
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:52,880
so that people are more likely to remember the man as if it was gonna say like really

1522
01:35:52,880 --> 01:36:00,160
i guess right yeah his name is disney your name is pretty splashy like uh yeah on camera a lot i

1523
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:07,840
so much footage of him yeah um not all people likely to be forgotten oh walt disney oh i thought

1524
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:12,640
it might be a different guy because this is on the east coast oh okay it's him i see i see not

1525
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:19,920
jonathan q disney oh okay got it um so yeah i mean it seems like his drive really

1526
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:26,720
caused it all to happen and that's why there's a statue of him at the park correct and the magic

1527
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:33,360
is sitting on a bench next to minnie right gotta ask mike yeah well jealous pisses me off yeah

1528
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:39,520
that old man doesn't deserve to sit next to minnie his true love though he was a money man like

1529
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:46,000
get bern and tracy you know never got divorced but well you know that was real love i don't know i

1530
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:51,040
don't care for it yeah well maybe the golden one they're putting in will be your shot yeah they

1531
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:55,040
should it would just be it should be the exact same statue but without roy and you can sit there

1532
01:36:55,040 --> 01:37:08,480
and take your own photo that's what i would prefer um hello um uh so yeah he roy makes it happen um

1533
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:19,360
they set october 1st 1971 as the day partially because um they are remembering the mistakes of

1534
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:25,920
disneyland disneyland opened in the middle of the summer it was extremely hot which caused all of

1535
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:30,480
the famous problems that they ran out of water and the women's heels are melting into the concrete

1536
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:35,840
just added to the mania that it was so hot and the disaster that was disneyland opening day we

1537
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:41,200
did an episode about it you can go check that out um so they didn't want that so they they picked

1538
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:47,840
october when the weather is worse uh when school is back in session yes the friday it's kind of

1539
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:51,520
i don't know is it a friday i don't know that it's a friday now it's friday this year was a friday

1540
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:56,400
okay good i didn't get it right uh so just kind of like middle it's not a weekend uh they think

1541
01:37:56,400 --> 01:38:01,520
they wanted to downplay it a lot and this is funny because it's sort of how the opening of

1542
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:07,760
galaxy's edge played out where they're saying you're sensing from a lot of places this is

1543
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:13,520
going to be pretty nuts you maybe don't want to be part of this maybe people stay away and then

1544
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:18,400
they did and it was like oddly because we were there first day of galaxy's edge it was oddly

1545
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:23,680
sparse everywhere but galaxy's edge and that's sort of what happened with disney world too they

1546
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:31,360
it worked too well leading to that problem of a cast member for every two people uh and

1547
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:37,440
it was so it was initially like very initially i think there was it's not like it got it was that

1548
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:43,440
dire but i think it opened with a feeling of uh oh what if this didn't what if we didn't

1549
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,640
successfully do the east coast outreach what if people aren't interested in this

1550
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:56,160
yes or hopefully this is just like a result of people being afraid of crowds but maybe we

1551
01:38:56,160 --> 01:39:02,320
messed it up they roy did think that before he passed away like that was keeping him awake

1552
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:08,480
maybe alive the stress was coursing through his body keeping alive but yeah it was kind of a bad

1553
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:14,560
first couple weeks i i believe seemingly yeah i think they i think it turned around by the time

1554
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:19,040
thanksgiving came around i think the thanksgiving holiday they were like oh wow there's a lot of

1555
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:25,520
there's like 50 000 people in the park yeah yeah i think no it like it exploded pretty quickly

1556
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:32,800
thereafter and then with thus leading to like giant lines of cars they'd have to like block

1557
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:37,120
parking lots and say nobody could come in so cars would just pull off to the side of the road and

1558
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:42,080
wait and then they'd see a car leave and they go all right well then i can go in and they'd go to

1559
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:46,960
the turnstile and say that well i saw car leaves that means i get to go well no it's not as simple

1560
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:53,680
as that what why not so like furious campouts and like i think i think it was like pretty rough in

1561
01:39:53,680 --> 01:40:00,160
terms of crowd management for the first little run yeah there's a funny helicopter story um the

1562
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:07,520
website this day in disney history has a couple of good uh did you find this too um uh it has a lot

1563
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:12,000
of interesting facts and pictures and stuff there's a story about card walker and don tatum

1564
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:20,160
two executives going up in a helicopter and seeing lines and lines of cars and getting very excited

1565
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:25,280
at all the people coming and then the cars started to turn the wrong way and they realized it was all

1566
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:33,440
the cast members going to park it is really like from this from these stories to the opening day

1567
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:40,480
special contrasted with disneyland it is night and day it is so like call that opening this opening

1568
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:45,600
day special is pre-recorded it starts with just part of it yeah they were out like we learned

1569
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:52,640
about we will film this over the course of three days instead of trying to do some big live thing

1570
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:57,520
and it was done way later this was done after october first right just kind of like yeah it'll

1571
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:02,800
just be we'll just ramp up slowly over a month no big weird special where people are on drugs and

1572
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:07,600
cheating on their wives it is why yes that it's the difference nighted like the disney world

1573
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:12,160
special open that we i don't want to jump ahead but like it opens with a four minute glenn campbell

1574
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:19,360
music video largely glenn campbell it is so much glenn campbell yeah watch this special if you want

1575
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:27,120
to kind of follow along with us the grand opening of all disney world 1971 um yeah it's real sleepy

1576
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:33,760
it's so sleepy today is mine today is mine and it's the whole song and it's the first and there's

1577
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:39,280
shots of disney world but not as many as you'd think the first four minutes of the opening day

1578
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:46,080
special would have fields it's a lot of fields in swampland and then he keeps coming back with very

1579
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:51,920
boring speeches like you're i was just sitting here going shut up man play wichita lineman come

1580
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:58,080
i like some glenn campbell songs yeah that's exactly um but it is it's it's real meandering

1581
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:04,160
and just kind of like spirit and hope and americana and that's the that song is what i wrote like it's

1582
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:10,880
like there's a feeling there's a feeling rumbling beneath this land and then they don't really show

1583
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:16,000
you like yeah right and it's not like sky buckets and there's some disney songs but you're like i'm

1584
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:21,040
not sure why this was the choice yeah the the contrasting it with if you haven't heard our

1585
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:27,360
disneyland opening day special you can even just watch that special it is crazy it is it is uh it

1586
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:33,200
is punk rock the disneyland opening special it's like cinema verite yeah it's like very yeah and

1587
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:39,040
like kind of with it's like harsh black and white i think that adds to it uh that you can't always

1588
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:45,200
make out what's happening yeah it's uh it's like a very distinct visual palette and this is just

1589
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:52,640
this like 70s tide commercial it is just yeah so yeah bland in every way they're just like i don't

1590
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:58,560
know what it was with the 70 maybe it was the it's it's post vietnam let's say it let's calm

1591
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:07,200
everybody down things are hectic everything just got so like sanitized and gentle yeah yeah calm

1592
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:13,840
well i think in 55 television was still very new like it was still the early days of the medium so

1593
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:18,960
they so to do a major broadcast for this giant event and then by the 70s it's like all right we

1594
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:26,640
figured out how to like cut variety and cut like you know live events down to something that like

1595
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:31,440
it's very clean but then it's like experience doing it and it's not just it's just not by the

1596
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:37,520
seat of our pants anymore but it's too clean that said there are there's a couple versions on youtube

1597
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:44,800
one of which i i think the one has more commercials in it from the time and that's a lot of fun

1598
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:51,040
like getting to see of course we've we yeah we talked about that the eastern airlines uh add with

1599
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:56,080
orson welles narrating of like fly eastern airlines to disney world walt disney world

1600
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:58,480
there is a certain airline

1601
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:10,400
um yeah uh it's something this special i would say if i had to choose between this or really any

1602
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:15,920
other special you know hey look i love my old disney world specials i watch these all the time

1603
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:23,600
i would not put this towards the top of my favorites it is me andry oh yeah that is for sure

1604
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:28,720
boy some sleepy musical numbers i you know hey i think we all like julie andrew's plenty i don't

1605
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:35,680
i don't need to see any of those numbers again no no no bad job or anything it's just all boy she

1606
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:42,400
she entered she's introduced like on the monorail and the the noise of the monorail is just as loud

1607
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:48,320
as her voice which is really funny uh and then she does like yeah like a weird like disco zippity

1608
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:54,320
dude uh like not even disco like kind of i don't know i guess a little dance it's just it has like

1609
01:44:54,320 --> 01:45:01,120
boo boo boo in it right yes so it's like i don't know what this is and like hip 70s varieties kids

1610
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:08,480
dancing with her yeah and i don't ugly colors i don't believe anyone would wear in reality yeah

1611
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:14,800
and then fucking bob hope shows up oh man that's really the core of it is the miss as they call

1612
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:24,080
the spirit of eternal youth now there cannot be an older looking man than bob hope in 1971

1613
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:32,320
man lived to be 100 he lived to the ripe old age of 100 100 years old and he had it is you know it

1614
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:39,440
wasn't youthful was his brain no it was not no he's greatest ideas none of those forward thinking

1615
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:47,440
ideas this man tell a lot of body half jokes like like half set up half punch line like i don't

1616
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:53,360
it's not all the way there if you don't know this footage it is i will give it this it is possibly

1617
01:45:53,920 --> 01:46:02,080
the craziest setup for a stand-up comedy routine that has ever occurred oh yeah the monorail

1618
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:09,280
landing in the inside station of the contemporary hotel the monorail door is open bob hope

1619
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:17,280
walks down half a flight of stairs and does his stand flanked by two guides with a like riding

1620
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:23,600
crop plaid style right guides uh and then he's and and the you know the contemporary hotel if

1621
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:28,560
you've been in there is just very like uh i mean it's a pretty just big open concourse but it's

1622
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:33,040
also like kind of angular depending on where you are so you feel like his angle is weird and

1623
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:37,920
everything's pointed weird and diagonal and it keeps cutting to balconies where everybody's like

1624
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:42,160
leaning in these weird ways and the sight lines aren't that's the funniest that people are like

1625
01:46:42,160 --> 01:46:47,760
they walked out of their hotel room and they're leaning over the the balcony on the 12th floor

1626
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:53,440
trying to watch a comedy routine one of the strangest rooms i think ever it would stand ups

1627
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:58,720
been done in yeah it wouldn't shock me also if it was all not like shot at different times because

1628
01:46:58,720 --> 01:47:05,120
of how odd it is i don't think i'm sure some of it was but it's like it's so disorienting that if

1629
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:11,520
you told me that like the place was empty except for bob hope and the two girls there yeah you

1630
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:15,840
would be oh yeah it makes because the audio is sweetened the laughs are sweetened for sure oh yeah

1631
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:21,440
not enough not enough it still makes it still makes it sound like he's eating shit with these

1632
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:28,880
jokes yeah a lot of them truly don't well you want to you want to get into it you just have them on

1637
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:59,200
17 or younger i don't know maybe 18 with that we can't say yeah i guess not they're very young

1638
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:03,520
looking that's all i'll say documentation i don't want to i know you want to defend bob hope's honor

1639
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:09,440
here i understand always great man he like looks one of them up and he goes oh boy they don't build

1640
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:14,800
mice the way they used to which first of all let's just break this joke down the they're not might

1641
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:20,000
the the because they're a mouseketeers what is he talking about here it's unclear like it's really

1642
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:26,400
unclear what he's in disney world it's so he could have just said like they're a mouseketeer maybe

1643
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:31,120
if i'm punching the joke up it's like you it's just really what is he doing what do you have

1644
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:36,160
the follow-up to that like joke that didn't about like meet me yeah he says like meet me in an

1645
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:42,880
adventure land meet me in adventure land and the audience is like tickled by that yeah but he's

1646
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:48,320
this old man is saying hey let's hook up in adventure land that's the joke yeah he's saying

1647
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:52,640
i'm gonna hook up with these two young women in adventure land later and he did and he they

1648
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:58,000
charted a private jungle cruise boat mr eternal youth who could turn it down who could turn out

1649
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:05,040
done the charm of a probably in his late 50s but seemingly in his early 80s he couldn't do it he

1650
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:10,400
impregnated both of them and they raised their children together as friends and the children

1651
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:16,960
are friends and they have bob to thank for them that's very nice so beautiful story there's a i'm

1652
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:21,520
cutting i'm cutting around here i just like when he like really lazily goes hey what a building

1653
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:29,520
hey i know we think it too he's right i mean it is a great building we really like the building

1654
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:34,800
well it's really two buildings leaning against each other i want to congratulate the architect

1655
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:43,440
dean martin is that the strongest joke no no is that the strongest joke because he leans because

1656
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:50,080
he's drunk yeah because he's drunk and like leaning like leaning i guess so yeah you know the way you

1657
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:55,920
lean and the way you don't ever lean when you're sober it is only activated by alcohol right

1658
01:49:55,920 --> 01:50:00,560
leaning and that's the thing we know about dean martin is that he leans a lot that's the first

1659
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:06,000
thing that comes to your head when you think of dean martin is he leans a lot so the guy was tall

1660
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:12,400
but from the how often he's leaning you'd think he was five two that's a pretty good there i

1661
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:19,920
push it up yeah yeah you could go i keep going i keep going he's better than i was around to do the

1662
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:29,760
a hack scenario with bob hope if only the young gun giving him the john wayne when john wayne

1663
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:34,880
paints i don't have that one well and john wayne doodles he really doodles yeah yeah because there's

1664
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:40,720
like a weird mural and the mary blare he's the mary blare western for some reason the futuristic

1665
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:47,280
hotel has a western themed mural and you have to know this already to get the joke right and he's

1666
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:53,280
like saying john wayne painted this that's the joke uh that one doesn't go with that i don't feel

1667
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:59,600
like the audience gets that the sweetened audience this is just like reference this is their big

1668
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:04,960
references at the time it's like yeah we were if we were nowadays talking about like i don't know

1669
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:12,880
like oh i'm feeling real malignant in this so like i don't know i can't i'm feeling real malignant

1670
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:20,080
i haven't watched it i just know it's a thing what's what are the other things who painted the shung

1671
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:30,000
chi these are the two things people talk about bts tickets for their tour i'm going to see bts

1675
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:56,240
i'm just thinking let there be carnage look up the google the name of the i was praying to the

1676
01:51:56,240 --> 01:52:02,400
patron saints of newark that flight was so rocky who could go for a licorice pizza

1677
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:11,440
oh if only cryogenics worked and we could have a hundred and twenty-five year old bob

1678
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:17,200
hoe truly would be the spirit of eternal youth oh man we could we could ride for one bob hope for

1679
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:23,120
ity special be able to buy a house yeah that's true the old economy economics of comedy back

1680
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:29,200
in the day well look the economic economics are not wrong because now it's a bunch of weird

1681
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:35,360
shit that most 10 000 people watch or listen to back then this special that were like kind of

1682
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:40,320
boring right kind of bad stand up and not a you know boring glenn campers this is watched by

1683
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:51,200
a 52 million people yeah yeah those numbers uh um but no the topicality it's it was different

1684
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:57,440
you know you it is such that you sometimes have to do research to figure out what the joke was

1685
01:52:57,440 --> 01:53:04,560
as in this case which is he's referencing the different lands he says they got a place fantasy

1686
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:11,760
land that's like spiro agnew winning the national open and at first i'm like all right national was

1687
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:16,560
of what does that mean okay context clues golf could be golf when he was on the simpsons

1688
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:20,480
he asked you the mayor what's the mayor's name quimby got it and then he made a joke about mayor

1689
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:27,680
quimby being a bad golfer uh so okay that must be with that is spew agnew was nixon's vice president

1690
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:34,320
so was spiro agnew a bad golfer i look up spiro agnew golf and it turns out that about seven months

1691
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:41,040
prior at bob hope's own golf tournament that uh there was a foursome and the foursome was

1692
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:48,720
bob hope willy maize baseball willy maize a pro golfer named doug sanders and the vice

1693
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:53,680
sitting vice president spiro agnew and that is that is a foursome at this golf tournament

1694
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:59,120
they all tee up this is the first this is hole number one spiro agnew takes his first shot

1695
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:05,280
immediately hits two people in the stands an older husband and wife they happen to be if you're going

1696
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:12,080
to hit people make sure they're married helps to keep the lawsuits tight here so he goes up to the

1697
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:18,080
woman charms her like i'm so so well if there's anything i can do kisses her on the arm just

1698
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:24,800
denoted that d wow the vice president hit me with a golf ball and kissed me uh then he goes all right

1699
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:29,760
and everybody charms everybody applause applause great he goes back to the tee uh tees off again

1700
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:36,800
immediately hits somebody else hits them harder and worse uh yeah a woman half that age who had

1701
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:41,040
to go to the hospital and get an x-ray for it it's like dick cheney shooting the guy on

1702
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:48,240
hunt and hunting he was the he was a pioneer vice president's in farming other uh wow well and you

1703
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:58,400
don't even know the half of it because it turns like the year prior he uh hit somebody in the face

1704
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:05,280
he shot a golf ball into somebody's face persuading dick cheney's bullet and the person who he hit in

1705
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:12,320
the face was doug sanders the other guy in the foursome who they still wow this guy still

1706
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:17,840
voluntarily after being hit in the face by him is like yeah sure sign me up i'll go out that's wild

1707
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:24,240
three people three uh people in the stands with two balls so that's the best joke in the set it

1708
01:55:24,240 --> 01:55:31,920
kind of is yeah bob was there he knew it he heard the screams he saw the bruises personal connection

1709
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:37,600
autobiographical yeah wow that's okay that's a good joke this is an honest set and that's why

1710
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:42,800
an honest joke at least and that's why it was so funny yeah like people wouldn't be upset with him

1711
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:46,880
like they're upset with malaney now because he would hope was more honest than his standup

1712
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:53,520
jesus i'm just saying you know you felt so betrayed yeah i know i thought bob hope would

in the back golf course on it yeah and to luke lake over here so good christmas displays my

1719
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:30,800
parents would take me to sit sure this is bob and delores and delores supervises it and remember

1720
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:35,680
all this because you'll probably run out of ideas and do a second gate on your podcast about this

1721
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:40,960
that's it it's a title you should use by the way second gate that was when i was nine right and

1722
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:45,840
she was they were right um so that's what that joke was and any other jokes that we want to

1723
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:50,960
name check did anyone else do any deep dives into what a joke meant no i'm glad you did because

1724
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:56,160
i actually yeah ignored that one and i think that you got the juiciest one because the other ones

1725
01:56:56,160 --> 01:57:02,320
yeah also keep in mind that after all that he he's a horrible golfer uh injuring people every time

1726
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:07,200
he plays and then two years later he's the first vice president to resign due to criminal charges

1727
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:16,880
spiro coming stay tuned that's coming back around later what criminal charges will come back up

1728
01:57:17,200 --> 01:57:23,040
later in this episode oh my god okay how much how far are you anticipating two more hours

1729
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:31,040
it's entirely possible um well if we're done with bob hope who by the way comes back in an even more

1730
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:36,000
boring segment of the special god yeah they just give him like a little a non-comedic monologue a

1731
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:40,480
wistful monologue at the lake i was reading i was reading how a lot of people were very annoyed

1732
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:43,760
with bob hope over the years like johnny carson was annoyed because he would he would like bring

1733
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:47,360
something up like oh so bob i hear you just came back from a tour and he go yeah

1734
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:55,600
on the show not a giving comedic partner yeah it seems like we just get drag on a talk show great

1735
01:57:55,600 --> 01:58:02,320
thanks for coming yeah there is um something in the special directly in my uh line of interest

1736
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:15,280
which is the 1,700 so no sorry 1,076 piece marching band led by the music man creator composer

1737
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:23,040
meredith wilson and they play 76 trombones marching down main street uh there are indeed 76

1738
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:32,960
trombones in this ensemble uh and uh i it is very funny that they are uh playing a song

1739
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:40,640
from a musical about a con man who hoodwinks like average american joes into spending a lot of money

1740
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:47,120
the opaque of walt Disney world uh but as it is it's just a music man is that what you're saying

1741
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:53,120
yeah he's not it's a funny selection even though like they do occasionally here on main street

1742
01:58:53,840 --> 01:59:00,400
uh yeah that's true no they play the more con manny song yeah they no they play their joe and t song

1743
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:06,480
that kind of is often played removed from it but there there are stories about um people in the

1744
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:12,400
marching band like you know kids in the marching band and stuff and like the one kid you know their

1745
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:17,440
busk was really late arriving and roy oh disney came out and shook their hands and said hi and

1746
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:22,960
then meredith wilson sent like letters saying like thanks for being a part of this like like

1747
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:29,280
to everyone in the in the band seemingly to uh people in the band wow yeah and as we know i

1748
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:33,680
marched in a marching band down main street when i was in high school and i did not get a letter

1749
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:39,920
from the real from the real wilson meredith wilson who was possibly dead although you know

1750
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:44,480
probably dead at this point we played late in the evening by paul simon and i did not get a

1751
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:49,920
letter from paul simon well but paul simon also wasn't leading your band down main street i maybe

1752
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:55,360
he was no well i don't know maybe he was i don't think he was i don't you would have led with that

1753
01:59:55,360 --> 02:00:00,320
as the main part of the story yeah i guess you're right i wasn't first time ever he led a marching

1754
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:08,000
theme park it's possible in the late early 2000s paul simon was leading a marching band down main

1755
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:17,440
street in disney world it's eclectic the music's eclectic yeah um yeah so uh yeah it's a weird

1756
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:23,200
special i mean that i'm glad you're charmed by that marching band thing but it also lasts for i want

1757
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:28,160
to say 25 minutes most at the end of the special yeah most of the back half of the special

1758
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:35,760
which marching band on television doesn't really yeah this isn't like drum line or something

1759
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:41,520
drum line is awesome like a real hold on energy performance before the marching band there's an

1760
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:48,640
orchestra so pretty dynamic people sitting perfectly still in chairs playing instruments

1761
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:54,800
before the walking instruments man yeah it's it's uh it's quite a special there's also some

1762
02:00:54,800 --> 02:01:00,880
sketches where jonathan winter shoots his wife with an arrow oh yeah these jonathan winter sketches

1763
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:13,760
brutal i would say yeah yeah this feels like the first like improv on tv in the early 70s

1764
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:19,120
i could be wrong this could be scripted but kind of his thing was that true it was yes jonathan

1765
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:27,040
winters would improvise uh a lot but these uh these don't land i would say no and he plays a

1766
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:35,600
final tracker final swamp man yeah there's some characters some characters but buddy hack it does

1767
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:42,640
drive her with the love bug yes along tomorrowland's b-way route against actual race car drivers oh with

1768
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:51,040
chick hern my uh beloved uh basketball announcer of my youth la guy right yeah surprised to see him

1769
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:55,520
in a florida thing right so yeah that's nice so yeah there's some hat you get some hack it he's

1770
02:01:55,520 --> 02:02:03,200
got energy at least you know and he's in the music man he is he does shabu be that's right so you got

1771
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:10,080
that connection yeah very exciting more music man content you know did he dine on like chopped

1772
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:15,440
sirloin in a pear with uh meredith wilson at the contemporary or whatever gross food they were

1773
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:21,440
serving at the time uh and i hope you are prepared you got trouble for the future podcast to ride live

1774
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:27,440
music show i'm working on it because yeah you will be performing that i did it at karaoke i did it in

1775
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:32,640
the one week we did we're all hanging out without this yes you did yeah that was a beautiful week

1776
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:41,600
hopefully soon um so that's that's the founded that's the founding of it that's the special

1777
02:02:41,600 --> 02:02:49,200
that that takes us up to 1971 and now we're up and running and creating magic and memories for

1778
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:56,400
generations to come it's 50 years of of incredible moments occur after all this and i think it's safe

1779
02:02:56,400 --> 02:03:03,280
to say that disney didn't peak at the beginning with glenn campbell monologues and lengthy marching

1780
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:08,480
band performances so many wonderful things happened in the intervening years and that

1781
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:14,880
is what we wanted to close this episode with is determining what is the greatest moment

1782
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:22,320
in the history of the walt disney world resort or the greatest thing that ever happened there i

1783
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:27,440
don't know i don't want to like completely define i don't know what all of our answers are and and

1784
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:35,200
i don't want to shut anyone out but we do want to determine in 50 years what is the best stuff

1785
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:39,600
that ever occurred there and i guess is this a situation where we all present something and

1786
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:45,040
then the audience will decide where else having obviously correctly picked the three we've narrowed

1787
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:52,640
it down to the three um and there there can only be one um is that fair to say i think so yeah that'll

1788
02:03:52,640 --> 02:03:57,360
be the best obviously it's going to be real hard to do this but yeah you go we i think that'll be

1789
02:03:57,360 --> 02:04:04,720
the yeah it's going to be personal to us obviously i just want to add that i think so yeah yeah uh we

1790
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:11,840
it's impossible to um you know take ourselves out of the the running and our our our memories and

1791
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:17,760
happy moments we've had and you know we'd like to hear your ideas of what the greatest moment in

1792
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:22,720
disney world history is you might will be incorrect one of us will be correct but we'd still like to

1793
02:04:22,720 --> 02:04:27,920
hear them anyway of course yes try uh but so that that's what we're doing between between the three

1794
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:30,640
of us we're going to figure out what's the best thing that ever happened on the property does

1795
02:04:30,640 --> 02:04:35,200
anybody want to i don't want to start you don't want to start too proud too much pressure uh i

1796
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:42,560
could jason what do you think um i could go where do you want to go okay richard nixon

1797
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:47,360
there's a lot of richard nixon stuff and oh well the career is the criminal

1798
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:54,400
yeah so i didn't want to be you know very basic and go with i am not a crook richard nixon of

1799
02:04:54,400 --> 02:05:02,800
course delivers his famous line i am not a crook at the contemporary hotel in uh 1973 in front in

1800
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:09,440
front of 400 managing editors of the associated press so that was was an associated press thing

1801
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:15,520
yeah in the lion's den now uh there's some interesting stuff on the nixon library website

1802
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:23,760
that they could nixon seemed like he wanted to be at the opening of disney world and there was

1803
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:29,680
scouting there was a scouting trip to go wow and there is a page of potential remarks that the

1804
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:35,840
president could say yeah that i did this is like possible speech possible speech stuff said yeah

1805
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:42,800
uh he did not end up going there was a lot going on in 1971 nixon had just accepted the invite

1806
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:50,880
to china uh that was historic um the the uh uh group called the plumbers had just broken into

1807
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:56,640
the offices of daniel elsberg who had released the pentagon papers in september uh whatever they were

1808
02:05:56,640 --> 02:06:04,800
attempting to do failed uh i a big troop drawdown in vietnam occurred in december 1971 there we go

1809
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:11,280
so it seemed like it would have been poor taste for the president to show up that said the white

1810
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:18,000
house did send an american flag and who was the representative hr haldeman the chief of staff who

1811
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:23,920
would go on to spend 18 months in prison for conspiracy and obstruction of justice student

1812
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:31,120
was rolling watergate criminal charges as we mentioned earlier wow hr aldeman brought a flag

1813
02:06:31,120 --> 02:06:37,360
to the opening to the opening haldeman is credited on imdb in the opening special and i could not

1814
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:44,560
find him i was wondering if he was possibly in the crowd shots of the um marching band or the

1815
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:51,520
marching band is he doing a character with jonathan winters um uh but yeah i don't know

1816
02:06:51,520 --> 02:06:59,360
if he's in the crowd of the bob hope thing but uh nixon kind of a big seemingly disney dork i would

1817
02:06:59,360 --> 02:07:06,880
say like like i would guess that nixon is you're going dork i'm going with a disney nerd like us

1818
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:13,520
like he was like he was at the opening of the monorail he drove the monorail he uh is from

1819
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:18,720
orange county originally seemed like he wanted to be at the opening of disney world he's buried

1820
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:25,200
15 miles from disneyland well that doesn't mean he's a disneyland dork i think he was buried with

1821
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:31,520
we might be buried that close he had a lot of former disney people on staff like disney corporate

1822
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:37,360
people he had former jungle crew skippers on stand like toke holvig the the voice of goofy was

1823
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:42,640
involved in the break-in he went to jail for several years people like they drop pins disney

1824
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:49,680
pins on his grave every day he's a pin collector in the after as far as after the afterlife i guess

1825
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:58,080
and while he was not there for the opening ceremonies or anything nixon and his family

1826
02:07:58,080 --> 02:08:04,000
would go a number of times over the years not just for the i am i am not a crook speech uh so

1827
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:09,120
i am going to award the best thing that ever happened is this moment where richard nixon

1828
02:08:09,120 --> 02:08:16,720
and his grandson meet dreamfinder and figment it's a perfectly symmetrical picture uh it's

1829
02:08:16,720 --> 02:08:24,880
wow that's crazy i didn't know i've not seen that picture icons yeah wow icons meeting uh there is

1830
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:33,760
also i think a less iconic photo of uh nixon uh standing in front of spaceship earth yeah i've

1831
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:41,120
seen that okay and if you zoom in you will notice that the buttons on his suit are different so this

1832
02:08:41,120 --> 02:08:46,400
is a different day this is either a different day from the same trip or a different trip when

1833
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:52,000
nixon was hitting up ebcot center i sorry to cut you i'm obsessed with the idea of like nixon disney

1834
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:56,400
dork like did you listen to the new jim hill and lentester what they were talking about the new rides

1835
02:08:56,640 --> 02:09:01,280
by the way it's my gruff is uh is my nixon have you read mice chat today

1836
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:08,160
i believe they were trying to get a hold the nixon library i think they mentioned that they like

1837
02:09:08,160 --> 02:09:12,320
he really liked watching movies and they were really trying to get a hold of like the disney

1838
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:20,640
nature movies to show in the white house sure he uh he's obviously a fascinating uh character uh and

1839
02:09:21,200 --> 02:09:25,840
i can see that being the greatest moment the greatest moment was the accords

1840
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:32,560
nixon nixon uh-huh and figment and dreamfinder oh man this is throwing me for a loop i feel like

1841
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:36,480
i'm gonna call an audible here and switch what i'm gonna say do you need a minute

1842
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:43,440
well no i can i'll talk through it um dreamfinder dreamfinder talked him out of bombing the uh dykes

1843
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:51,280
in vietnam cabodian really grant told him to bomb it and flood the areas oh man nixon disney dork

1844
02:09:51,280 --> 02:09:55,360
that feels like if we did more characters on this show that's like well all of a sudden like the

1845
02:09:55,360 --> 02:10:01,280
not like a knock at the door and we're like who is it oh richard nixon nixon too many characters

1846
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:07,200
i'm glad this harmonica show still seems kind of ethereal and weird and not just character moments

1847
02:10:07,200 --> 02:10:12,160
that just say that tokyo disney's anniversary merchandise contains the return of final mission

1848
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:17,360
for both just like i am not a crook always yes you yeah mike is doing it only with peace signs

1849
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:22,400
which is the way to do it always peace signs up yeah they announced the 50th desserts these look

1850
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:30,640
like some delicious treats the iridescent croissant donut it's got blue icing and sprinkles i don't

1851
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:36,400
know a way to celebrate 50 magical years of dreams look clearly it's working for them but i don't

1852
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:43,120
understand why they keep making the ears out of different colored walls uh chapek

1853
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:54,160
i love that that's gonna be a recurring character i think bringing back capital punishments just for

1854
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:01,280
by president's orders chapek straight to the chair

1855
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:08,640
uh okay so there are many significant yeah moments that happen obviously uh the nixon stuff

1856
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:15,760
john lennon signing the papers to dissolve the beetles at the polynesian saint is with may pang

1857
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:22,160
as long one of his long weekends with away from yoko uh i guess i'm gonna steal away from that i

1858
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:27,600
was also thinking i was gonna do maybe you know we mentioned earlier alan thick sings the christmas

1859
02:11:27,600 --> 02:11:33,120
song with the ninja turtles that was also cut from my an insane if we both thought it it's

1860
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:38,560
got to be in content yeah we play this on our original christmas specials episode the alan

1861
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:45,360
thick ninja turtles santa claus is coming to town rap it's crazy i really did almost think about

1862
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:50,160
saying that and it's like that should be it too and it's like how do i stack up these important

1863
02:11:50,160 --> 02:11:55,440
moments with all these cultural figures so it's like maybe that a fourth in the pole like that's

1864
02:11:55,440 --> 02:12:00,560
the honorable mention is the alan thick i mean if maybe just by virtue of both of us thinking of

1865
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:05,680
it because it is a hell of a yeah yeah but you know what i better watch out dude i'm talking

1866
02:12:05,680 --> 02:12:12,080
about your moves you better watch out freak out santa claus is coming to town that's a whole maybe

1867
02:12:12,080 --> 02:12:18,320
christmas second gate is that song i think sure i mean look if you i would love to just do uh all

1868
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:24,240
the alan thick musical numbers i think that is also five that i'm so fond of i think maybe that's a

1869
02:12:24,720 --> 02:12:30,000
we call it ninja turtles and alan thick and it's a catch-all yes because there's there's a ninja

1870
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:34,640
there's a ninja turtle christmas special that's oh with this with the what do we get splinter for

1871
02:12:34,640 --> 02:12:40,560
christmas yes and there's a couple other things too that are in the ninja turtle uh so the thick

1872
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:45,520
and turtle catch-all is coming in the christmas season i think the thick and turtle connection

1873
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:53,040
the big thick big turtle christmas a big thick turtle christmas is coming this christmas ever

1874
02:12:53,040 --> 02:12:58,000
so you know what i gotta say i'm gonna i'm gonna go on to all that important stuff all the all the

1875
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:01,920
stuff happened i'm gonna declare the most important thing that happened in disney world is the

1876
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:10,960
the video of my mother and i singing gregoria stephan song that is on youtube if you don't

1877
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:15,520
know if you haven't heard the episode i talk about it they used to be able to make a music video

1878
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:21,120
and uh there's a video of my mother and i in the year like 1990 and i am grabbing my crotch the

1879
02:13:21,120 --> 02:13:26,720
whole time because i am scared and i don't know the words two cameras on you the pressure two

1880
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:33,840
cameras it's a beautiful 1980s-ish like background singing one two three four come on baby say you

1881
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:40,160
love me five six seven time uh we'll repost this this is maybe the most i think this i wanted i

1882
02:13:40,160 --> 02:13:45,760
wanted to pick something personal yeah um and this is this is probably this is beating out another

1883
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:50,240
great clip that we have not put up anywhere yet is that my sister and i dancing on the deck of the

1884
02:13:50,240 --> 02:13:55,520
pollination with these like light strands and i hit myself in the eye very hard with one of them

1885
02:13:56,320 --> 02:14:00,800
like i just knocked myself out of commission really hard and that's a great moment too but

1886
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:07,360
it's not as iconic as me singing with my mother at age five grabbing my crotch the entire almost

1887
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:13,040
almost the entire time yes is that disney mgm studios yes the spot of this yes it was at mgm

1888
02:14:13,040 --> 02:14:17,520
studios you were you could make your own music video and you'd pick the song and then uh you

1889
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:22,160
could go in there i think they probably too was the limit of people i haven't seen a lot of other

1890
02:14:22,160 --> 02:14:27,760
people with this exact like video so i'm sure they're out there um but i have to pick it

1891
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:35,200
personally and that's the most iconic thing for my life so yeah yeah post that and um ironically

1892
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:40,240
as an adult grabbing your crotch makes you nervous but back then you would be nervous

1893
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:46,400
and you would find comfort grabbing crotch wait wait say that again i know i've been trying to

1894
02:14:46,400 --> 02:14:51,440
think of it and i just didn't stick the landing on that wait what is it i was saying your crotch

1895
02:14:51,440 --> 02:14:56,400
business as an adult would make you incredibly nervous and sweaty and as a kid it would be a

1896
02:14:56,400 --> 02:15:00,640
source of comfort you're saying now if there was a video of me grabbing my crotch i would find it

1897
02:15:00,640 --> 02:15:07,280
indecent yeah it would just be a source of a video of that would be neurotic anxiety body video of an

1898
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:12,800
adult man in his 30s grabbing his genitalia yeah well if it's in like if it's in the context of

1899
02:15:12,800 --> 02:15:18,160
like a hip-hop performance then it's fine but as far as like me at 37 because i'm afraid

1900
02:15:18,160 --> 02:15:24,400
i think i meant any crotch business in general like generating neuroses yeah no if i was off

1901
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:30,000
by crotch business if it's the same video only i'm in my 30s with my mother grabbing my crotch yeah

1902
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:37,040
that's weird you're right i agree with you yeah um okay so you're locking in your own my own

1903
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:44,640
personal grades it's nixon it's mike carlson yeah his mother uh it's icons and that's sort

1904
02:15:44,640 --> 02:15:50,640
of what i was um well let me here let me frame it this way in my my highfalutin way we were

1905
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:56,080
talking about the the founding of walt disney world and how it all comes from a great man

1906
02:15:56,080 --> 02:16:05,040
walt disney trying to create a hub of technology and innovation uh but thankfully uh you know

1907
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:10,160
nearly halfway through the run through the 50 years a better man shows up by the name of

1908
02:16:10,160 --> 02:16:16,560
michael eisner and uh he has a more achievable dream because the other shit didn't happen he

1909
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:21,040
didn't make the progress city but eisner thinks that it can be something else the disney world

1910
02:16:21,040 --> 02:16:27,600
can be a hub of the arts and that's what it became under his watch a place where architects can do

1911
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:34,320
some of their their greatest masterworks and a place where uh performers and musicians even

1912
02:16:34,320 --> 02:16:41,120
can have a have a backdrop uh to play against and these things uh dovetail came together in a in a

1913
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:46,640
beautiful way in the most beautiful way in the most important piece of art produced on the property

1914
02:16:46,640 --> 02:16:54,480
uh i am talking about uh with the backdrop of the yacht and beach resort hotel uh the uh mmc music

1915
02:16:54,480 --> 02:17:01,840
video for the song king of wishful thinking you know if you i you are you familiar with this one

1916
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:06,560
this like pops up enough i feel like is like a disney world oddity or do either of you know what

1917
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:12,240
i'm yeah you know the one that i'm i'm talking about uh so and i think some of our audience

1918
02:17:12,240 --> 02:17:17,520
might as well if you don't uh look it up look i'll play a second of it but it's not really going to

1919
02:17:17,520 --> 02:17:22,560
you know be anything because really you need the visuals you need to be in disney world but

1920
02:17:22,560 --> 02:17:29,200
nonetheless because i wanted you know i want to hear the song first of all the the original song

1921
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:35,360
itself by the way king of wishful thinking by go west is a masterpiece uh so it's just nice to

1922
02:17:35,360 --> 02:17:42,320
hear it and nice to see the beautiful resort uh we meet our our hero and our musician uh blaine

1923
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:49,680
so it's blaine from the mmc this is a song by blaine and uh blaine is waiting in a restaurant

1924
02:17:49,680 --> 02:17:55,360
uh that's also at the hotel presumably where people are wearing island casual clothes and

1925
02:17:55,360 --> 02:18:01,120
there's lots of like teal and turquoise curtains even though the mater d is like a fancy tuxedo man

1926
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:06,320
right and he asks if anybody's anybody else is going to be joining you and he is sad because no

1927
02:18:06,320 --> 02:18:11,600
it's an empty chair um there's a line about cutting me to the bone and then his the guy's

1928
02:18:11,600 --> 02:18:16,400
reflection is in a knife uh i'm not sure where to pick it up i'm here i'll just i'll just do it

1929
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:22,640
from here and see where we land or maybe like chorus number two well first of all here i'll

1930
02:18:22,640 --> 02:18:26,800
pick it up from here there's our there's our yacht and beach club lighthouse uh

1931
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:33,600
beautiful instrumentation

1932
02:18:36,240 --> 02:18:40,880
there were at that uh uh that mgm studios thing where you're in the ship that's getting stormed

1933
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:48,160
on they're using that uh-huh he's in a row boat out in that lake i don't know what that lake's called

1934
02:18:52,800 --> 02:19:01,360
uh blaine is killing it blaine's dynamic as hell yeah yeah that's not how it's gonna be

1935
02:19:03,440 --> 02:19:10,160
i'm really building to one moment mater d's checking it on him

1936
02:19:10,160 --> 02:19:13,680
me

1937
02:19:16,560 --> 02:19:23,280
mainly that that he's like he's in a boat in this thing uh and then the the boat the line is you've

1938
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:28,640
made a hole in my heart and then the boat has a big sign that says my heart that's the name of the

1939
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:35,120
bow and has a hole in it um later he he's the song is about him being a king and then there's a card

1940
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:41,360
that comes up and he's he's the king he is the king of wishful thinking it is a happy ending

1941
02:19:41,360 --> 02:19:45,680
the girl of his dreams shows up at the end that's great and you get to see beautiful views of a

1942
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:54,640
beautiful resort uh it's uh it's it's a hell of a jam and uh i i think it's a uh formative foundational

1943
02:19:54,640 --> 02:20:02,960
piece of art that was thanks to eisner being like a benefactor um you know like as with you know

1944
02:20:02,960 --> 02:20:09,360
george harrison financing the monty python movies of course yeah yeah he eisner set up a

1945
02:20:10,160 --> 02:20:16,240
playbox for great artists like blaine to play in and that's why my choice is blaine and the

1946
02:20:16,240 --> 02:20:23,280
rest of the mmc with king of wishful thinking look wow great that's great yeah um so and you know

1947

1950
02:20:39,520 --> 02:20:46,960
important place that brought golden greats to it throughout its first 50 years and here's hope and

closing thoughts about this wonderful place uh i just want to know uh what nixon thinks of al

1962
02:21:56,480 --> 02:22:01,920
lutz and the controversy and that's what i'm wondering i don't think he was real

1963
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:09,120
it was a sciop al lutz was a number of people operating former user name cia

1964
02:22:11,120 --> 02:22:16,000
and i also would like to my nixon to get away from mcgruff if you yeah yeah figure i figure out the

1965
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:21,920
way to try to move it away um and speaking of icons visiting the park i think the the the best

1966
02:22:21,920 --> 02:22:26,640
way to go out this is something that i discovered on the 15th anniversary special where people are

1967
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:32,880
wishing uh disney world at that point a happy 50th 15th birthday but why not a happy 50th as well
