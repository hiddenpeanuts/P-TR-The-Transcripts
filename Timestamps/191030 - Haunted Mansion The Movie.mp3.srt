00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,920
Welcome, Foolish Patreon subscribers, to Hauntcast this week.

2
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,320
It's the Fright, the Cemetery Gate.

3
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,320
I'm Rod Skardner, joined by Mike Koffinson and Jason Skeleton.

4
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,120
Boo to you, listeners.

5
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:48,720
Let's boo this, as the advertising in the Magic Kingdom says for the Halloween party.

6
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,800
Oh yeah, there was that as soon as, that was one of the first things I saw at the Orlando

7
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,800
airport.

8
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
Let's boo this.

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,800
Let's boo this.

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,800
Let's boo this.

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
Yeah.

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,800
Like let's do this.

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,800
Yes.

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:07,080
Let's all boo this, and this is a film that deserves boos.

15
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,080
Yeah.

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,400
And I don't mean do's, but flipped.

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,600
I mean, this is a, yeah, I mean, we knew, obviously we knew, and we're talking about

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,280
the, if you didn't fully, if you didn't pay attention to whatever we titled this, it is

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,920
not, we're not doing some, God knows we are not chipping off Haunted Mansion the Ride

20
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,040
over here on the second gate.

21
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,720
This is about the Haunted Mansion film from 2003.

22
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,720
2003.

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,960
Starring one Eddie Murphy.

24
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,960
Yeah.

25
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,720
Which we all subjected ourselves to.

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,880
But you know, before we get into that, this is sort of, this will close out Haunt Cast

27
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,600
the Fright for this year, and this is the last episode for October.

28
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,760
And I would be remiss if I didn't say just at the top of the episode, if you're waffling,

29
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,840
if you're thinking about not continuing to subscribe to the second gate, big stuff coming

30
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
in November.

31
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
Oh, sure.

32
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,840
Stay tuned.

33
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,160
A lot of fun, some adventures, some guests, which we don't always do behind the second

34
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,960
or cemetery gate.

35
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,720
So fun stuff's coming up.

36
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,240
Keep subscribing and thanks for subscribing.

37
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
Yes.

38
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,240
Yes.

39
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
I agree with all of it.

40
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,240
Sure.

41
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,240
Thanks.

42
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,240
Glad I said it.

43
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,240
Glad I got it out there.

44
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,960
This is also our first episode we're recording since we got back from Chicago and Orlando.

45
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,960
Oh yeah.

46
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
More of that soon.

47
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,000
For anybody who was there, this is the first chance to say thank you.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Thank you to everyone.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,920
I think we probably personally met some folks who are listening to this right now.

50
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
Thanks for everything.

51
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,920
Oh my God.

52
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,640
Some of the most, like, getting to leave a show where you had a good time and then face

53
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,400
a hallway full of people wearing shirts affiliated with this podcast or shirts affiliated with

54
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,920
the parks that we like so much.

55
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,920
And some people gave us things and just delightful conversations and a really wonderful time.

56
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,360
Real highlights in trips that included lots of fun stuff anyway.

57
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
So that's saying something.

58
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,600
And then meeting all of you is some of the best stuff.

59
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,960
So Dan, thank you for coming out.

60
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
Thank you for saying hello.

61
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,560
All of it.

62
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
Yeah.

63
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,920
And if you want Podcast the Ride to come to your town, it remains a little confusing how

64
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,080
to tell if enough of an audience in a place will come out.

65
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,600
So if you're in a place, you know, tweet or email and say, come to my place.

66
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Not your house.

67
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,920
But still not a great way to tell if we can draw a crowd.

68
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,840
Two of those emails. But if we get, you know, 100 to 200.

69
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
That's true.

70
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,840
That's true.

71
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
Yes.

72
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
Let us know.

73
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,840
OK.

74
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,520
But boy, we would like to do more tours and shows.

75
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
Yeah, we'll do that.

76
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
Yeah.

77
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
Yeah.

78
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,520
But for now, let's talk about a terrible movie.

79
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
Yeah.

80
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,520
All right.

81
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,520
Let's talk about this bad movie.

82
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,400
Kind of boring, too.

83
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,960
That's the real crime of it.

84
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,800
Agreed.

85
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
That's the rub.

86
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,080
Look, let's do right here right now.

87
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,440
We need to agree that if we're going to do more of these movies, they have to be like

88
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,200
bad, bad, not bad.

89
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,040
Well, that's the trouble that we have because it's hard to tell.

90
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,720
Only other real movie review we've done, Aladdin.

91
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
Yes. Yes.

92
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,640
Which is also I feel more boring bad than bad bad.

93
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,080
Yeah. But I like Aladdin a lot more than this.

94
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,560
I would agree. I would agree.

95
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,480
And that's a thought resonating with me throughout that you're tempted to go, well,

96
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,200
movies now, Disney movies are just recycling the IP and they're out of ideas and

97
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,880
they're just these like dull trod's.

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,960
And then you see what a real dull trod used to be.

99
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,840
Yeah. Back in the early 2000s.

100
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,960
I meant to I was going to buy this because there's like a ten dollar for movie

101
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,960
set you can get.

102
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
That's this the Tower of Terror.

103
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,680
Kirsten Dunst, which I have fond memories of, which I'm not sure.

104
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,920
I'm the same level of this movie.

105
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,920
I argue.

106
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,760
I have to think that's better.

107
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,600
Disney ABC night like like Sunday night movie or something.

108
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,600
It should have been. Were it not Eddie Murphy, there's nothing keeping it out of that

109
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,720
territory. Yes.

110
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,680
Country Bears is on this disk.

111
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,840
That at least seems interesting.

112
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,520
Yes. Well, I have to do that for specifically like research purposes and for claims made

113
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,640
by people that I won't mention.

114
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:22,840
And then a thing that seems much it seems still to me seems like it's

115
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,760
actually a mass hallucination.

116
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:31,880
The Mr. Toad Wind in the Willows live action movie by a bunch of money Python, a

117
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,000
bunch of British comedians in the 90s that I learned about like three months.

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I was like, no way.

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,200
Yeah. Michael Palin did what?

120
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,480
It's pretty quiet.

121
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,840
I think that maybe that movie was a bigger deal in England.

122
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
I think so.

123
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,520
And maybe not called Mr.

124
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,400
Toad's Wild Ride in England.

125
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,280
I think it was not.

126
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,360
I think that was a way to put a more recognizable title on it in America.

127
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,600
Was it still a Toad Man, though?

128
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,280
Was it a different Toad Man?

129
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,320
I think it is.

130
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,960
And I think they just ice.

131
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,600
They were branding it with the ride specifically something like the instead of

132
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:10,400
when in the wind, when country bears insure like I'm curious.

133
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,640
Yeah, I wasn't even curious in 2003.

134
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,520
Yeah, I didn't see it in the theater.

135
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah, no, I didn't see.

136
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,880
I didn't see it.

137
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,920
I think I was like in my first semester of college, so I don't think I was like,

138
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,480
hey, everyone, let's go see this theme park movie.

139
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,960
Yeah, I was running up my film school.

140
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,040
Like I'm finally in film school with intellectual giants and I can go

141
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:40,320
appreciate the cinema Kill Bill Part One and Lost in Translation and make way

142
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,640
too big of a deal out of both of those movies.

143
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,480
Matrix opening night, Matrix Revolutions.

144
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
Of course.

145
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,640
Um, yeah, we were I wasn't seeing this kind of trash in November,

146
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,520
sort of 2003, I was trying to improve myself as a person being educated.

147
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,680
Luckily, though, you would regress years later.

148
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,240
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

149
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,360
I now like, please let me show you the like agreed upon top 10 films of the year

150
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,200
and let me tell you how few of them I saw.

151
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,800
I'll give myself credit.

152
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,440
I think this was one of the first connections I made where like, oh, wait,

153
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,080
they saw Pirates of the Caribbean was successful.

154
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,920
So they did Haunted Mansion and it seems like they did a worse job.

155
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,680
They were greenlit around the same time because what is Pirates the same year?

156
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,920
I believe. Yeah. So they wouldn't be seen it.

157
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:34,640
And then, yeah, I think there was maybe a mass operation of let's do theme park

158
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:40,800
stuff. Country Bears got figured out first, then Pirates, then Haunted Mansion.

159
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,840
And it's weird to think about how it all just seemed like sort of this junky pile

160
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,920
at once. And then isn't it weird in retrospect that Pirates of the Caribbean

161
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:57,320
was so much stickier and better done and yeah, yeah, it has so much more of an

162
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,240
impact. Like is the agreed upon thing?

163
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,160
I have not I have not seen one Pirates of the Caribbean.

164
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,120
Really? No, not even the first.

165
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,400
No, I know.

166
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,160
I saw it a couple of times.

167
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,280
I know people enjoy that first one especially.

168
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,200
And even some of the other ones, I still like the just like every frame I see looks

169
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,720
unpleasant to me. I haven't seen my taste years.

170
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,000
But is the deal basically that that first one was like, wow, I'm kind of surprised.

171
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,080
And then the and then the rest were garbage.

172
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,760
Yeah, I think that well, I don't know, because the people made a big deal out of it.

173
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,960
I feel like it didn't look bad, which is why people went to see it.

174
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,440
And then I think everyone was very happy with the weird Johnny Depp performance.

175
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,280
It's the it's the full mainstreaming Johnny Depp performance for the first one,

176
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,280
for the first one. Yeah, I kind of have diminishing return, much like the Matrix

177
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,120
sequels. I like the second one.

178
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,360
That's my memory is that I really like the second one.

179
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,680
And then the third one is horrible.

180
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,680
And I don't think I've seen other two more.

181
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,520
Yes, there are. I don't think I've seen either of them told.

182
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,480
Yeah, because there's

183
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
a.

184
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,160
I think there's dead.

185
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,040
I got to look this up now. I think there's five.

186
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,640
I think there's five. Yeah.

187
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,960
So I think now I'll have increasingly worse British rock stars.

188
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,560
Yeah. Paul McCartney was in the last one, right?

189
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,040
Yeah. Yeah. The Richards is in the third one.

190
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,160
Peter Noon is

191
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,720
Jack Sparrow's great uncle.

192
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,080
They're stepping down. Yeah.

193
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,760
Roger Daltrey was in the first one.

194
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,520
He was Will Turner's older brother.

195
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,000
They were going to get to Rod Argent sooner than we are.

196
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,200
But now we do who knows if they're going to make more.

197
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,120
Yeah. I mean, they're going to try because the Craig Mazin is making them.

198
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,080
Yeah. He's writing those friend of writers.

199
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,680
Craig Mazin. Yeah.

200
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,760
We'll be doing some writing all around smart man.

201
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,520
So Curse of the Black Pearl, Dead Man's Chest at World's End

202
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,320
took a break for four years.

203
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,600
Then you got on Stranger Tides.

204
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,280
And just in the last few years, you got is it Dead Men Tell No Tales?

205
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,600
I believe that it would call Dead Men Tell No Tales.

206
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,920
Of course, you wouldn't call the second one that like, well, you know,

207
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,960
what was the second one called? Stranger Tides?

208
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,120
Or is that the third? I don't know.

209
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,240
I forgot the list. I forgot the list being said there's Bill.

210
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,280
There's what's his Mackenzie Crook is in the Pirates movies.

211
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,880
He's what's his name from the office in the English office?

212
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,360
Oh, yes. They're Dwight. They're Dwight.

213
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,080
Gareth. Thank you.

214
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,160
He's very good.

215
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,000
Jack Dawson in the office from Smash.

216
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,640
Bill Nye. Right.

217
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,360
Bill Nye is what's his name?

218
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,480
You know, the bad guy.

219
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,920
Ian McChane. I feel like those movies were different

220
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,600
because they felt like real movies also.

221
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,720
Even when they were bad, they felt like modern big blockbuster movies

222
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,560
whereas Country Bears, which I have not seen all of.

223
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,560
And this movie feel like Sunday night, goofy, don't take themselves seriously,

224
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,600
maybe in a bad way.

225
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,320
Movies still feel cheap.

226
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,200
Yes. Even though, you know, the budget must have been like 80 million dollars.

227
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,960
Yes. It's still just like any frame of Pirates of the Caribbean feels.

228
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,480
This is a big adventure film. Right.

229
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,120
Whether or not you enjoy it, it's like this is like epic and real.

230
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,120
This thing is just so junky.

231
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,400
Posters are junky.

232
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,200
Yeah, they're junky.

233
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,960
Joyless, too. Yeah.

234
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,640
The Haunted Mansion references to the ride feel so crowbarred in.

235
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:38,280
Yes. And and like, well, we have boxes and a drinking game.

236
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,160
Just like, hey, got that one. Got that one. Got that one.

237
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,560
That's a perfect way of saying it.

238
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,240
And it's even more confusing when you think about the director is Rob Minkoff,

239
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,160
who co-directed The Lion King.

240
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:56,040
Yeah. And produced by Don Hahn, who produced The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast.

241
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,880
Oh, Rob Minkoff also involved in the who framed Roger Rabbit shorts

242
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,280
that they did for a few years.

243
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,880
Directed to Tummy Trouble and very, very, very strong live action

244
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,440
or animation, animation and shifted to like to live.

245
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,240
The merger. Well, Stuart Little, Stuart Little, the bridge.

246
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,160
Yeah. Part animation and part.

247
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,800
I remember being charming.

248
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,400
Yeah. Like a charming movie.

249
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,440
Also, Stuart Little, co-written by M.

250
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,240
Knight Shyamalan.

251
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,280
Maybe you should have.

252
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,360
Yes. Stuart Little is co-written by M.

253
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,800
Knight Shyamalan. No idea. Whoa.

254
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,160
By point being that Rob Minkoff, maybe you should have checked in with M.

255
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,800
Knight Shyamalan on how to make a spooky movie.

256
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,680
Scary. This one.

257
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:44,000
This feels like one where I like who I don't know how this all played out.

258
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,120
Yeah. You could blame specific people.

259
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,400
But this also seems like such a the system chose it movie.

260
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,720
It felt like just someone declared like there was papal smoke that said

261
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,920
there will be a Haunted Mansion film.

262
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,040
Yeah. Everyone followed those orders.

263
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,200
Yeah. No one, anyone, anywhere was excited about it.

264
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,240
From from director to Eddie Murphy.

265
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,640
I mean, maybe I you know, who probably enjoyed themselves

266
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,400
is like production designer.

267
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,400
I didn't write down his name, but a very good production designer

268
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,320
who also did Mary Poppins Returns and Rick Baker.

269
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,360
Rick Baker was surprising to see.

270
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,080
Who's doing some podcasts right now, which I recommend.

271
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,080
I haven't heard him on the Gilbert Gottfried one yet,

272
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,080
but his Mark Maron is fantastic.

273
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,920
Oh, man. There's this insane stuff about how he was King Kong

274
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,400
in the 76 King Kong with Jeff Bridges.

275
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,680
And but the producer, Dina De Laurentiis, was so dead set on

276
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,400
we have to advertise the that it was a robot.

277
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,200
It is a robotic Kong, much like they had at Universal Studios later.

278
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,040
It's the first robot con, but it's they used a robot

279
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,480
for only like six seconds of the movie because it didn't work.

280
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,480
And the rest of it is all Rick Baker doing his own makeup, applying his own.

281
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,840
Wow. Really? Like Lon Chaney.

282
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,960
Yeah. Oh, did he do his own?

283
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,200
A lot of those early Universal guys did.

284
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,320
I think Chaney invented a lot of movie monster techniques, like trial and error.

285
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,120
Oh, no kidding. Wow. That's cool stuff.

286
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,160
Anyway, that Rick Baker, it's it just builds to the point

287
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,640
where like Time magazine is coming and you cannot say that you are playing Kong.

288
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,640
We have to keep up the story that it is a robot.

289
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,480
And this is being told to Rick Baker dressed as a full ape.

290
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,320
He's like, what do you want me to say?

291
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,880
Look at me. Like, what is the story I can tell here?

292
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,160
I'm a robot. Yeah.

293
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,840
How about I go to lunch?

294
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,880
That seems like the easiest solution.

295
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,560
Just go hide in a hole. Just go hide. Wow.

296
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,800
Anyway, Dino De Laurentiis seems like that's one that's like,

297
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,280
I could read more on him because every time I feel like there's stuff there,

298
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,680
I feel like there's a Copperfield level.

299
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,280
I would imagine. Yeah.

300
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,600
And part of also the around that same time, the movie Orca,

301
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,080
this bad jaws rip off, which is really, really bonkers.

302
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,320
And what's the relation to Giada Food Network's Giada?

303
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,440
Who is wonderful and perfect.

304
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,040
And I wish my wife and I were friends with.

305
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,160
I don't know.

306
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,440
I think there is a familiar relation.

307
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,680
Yeah. Let me not throw all the De Laurentiis under the bus.

308
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,920
Giada is wonderful.

309
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,320
But so it's also funny that we're talking about this

310
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,640
right during a like if there was ever a shot at the full Eddie Murphy

311
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,080
Renaissance, it seems like we are in the attempt at that right now.

312
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,480
And we were traveling. I've been busy.

313
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,560
I've not gotten to watch. Dolemite is my name.

314
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,840
I really want to like it. I really hope I like it.

315
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,360
It seems like people do.

316
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,120
And that's from that world, those screenwriters, Alexander, Scott and Larry,

317
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,440
whatever did Ed Wood and people who are very fit.

318
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,840
I feel like I am going to like this thing.

319
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,520
I really hope that I do.

320
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,120
And it's cool to see Eddie Murphy like it.

321
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,480
And hopefully that's and all it's coming is good.

322
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,080
And his return to stand up by fingers crossed.

323
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,000
Because I think everybody would like if Eddie Murphy was back in form.

324
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,680
And he's doing all the sequels.

325
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,880
Yeah, he's doing coming up.

326
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,480
Excuse me. Coming to America, too.

327
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,600
Yeah. Right. Right.

328
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,520
And he says Beverly Hills Cop is coming.

329
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,840
And it'd be wonderful if this was all great.

330
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,080
And he was just back in good because we were going back to 2003.

331
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,920
This is certainly the nadir.

332
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,840
This came right after Daddy Daycare,

333
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,920
which is like seems like a highlight in this family run.

334
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,720
Yeah. As opposed to the one before Pluto Nash,

335
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,280
which is for God, Dave.

336
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,440
Meet Dave was like a little later, 2007. OK.

337
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,240
But the family run of Eddie Murphy, truly.

338
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,880
What a dreadful. Yeah.

339
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,680
I'm for him.

340
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,040
I was a little too young for like height of his power.

341
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,000
Eddie Murphy, I think I think Comedy Central used to play coming to America a lot.

342
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,320
Mm hmm. But when I was like a teenager, I knew Eddie Murphy is like,

343
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,400
oh, yeah, used to be a big stand up.

344
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,920
He was on SNL.

345
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,880
He made huge movies in the 80s and now he makes these kind of broad

346
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,720
like nutty professor like, oh, like already that was the read on him.

347
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,320
Yeah. He was he was not one of my guys.

348
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,640
And then when I got older, I saw 48 hours.

349
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,080
I was like, God damn, like, this is good.

350
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,240
Like, this is I liked this a lot.

351
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,600
Yeah. It's also I mean,

352
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,320
I certainly was going through those like best of SNL's.

353
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,480
Yeah. His is just like, I don't know.

354
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,520
It's like a fucking like, you know, punk album where everything's perfect.

355
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,640
Like it's just like, you know, like two minutes, all killer.

356
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,280
Like another one, another one, another one. Yeah.

357
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,040
He's like 20 years old or something. 21. Yeah. Yeah.

358
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,360
Insanely. I stood in and out of there in two and a half years.

359
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,000
Saved the show.

360
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,080
Wouldn't exist without him. Literally. Yeah.

361
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,280
Yeah, I hold him in pretty high regard, but this it was getting tough to.

362
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,000
Do you guys feel bothered at all by like, we're all supposed to forget

363
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,240
that Sandler got very bad and still as bad sometimes.

364
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,600
It just became like, well, I hate doubters.

365
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,440
How dare you and like go back and watch the bad Sandler's.

366
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,080
I can you blame?

367
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,960
Well, we all live in our own reality now more than ever.

368
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,080
So the prequels are good.

369
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,880
Adam Sandler is good.

370
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,280
Like whatever you want.

371
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,920
Not good.

372
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:29,880
Even once there was no not a single time he would not ever you want to live in.

373
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,880
You live in it.

374
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,440
So whatever out there you believe you believe it's real.

375
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,120
Like so. Yeah, I don't know.

376
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,120
I mean, Sandler, I loved Punch Drunk Love when that first came out.

377
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,120
I think it's still a great movie.

378
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,920
I mean, I was saying what Jim Carrey with with Eternal Sunshine, I was like,

379
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,160
oh, cool, these guys are going to be serious actors now.

380
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,920
And that kind of didn't happen.

381
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,760
They just made.

382
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,160
Yeah, those were the peaks.

383
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
Those were the peaks.

384
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,000
But then like Truman Show, Truman Show.

385
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,280
But I mean, I'm psyched for Uncut Gems.

386
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,280
The Sandler.

387
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
Oh, yes.

388
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,280
Yeah.

389
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,000
I think we're in the Sandler Renaissance and I like the Sandler Renaissance and I want the Murphy.

390
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,720
It was starting to feel like there would never be the Murphy Renaissance.

391
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,240
And I think where I seems like a shot.

392
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,120
Well, there's also the Murray.

393
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,840
There's the couple of years where Murray is doing the elephant movie.

394
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,480
And the man who knew too little.

395
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
Oh, yeah.

396
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,080
And it's like I remember being a kid and like thinking he was different now.

397
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,080
I remember I don't know.

398
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,720
I couldn't articulate it, but I remember seeing commercials for that and thinking he was like

399
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,520
the coolest guy because of Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day and then seeing those movies

400
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,280
and just sort of knowing they were like kind of boring ish family movies or something.

401
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,280
Yeah.

402
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,280
And then he like switched.

403
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,760
And this is the start of the Murray Renaissance of like Lost in Translation and then Broken

404
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,000
Flowers and then and then like a different annoying thing.

405
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,880
Of course, is born out of all of this Murray stuff.

406
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,880
But that's another more fans.

407
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,880
Yeah.

408
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,280
But yes, he had a he I feel like he flirted with having that 10 to 15 years.

409
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,120
He only did it in a couple of years, though, of like doing a bunch of stuff for probably

410
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,720
a lot of money and not a lot of days shooting.

411
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,360
I think a lot of these guys fell into I throw Steve Martin in there, too.

412
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:22,560
Like, I think it became just like there's 10 guys who can open comedies and let's just

413
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,560
see who's ready.

414
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,560
Who can we plug in?

415
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,720
And that's how Haunted Mansion feels to me, where this does not feel made for Eddie Murphy.

416
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
Oh, yeah.

417
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,720
No.

418
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,920
What he's doing in it isn't even that Eddie Murphy esque.

419
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,360
And I feel like this just as easily could have been like this to Steve Martin have a

420
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,360
couple of months.

421
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Great.

422
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
Does Bill Murray have a couple months?

423
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,360
Great.

424
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,360
Like, it's just like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think

425
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,360
I don't know.

426
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,360
It feels so phoned in.

427
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,360
Yeah.

428
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,360
He mostly is concerned about real estate deals.

429
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,360
Yes.

430
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,360
This is an extremely pre housing crisis movie.

431
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,360
Yes.

432
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,360
Because this guy sells like four houses in a day and just comes home to grief.

433
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
Yeah.

434
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
The problem in this movie.

435
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,360
Yeah.

436
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,360
Eddie.

437
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,360
So Eddie Murphy is a real estate agent, which is what brings him to the Haunted Mansion

438
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,360
ultimately.

439
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,360
And he's like a workaholic.

440
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,360
And the problem is he's selling too many houses.

441
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,360
Too many people want to buy nice houses from me.

442
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,360
And then there's scenes where characters are like, I don't know, I wanted a different kind

443
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,360
of nice house.

444
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,360
People are being picky about houses.

445
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,360
And Jason, you were just saying there's a similar thing in the movie.

446
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,360
I love you, man.

447
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,360
With.

448
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,360
Oh, yes.

449
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,360
Paul Rudd.

450
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,360
That's also a like the housing market is going to great.

451
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:49,360
I yeah, he was like like Paul Rudd's character in a similar fashion is like, I'm really struggling.

452
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,360
I can't like I can't make a big deal that saved my life.

453
00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:00,360
And then he gets into like a BMW and drives into like a beautiful Los Angeles home.

454
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:07,360
And like it's it's just so it's it's forced in the way of like in this movie.

455
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,360
The the like you're working too much is forced or my probably one of my least favorite parts

456
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:18,360
of this movie, The Sun's Spider Fear, like all this stuff about overcoming fear of spider.

457
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,360
I was like, this sucks.

458
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,360
Like this is rough.

459
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,360
Well, you could see it coming later to play in.

460
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,360
For sure.

461
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,360
It is set up so hard.

462
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,360
How dare a kid not like a spider?

463
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,360
Like setting that up is like a quality.

464
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,360
You can't live your life without a lot of people don't like spiders.

465
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,360
And most of us are not going to end up in a spooky mansion.

466
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,360
So it's OK.

467
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:47,360
I watched and the daughter and it also helps set up that like the daughter is like she's a little braver and a little brasher.

468
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,360
But there's about 15 minutes of joyless behind the scenes B roll on YouTube.

469
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,360
And I thought it was making of.

470
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,360
But it's just, you know, a camcorder shooting them shooting a scene.

471
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:13,360
And I from from behind the actors, I watched the moment where like they pull up to the mansion and like the daughter closes the door too hard.

472
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,360
And he's like, hey, don't do that.

473
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,360
This is a nice machine.

474
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,360
And I'm like, why is this in the movie?

475
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,360
This sucks.

476
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,360
They've already set up that he's kind of a stuffy guy and he's too focused on work.

477
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:32,360
Like he's not taking a vacation, but that's complicated by the fact that his wife is a partner in the real estate business.

478
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,360
Oh, that's right.

479
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,360
What's the what's the name of it?

480
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,360
I haven't written down.

481
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
Evers and Evers Evers and Evers.

482
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,360
For you.

483
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,360
He says that you're almost in like, OK, are we in Eddie Murphy?

484
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
Fun, because he says that really fast.

485
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,360
Evers and Evers.

486
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,360
And like, are we going to have some Eddie Murphy fun?

487
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,360
No, because that doesn't like keep going.

488
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,360
Let me just real quick before we get too deep into it.

489
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,360
The premise of Eddie Murphy is a realtor who tries to sell the haunted mansion.

490
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,360
Sounds like a funny, like fun.

491
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
Sure.

492
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,360
Sounds like a funny.

493
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:16,360
And some of the there was there's behind the scenes material somewhere I've seen one of either Minkoff or Han saying, you know, I just got to say that putting Eddie Murphy in a haunted house.

494
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,360
That's gold.

495
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,360
That's gold.

496
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,360
And like, yeah, it would be if anyone tried.

497
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,360
I like I don't it's not on its face a bad idea.

498
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:33,360
And there was a teaser trailer I watched that were if you all if that was all you saw, you'd go, oh, here we go.

499
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,360
And it's the Haunted Mansion with this star we've all like something from.

500
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,360
And they do they do like a number count of.

501
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,360
Yes, I saw that.

502
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:48,360
16 rooms and 999 ghosts and he's going to meet all of them.

503
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,360
Well, which sounds cool.

504
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,360
I don't know if he did.

505
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,360
I don't think he met them.

506
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,360
What do you count as meeting?

507
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,360
Seeing seeing meeting.

508
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:02,360
I guess seeing his meeting of seeing his meeting by interesting ghosts who you like and know from the ride.

509
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,360
Yeah.

510
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
And just driving past them.

511
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,360
Does that matter?

512
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,360
We got to pay off the spider stuff.

513
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,360
It's all about.

514
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,360
Yeah.

515
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:17,360
In a world we've we've got we've there's so much mythology to Haunted Mansion that we're going to do an event where it's going to end up being 14 episodes about it.

516
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
And they chose none of it.

517
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,360
It is about made up.

518
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,360
It's about Evers and Evers helping their son with a spider fear.

519
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,360
Yes.

520
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
And mistaken ghost identity.

521
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,360
Yes.

522
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:36,360
I don't this is not really a hard and fast rule, but Pirates of the Caribbean is the closest one to like a tone or a feeling.

523
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:44,360
Maybe you have on a ride because like the rider have rides of jokes, but they do have like a tone that like conveys like adventure.

524
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:51,360
You're in the middle of a cannonball fight between, you know, the ships or whatever on pirates and Haunted Mansion as a tone.

525
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,360
It's scary and it's like not in this movie.

526
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,360
It's not they don't convey anything.

527
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:11,360
You get it says, yeah, if it truly were you set up the maybe if this the beginning of the movie was more we're in the Haunted Mansion and then Eddie Murphy shows up and what you're bringing a totally different vibe to this, but they don't get the Haunted Mansion tone right.

528
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,360
And the Eddie Murphy vibe is very flat.

529
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,360
Yeah.

530
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,360
And I understand that all of these.

531
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,360
Look, making a movie out of a ride.

532
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,360
The rides are thin.

533
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:32,360
Even like with all the mythology we've talked about, I still couldn't tell you what exactly the absolute this needs to be the plot of a Haunted Mansion movie is.

534
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:40,360
Pirates of the Caribbean seems to have gotten it right and that like, yeah, it's like some of the set pieces and there's little nods to tableaus from the ride.

535
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,360
But we made up our own thing because you got to make up your own thing.

536
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,360
They did that in Haunted Mansion, too, but I don't like any of what they made up.

537
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,360
Okay, I some some quick things I did like so we're not just being nice.

538
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,360
Okay, I think it's cute.

539
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,360
They got the dapper dance to be the singing busts.

540
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,360
Yeah, sure.

541
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Not super excited.

542
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,360
I can tell.

543
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,360
I don't think it's essential that the eight is nice.

544
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,360
I don't think it's essential that the that the singing buss are good at singing.

545
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:16,360
I like that it's a these all these weird old men who like it's not that sure.

546
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,360
And you end up losing one.

547
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,360
You end up there's only four instead of five, which is a bummer.

548
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,360
Yeah, yeah, I was upset.

549
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
The thorough wasn't there.

550
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,360
But a cute little nod, a cute little wink.

551
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,360
The movie could have been two dozen more of those because it doesn't have that.

552
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,360
Yeah, okay.

553
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,360
You're right.

554
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,360
The saving grace performance wise, obviously Wallace Shawn.

555
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,360
Sure.

556
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:43,360
As usual, he has one line where he just yells at Eddie Murphy.

557
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,360
Are you upset?

558
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:58,360
And I legitimately laughed at that because I think it was like they had just explained that Master Gracie was going to kill his wife so that Master Gracie could be reunited with his lover.

559
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,360
Mm hmm.

560
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,360
And just Wallace Shawn.

561
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,360
They explained all this and Wallace Shawn asked, Are you upset?

562
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,360
And his delivery was very good.

563
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:16,360
That said, it was immediately followed up with him saying, there's always my way and there's always my way.

564
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,360
There's always my way.

565
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:23,360
And then he crashes a carriage through the wall of the man.

566
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,360
It doesn't make any sense.

567
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:30,360
So in case you haven't seen this, Wallace Shawn is one of two ghosts, housekeepers, essentially.

568
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:35,360
And then he sometimes looks like a human, but then sometimes looks like a blue ghost that you could put your arm through.

569
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,360
I mean, there's other characters like this as well.

570
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,360
Yeah.

571
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:43,360
So he is driving a carriage as a ghost right from when that gets cut.

572
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,360
Yeah.

573
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,360
Got to cut to.

574
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,360
Yeah, Wallace Shawn, you're never going to be mad at Wallace Shawn.

575
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,360
No.

576
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,360
So that's good.

577
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,360
But he can't save it himself.

578
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,360
He can't save it himself.

579
00:28:52,360 --> 00:29:01,360
And then they go right from that carriage scene into what's kind of a mashup of the ballroom and the grim grinning ghosts like graveyard party.

580
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,360
And they blow through that setup so quick.

581
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,360
Yeah.

582
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,360
It's just like, hey, you know, that fun thing on the ride.

583
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,360
There you go.

584
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,360
Hi.

585
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,360
Wave at it.

586
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,360
It's gone.

587
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,360
You go past the characters faster than you do on the ride.

588
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,360
Yes.

589
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,360
All right.

590
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,360
Here's these guys.

591
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,360
There's the dueling guys.

592
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,360
Great.

593
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,360
Gone.

594
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,360
Yeah.

595
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,360
Gone.

596
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,360
You see hitchhiking ghosts.

597
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,360
They factor in a little more, a little bit.

598
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,360
They give some lines.

599
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,360
Yeah.

600
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,360
But still not a lot.

601
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,360
I feel like I'm bad at synopsizing plots.

602
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:38,360
But if we had to do that fast for anyone who will not watch the film as we did.

603
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,360
Yes.

604
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:45,360
It's a workaholic real estate agent who's not spending enough time with his family.

605
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,360
And then he commits to spending a weekend with his family.

606
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,360
But on the way, he's going to check out this house that he thinks he can make a killing on.

607
00:29:52,360 --> 00:30:03,360
But the house is full of haunts and happy haunts and some unhappy haunts because a woman committed suicide.

608
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,360
Who happens to look exactly like Eddie Murphy's wife.

609
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,360
Yes.

610
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,360
Yeah.

611
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,360
And then the master of the house who was in love with her kills himself.

612
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,360
That happens at the very end of the opening credits.

613
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,360
They do the hanging from the.

614
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,360
Oh, yeah.

615
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,360
Which is sharring.

616
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,360
Yeah.

617
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,360
Soon to be comedy.

618
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,360
So he's a good.

619
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,360
So everybody's basically a ghost in the house.

620
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,360
Not.

621
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,360
But not.

622
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,360
Terrence Stamp.

623
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,360
No, no, no.

624
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,360
He is.

625
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,360
He's a ghost.

626
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,360
He punches through him.

627
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,360
He tries to punch Eddie Murphy tries to punch Terrence Stamp and it's like ghost.

628
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,360
I now watch this movie like five weeks ago.

629
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,360
So I don't.

630
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,360
I have I'm going to be lost in some stuff, but that is the character.

631
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,360
Ramsley.

632
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,360
Ramsley.

633
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,360
Ramsley.

634
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,360
A normal regular name.

635
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,360
Yeah.

636
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,360
Very good name.

637
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,360
And he's scary.

638
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,360
Yeah.

639
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,360
I mean, he's scary just in the way a regular butler would be scary.

640
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:06,360
But spoiler, then he's a little more scary because he's he's not just unsettling to look

641
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,360
at.

642
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,360
He's all he also did bad things.

643
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,360
Yes.

644
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,360
To the people who lived in the house.

645
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,360
What a shocker.

646
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,360
Swapped a letter.

647
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,360
No.

648
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,360
OK.

649
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,360
So there was a letter.

650
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,360
OK.

651
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,360
He no he poisoned.

652
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,360
He poisoned Master Gracie's the love of Master Gracie's life.

653
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,360
Elizabeth Elizabeth.

654
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,360
She dies.

655
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,360
And then Master Gracie.

656
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,360
I think he gives a fake letter to Master Gracie that I believe is a forgery.

657
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:45,360
And he is overcome that he's overcome with grief and commits suicide in this children's

658
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,360
movie, which yeah, that happens in the ride.

659
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,360
You would have cut the suicide.

660
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,360
I don't know.

661
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,360
I think you got to have a hanging in the movie.

662
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:02,360
I mean, as we talked about on the the economy episode, they purposely on the raw, the imagineers

663
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,280
are like, no, no, the guy who hung himself is not Mr. Gracie because he killed Gracie

664
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,280
was murdered.

665
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,280
So we don't.

666
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,280
Oh, yeah.

667
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,280
So again, you're we're back to that.

668
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:19,280
The character in this movie is named after this real imagineer who died, not at his own

669
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,280
hand.

670
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:27,280
And then and obviously then crucial to the plot is Madame Leota played by Jennifer Tilley.

671
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:35,280
And what she does is be there and get carried around in the car.

672
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,280
A little gag.

673
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,280
She gets a couple of good lines towards the end.

674
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,280
I guess a couple does she?

675
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,280
What are they?

676
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,280
Like I think Eddie Murphy says, don't go anywhere.

677
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,280
And she goes like, oh, not a problem.

678
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,280
There's a hole.

679
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,280
They like have all the Sean.

680
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,280
He grabs the whatever you call it.

681
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,280
The crystal ball.

682
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,280
The crystal ball.

683
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,280
And they're like kind of grossed out by it a little bit.

684
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,280
They're like scared.

685
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,280
There's a little bit of gag in the back.

686
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,280
I'm not going to say I like it.

687
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,280
I'm just explaining there is a gag where all Sean picks up Jennifer Tilley's head, which

688
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,280
I guess if I say it like that, it sounds fun.

689
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,280
She she encourages Eddie Murphy not to give up.

690
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:21,280
And instead of hitting the conservatory glass with pipe, he should drive his sedan through

691
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
it.

692
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,280
And that'll fix that actually works.

693
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,280
Right.

694
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,280
Because, yeah, he she gives him a speech about, yeah, like you got to do try again.

695
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,280
You got to try again.

696
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,280
You can't quit.

697
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
You got to try again.

698
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,280
And then he drives a car into the haunted mansion.

699
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,280
Also, he gets that's right.

700
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:42,280
That's right after he gets thrown out of the window in a really like gruesome like fall

701
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:47,280
from my Terrence Stamp by Grimmsley Grimsley Grimsley Grimsley.

702
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,280
Is his name Grimsby?

703
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,280
Grimsby.

704
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,280
OK, sorry.

705
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,280
It's Ram's Lee Ram's Lee.

706
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,280
But he throws Eddie Murphy out the window.

707
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,280
Eddie Murphy takes a really hard hit on his car and is not.

708
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,280
Oh, yeah, really destroys the car.

709
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,280
Also, a nice BMW, just like in I Love You Man.

710
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,280
Yeah.

711
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,280
You're saying.

712
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,280
Yeah, pretty much.

713
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,280
Multiple 2000s films with real estate agents and nice BMWs, the most relatable characters.

714
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,280
And then, yes, just like in I Love You Man, he closes that big real estate deal in this.

715
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,280
They go on.

716
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,280
They go on vacation with the family.

717
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,280
Also, the other problem with that is him and the wife own the business.

718
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,280
They can go on vacation whenever.

719
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,280
Mm hmm.

720
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,280
And he's a workaholic.

721
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,280
He doesn't want it.

722
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,280
And he's selling so many houses.

723
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:42,280
He is haunted by eager buyers and sellers like like and he likes the opening.

724
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,280
He's in a bar and he's getting people to sign their final papers and they're like,

725
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,280
you're not leaving until you have a drink, like almost threatening.

726
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:56,280
And then when he finally gets out of there, someone else goes like, oh, you're a real estate person.

727
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,280
We need a real estate person.

728
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:04,280
And it's like, what the fuck is this batting away offers to sell nice houses?

729
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,280
Just having is it Rachel Harris or Beth Littleford?

730
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,280
It's a daily show.

731
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,280
Rachel Harris.

732
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,280
Yeah.

733
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,280
I.

734
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,280
Yeah.

735
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,280
And then but then the Haunted Mansion comes up.

736
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:25,280
His wife, Sarah, is contacted specifically because they must see an ad with her and she is identical to.

737
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,280
Elizabeth.

738
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,280
The yes.

739
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,280
Master Gracie's wife who died.

740
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,280
And so the whole thing is that it's her.

741
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,280
It must be her.

742
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,280
She's lying.

743
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,280
I'm I must forcibly marry her.

744
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,280
Yeah.

745
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,280
Yeah.

746
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,280
She must.

747
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,280
We have to kill her and keep her here.

748
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,280
Yeah.

749
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,280
Oh, yeah.

750
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,280
Wait, she's dead.

751
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,280
Also.

752
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,280
OK.

753
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,280
There's these are all ghosts.

754
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,280
Yeah.

755
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,280
Like, don't they have access to some like higher?

756
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,280
First of all, let's just say this.

757
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,280
Heaven and hell exist.

758
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,280
This movie proves that heaven exists because Walsh is so excited he's going to go to heaven.

759
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,280
Yeah.

760
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,280
And then at the end, the literal gates of hell.

761
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,280
Yes.

762
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,280
So heaven.

763
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,280
So this this is something that is not in the ride.

764
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,280
No, they don't explain that heaven and hell exist on the Disneyland ride, the Haunted Mansion, but they do in the movie.

765
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,280
It seems like the 99 happy haunts leave the Haunted Mansion.

766
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,280
Except for Madame Leota and the singing bus who go on vacation with the Evers family.

767
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,280
Right.

768
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,280
That's a whole week.

769
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,280
We need some time to deconstruct.

770
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,280
We need to build.

771
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,280
We can build to the end credits.

772
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,280
Which haunts me.

773
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,280
Which that that's what really haunts me.

774
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,280
Yeah.

775
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,280
Is the end of this.

776
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,280
I'm with you.

777
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,280
Yeah.

778
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:48,280
But so, yeah, it's a world where two people can be exactly identical, like not even, you know, yes.

779
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,280
Similar looking, similar types, but she's just an exact.

780
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,280
Eddie Murphy's wife is an exact double of a ghost.

781
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:04,280
My point is, I guess, is like I thought that once you're a ghost, you have maybe have some access to like knowledge or something or, you know, there's an afterlife.

782
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,280
Oh, you know, I know who really killed her.

783
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,280
That's usually what it happens with ghosts is like now the ghost is haunting because they know who killed them or they know who betrayed them.

784
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,280
Not the case here.

785
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,280
Ghosts are way in the dark.

786
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,280
I mean, they are just as clueless.

787
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:23,280
They have exactly the same access to the exact same information they did when they were alive.

788
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,280
I don't.

789
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,280
It seems weird to me.

790
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,280
They're all ghosts, but they're all just acting like humans.

791
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:37,280
That's distressing to think about because I'm not sure I believe in an afterlife, but I assume if there is one that you get to know everything you would hope.

792
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,280
Yeah.

793
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:49,280
Don't still or you're like, you know, like reading different afterlife media and being, you know, confused by what's right and what's wrong and what's a lie and what's not just like here on Earth.

794
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,280
Ghost fake news.

795
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
Those fake news.

796
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
That's not an after world I want to live in.

797
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,280
No, it's a real bummer because I was like, well, somebody's got to be alive here and somebody's got to be a ghost.

798
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,280
No, they're all ghosts.

799
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:06,280
They're all ghosts, but there's only like there's Wally Sean and Dina's Bay Spy Bay.

800
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
I don't know the actresses.

801
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:14,280
The person playing Emma, Emma and Ezra, which Ezra Reno is one of the hitchhiking ghosts.

802
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,280
That is the name of one of the hitchhiking ghosts.

803
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
Right.

804
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,280
Kind of.

805
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Wally Sean also is at the Oregon playing the Oregon at one point, which is kind of a cute.

806
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,280
And the hitchhiking ghosts are separate people.

807
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,280
So one of the he's not one of the hitchhiking.

808
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,280
No, but they yes, they show up in the in the carriage.

809
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,280
You're right.

810
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:37,280
But there the whole mansion was cursed, but only Master Gracie killed him.

811
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,280
And there's only two members of the domestic staff.

812
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,280
But then there's ghosts in the summit.

813
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:49,280
The ghost rules don't quite line up for me because in the opening credits, there's all these people ballroom dancing.

814
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,280
And I thought that was a nod to the ballroom scene.

815
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,280
But then there's no ghost ballroom scene.

816
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,280
There's the split ballroom dance.

817
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,280
That happened before.

818
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,280
That was the lead up to Elizabeth dying.

819
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,280
Yes, that's when the treachery occurred.

820
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,280
They're showing you the night that she died.

821
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,280
Yeah.

822
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:13,280
That was the exact moment that I knew I was not going to like this movie when it cut to this masquerade ball.

823
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,280
The masquerade and the signing.

824
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,280
No, I hate masquerade balls.

825
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,280
I'm not going to.

826
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,280
And that all seems like cut scenes.

827
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,280
Like, let's just jam it into the opening credits.

828
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,280
Tell it as quickly as possible.

829
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,280
So, you know, they're re-editing this movie like crazy.

830
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:32,280
This is this reeks of being one of those like 35 screenwriter disasters.

831
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,280
And oh, you know, here a quick side trick.

832
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,280
Did anybody look into the history of previous Haunted Mansion movies?

833
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,280
No, no.

834
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,280
Oh, my God.

835
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:49,280
OK, so if you look, there's different Wikipedia's and different sources you can look at that tell you that, you know, we ended up with this one.

836
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,280
And it's this guy who got into a Disney writing conservatory kind of program.

837
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,280
Who also wrote the movie Elf.

838
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,280
And that was before Elf was produced.

839
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,280
He wrote Elf on spec in 96 and used that as a sample to get a bunch of other work.

840
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,280
And then Elf was made and huge.

841
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,280
It was such a huge hit.

842
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:09,280
You know, so a very successful screenwriter who ended up writing this.

843
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,280
But before that, there was an attempt by a screenwriting pair.

844
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,280
And forgive me, I don't remember the second person because I'm so distracted by the first.

845
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,280
Apparently, there was a Haunted Mansion film written by a screenwriter named Jim Hill.

846
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,280
What?

847
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,280
Yep.

848
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,280
Yep. And it's that one.

849
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:34,280
I forgot about Jim Hill, who is the source of much of our theme park information and hosts the titan of Jim Hill Media Podcast Industries.

850
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,280
And there's always been a lot.

851
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,280
There's a lot of confusion about who is Jim Hill.

852
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,280
Right.

853
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:46,280
Even his own bio is like he's done stand up and he's and there he there's he he tried to write a show based on the Adventures Club.

854
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:53,280
But so supposedly in the 80s or 90s, he came to Disney with an idea for a Haunted Mansion film.

855
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,280
And this is written up in several settings.

856
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,280
That's a that's a confusing one, isn't it?

857
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,280
I we maybe we see if we can get it from.

858
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,280
Yeah. Does he have the script out?

859
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,280
I don't know.

860
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,280
Good day. Was it a pitch?

861
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,280
Do we know if there was a script or was it a pitch?

862
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,280
I don't know.

863
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,280
And it seems the story seems to be told like he just like contacted the Disney company blind.

864
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,280
I got to get we got to get him on the show.

865
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,280
Yeah, we got it.

866
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,280
We have a lot of questions, including this.

867
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,280
Yeah.

868
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,280
I mean, the most infamous one is the Guillermo del Toro was going to make one at Comic Con.

869
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,280
There was a teaser with Ian McShane reading the ghost host lines.

870
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,280
Really?

871
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,280
People lost their minds.

872
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,280
Yeah.

873
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:45,280
It's just like spooky, ethereal, like a mist that spells out the Haunted Mansion while he's reading Foolish Mortals and stuff.

874
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,280
But it made a video and people went wild.

875
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:54,280
And that 15 second teaser is better than this movie.

876
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:01,280
Well, I mean, then he's talking about it, the movie revolved around the Hat Box ghost, which was not on the Disneyland ride yet.

877
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,280
So he hadn't Hat Box had not his.

878
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:14,280
We were talking about Eddie Murphy's resurgence and Adam Sandler Hat Box had his resurgence a couple of years ago because he had been sort of just down in the first Safdie Brothers in good time.

879
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,280
Hat Box ghost was in the first Safdie Brothers movie.

880
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,280
He took the hat off.

881
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,280
So it's hard to recognize him.

882
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,280
But yeah, he tries to buy the liquid ecstasy in the Sprite bottle.

883
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:37,280
Can I also just say I was trying to find more information and I googled Jim Hill Haunted Mansion and the second result is an article he wrote called A PC Haunted Mansion.

884
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,280
Now that's scary.

885
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,280
Well, what year?

886
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,280
2008.

887
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,280
Oh, interesting.

888
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,280
What was it?

889
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,280
Was it where there changes to Haunted Mansion to make a PC?

890
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,280
I'm trying to remember.

891
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,280
I'll try to read while we keep talking.

892
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,280
Yeah, Hat Box ghost.

893
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,280
So yeah, Guillermo was talking about.

894
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,280
Next first line.

895
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,280
Forget about grim grinning ghosts.

896
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,280
Get ready for prim.

897
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,280
We don't mean to offend anyone ghosts.

898
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,280
What the fuck?

899
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,280
What is going on?

900
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,280
What changed in the Haunted Mansion?

901
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,280
Everybody's so goddamn scared of the PC police.

902
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,280
Get your guns out.

903
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,280
The PC police are going to come into your house and stop you from doing an accent.

904
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,280
Sorry, Charlie Brown.

905
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,280
Sorry, the great pumpkin.

906
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,280
Hat Box ghost.

907
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,280
This is a long time ago already.

908
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,280
Guillermo announced that movie that for some weird reason, Disney won't make.

909
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,280
I don't know what the hell the problem is, but he was he was an OG Hat Box ghost guy.

910
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,280
Yeah, he deserves credit for him before like mentioning it before.

911
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,280
Crazy houses in the valley in San Fernando Valley.

912
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,280
I know he is losing one.

913
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,280
He's divorced as well recently.

914
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,280
Oh, so I don't know if he has both houses.

915
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,280
He has half those houses probably.

916
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,280
I'm sure he has one of the houses.

917
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,280
I'm sure his like.

918
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,280
He has the nerd house.

919
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,280
He has the house that's like this is the Haunted Mansion room.

920
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,280
This is the Kaiju.

921
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,280
Maybe he bought the house then next to the other house.

922
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,280
So there's three houses now.

923
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,280
The ex-wife, the monster house, then his other house.

924
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,280
OK.

925
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,280
I don't know.

926
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,280
I'm just spitballing here.

927
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,280
Jim claims that they cut or maybe going to cut the line.

928
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,280
Drag your wretched bodies to the dead center of the room.

929
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,280
Is that that's the one?

930
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,280
I think so.

931
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,280
People found that offensive.

932
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,280
This seems like a fake.

933
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,280
We got to get more.

934
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:31,280
They do not get and do not let any employee say, please follow the blood red carpet into the foyer.

935
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,280
Sorry, death.

936
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,280
You're canceled.

937
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,280
I don't know about that.

938
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,280
I don't think they say blood red anymore, but I don't know that I ever heard that to begin with.

939
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,280
Yeah, I don't remember that.

940
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,280
And that's great.

941
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,280
And that's great.

942
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,280
You don't say that line.

943
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,280
The haunted mansion is dead.

944
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,280
It is burnt to the ground.

945
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,280
Might as well not even.

946
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,280
There's a guy hanging in the first scene.

947
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:58,280
The article seems to be a slippery slope type argument where like, well, then when do we cut that?

948
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,280
And then when next we're not going to be allowed to smoke as soon as we get out of our tomb.

949
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:10,280
I want one of the stops on Louie's upcoming standup tour to be in the foyer of the haunted mansion.

950
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,280
See, I see.

951
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,280
It used to be better.

952
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,280
It used to be better to be a ghost.

953
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,280
Those PC police will be white as ghosts when they see Louie's.

954
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,280
Well, we got to look into this.

955
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:31,280
Now we got to look if there was like just some crazy racist stuff on the haunted mansion that we forgot about in 2007.

956
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,280
That's the list.

957
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,280
What I just told you is the list.

958
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,280
The PC police are coming.

959
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,280
They're putting their PC police tape all over the mansion.

960
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,280
They cut the number from Miss Saigon that used to be in the Dida groups.

961
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,280
Oh, right.

962
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,280
Oh, that's right.

963
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:51,280
It was the ghost of Mickey Rooney's character from Breakfast at Tiffany's.

964
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:57,280
Well, they had to find 999 ghosts, so they were kind of scraping the bottom of the barrel.

965
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,280
And there was that song of the South reference in the graveyard.

966
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,280
I remember that now.

967
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,280
Yeah.

968
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,280
Yeah, they got rid of that.

969
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:13,280
There's also maybe a good time to mention the also making Disney fans at the time very upset.

970
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,280
Jennifer Tilley gave an interview where she said she was so excited about it and I'm in the ball.

971
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,280
It's just like the thing from the ride.

972
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,280
And if the movie does well, they're going to put me into the ball and the ride.

973
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,280
Oh, great.

974
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,280
So I always wonder where that came from.

975
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,280
And it came from her, apparently.

976
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,280
And I remember people being all a tizzy.

977
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,280
I think I was mad.

978
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,280
I probably like talked to my parents about it.

979
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,280
Mom, Dad, can we talk for a little bit?

980
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,280
It's probably right, though.

981
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,280
Like, there's probably like because I think we might mention this in the Haunted Mansion.

982
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:51,280
Tony Baxter said there was a plan in place to change the load area of Disneyland's Haunted Mansion into their like conservatory area.

983
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,280
Yeah, because he's famous conservatory.

984
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,280
He's always said.

985
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,280
I don't know what he's talking about.

986
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,280
What was the conservatory?

987
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:01,280
It's the glass room on the side of the mansion that a car goes in.

988
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,280
Yeah, it's not on the real Haunted Mansion.

989
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,280
It's sort of an invention for the movie or it's a part of that house.

990
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:18,280
Conservatories first became popular, apparently, after people got used to the more hot weather fruits, citrus and such.

991
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,280
The hot weather fruits.

992
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,280
They would get that would come as the British Empire expanded.

993
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,280
And they're like, can we grow this here back in the motherland?

994
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,280
Hot weather fruits.

995
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,280
Can I go with oranges?

996
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,280
Bananas?

997
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,280
OK, I see.

998
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,280
I got you.

999
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,280
I mean, I like I'm a big orange and banana fan as well.

1000
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,280
Sure.

1001
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,280
Yeah, that's crazy.

1002
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,280
What do you like oranges or bananas?

1003
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,280
Believe it or not.

1004
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,280
What are cold weather fruits?

1005
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,280
Oh, yeah, I there are some stuff that grows in cold weather.

1006
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,280
I mean, grapes are very temperature sensitive.

1007
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,280
Scott, you got an hour on this.

1008
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,280
You got a cold weather.

1009
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,280
I'm looking it up.

1010
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,280
Twenty one winter fruits to grow or buy in every climate.

1011
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,280
Honey, crisp apples, cherry plums, pears, apricots, cherries.

1012
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,280
Your best bet is pears, they say.

1013
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:13,280
So if you're a big pear person and you don't have a conservatory, don't worry about it.

1014
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,280
Yeah, don't worry about it.

1015
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:21,280
So that was going to be they obviously had a plan in place because it wasn't like the movie was a hit.

1016
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,280
So they had to have that plan before it came out.

1017
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:29,280
So I'm sure there was a version where Eddie Murphy's on the ride and where Jennifer Tilly is on the ride.

1018
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:38,280
But that would require them to do something iconic, even just like all Jack Sparrow really does is like kind of shimmy around.

1019
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:45,280
Jack Sparrow's shimmying is way more memorable than anything that either Murphy or Tilly does.

1020
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,280
Yeah, I want to do this.

1021
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,280
Oh, wait, what's the release date?

1022
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,280
Did Pirates come out a couple of months before?

1023
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,280
Yeah, this was like summer.

1024
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,280
And this was in November.

1025
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:02,280
So I would imagine when Pirates is a giant smash, there's some people in the company that are like, this is going to be a giant smash too.

1026
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,280
Oh, yeah.

1027
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,280
Yeah.

1028
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,280
So we have to be ready.

1029
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,280
Right.

1030
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:12,280
Because maybe they already had the Jack Sparrow animatronic plan, but it was going to take forever to enact.

1031
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,280
So they're like, this time, let's pounce on it.

1032
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:21,280
So, you know, it could have been like some executive telling Jennifer Tilly that as well.

1033
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,280
It's possible there wasn't like they hadn't made the head yet.

1034
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,280
They're going to be on the ride.

1035
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,280
Yes, it's going to be great.

1036
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,280
You're going to be on the ride.

1037
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:44,280
You know where they did put specifically Jennifer Tilly and I amazingly this does not come up in a later Denton Disney or deal episode coming soon.

1038
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,280
But there was.

1039
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,280
Oh, wait. Oh, I do.

1040
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,280
I have it.

1041
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,280
This is part of my research for that.

1042
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,280
And it didn't come up.

1043
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:58,280
But here is outside of the AMC theaters now defunct at Denton Disney.

1044
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:03,280
Here is at the time of the release a giant Jennifer Tilly inflatable.

1045
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,280
Whoa.

1046
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,280
Yeah, that's scary.

1047
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,280
That is hideous.

1048
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,280
That is scarier than anything in the Haunted Mansion.

1049
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,280
I'll post a picture of that.

1050
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,280
Thanks to an old trip report from MousePlanet.com.

1051
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:27,280
But yeah, she well, you know what an inflatable woman looks like an inflatable plastic woman is like with a cloudy glass ball.

1052
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,280
It just looks like something that maybe you have sex with.

1053
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,280
Oh, I see what you say.

1054
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,280
She's got that like inflatable eyes.

1055
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,280
Just.

1056
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,280
Yeah.

1057
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:46,280
There's a there's a vacancy to inflatable eyes that I've only prior seen in a sex doll.

1058
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:49,280
And that's basically what this looks like.

1059
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,280
And she's a suffocating this lady.

1060
00:50:51,280 --> 00:51:00,280
She looks like somebody's trying to murder various fetishes are all tied up in this one like a long line to get pictures with it.

1061
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,280
Yeah, a really certain type.

1062
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,280
Yeah.

1063
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,280
Good thing this movie wasn't a ties together.

1064
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:15,280
Yeah, sex dolls, suffocation, fantasies and you get your pictures and there's a paddy wagon right next to it.

1065
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,280
Like they're just ready.

1066
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,280
All right. So like I'm over a while.

1067
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:25,280
The searches browser history and it's like it's a sting operation.

1068
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,280
It man. Yeah.

1069
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:34,280
Yeah. But the Johnny Depp animatronic to a lot of like it was I remember at the time when it got in the right.

1070
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,280
It was like, wow, it's so human. It's so lifelike.

1071
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:50,280
And so I'm half the time when stuff gets into the parks, it's like a test for a grander, a grander that like there was like a game in frontier land a while back on like heroes of frontier land.

1072
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,280
And that was a test for Star Wars.

1073
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,280
So what was what was Captain Jack testing?

1074
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,280
What were you?

1075
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:00,280
Just I think was the first in the line of like a next generation of animatronics, whatever it came after.

1076
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,280
So they were testing for Eddie Murphy.

1077
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:08,280
Oh, maybe they were ready for Eddie Murphy to be appearing out there around every corner.

1078
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:16,280
I mean, maybe he would have replaced the shaky need Brownskeeper in the cemetery at the end.

1079
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,280
Like you would have ran instead of that corner.

1080
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:35,280
And he said one of his classic lines like that guy looks like he had a bad clam in his jambalaya or looking at a scary house and saying Bob Vila would have a field day with this.

1081
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,280
That's maybe my favorite line that he says in the movie.

1082
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,280
Why?

1083
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,280
I mean, well, I had to pick one.

1084
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,280
I'm not saying I like it.

1085
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,280
I'm saying I'm the ranking.

1086
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,280
It is a joke.

1087
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,280
I just I like the Bob Vila reference.

1088
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,280
It reminds me of the 90s.

1089
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,280
It reminds me of home improvement.

1090
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,280
So that's why I like that.

1091
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,280
My best.

1092
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,280
That's maybe my favorite line.

1093
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:58,280
Eddie Murphy says, But I want to keep asking if I were there in person, I'd say he a field day.

1094
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:05,280
You mean like an old like a British child in 1902, whatever Bob Vila would have a field.

1095
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,280
He would see this decrepit house and go, ooh, hooray.

1096
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:18,280
Well, if the idea that Bob Vila really gets excited, it gets like horny when he sees a dilapidated house because he gets to fix it up because he loves to do that.

1097
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,280
By the way, where is Bob Vila?

1098
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,280
Is he still alive?

1099
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:24,280
Everyone talks about Bob Ross, but Bob Vila doesn't get enough credit.

1100
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,280
Not on any shirts.

1101
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,280
No ironic Halloween costumes.

1102
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,280
I was a Bob Vila kid.

1103
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,280
What?

1104
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:36,280
I don't really remember watching Bob Ross that much growing up on PBS, but I would stop and watch Bob Vila sometimes.

1105
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,280
And I was a big Paul Prudhomme kid.

1106
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,280
Well, of course.

1107
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,280
What's your fault?

1108
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,280
I had a different floppy hat for every day of the week.

1109
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,280
Different beret at eight.

1110
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,280
Sure.

1111
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,280
Bob Vila is alive.

1112
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,280
Yeah.

1113
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,280
Oh, good.

1114
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,280
I know he's alive.

1115
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,280
I just was he OK?

1116
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,280
I don't know.

1117
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:03,280
He's got a dot com where he seems to have various projects and wares.

1118
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,280
OK.

1119
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,280
Yeah, that's good.

1120
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,280
Second gate.

1121
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,280
He's not like Roddenberry.

1122
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,280
He's not like Roddenberry who just destroyed his body with drugs and alcohol.

1123
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,280
Wouldn't that be funny, though, if Bob Vila partied a lot?

1124
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,280
Partier.

1125
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,280
Yeah.

1126
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,280
We got to look into that.

1127
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:22,280
I'll say something that brought the John Bligh reminded me.

1128
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:26,280
I forgot this movie takes place in like Louisiana.

1129
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,280
New Orleans.

1130
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,280
Yeah.

1131
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:34,280
And I only remembered because should we talk about like that last sequence?

1132
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:39,280
The the the driving sequence, the end of the end of the film.

1133
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,280
Sure.

1134
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:46,280
OK, because this this is I was really expecting more to go like, oh, my God, this is unbelievable.

1135
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,280
And I really didn't feel that until the very end.

1136
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:55,280
They've resolved the problems and then they're driving.

1137
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,280
And there's a joke about them finally going on vacation.

1138
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:09,280
And then the camera zooms out of a CGI car and I thought it zoomed out and then they're on a very long road going on.

1139
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,280
Most digital bridge.

1140
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,280
The digital apparent.

1141
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:15,280
So that is apparently a real bridge.

1142
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,280
Oh, that is the Lake Punch train causeway.

1143
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,280
And it crosses like a man.

1144
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,280
That was your vocal warm up before we started.

1145
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,280
All right.

1146
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,280
Punch straight punch.

1147
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,280
Oh, no.

1148
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,280
You nailed it in the in the test.

1149
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,280
You got two in your own head.

1150
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,280
Now, I've been on some there.

1151
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,280
I've been on long bridges like that, like in the Chesapeake Bay.

1152
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,280
We believe you.

1153
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,280
I've seen long.

1154
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,280
I know they exist.

1155
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,280
What's the history of causeways?

1156
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:46,280
It connects to one point to another.

1157
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,280
It's it's long.

1158
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,280
It's a big part.

1159
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:54,280
Have you been on winter bridges as well as summer bridges?

1160
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:57,280
Bridges that are good for the heat and the cold.

1161
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:02,280
In the winter, you have to be careful because bridges usually ice first before road.

1162
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,280
So you must.

1163
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,280
Is that true?

1164
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,280
Yes.

1165
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,280
Because there's less like it doesn't go that deep.

1166
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,280
I don't know the science behind it, but you see signs a lot in the northeast.

1167
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,280
Bridges ice first.

1168
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,280
Because the core of the earth is hot.

1169
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:22,280
So if there's nothing going up, if it's just a cold air, it's what caused a problem for theme park owner, Kendall Roy.

1170
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:27,280
And she wanted to win without spoiling anything.

1171
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,280
Watch out for the ice.

1172
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,280
Watch out for the ice.

1173
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,280
Yes.

1174
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,280
Don't do coke.

1175
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:39,280
So but that yes, it looks like they're just driving in a digital bridge into a screen saver, like into the needs.

1176
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,280
So the bridge is real, but the city, everything else is in theory is real.

1177
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,280
I don't know if it's a real brick because it all looks very bad.

1178
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,280
I has aged very really awful.

1179
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:59,280
But what's happening here is that you think it's a family vacation and then you zoom out and it's there's a bunch of other also strapped into the car.

1180
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,280
Leota and the singing bus.

1181
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,280
The bus are on the back and the bus.

1182
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:09,280
We didn't say earlier the bus are part of a really extended set piece.

1183
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:14,280
One of the longer just here's let's let's settle into the scene for a while.

1184
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:20,280
And they're always in barbershop quartet mode and they sing everything you say and are very unhelpful.

1185
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,280
In fact, they don't help Eddie achieve his goal in talking to them.

1186
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:31,280
He's looking for a key and they just like sing whatever they sing, repeat whatever he says and sing like coming around the mountain.

1187
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:36,280
Yes. So then at the end, this reprises and they drive off into the sunset.

1188
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:43,280
Sometimes they're singing with a backing track, which again, barbershop quartet doesn't quite make sense.

1189
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,280
But aren't they they're singing something mundane.

1190
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:54,280
It's something about like art like, are we there yet or which way is northeast or so?

1191
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:57,280
Remember, those got called up to heaven at the end.

1192
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:02,280
Yeah, they're spirits and the five bus have to go on vacation.

1193
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:10,280
I have to imagine that was done because they're like, well, there's going to be a sequel and we're going to know some of the characters back.

1194
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:13,280
So they're just going to be like their friends.

1195
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,280
And I guess going on a trip is nice.

1196
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,280
But like if you're trapped in a bus, don't you want to have a body again?

1197
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:26,280
They'd rather just be in the back of a flat bed going into digital city USA.

1198
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:29,280
And yeah, no, I you're right.

1199
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,280
Afraid of spiders.

1200
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:34,280
They probably thought that was the funniest for like gags later.

1201
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:38,280
Like they're all holding heads, essentially, just the heads.

1202
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,280
I guess I'm got my guess.

1203
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,280
But I'm fighting for the rights of the characters.

1204
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,280
Right. You're right.

1205
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,280
To have their spirits free.

1206
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,280
Yes, you would argue with them like you should go to heaven.

1207
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,280
Heaven is exists. It exists.

1208
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,280
It's real. We saw it.

1209
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,280
We saw heaven and hell.

1210
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,280
And why they don't get to go.

1211
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,280
They just like take a trip with Eddie Murphy's boring kids.

1212
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:04,280
Yes, I guess it doesn't look quality free children.

1213
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,280
I guess you could make the argument they could go to heaven later.

1214
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,280
They could put it off.

1215
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,280
Maybe a quick trip. See a little bit of heaven can wait.

1216
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:18,280
I suppose you could say there is a you can't take it with you line because like Emma,

1217
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:22,280
the other housekeeper, like has all these bags and stuff.

1218
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,280
Someone yells, you can't take it.

1219
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,280
Oh, yeah. Right. Right. Right.

1220
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,280
She's got a hat box.

1221
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:29,280
I don't think that's a nod that the hat box goes.

1222
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,280
Probably not.

1223
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,280
Probably just her own woman with her own hat.

1224
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,280
That's also it's also funny.

1225
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:39,280
This has the beauty and the beast situation where love needs to unlock a curse.

1226
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,280
Yes. In a crazy house.

1227
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,280
Yeah. And free the spirits of everybody who works there.

1228
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,280
But Elizabeth. OK.

1229
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:51,280
So let's go back before we address the what I think is the weirdest thing in this movie.

1230
00:59:51,280 --> 01:00:00,280
So there is an insane like checking off kids movie like, well, you have to go on this quest and get this key.

1231
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:07,280
The key they find in a vault full of spiders that the sun overcomes his fear of.

1232
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:12,280
And the key unlocks the trunk that reveals Ramsley's treachery.

1233
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:18,280
Meanwhile, oh, Sarah Elizabeth.

1234
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,280
No, I'm not all right.

1235
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,280
Describing the plot of the Honored Mansion for 2003.

1236
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,280
No one's all right.

1237
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:32,280
She agrees to marry to die and marry Master Gracie because he vaguely threatens her children.

1238
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,280
And Ramsley does, too.

1239
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,280
And then they have the wedding.

1240
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:44,280
Ramsley somehow ordained like Ramsley in a minister frock or priest frock.

1241
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,280
Everyone shows up to stop the wedding.

1242
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,280
She has already drank the poison.

1243
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,280
They do stop the wedding.

1244
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,280
But she dies.

1245
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,280
But then the ghost ball, there's a ghost ball.

1246
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,280
We haven't talked about the ghost ball.

1247
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,280
There's like a word following everyone.

1248
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,280
I believe I have this written down in quotation marks.

1249
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,280
The ghost ball was Elizabeth.

1250
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,280
Someone says that.

1251
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:05,280
Yes.

1252
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,280
Ghost ball was ghost ball.

1253
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,280
It's kind of an orb.

1254
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,280
Oh, wait.

1255
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,280
Oh, I remember this now.

1256
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,280
Yeah.

1257
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,280
Ghost ball.

1258
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,280
The ghost ball.

1259
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:22,280
So then Sarah collapses, but then Elizabeth shows up and takes Master Grace like it's OK.

1260
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,280
We can be together now.

1261
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,280
It's fine.

1262
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,280
And then through the power of love, the poison is undone.

1263
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,280
Like Sarah is fine.

1264
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:38,280
I'm realizing now in my notes, I do have the phrase the ghost ball was Elizabeth, but I didn't put it in quotes.

1265
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,280
So I assumed that was my bad job to myself.

1266
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,280
Not an actual line from the film.

1267
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:49,280
Maybe our description for this episode should just be the ghost ball was Elizabeth.

1268
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,280
The ghost ball was Elizabeth.

1269
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:56,280
So and Ramsley gets his comeuppance somehow.

1270
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,280
Because he goes to hell.

1271
01:01:58,280 --> 01:01:59,280
He goes to hell.

1272
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,280
He yells, damn you all to hell.

1273
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:09,280
And then the gates of hell, the ground opens up and you see into hell.

1274
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:14,280
And Eddie Murphy almost falls into hell.

1275
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:17,280
We watch Eddie Murphy almost go to hell.

1276
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,280
That's a crazy ending.

1277
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,280
That's really crazy.

1278
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,280
I mean, I guess ghosts suggest an afterlife.

1279
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:28,280
But this confirmation of your Judeo-Christian afterlife.

1280
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:32,280
Ramsley will be seated at the right hand of Satan.

1281
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,280
Yeah.

1282
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:39,280
You watch him fall in and the camera kind of tracks with him down into fire.

1283
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,280
Yeah.

1284
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:44,280
And it's such a silly CGI laden shot.

1285
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:53,280
And it reminds me so much of the moment in MacGruber where Dieter von Künth is blasted off of a cliff.

1286
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,280
And he's already like a mutant.

1287
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,280
And then he like splatters into blood on the ground.

1288
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:04,280
It's like the right, it's like the silly CGI MacGruber is like this meant to be taken seriously CGI of.

1289
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:15,280
And it did really make me wish that Eddie Murphy would then urinate on Ramsley's body and say, fuck you, dude.

1290
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,280
Well, you know, they made a sequel.

1291
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:22,280
Ramsley would have come back to like mess with the Evers family at a different Haunted Mansion.

1292
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:26,280
This Haunted Mansion 2 is like a mashup of all the Haunted Mansions.

1293
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,280
So overly art directed.

1294
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:32,280
I would argue that Eddie Murphy, they should go travel to hell to get Ramsley again.

1295
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,280
That they should go stick it to them one more time.

1296
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,280
There's a Haunted Mansion in hell.

1297
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,280
Let's go re-kill them.

1298
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,280
Re-kill them.

1299
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,280
Ooh, a Haunted Mansion in hell is a pretty cool idea.

1300
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,280
Oh, yeah.

1301
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,280
Yeah.

1302
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,280
Werner Herzog in there.

1303
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,280
They're waiting for you.

1304
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:51,280
They're all waiting for you on sale, Ramsley.

1305
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,280
It's all made, it's made of bones.

1306
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,280
Yeah.

1307
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,280
Yeah, that's cool.

1308
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,280
Haunted Mansion.

1309
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:01,280
The movie, all the trivia on IMDB, I'm always skeptical that it's all, any of it's really real.

1310
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:06,280
But it's like, it says that the fan, it's this sort of Phantom Manor more than any of the other ones.

1311
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,280
Kind of.

1312
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,280
Kind of.

1313
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,280
A little bit.

1314
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,280
From what I understand, kind of is the answer to that.

1315
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,280
I don't mind how it looks, but why wouldn't they just make it one of the ones that we know?

1316
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,280
Well, especially since it's set in the South.

1317
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:19,280
Like just make it look like the New Orleans Square one.

1318
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,280
But I guess so many people go to Disney World.

1319
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,280
It needs to look a little like, this is tiring just talking this.

1320
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,280
Yeah.

1321
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:38,280
I mean, that's the, I think this is clearly from an era where Disney didn't realize that there are fans of this stuff who would be really excited to see good depictions of how it is in the ride.

1322
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:45,280
And again, I don't want a film that's just like swirling, just connecting the dots between things I know from the ride.

1323
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,280
Because you can just go on the ride.

1324
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,280
You got to tell a good story too.

1325
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,280
But I find it so baffling.

1326
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,280
They just blasted through all the ghosts.

1327
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:54,280
We don't get a scene with the guys dueling.

1328
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,280
You just pass by them.

1329
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,280
Screw that.

1330
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,280
Hitchhiking ghosts barely factor in.

1331
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:02,280
There's always my way is just the prelude to a silly car crash.

1332
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:08,280
Bus that follow you door that looks like it's going to explode comes so fast and are just afterthoughts.

1333
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,280
Yeah.

1334
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,280
Hurry back is after the credits.

1335
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,280
Is it?

1336
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,280
Yeah. Yeah.

1337
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,280
There's a little after the credits tag.

1338
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,280
Is it Leota?

1339
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,280
Yeah, it's Leota.

1340
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,280
And she's floating around in a very digital way.

1341
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,280
It's not little Leota.

1342
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:21,280
No.

1343
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,280
No, no, no.

1344
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,280
And that's not the right person.

1345
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,280
It's like the bride who says it.

1346
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,280
Not early.

1347
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,280
Yeah, Leota doesn't say hurry back.

1348
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:29,280
Yeah.

1349
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,280
Oh, right. Sorry.

1350
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,280
So that's incorrect.

1351
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,280
So it doesn't sound right.

1352
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,280
They got it all wrong.

1353
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,280
And clearly they didn't know.

1354
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:45,280
Clearly, like, I think the fact that there are there's so much more merch and all of we just got back from Epcot, which is currently all about.

1355
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,280
So, OK, if you like Epcot, it's going to be fine.

1356
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,280
We're going to fix it.

1357
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:54,280
There's going to be stuff that even with Guardians, there's going to be stuff that you like that feels very classic Epcot.

1358
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,280
Now they're like pleading with theme park fans.

1359
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:59,280
They know we're out there in 2003.

1360
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:04,280
I don't think they knew they were like, as an Easter egg, we could throw in the hitchhiking ghosts.

1361
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:09,280
But people are really going to want to see the story about Evers and Evers helping their son get over his fear of spiders.

1362
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,280
I think you're right.

1363
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,280
I think that now it's interesting.

1364
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:13,280
We'll see with Jungle Cruise.

1365
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,280
We'll see where they're at.

1366
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,280
Jungle Cruise guaranteed to be better than this.

1367
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,280
Even that the trailer was so coherent.

1368
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,280
Yeah, for sure.

1369
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,280
As you know, the most some of the most charismatic actors we have.

1370
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:34,280
2003, my memory of Disney World is like the Haunted Mansion merchandise was on a cart like the Memento Mori store that we went in.

1371
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,280
I went into last week.

1372
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:39,280
Shock full to the rafters of Haunted Mansion merchandise.

1373
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:53,280
But a newer thing, a new a newer store location like they did not have a lot of Haunted Mansion stuff in the parks at the time, even though it's the caliber of ride that like like Splash Mountain or Space Mountain.

1374
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,280
It is shorthand for theme park or shorthand for Disney World.

1375
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,280
Yeah.

1376
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,280
Haunted Mansion, Splash Mountain.

1377
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:09,280
I think they need to do make a Splash Mountain movie that has nothing to do with Song of the South and then like reset it entirely.

1378
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,280
So now the ride can be based.

1379
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,280
It's no longer based on Song of the South in any way.

1380
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:18,280
Yeah, I guess then you'd have to like if you have all the the Brayer characters.

1381
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:21,280
Yeah, that's the characters are still like Mary those tales.

1382
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:27,280
And let's just like call it like Brian Bear and Brian Rabbit.

1383
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:30,280
Just change the name and make sure the shirt.

1384
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,280
Zootopia.

1385
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,280
All the Zootopia characters are going on a trip.

1386
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,280
That's fine too.

1387
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,280
And decided to like kill each other.

1388
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,280
I don't know.

1389
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:39,280
I think I like.

1390
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,280
They're all named Brian instead.

1391
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,280
I think Brian Bear and Brian Rabbit.

1392
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,280
No, no, no.

1393
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:45,280
It's not Brian.

1394
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,280
It's not Brayer Bear.

1395
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,280
It's Brian Bear.

1396
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,280
Brian Bear and he's got a different color shirt and a different color hat.

1397
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:53,280
So you don't have to do too much work on the animatronics.

1398
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,280
Still got a very thick seat, though.

1399
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,280
Sure.

1400
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,280
You can't change that.

1401
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,280
That's another seat wedged into a wall.

1402
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,280
Yeah.

1403
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:02,280
It's another airborne seat.

1404
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:05,280
One of the best theme park seats for sure.

1405
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,280
Is this the is it the seat?

1406
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,280
Is it the thick seat?

1407
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,280
Final four.

1408
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,280
Which theme park seat?

1409
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,280
There's not a lot to deal with.

1410
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:17,280
OK, we got that.

1411
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,280
We got Donald.

1412
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,280
We got Pooh Bear.

1413
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:20,280
Brian Bear.

1414
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,280
Pooh Bear.

1415
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,280
Shrek.

1416
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:23,280
Donald.

1417
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:24,280
Yeah, Shrek.

1418
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:25,280
Shrek seat.

1419
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,280
Yeah.

1420
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:27,280
Didn't we see in.

1421
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:28,280
Oh, oh, Donald in.

1422
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,280
Well, this is Donald again.

1423
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:33,280
I think Donald in Fill Our Magic is different than Donald in Three Caballeros.

1424
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,280
Yes.

1425
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,280
During Fiesta.

1426
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:36,280
So there's a Donald division.

1427
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,280
Did you say did you say Hulk or Polk?

1428
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,280
I said Hulk.

1429
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,280
Like the Hulk statue.

1430
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:41,280
Not the President Polk.

1431
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,280
President Polk's thick seat.

1432
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,280
Was Polk a larger gentleman?

1433
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:46,280
No, I said Hulk.

1434
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:49,280
Like a Hulk statue ripping apart the track.

1435
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,280
He's got a thick seat.

1436
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:53,280
If that had been true and just did.

1437
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,280
What if Polk?

1438
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:58,280
James K. Polk was a skinny, slight man except for his large seat.

1439
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:01,280
Well, we know which president has the largest seat.

1440
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,280
Oh, yeah.

1441
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,280
And he'll be in there.

1442
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:06,280
He's in this final four maybe.

1443
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:07,280
Oh, no.

1444
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,280
Do we have to?

1445
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,280
This is horrible.

1446
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:10,280
It's all weird.

1447
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,280
Well, it's all male, which is weird.

1448
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:20,280
But how horrible would it be if we three men put like a nice, a nice female seat?

1449
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:21,280
No, no, no.

1450
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,280
Disgusting.

1451
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,280
No, absolutely not.

1452
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:25,280
No, I mean weird as hell.

1453
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:26,280
Yeah, we shouldn't do this.

1454
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,280
Big boys only.

1455
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,280
Big boys season's coming.

1456
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,280
Temperatures dropping.

1457
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,280
Get yourself a big boy.

1458
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:34,280
We're good boys admiring big boy butts.

1459
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,280
But they're mostly animal butts.

1460
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:37,280
Yeah.

1461
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:38,280
They're big animal butts.

1462
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:39,280
Yeah.

1463
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:40,280
That's what it is.

1464
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,280
That's what makes it wholesome.

1465
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:44,280
There's a couple big boys in How to Train Your Dragon, that universe.

1466
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:47,280
So we've got to see about the epic universe.

1467
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:48,280
Well, it's called an epic universe.

1468
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:51,280
You think we should wait till 2023 to do the thick seats?

1469
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:53,280
No, I'm just saying we might have some thick seats on the horizon.

1470
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,280
Final four?

1471
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,280
Final four.

1472
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,280
I was just saying brace yourselves, fellas.

1473
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,280
All right.

1474
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,280
I'm brazing myself.

1475
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,280
I'm just saying we have to talk about the thick seats now.

1476
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,280
Sure.

1477
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,280
Big Al, probably a lot of the country bears.

1478
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,280
Big Al seems like it'll sweep in.

1479
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,280
A lot of the country bears are in the conversation.

1480
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:07,280
Mm-hmm.

1481
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,280
Yeah.

1482
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,280
So we can't discount Henry.

1483
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,280
No.

1484
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,280
You can't get to discount any of them.

1485
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:13,280
No.

1486
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,280
You didn't even know or should you try?

1487
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,280
Pooh bear.

1488
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,280
Pooh, yeah.

1489
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:17,280
Why is it Pooh already?

1490
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:21,280
But you really see, is there really seat involved?

1491
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,280
Yeah, isn't there?

1492
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,280
Yeah.

1493
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,280
Yeah.

1494
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:25,280
Mainly if he's stuck, it's like the other way.

1495
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,280
Yeah, he gets stuck.

1496
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:29,280
Yeah, he gets, well, but then he like floats around when he has his like honey hallucination.

1497
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,280
Mm-hmm.

1498
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,280
So.

1499
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,280
Are there any universal, well, obviously.

1500
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:34,280
Check.

1501
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,280
Homer J. Simpson.

1502
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,280
Homer J. Simpson.

1503
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:37,280
Of course.

1504
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,280
Yeah.

1505
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:39,280
Uh.

1506
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,280
I'm trying to think if there's a.

1507
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:41,280
Vin Diesel?

1508
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,280
Vin Diesel.

1509
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,280
I don't think that's a thick seat.

1510
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,280
I'm a bum.

1511
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:45,280
Dominic Toretto.

1512
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:46,280
Bum Bumblebee?

1513
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,280
No.

1514
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,280
Would you refer to a.

1515
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:49,280
They have.

1516
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,280
Fast and Furious Cars having a thick seat.

1517
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:55,280
Well, Bumble, the Transformers and the Fast and Furious Cars all have seats.

1518
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,280
Literal seats.

1519
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:57,280
So you could put them in there too.

1520
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,280
Because they're cars.

1521
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,280
Michael, don't be ridiculous.

1522
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:02,280
I'm just saying maybe there's a cushion, a thick cushion in their seats.

1523
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,280
I think they're getting bumped ASAP.

1524
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,280
All right, fine.

1525
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,280
In favor of real seats.

1526
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,280
Fine.

1527
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,280
Maybe they'll, maybe they'll make it in.

1528
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,280
We don't, we haven't talked about this.

1529
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,280
We're just brainstorming.

1530
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:11,280
Hagrid.

1531
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,280
Hagrid animatronic.

1532
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,280
Big boy.

1533
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,280
Yeah, that's true.

1534
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:15,280
That's true.

1535
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,280
Three out of dog probably.

1536
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,280
Yeah.

1537
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,280
Yeah.

1538
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,280
Wouldn't want to clean up after that.

1539
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,280
No.

1540
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:22,280
Well, I guess we have to do it.

1541
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,280
Thick.

1542
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,280
Ugh.

1543
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,280
That's where.

1544
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:29,280
You feel who haven't checked in on the podcast are like friends of ours.

1545
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,280
Like, like.

1546
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,280
How's the podcast going?

1547
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:33,280
Good.

1548
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,280
We just did the thick seat final four.

1549
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:41,280
We spent two hours, 45 minutes talking about which animal's butt was the best or fluffiest.

1550
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:45,280
And then people get home from the, that party where that conversation was said, like, Oh,

1551
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,280
I ran into a Gardener.

1552
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,280
Yeah, he's not, I don't.

1553
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,280
Something's wrong.

1554
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:51,280
I don't know if I'm going to talk to him at a party again.

1555
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,280
Yeah.

1556
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,280
I think I'm done with that guy.

1557
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,280
They were doing the theme park podcast.

1558
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:58,280
I thought it was like, they're talking about like, you know, the haunted mansion or whatever,

1559
01:11:58,280 --> 01:11:59,280
but they're.

1560
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,280
Like they are just very, very slowly.

1561
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,280
Very.

1562
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:04,280
Yeah.

1563
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:08,280
But it's the furry robots, but they were talking about it for 45 minutes.

1564
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:09,680
And he talked to me.

1565
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:12,280
He cornered me and talked to me at the party about it for 75.

1566
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:14,280
Show me photos of it.

1567
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,280
I kept telling him I had to go to the bathroom.

1568
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:20,280
So he said, I'll follow you there.

1569
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:26,280
Carlson wrote a, spent a week writing a song about the robots, but I don't know.

1570
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,280
He's cracking up.

1571
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:32,280
We all did at least two song parodies for the thick seat final four.

1572
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,280
Yeah.

1573
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,280
All right.

1574
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:36,280
And I got a third.

1575
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,280
Oh, I knew you would.

1576
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:40,280
Yeah.

1577
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,280
Oh, a glimpse into our future.

1578
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,280
We all know we have to do it.

1579
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:43,280
I'm like, yeah.

1580
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,280
I'm looking in a scary mirror.

1581
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:46,280
Yeah.

1582
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,280
Oh, what a burden.

1583
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,280
Watching our brains decay.

1584
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:51,280
Looking at each other like, well, like as if we just accidentally killed someone, we're

1585
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,280
like, well, we have to cover it up.

1586
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:53,280
We have to do this now.

1587
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,280
Like we're all in this together.

1588
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,280
This didn't happen.

1589
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,280
Yeah.

1590
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,280
Well, that's, or this will happen.

1591
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,280
I was going to say this will happen.

1592
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:01,280
Okay.

1593
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:04,280
So I think I've braced myself enough.

1594
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:05,280
Oh yeah.

1595
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:09,280
Let's talk about, so the end credits, you zoom out of the car.

1596
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,280
Leo is there.

1597
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,280
The bus are there.

1598
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:18,280
They're driving on an endless bridge to a digital vacation, presumably, but it looks

1599
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:24,280
like a limbo and we hit the credits and what song are you greeted with?

1600
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:25,280
You're thinking grim grinning ghosts.

1601
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,280
You're thinking that we're good music.

1602
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:30,280
No, it's a song called is you by Nelly.

1603
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:36,280
It is a song by Nelly that samples the people's court theme song.

1604
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:39,280
I forgot.

1605
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:42,280
I truly thought I was losing it.

1606
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:48,280
Nothing glues this more to 2003 than credit song by Nelly.

1607
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:54,280
But the fact that it's a Nelly song that samples the people's court theme song, I truly thought

1608
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:58,280
I was losing my mind as I was watching this because I was going, is that the people's

1609
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,280
court?

1610
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,280
Yeah.

1611
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:05,280
I, and you, and you know it and you're like, is it like a scared, is it from a scary movie

1612
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,280
or something?

1613
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:07,280
No, no, no.

1614
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,280
It's the people's court.

1615
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:11,280
I'm now on the Wikipedia of is you.

1616
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,280
This was not made for the haunted mansion.

1617
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:20,280
It was originally on Nelly's album, the dirty versions, the reinvention.

1618
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:27,280
And let me just, this is a case where why say it in my own words when I could just read

1619
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:31,280
the Wikipedia music video similar to the film, the haunted mansion.

1620
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,280
Nelly inherits a mansion from his recently deceased uncle.

1621
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:35,280
Sorry, Nelly.

1622
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,280
Sorry.

1623
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:37,280
Your uncle died.

1624
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,280
Nelly condolences and throws a house party.

1625
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:43,280
However, his guests soon start falling victim to the haunting of the house.

1626
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:46,280
Falling victim to the haunting of the house.

1627
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:54,280
Nelly soon confronts the evil spirit causing it all also played by him and defeats it by

1628
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:57,280
throwing an enchanted orb he received from a zombie.

1629
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,280
Whoa.

1630
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,280
The evil spirit.

1631
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:04,280
Mike, can you throw this on your TV or something while we wrap this up?

1632
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:09,280
I really regret not knowing there was a music video or watching it.

1633
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:10,280
Yeah.

1634
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:11,280
I'm sorry.

1635
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,280
I'm going to leave Evo and watch the video.

1636
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,280
This music video sounds better than this movie.

1637
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,280
Yeah, it seems like it does everything the movie does, but in quicker time.

1638
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:21,280
And then in the end, the evil spirit is destroyed and the ghosts of the mansion are free.

1639
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,280
So that all happens.

1640
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:25,280
There's a ghost ball who in this version is not Elizabeth.

1641
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:29,280
And this wasn't made in conjunction with the movie.

1642
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:32,280
The video maybe finally.

1643
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,280
The video was probably like.

1644
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,280
Was.

1645
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,280
Was.

1646
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,280
Yeah.

1647
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:41,280
You know, those music videos back in the day were like it would be a music video and

1648
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:45,280
there would just be one or two clips from the movie just shoved in.

1649
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:46,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1650
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,280
Those are always interesting.

1651
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,280
I'm also in this vein.

1652
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:53,280
This is a similar probably within the year, the couple year period of Master of Disguise,

1653
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:57,280
which has a song by Cleopatra called Master of Disguise.

1654
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,280
He's the M A S T E R of Disguise.

1655
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,280
True change right in front of your eyes.

1656
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,280
I'd like to recommend that one too.

1657
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,280
That's the haunted mansion.

1658
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:05,280
Like this.

1659
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,280
The video is clearly made.

1660
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:08,280
Do we need to pause recording and just watch this?

1661
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,280
Yeah, let's pause this.

1662
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:10,280
Okay, hang on.

1663
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,280
We are back.

1664
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:18,280
Okay, I really regret not finding out about this because we have to wrap it up because

1665
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,280
I have to leave for something.

1666
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,280
So we just got to like take it all.

1667
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,280
It's tough to take it all in.

1668
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,280
Let's try to describe what we just saw.

1669
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,280
Also though, stop what you're doing and watch first.

1670
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:27,280
Stop what you're doing.

1671
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,280
Watch this horny video.

1672
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:30,280
This extremely horny video.

1673
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,280
Horny, not horny.

1674
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,280
Horny.

1675
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:33,280
That's pretty horny too.

1676
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,280
Yeah.

1677
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:35,280
Oh my God.

1678
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:40,280
So you kick right into a really green screeny scene where a woman is very impatient outside

1679
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:42,280
the haunted mansion looking at her watch.

1680
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:43,280
Where's Nellie?

1681
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,280
Nellie gets there.

1682
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,280
You're late.

1683
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:47,280
I've been waiting for you for over an hour.

1684
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,280
I'm sorry to hear about your uncle, but you just got to sign this very quickly.

1685
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,280
She says it as flat and quick as that.

1686
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:53,280
That's not me rushing.

1687
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,280
Your uncle left you this great house.

1688
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,280
Your uncle left you this great house.

1689
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,280
Oh cool.

1690
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,280
Hey, do you want to stick around and hang out in the house?

1691
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,280
No, I got to go.

1692
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,280
Sorry.

1693
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,280
Bye.

1694
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:08,520
He's in like a yellow Lambo that now beats Eddie's BMW as the nicest car to drive into

1695
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,400
the haunted mansion.

1696
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,920
So Eddie's been shown up.

1697
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:15,280
I mean, this whole thing shows up the movie big time.

1698
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,280
This is better than the movie for sure.

1699
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:17,280
This is better.

1700
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,280
Better than the movie.

1701
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:21,280
This is a wild Nellie at the height of his powers, I feel like.

1702
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,280
Yeah.

1703
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:23,280
2003.

1704
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,280
Yeah, a couple of years.

1705
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,280
All that's too hot in here is not far.

1706
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,280
Budget, effects, acting.

1707
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:27,280
Let's see Nellie act a lot.

1708
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:31,280
Acting, three different Nellies, some ghost Nellies, zero Band-Aids.

1709
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,280
Yeah, you're right.

1710
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,280
No Band-Aids.

1711
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:36,280
He excused the Band-Aid.

1712
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:42,280
Also, this is a music video in a haunted house where there's multiple Nellies and it reminds

1713
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:48,800
me a lot of Michael Jackson's Ghosts, which is, if you've never seen it, insanely high

1714
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:54,040
production value, goes on for like an unnecessary full hour.

1715
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:57,000
Nellie gets it all done in Is You in four minutes.

1716
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,880
He gets more done than the Haunted Mansion movie.

1717
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,200
It's funnier than the Haunted Mansion movie.

1718
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:05,680
He does multiple characters much faster than Michael Jackson does.

1719
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,600
I'm a big fan of this.

1720
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:11,360
Yeah, it's really, I mean, there's a lot of narrative in this video.

1721
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,360
Yeah.

1722
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,360
Yeah, it covers so much.

1723
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:18,120
Part of it, we didn't really say, and this, we oddly talk about this in a different episode

1724
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:21,700
you'll hear in a long time from now, but the first half hour of the Haunted Mansion is

1725
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:23,720
so wretchedly slow.

1726
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:24,720
Yeah.

1727
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:25,720
What are we doing?

1728
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,520
Like, you're not anywhere near a ghost for so long.

1729
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,000
It's like, come on, come on.

1730
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,680
Nellie, this jams so much story.

1731
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:39,280
The woman does you the courtesy of talking as quickly as possible to throw you into it.

1732
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,960
I wish the Haunted Mansion movie had been done at this pace.

1733
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:43,240
I would have no complaints.

1734
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:46,520
They should have, my only complaint with this Nellie video is they should have put some

1735
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,520
of the actors in.

1736
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,840
So like, Wallace Shawn should have been in there.

1737
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:54,240
Like there's a scene where like a ghost sticks its tongue in like one of this woman's ear

1738
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:55,800
and that should have been Wallace Shawn.

1739
01:18:55,800 --> 01:19:00,320
There's a sexy tongue goes like licking a woman's ear, but you don't see it on a camcorder

1740
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,320
monitor.

1741
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:02,320
Right.

1742
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,320
Sexy tongue goes should have been played by Wallace Shawn.

1743
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,320
Sure.

1744
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,320
That's what I'm saying.

1745
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:06,320
Can I be a Saint Lunatic?

1746
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:11,600
Wallace Shawn and Nellie in a video together.

1747
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,600
Come on.

1748
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,600
This is still gonna happen.

1749
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,720
Nellie is making it rain at one point in the video.

1750
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:20,040
If Wallace Shawn was next to him also making it rain, this would have been the cultural

1751
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,320
event of the year.

1752
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,680
Yeah, that's true.

1753
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:25,200
I think my butt getting big.

1754
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:32,040
Oh, well now he's in the whole Nellie extended universe.

1755
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:37,960
So a lot of 2003 flip cams and then like ghosts start appearing in those like this creepy

1756
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:40,960
tongue ghost.

1757
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:44,920
Nellie, I just wrote down, he rapped Nellie raps in that one way Nellie raps.

1758
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:51,840
It's just kind of like all the Nellie songs.

1759
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:55,080
He hooks up with somebody in a haunted bed.

1760
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:56,360
He seems like excited.

1761
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:57,360
Here we go.

1762
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:00,400
This is the sweetest bed I've ever hooked up in.

1763
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:06,980
And then it starts bouncing around, but he but not the not because of the fucking it's

1764
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:08,260
because of ghosts.

1765
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:11,280
And then the woman stays in the bed and is like seizureing.

1766
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,280
It's very disturbing.

1767
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:14,080
Yeah, like the exorcist or something.

1768
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,080
Yeah.

1769
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:18,160
And then there's some poltergeist stuff with TVs too.

1770
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,560
Again more types of ghosts than the movie.

1771
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:21,560
Yeah.

1772
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,040
It was superior in every way.

1773
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,600
Scarier than the movie.

1774
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:25,600
Yeah.

1775
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,840
There was a genuine like jump scare with that tongue ghost appearing in the camera.

1776
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:33,720
And we all went, oh, it's actually yeah, actually a little bit freaky.

1777
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:38,080
Someone turns their neck a full like three set layers, like a creepy makeup effect.

1778
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:41,200
And yeah, a toilet explodes with water.

1779
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:45,880
A lot of the rapping is done via Nellie in a leota ball.

1780
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:46,880
Yeah.

1781
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:50,720
As a park nerd, I had no idea this was has been sitting there for so long.

1782
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:55,280
Yeah, really video where Nellie is in Madame Leota's crystal ball.

1783
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,280
Yeah.

1784
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:59,240
Yeah, we need to there needs to be merch of that.

1785
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:02,320
And that I will allow in the ride.

1786
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,320
Oh, yeah.

1787
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:04,320
OK.

1788
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:11,040
Maybe on every 420, the ball is full of green smoke and it's Nellie rapping is you.

1789
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,040
Oh, my God.

1790
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:14,480
Oh, now that's a holiday overlay.

1791
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:19,360
We can all hear him says like in the song and in note that when the woman walks into

1792
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,040
town, that's what he says in the song.

1793
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:24,560
And he says, I've never been the type to break up a happy home, but there's something about

1794
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,560
baby girl.

1795
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,520
I just can't leave her alone.

1796
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:28,520
So he'll say that in the room.

1797
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:31,520
I can't leave alone.

1798
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,760
I also thought I said while we were watching it, there's some censoring there.

1799
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,960
They heard the word poppin and then they censored what's after that.

1800
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:43,080
And I thought that was going to be about poppin P, but it's about poppin B bottles.

1801
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,960
They censored it because you can't talk about poppin bottles.

1802
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:46,960
There's a couple.

1803
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:47,960
There's an F word.

1804
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:48,960
There's yeah.

1805
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:50,560
There's a lot.

1806
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,560
I'm surprised by this.

1807
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:52,960
I'm surprised Disney put this.

1808
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:53,960
Do they know?

1809
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:56,960
They just didn't know.

1810
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,360
The Internet was so slow.

1811
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:05,160
They had to run it on a DV tape over and the PA got lost and they were all like just rush.

1812
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:06,160
Just get it out.

1813
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,160
Just get it out.

1814
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:08,160
The theaters.

1815
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:09,160
Who cares?

1816
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:10,160
So the zombie shows up.

1817
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:16,000
Nellie hits it with a frying pan and then goes in the fridge and gets a bottle of champagne.

1818
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:21,040
You pour one pours one out and a coffin comes through the ground.

1819
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,040
Yeah, that's great.

1820
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,040
Good idea.

1821
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:26,040
You pour one out and then the dead body comes up.

1822
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,040
Yeah.

1823
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,040
Where you poured one out.

1824
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:31,040
And that's where he gets the orb, the orb that he throws at Ghost Nellie.

1825
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,800
That makes Ghost Nellie's head explode.

1826
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,360
He explodes his own head.

1827
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:42,200
But before that, Ghost Nellie waves his arms and seals regular Nellie's mouth shut.

1828
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,200
Yeah.

1829
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,400
It's a Wu-Tang torture sketch-esque event.

1830
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,400
It's very disturbing.

1831
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,320
His mouth is like buttoned up.

1832
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:51,320
Looks like a butthole.

1833
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:52,320
Yeah, it's scary.

1834
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,320
Yeah.

1835
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:54,320
Yeah.

1836
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:57,760
That's again a freakier thing than happens in Eddie Murphy Haunted Mansion.

1837
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:01,280
Man, this is so much better than the Haunted Mansion.

1838
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,360
Nellie decapitates himself.

1839
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:07,200
It is so much more memorable than any single one part.

1840
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:08,200
Wow.

1841
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,080
This saved the episode.

1842
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,920
I am so much more excited than when we started it.

1843
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:13,920
I know.

1844
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,560
If only I knew Nellie was coming at the end.

1845
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:17,560
I can't wait to share.

1846
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,160
The best is at the end.

1847
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,720
Like the ghost following you home.

1848
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:25,920
We gave you a good little like a good little fun hit of something at the end of this episode.

1849
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:32,440
Just like when he was alive, Master Gracie, sharing his beautiful home with ballroom dancing

1850
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:37,680
guests, we're so excited to share Is You with you, the listener.

1851
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:38,680
Yes.

1852
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,080
It's the same exact thing.

1853
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,120
It's the same exact thing.

1854
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:45,080
It's tough to obviously Grim Grin Ghosts.

1855
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:51,040
I'll still barely give the edge as the best Haunted Mansion affiliated song, but a very

1856
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:52,040
close second.

1857
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,040
Nipping at his heels.

1858
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,040
Yeah.

1859
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:55,040
Is You.

1860
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:59,160
In 2003, it would have been tempting to say, take out Grim Grin Ghosts.

1861
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,480
I think it's Is You now.

1862
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:05,640
Do we know anyone who?

1863
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:10,480
There has to be someone we know that works Haunted Mansion is high up enough to let us

1864
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:14,440
ride through the Haunted Mansion with Is You blasting.

1865
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,840
One ride through.

1866
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:21,080
We got some fun little hookups in Florida.

1867
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:24,280
We got to go in a place in the Haunted Mansion that we didn't know existed.

1868
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:27,520
We'll talk about that, of course, in a few years when we get to that.

1869
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,520
Yes.

1870
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:29,520
Yes.

1871
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,520
On the Haunted Mansion in Florida.

1872
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,520
But yes, that's what I'm thinking.

1873
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:36,000
Like maybe we know someone that works like Ops that could just, you know, put a CD in

1874
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
a disc drive.

1875
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Yeah.

1876
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:41,680
I don't want to say names, but did anyone we just met, if there's anyone listening

1877
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:43,720
to this, can you arrange?

1878
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,080
Obviously, we are.

1879
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,760
Thank you so much for everything you did for us while we were down there.

1880
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,640
But now we've got a new dream.

1881
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:50,640
Yeah.

1882
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:54,880
Which is bumping Is You the whole mansion long.

1883
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:58,760
I honestly think it would play well too, because there's a couple of party scenes and it's

1884
01:24:58,760 --> 01:24:59,760
a party song.

1885
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:00,760
Oh yeah.

1886
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:02,080
And I think the graveyard.

1887
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,600
All those ghosts would have a fun time with that.

1888
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,600
Yeah.

1889
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:11,400
I guess what we could do is, at the very least, what we'll do is have our phones bring your

1890
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:17,320
headphones or your AirPods and blast Is You in your headphones while you're on the Haunted

1891
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:18,320
Mansion.

1892
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:19,320
Yeah.

1893
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,960
And we'll all put on face band-aids in solidarity.

1894
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:25,320
Hey, and you know what else we got to do.

1895
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,800
We got to get high, y'all.

1896
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:27,800
Oh, well.

1897
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:28,800
You know what that means?

1898
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:33,400
My standard one quarter of a weed gummy that gets me sleepy.

1899
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:34,400
Hell yeah.

1900
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,360
Nellie would be proud.

1901
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:38,360
Yeah, I'm going to have to figure that out.

1902
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:41,000
I'm going to have to really test that out, because I don't want to freak out.

1903
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,360
Because I'm going to freak out hearing the party song and seeing.

1904
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,360
Too intense.

1905
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:48,160
It's too much of a party, my brain.

1906
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,640
You're going to be looking for the tongue ghost.

1907
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:52,720
You're like, oh, I don't want that tongue ghost to get me.

1908
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:53,720
Yeah.

1909
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:57,480
I thought I liked this song, but now it feels like a tongue ghost licking my ear.

1910
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:58,480
All right.

1911
01:25:58,480 --> 01:25:59,480
Well, I'll look.

1912
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:03,000
I'll work on my weed tolerance so we can do this.

1913
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Yeah.

1914
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,160
I guess we have to do that.

1915
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,680
I guess we do actually have to do this, too.

1916
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:11,040
We have to get them to or do we just know we should go.

1917
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:16,720
I'm saying we at least have to get high and bring our headphones and see what the haunted

1918
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,560
mansion is like with is you play.

1919
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,560
I think we have to do this.

1920
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:21,560
I think we really.

1921
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:22,560
That that that that.

1922
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:25,560
And then I think we.

1923
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:31,120
Yeah, I think it's hard to bring these rides to life for yourself again.

1924
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,320
But this we found a way.

1925
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:36,600
We're not saying we're mansion records records, but we can't leave it alone.

1926
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:37,600
Oh, man.

1927
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:43,760
Well, what a great exit.

1928
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:47,400
You survived haunt cast the fright 2019.

1929
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:48,400
Wow.

1930
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:49,400
Wow.

1931
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:50,400
What about.

1932
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,200
And hey, you don't have to wait for it next time you're in Disneyland.

1933
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,200
Bring headphones.

1934
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:57,080
Yeah, you know, whatever you feel comfortable doing.

1935
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:00,920
If you want to bring in your own quarter of a weed coming, I'm not going to stop you.

1936
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,200
I would say do it in the car, though.

1937
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:05,040
You don't want to disrespect the sanctity of the park.

1938
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,040
That would be my preference.

1939
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:08,640
But that whatever you want devouring of a gummy.

1940
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:09,640
Yeah.

1941
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:10,640
Yeah.

1942
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:11,640
I think that is you.

1943
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:12,640
Hell, yeah.

1944
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,720
That was a lot of fun.

1945
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:17,200
As I said, please stick around for November.

1946
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,480
The second gate there's it's been transformed.

1947
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:23,040
If the spirit our spirits are set free, it's no longer the cemetery gate.

1948
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,040
Yeah.

1949
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:27,160
It'll be the second gate again in a couple of days and fun stuff coming.

1950
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:28,160
Bye.

1951
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:31,280
Ding, Ding, Ding, Ding, Ding, Ding.
