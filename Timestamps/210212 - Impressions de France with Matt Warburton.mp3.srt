1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,680
Dog.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,040
Among gentle spirits of the air,

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,480
our podcast awakens at the early dawn.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,200
It may include censored sunbathers,

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,140
talking body parts, and Simpsons trivia

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,580
as breathtaking as the French Alps.

8
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,560
Matt Warburton joins us to talk Epcot's film

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,360
Impressions de France, not to mention his work

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,920
on the Simpsons ride.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,680
This is podcast Les Attractions.

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,100
["Impressions de France"]

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,640
Welcome to Podcast the Ride,

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,140
a podcast about theme parks that might get a little dry,

15
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,320
so if you're bored, just do a Beauty and the Beast

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,840
sing-along instead.

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,320
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Jason Sheridan, hi.

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,580
Bonjour mon ami.

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,760
I'm very excited for an episode subtitled,

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,920
Jason Mispronounces Any Number of French Names,

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,280
Landmarks, Cities.

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,240
Yeah, yeah, we're pretty screwed.

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,920
It's gonna be a lot of Versace and such.

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,760
Yeah, yeah.

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,720
Mike Carlson, how do you think you'll fare?

26
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,760
Well, look, I did two years of high school French,

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,880
and I was addressed as Bernard in that class,

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,960
so I do think maybe this will all come back to me.

29
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,080
Have I studied up on it?

30
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,920
No.

31
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,920
Have I relearned anything?

32
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,740
No.

33
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,000
But I'm hoping that I'll remember things,

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,520
like I'll remember how to say, let's say,

35
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,240
Keller et al, that's what time it is.

36
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,160
It's asking what time is it, excuse me.

37
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,560
So that just came back to me now,

38
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,460
so we're gonna have revelations like that as we go on.

39
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,280
So I'm excited to see what's still in my brain.

40
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,400
This is maybe your only chance to show it.

41
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,640
This is the only application you've found, seemingly,

42
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,080
for two years of high school French,

43
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,120
is this very episode, so don't blow it.

44
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,540
I will try not to.

45
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,040
And I guess we'll learn about the French skills

46
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,000
of our guest, who mainly, it seems like,

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,960
is a pretty huge theme park fan, a pretty big Epcot head,

48
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,000
so we're excited to talk to him.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,940
He's a comedy writer, has worked on The Simpsons

50
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,800
and The Mindy Project.

51
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,600
It's Matt Warburton, hello.

52
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,680
Hello.

53
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,240
Bonjour, madame de monsieur.

54
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,960
Oh, geez.

55
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,760
I don't speak any French either, I feel bad.

56
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,640
One of four of us speaks a word of French.

57
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,820
I have learned every French word I know

58
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,480
is from either the people introducing the movie

59
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,780
we're about to talk about, or things mentioned

60
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,840
in the 18-minute France documentary at Epcot itself.

61
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,480
So, yeah, it's gonna be a tough road for the audience here.

62
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,320
Yeah.

63
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,560
People are coming to it hoping for a duolingo experience

64
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,920
where they can pick some stuff up.

65
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,800
I don't know, it's not coming from, you know.

66
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,840
Yeah.

67
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,360
I wonder how helpful those apps are.

68
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,080
This movie reminded me, oh yeah, I've always wanted

69
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,160
to see Paris and the French countryside.

70
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,180
I've always wanted to go to this,

71
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,300
and looking up some French language stuff,

72
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,140
I was like, oh, I would need to do some prep

73
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:28,140
before I do this, but I had like six or seven years

74
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,860
between middle school, high school, and college of Spanish,

75
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,900
and there was so much emphasis on finishing workbooks

76
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,100
and worksheets and textbook chapters

77
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,860
that I really did not do a very good job

78
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,380
at learning how to speak it.

79
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,900
Mm-hmm.

80
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,500
So are you calling into question

81
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,620
the American education system, basically?

82
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,820
Yeah, I'm going out on a real limb here

83
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,540
and calling out the American education system.

84
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,740
I see.

85
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,140
Well, I agree with you.

86
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,500
I mean, I think, actually, now that I think about it,

87
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,020
I did take some junior high French,

88
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,260
and it's just, it's like not practical.

89
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,740
There's like a must be a better way.

90
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,880
I don't know if it's total immersion.

91
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,780
I assume that's the best way for most people

92
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,420
to learn a language.

93
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,660
But yeah, it's not like I came out,

94
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,420
but you would think after a year of study

95
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,580
or nine months of study

96
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,180
that I would have some good grasp on it, and I do not.

97
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,460
And it was also a time when my brain

98
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,340
was actually absorbing things.

99
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,140
So you would think that would be good.

100
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,020
Oh yeah, before that stops, yes, into adulthood.

101
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,140
It's done.

102
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,980
I remember the names of the Ninja Turtles friends,

103
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,580
and I remember the pavilions at Epcot,

104
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,740
and that's about it.

105
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,780
I was absorbing, like, kids in the hall reruns,

106
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,740
and that's what ate up most of my brain power.

107
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,380
Sure.

108
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,820
All right, so it's an Epcot-centric worldview here,

109
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,820
evidently, and Matt, for us exchanging DMs a little bit,

110
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,820
yeah, it seems like you're a pretty big Epcot per,

111
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,540
like that's the focus of your theme parkdom, possibly.

112
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,180
Yeah, I mean, I've always,

113
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,300
I've been going to Disney World and Epcot

114
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,820
since I was a little kid, probably.

115
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,120
First time, I'm like a little older than you guys,

116
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,460
probably like 84, 85, so, you know, I've been on Horizons.

117
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,460
I was on original World of Motion,

118
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,020
and, you know, like vintage Epcot

119
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,900
is definitely my way into loving theme park stuff.

120
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,060
Definitely carried over, you know,

121
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,940
and also what I will say is that a great thing,

122
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,020
a thing that's interesting about World Showcase

123
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,340
and the French Pavilion in particular,

124
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,740
in the movie that we're talking about is like,

125
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,100
I'm also happen to be really interested in, like,

126
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,180
World's Fairs, and I don't know if you guys know this,

127
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,500
but like, you know, Epcot was designed

128
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,020
to be permanent World's Fair.

129
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,260
Right. Yes.

130
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,780
Disney World had done all this,

131
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,060
the Disney Company and Imagineering had done all this work

132
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,860
working on the 64 World's Fair and things like that.

133
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,220
I didn't realize this when I first started going to Epcot,

134
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,340
but I was like, when I found out that like,

135
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,820
oh, there are these things called World's Fairs

136
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,300
that are like Epcot, I, as a kid was like,

137
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,380
oh, this is great, and so, as an adult, I started,

138
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,020
I've been to four of the actual World's Fairs,

139
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,580
which they still have, nobody in America

140
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,860
knows about them or goes to them,

141
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,140
but they still, every couple of years, they have one,

142
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,940
and so, like, I am proof positive that like,

143
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,260
that they are really very much like going to Epcot,

144
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,740
and Epcot's better, but they're still around,

145
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,940
and I will say that like, the experience of the movie,

146
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,540
the Impressions of France, the movie we're talking about,

147
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,940
is like the most accurate sort of thing

148
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,260
of what a real World's Fair is actually like,

149
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,620
so the audience is getting a pretty good example of that.

150
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,180
Like the kind of thing they show,

151
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,420
like there are films like this.

152
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,260
Yeah, I mean, it's a movie,

153
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,180
and you know, sort of like an IMAX-y type of movie

154
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,860
that's basically like a, trying to get you to go there

155
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,460
as a tourist and sell you an idea of the country.

156
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,580
Of going to a place.

157
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,420
Where have you been?

158
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,940
Like, they'll throw money, like,

159
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,780
I've been to like the North Korea Pavilion

160
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,100
at the Chinese World's Fair in 2010, like, yeah,

161
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,580
you know, you'd be surprised how they can like,

162
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,420
gussy up a pretty awful country to make it look nice.

163
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,660
One of these pavilions.

164
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,180
Wow, that's insane.

165
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,100
Yeah, like, I guess I've always,

166
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,220
my interest in World's Fairs has sort of stemmed from,

167
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,820
like, that there were other 80s ones

168
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,700
with sort of the blocky retro future vibe of Epcot,

169
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,420
like Expo 86, I think,

170
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,180
because, wait, now I'm mixing it up,

171
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,500
is that Montreal, maybe?

172
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,140
But, or there's a Knoxville one,

173
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,980
but like, what is the, what's the feel of a current,

174
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,900
of like a post 2000 World's Fair?

175
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,540
Yeah, the ones I've been to,

176
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,780
I would say the most like, sort of,

177
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,020
they tend to be like futuristic,

178
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,380
but in a kind of like shopping mall kind of way.

179
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,580
I mean, they're not, there aren't a lot of rides,

180
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,540
which is one thing I was disappointed to learn.

181
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,380
They're often like one or something,

182
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,700
but they're, you know, they're not like

183
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,420
imagineering quality,

184
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,460
they're sort of like cardboard cutouts and stuff,

185
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,420
or like a little roller coaster or something like that.

186
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,980
But yeah, I would say like,

187
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,100
or sort of Angelino's in the audience,

188
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,420
they kind of had the vibe of the new Century City Mall,

189
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,500
kind of, but on a much, much, much larger scale.

190
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,860
Like to the point where the last one that I went to

191
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,940
was 2015, which was in Milan,

192
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,740
it actually had an Italy in it.

193
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,260
And so when the Italy came to our mall here in LA,

194
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,820
it was, it really transported me

195
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,380
to the 2015 Milan World's Fair.

196
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,180
Like not Italy proper, but the version of Italy.

197
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,300
They vary in quality.

198
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,380
I'll say the one in Shanghai in 2010

199
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,420
was one of the coolest things.

200
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,780
It was unreal that just the physical fair itself.

201
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,940
So like, it was like, imagine Epcot,

202
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,540
that was the size of Monaco, I think.

203
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,100
It was so big.

204
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,420
Jesus. Wow.

205
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,780
Mind blowing.

206
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,100
But they, you know, they throw these things up.

207
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,740
And one of the cool things at World Fair is they throw it up

208
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,380
and then they tear it all down a year later and it's gone.

209
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,420
And it's a cool thing about Epcot is that it doesn't go away.

210
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,980
So it's like, you know, you see it and you get attached to it

211
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,700
and, you know, obsess over it.

212
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,620
Are World's Fairs on, do you know, on like a Olympic schedule?

213
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,660
Like, do you know, are the next few planned out basically?

214
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,740
Yeah.

215
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,300
So they do a big one every five years.

216
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,140
So on the like, the fives and the tens.

217
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,740
So they were supposed to be one.

218
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,660
The last big one was in Milan.

219
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,220
Like I was saying, the next one,

220
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,740
which got bumped because of COVID is Dubai.

221
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,580
Whoa.

222
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,980
Man, those guys are going to know how to do it right.

223
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,380
Really?

224
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:32,100
I understand that they built an airport just to get in

225
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,460
and out of it is how crazy it is.

226
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,420
Oh my God.

227
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,860
Maybe they rescheduled it for this winter.

228
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,100
We'll see.

229
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,940
Yeah, yeah.

230
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,660
Something for a future.

231
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,300
We've all been upset about Tokyo Olympics getting canceled

232
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,620
and like the level of tech and theming that's going to be,

233
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,260
but now maybe suddenly I'm more disappointed

234
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,860
by a Dubai World's Fair not happening.

235
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,420
The, I don't think, you were not on The Simpsons

236
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,140
when there was the big run

237
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,340
about the Knoxville World's Fair, right?

238
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,180
That was before you were there?

239
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,020
That was before I was there.

240
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,740
Yeah, I did work on the Epcot episode.

241
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,780
That was like 13 or 14, right?

242
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,900
When I first started being there.

243
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,740
Gotcha.

244
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,380
Which was fun because I got,

245
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,180
I was like still too early there

246
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,580
to really have a huge role in that,

247
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,820
but it was a subject I knew a lot about.

248
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,260
The issue being that Al Jean,

249
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,140
the show runner in The Simpsons, great guy,

250
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,060
gave me my job, fantastic person, great writer,

251
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,820
does not like Epcot.

252
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,780
He loves Disney stuff, he loves Disneyland.

253
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,660
He just really has it in for Epcot

254
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,540
and so it was really tough to do that episode

255
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,940
because he just wanted it to seem like really lame.

256
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,140
I guess that's more fun.

257
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,300
And I guess it's a comedy show,

258
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,580
so it's like it wouldn't be that funny

259
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,060
if the jokes were like, isn't this place great?

260
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,220
But yeah, it was a struggle.

261
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,940
I think the designers did a good job.

262
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,340
There's like horizons in the background,

263
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,860
some shots and stuff, but.

264
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,220
Oh right, yeah, and the future sphere

265
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,780
does feel very like you're waiting

266
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:06,200
for the spaceship or the

267
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Eastern Airlines.

268
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
The airplanes are whipping people.

269
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Like Dream Flight sort of.

270
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,700
When you were in that room,

271
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,300
was it just a situation where you were sitting

272
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,860
on your hands when it would be like a joke

273
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,340
would come up about Epcot?

274
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,020
Or you're like, that's actually not accurate.

275
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,220
Absolutely, and look, I love Epcot,

276
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,060
I'm not gonna get fired over it.

277
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,900
Sure.

278
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,940
I don't, you shouldn't have.

279
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,380
Epcot's not worth it.

280
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,220
Which I know that, by the way,

281
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,460
I just said something that'll anger

282
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,620
a lot of our audience.

283
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,520
You've never been in this position

284
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,700
to potentially lose a job by saying

285
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,900
that Epcot's okay and not bad.

286
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,780
It's worth it to go to, it's not worth losing

287
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,500
a good job for is what I'm saying.

288
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,940
I also liked the accuracy of that.

289
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,060
That Epcot is the venue for a Teacher of the Year awards.

290
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,580
That feels like the most,

291
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,260
like there is a Eisner,

292
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,940
there was some American Teacher Awards thing

293
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,700
that was broadcast on the Disney Channel.

294
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,860
They do a lot of, they would host big conventions

295
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,220
and stuff like that there.

296
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,540
So it kind of, yeah, I forget what,

297
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,860
the other crazy thing was,

298
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,540
I think Little Richard was the guest in that episode.

299
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,860
And, rest in peace.

300
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,780
He did a great job.

301
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,540
One thing I remember really clearly though was that,

302
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,500
you know in a script,

303
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,340
this is a Hollywood talk audience members.

304
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,180
Scripts, the way you tell a story.

305
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,380
There's a peak behind the curtain at the biz.

306
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,540
There's often, what's called a reader or an internal

307
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,420
on a line of dialogue in a script, right?

308
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,900
It says like, yelling, get out of here or whatever.

309
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,820
It's like a little parent,

310
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,180
the two parentheses with like how to read the line in it,

311
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:45,300
all the parenthetical or a reader in Hollywood terms.

312
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,500
Okay, so there was a line for Little Richard,

313
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,820
who's a singer, he's not a professional actor,

314
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,500
that his line was, is this true Edna?

315
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,300
Referring to Mrs. Krabappel, Edna Krabappel.

316
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,980
And the reader was furious

317
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,100
so that he would know how to read it.

318
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,540
And I think we did a hundred takes of this guy

319
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,460
every single time.

320
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,540
It was furious, is this true Edna?

321
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,740
I was, I know it says furious,

322
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,700
just like, just anything in the parentheses.

323
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,460
Got it, no problem.

324
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,820
Furious, is this true Edna?

325
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,540
What am I happy with, Chris?

326
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,980
That's great.

327
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,900
That's exactly what I want out of him.

328
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,020
I love hearing that.

329
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,380
The podcast episode about the France Pavilion at Epcot.

330
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,220
Yes.

331
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,140
Did it have to be cut up at all to make the timing right?

332
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,340
Or did he get it eventually?

333
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,420
We got it clean.

334
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,820
Okay.

335
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,140
Maybe a line went.

336
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,020
And he'd done, I'm curious if any of our listeners

337
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,500
worked on his many guest appearances on shows

338
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,100
like Full House and he'd done a lot of things

339
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,740
if there was a similar situation.

340
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,220
Sadly, we can't ask the man himself anymore, but.

341
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,060
Right, yeah, yeah.

342
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,020
When he passed away, I was obvious,

343
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,100
what you were supposed to reflect on

344
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,540
are his contributions to music,

345
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:05,020
but I went to the many, many 90s cameos of Little Richard.

346
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,860
Yeah.

347
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,500
There's a good Mother Goose rockin' rhyme,

348
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,060
he's Old King Cole,

349
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,140
some very bizarre line readings and that, I'm very fond of.

350
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,620
I gotta rewatch the Simpsons one.

351
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,540
And speaking of the Simpsons, before we started,

352
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,740
you reminded us the fact that you were part

353
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,700
of the Simpsons ride.

354
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,100
You were one of the main folks putting the ride together.

355
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,060
That's amazing.

356
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:26,900
Yes.

357
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,540
Definitely like the thing I've worked on

358
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,140
and I'm proudest probably.

359
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,460
It was, or at least the most fun, for sure.

360
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,940
As I've said, coming as a person who's been obsessed

361
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,380
with this stuff since I was a little kid,

362
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,340
to actually get to work on riding.

363
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,700
Actually, when Universal came to us,

364
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,100
because the Simpsons always has this kind of like

365
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,740
special level of control whenever it does something

366
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,100
just because it's sort of a comedy institution

367
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,780
and the way the deals always work.

368
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,700
So when the Simpsons does a video game,

369
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,140
they can really dictate how the video game turns out.

370
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,940
And I had come from that team.

371
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,700
We had just done a couple of the 2000s era video games,

372
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,540
like Hit and Run and some of those things.

373
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:10,540
And I think I ran on a message board back in the day

374
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,340
that they were gonna turn the Back to the Future

375
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,300
ride into a Simpsons thing.

376
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,340
They were gonna redo it.

377
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,300
And I hunted down the executive.

378
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,580
I remember literally chasing her car down and being like,

379
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,740
hey, I heard there's gonna be a ride.

380
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,580
I have to work on it.

381
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,820
You have to let me do this.

382
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,500
I remember stupidly at the time saying,

383
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,220
I will do it for free.

384
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,460
Please let me do this.

385
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,380
Luckily, she was like, we will pay you a tiny amount of money.

386
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,340
I was like, great.

387
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,020
But so yeah, so like I happened to be the person

388
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,860
who was most into this sort of stuff

389
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,180
other than the staff at that time of the Simpsons.

390
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,260
So they kind of just let me be in charge of the product

391
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,980
for much of its run.

392
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,820
We had a great team.

393
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,860
We had Matt Selman and Danny Chun

394
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,860
and a bunch of other writers.

395
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,860
But it was literally like a make a wish foundation

396
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,260
treat for myself.

397
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,860
I got to really figure out what we wanted the ride to be

398
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,980
and go through the whole process.

399
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,220
And it was great.

400
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,060
It took like a year.

401
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,260
It was kind of during the writer's strike.

402
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,340
So like we all had a ton of extra time

403
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,300
to really make it great.

404
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,300
And we would do these things where we would write the script.

405
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,580
And I worked really closely with this guy, Colin Heck,

406
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,380
who's our assistant director, the Simpsons animator.

407
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,940
And we would work on the script.

408
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,380
We had a little trailer on the Foxlet to do it.

409
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,820
And then at night, they would work on a rough pencil animatic

410
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,260
of the animation for the ride.

411
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,420
And we would write it on the screen at Universal that night.

412
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,620
And then they would just project it.

413
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,020
And we'd be in the DeLorean

414
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,420
because the cars were still back to the future.

415
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,020
The ride had been open all day as a back to the future ride.

416
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,180
But we'd test out the moves and stuff.

417
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,020
Wow.

418
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,100
I mean, imagine.

419
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,420
I mean, like heaven.

420
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,860
Yeah, we're all suppressing.

421
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,980
We don't just want to shout noises of joy.

422
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,820
I know.

423
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,220
I mean, I've never gotten over it,

424
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,060
how insanely fun that was.

425
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,900
God, wow.

426
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,740
Wow, wow, wow.

427
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,900
So it was an unbelievable experience.

428
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,420
I feel bad.

429
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,380
I mean, as a part, we'll probably talk about this.

430
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,140
I feel like the France movie,

431
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,660
which is one of my favorite things at Epcot,

432
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,420
is always in danger of being replaced.

433
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,380
It's always like, it's got this Beauty and the Beast thing

434
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,220
nipping at its heels.

435
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,820
If that's popular, who knows what's gonna happen, right?

436
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:31,380
So many great things at Epcot have changed over the years.

437
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,740
Sure, sure, yes.

438
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,420
And I felt like, I wasn't gonna say no to the Simpsons thing,

439
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,260
but I definitely felt bad

440
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,100
because a lot of people loved the Back to the Future ride

441
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,420
and were annoyed at this beloved thing,

442
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,740
which I thought was good.

443
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,940
It wasn't particularly, it wasn't my favorite or anything,

444
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,260
but hey, so I've been on the other side of this.

445
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,860
I get it.

446
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,300
If someone offers you, you're gonna do it.

447
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,660
Yeah, absolutely.

448
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,300
Yeah, well with this though, I feel like,

449
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,660
yeah, was there a pressure or you were like,

450
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,300
oh, if people don't like this,

451
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,780
I'm gonna have the weight of Theme Park fan guilt.

452
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,140
Because I think the consensus I hear is

453
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,060
people like Simpsons, we all like that Simpsons ride a lot.

454
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,980
It's really cool and it is a worthy successor.

455
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,540
I will say that there were a lot of,

456
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,740
I think it turned out great.

457
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,020
It was very much what we wanted.

458
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,780
It was got to be about Theme Park stuff,

459
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,020
which I was really happy that they let us do.

460
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,900
It's hard to ride it now

461
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,220
because there's a million things

462
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,620
I wish we could still change.

463
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,060
Because you're used to the animation process

464
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,860
where you have forever the dialogue and stuff.

465
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,460
It was also weird.

466
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,820
It was a weird group of people.

467
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,660
It was people from Universal who were amazing.

468
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,660
There was Fox people, there was the Simpsons writers.

469
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,060
And there were a lot of compromises made

470
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,540
throughout each line of dialogue

471
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,780
and just making everything.

472
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,220
It was also an interesting challenge.

473
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,020
There aren't a lot of rides that are,

474
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,220
actually not just a Theme Park movie,

475
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,820
but a physical attraction where you're moving

476
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,060
that has to get you to pay attention

477
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,100
to a joke being said at you.

478
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,940
Right, right.

479
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,780
Being thrown around and moving,

480
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,580
doing simulated 360s and stuff,

481
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,020
it's hard to process a joke.

482
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,020
Long line of dialogue.

483
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,380
So we had to make things really simple

484
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,460
and sometimes we'd do it and it wouldn't make sense

485
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,300
and we'd have to make it simpler.

486
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,420
Also, we actually had tested out,

487
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,500
there's a thing at the end where

488
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,780
Barney, the Simpsons character Barney burps.

489
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,580
And we had actually tested out

490
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,860
spraying a bad smell at you.

491
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,660
Oh.

492
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,500
And this is right at the end of the ride

493
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
after you've been jostled around

494
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,700
and we were like, everyone's gonna throw up.

495
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,620
So the burp is still there.

496
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,980
And I think the ride physically has the ability

497
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,260
to throw a bad smell at you.

498
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,540
But it doesn't do it.

499
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,540
It was built to have a burp and then that was canceled.

500
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,980
Yeah, there is one smell, it's a baby powder smell.

501
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,820
Oh yes, yeah.

502
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,260
In Maggie's mouth, right?

503
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,620
Yes, and that's a nice smell.

504
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,780
So it's like nobody likes that.

505
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,140
But then Maggie spits you out

506
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,820
and then there's a part where Barney is front center

507
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,300
and he burps at you.

508
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,140
Right. Too much.

509
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,020
They would, the cleaning budget on that thing

510
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:23,860
would have been disgusting.

511
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,660
Also, those are tiered ride vehicles.

512
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,780
It would have, you would have had a surprise from upstairs.

513
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,540
Oh yes, yeah, it would have dripped down a couple levels.

514
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,620
You'll be happy to hear that the smell in Maggie's mouth

515
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,740
made it to our very prestigious

516
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,620
fake smell final four competition.

517
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,100
It didn't win, it didn't go all the way,

518
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,500
but it was in one of the 16 competitors.

519
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,940
So you guys should go back and listen to this.

520
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,780
What won?

521
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,260
The ET forest smell.

522
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,460
The ET forest, okay.

523
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,540
Yes, yeah, the smell and the line for the ET ride.

524
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,180
I think what did the, did Maggie,

525
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,580
it was in a chaos category with Rome burning

526
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,340
from spaceship Earth, actually.

527
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,820
This is a nightmare category for you.

528
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,300
It's your work versus something I'm not paying attention to.

529
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,460
I'm still going with my heart on that one.

530
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,100
That's burning Rome any time.

531
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,940
Yeah, yeah, unfortunately.

532
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,740
I think I voted for Maggie, didn't I?

533
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,580
I can't remember.

534
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,420
I don't know.

535
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,260
Well, yeah, we'll have to go check.

536
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,860
It's such a specific, I don't know,

537
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,740
it's so unique, the Maggie, the talcum powder,

538
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,700
or whatever it's called, baby powder, excuse me.

539
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,540
Right, right.

540
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,260
It really is what the inside of a baby's mouth smells like.

541
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,100
Right.

542
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,180
I was gonna say to give you credit as a fan,

543
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,620
when we asked what would you wanna talk about,

544
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,420
you led with all Epcot.

545
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,180
Like you did not, you did not like.

546
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,020
We give another option.

547
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,580
Yeah, we haven't mostly been talking

548
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,780
about the Simpsons ride, but.

549
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,260
You did not lead with work.

550
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,380
You led with pleasure and fun.

551
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,940
Yeah, I mean, Epcot's my favorite.

552
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,900
And you guys, I feel like you guys

553
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,900
have been doing a lot of work lately,

554
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,900
you've been focusing on a lot of Epcot stuff.

555
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,940
Thank you, thank you for noticing.

556
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,100
Yes, it's been nice.

557
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,020
It's made us feel better.

558
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,860
And yeah, yeah, what I'll point out is,

559
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,500
pivoting to our subject here a little bit,

560
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,940
a thing I love about the France movie is that I think,

561
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,780
I think it is the only day one Epcot attraction still open,

562
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,820
basically untouched in its original form.

563
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,620
Probably.

564
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,020
Like little updates to American Adventure and stuff.

565
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,260
American Adventure is close,

566
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,700
cause you have the movie, you know, you've got, you know,

567
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,820
who do they add lately?

568
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,660
Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein, whoever they've added.

569
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,100
It is all bad.

570
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,540
Yeah, it is that.

571
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,660
Wheaties box, the end of that thing.

572
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,860
Whoever they add, the end of American Adventure

573
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,380
is gonna be some sort of sex criminal within.

574
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,820
It was like Lance Armstrong, Bill Cosby.

575
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,380
It was unbelievable run of monster.

576
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,700
Neil deGrasse Tyson, Zuckerberg isn't a sex monster,

577
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,940
but he's a different monster in other ways.

578
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,900
Like Neil deGrasse Tyson's kind of,

579
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,380
that came and went a little bit.

580
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,580
Elon Musk is on, there's a lot of people who are like,

581
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,420
I don't know.

582
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,060
Ah, noted American, Elon Musk.

583
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,260
Oh yeah, right.

584
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,420
Not a good look.

585
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,900
I don't know, they should just stick with like

586
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,140
Kermit the Frog at this point or something, you know.

587
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,980
Play it safe.

588
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

589
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,260
It's a curse really to end up in that montage, yeah.

590
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,660
Like when I, you know, as an adult, when I go to Epcot,

591
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,260
I do gravitate towards things that are similar

592
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,020
to they were before.

593
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,740
I try not to be, you know, a nostalgic completely,

594
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,900
but your spaceship Earths,

595
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,220
the land, you know, things that,

596
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,780
things where the rides are recognizable from where they were.

597
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,620
Yeah, for sure.

598
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,420
The France movie, which I think I didn't really appreciate

599
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,580
when I was a kid, it's not like for kids.

600
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,420
Yeah.

601
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,820
It's, I would say like the pinnacle of,

602
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,020
let's call it fancy Epcot.

603
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,180
For the consumer of Epcot.

604
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,860
Right, right.

605
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,220
It is the same, because the China movie changed,

606
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,620
Canada movies changed a bunch of times.

607
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,740
You know, France holding the torch, basically the same.

608
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,780
Yeah, which is cool to, like, see if what you're after

609
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,180
from Epcot is a trip to 1982,

610
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,420
which certainly I am as much as possible.

611
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,980
This one very much is, and yeah, just this literally is

612
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,540
a 82 looking movie.

613
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,700
Yeah, it's just gotta be one of the only experiences

614
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,740
untouched too, just in general,

615
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,540
because everything, Main Street's different,

616
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,860
everything's like, even stuff that looks the same.

617
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,900
It is interesting that this isn't, this didn't have like,

618
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,140
you would think in the 90s they would have had like,

619
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,980
Richard Karn host something and like do a bad French accent

620
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,900
and have like a beret on or something.

621
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,060
I mean, I guess they would probably go with a real French man.

622
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:38,900
They'd go with a real French guy.

623
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,740
Gerard Defardieu, but then they temper it

624
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,140
with Richard Karn, yeah.

625
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,220
Yeah, a side of Richard Karn for the meal.

626
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,980
It has to, this is what, almost 40 years now at this point.

627
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,460
It had to have threaded a particular needle, right?

628
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,700
It's like, it was just popular enough to stay,

629
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,860
but not so popular that they fudged with it

630
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,060
in some significant way.

631
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,860
They never had, like you're saying, Martin Short,

632
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,580
or like they just kind of left it as it is.

633
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,620
And it's been, you know, so we'll see.

634
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,380
We'll see when that area gets a lot more attention

635
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,740
and you got the Ratatouille's gonna be there

636
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,660
around the corner.

637
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,180
It, you think the thing, you know,

638
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,900
it's like baseball or something.

639
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,020
Theme park business is a heartbreaking thing.

640
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,380
The thing you like, gonna go away.

641
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,820
Temporary, you got, you're like,

642
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,780
it could be there for 40 years and it's gonna be gone.

643
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,860
I'm not, hey, I know the French movie's

644
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,060
not gonna be there forever.

645
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,860
I can watch the like, you know, 4K YouTube of it.

646
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:39,860
Great, not the same, but it is nice that there's one thing

647
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,180
that's kind of still in its,

648
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,340
or you guys were talking about,

649
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,420
I listened to a little bit of the Living Seas episode.

650
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,420
I see the restaurant, the Coral Reef restaurant

651
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:54,420
is also like pretty untouched from its initial condition.

652
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,980
There's a few places that like that.

653
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,180
But yeah, yeah, for all this stuff,

654
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,340
it feels like enjoy anything.

655
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,900
Enjoy anything that doesn't feel like it's part

656
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,060
of the synergy plan while you can.

657
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,940
And I didn't mean to rhyme, I apologize.

658
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,380
But like, it feels like if there's no character,

659
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,220
if there's no something,

660
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,860
it's gotta be on the chopping block.

661
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,820
It's gotta be in their heads,

662
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,500
they're like, we could get rid of this.

663
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,340
Yeah, yeah.

664
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,860
And I have tried, like the last two or three times

665
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,020
I have gone down to Disney World,

666
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,980
I have been like, okay,

667
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,580
I'm gonna do Impressions de France.

668
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,620
I know I did it a few times when I was younger.

669
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:33,620
I did not have a ton of big memories of it as a kid,

670
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,700
which I'm gonna chalk up to,

671
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,220
that my family always started at Future World

672
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,100
and would go clockwise from like Mexico onward,

673
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,180
and then would usually eat a large,

674
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,980
debilitating meal at Alfredo's,

675
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:56,980
and then would kind of blitz through the last bit of Epcot

676
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,740
because we were all very tired from the large pasta meal.

677
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,020
And then when I went back as an adult a few times,

678
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,140
I would always try to do Impressions de France

679
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,380
at the end of the day,

680
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,700
and they were like, oh, the park is closing soon,

681
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,140
so we shut it down early.

682
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,500
It was not busy tonight.

683
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,860
And it's like, okay, all right, the French.

684
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,540
And now it's only open at night.

685
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:23,180
I haven't been since they added the Beauty and the Beast thing,

686
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,020
but as I understand it,

687
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,460
it's Beauty and the Beast during the day,

688
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,060
and then at like four o'clock or something,

689
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,900
it's adult time.

690
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,740
Yeah, that's weird.

691
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,580
I believe that's correct.

692
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,660
It's an adult film now.

693
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,140
Something for the parents.

694
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,500
Something for the parents.

695
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
I feel like this is a Twitter conversation lately.

696
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,060
I, growing up in as an adult,

697
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:44,740
have always been a counterclockwise visitor

698
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,220
world showcase.

699
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,500
Any particular like,

700
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,340
Canada first.

701
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,460
If you had to break down the plan?

702
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,300
Yeah.

703
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,140
What's, yeah, what do you,

704
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,700
like what is the route then if you're like,

705
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,300
is there something you wanna do later?

706
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,380
Is there something you wanna do?

707
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,820
Or is there, and is there a middle?

708
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,620
Is there like, the food has to be at this one spot?

709
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,820
You know, I think that the heart of the food is,

710
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,540
well, I think I'd like to hit,

711
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,580
you got a time American Adventure,

712
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,140
because it's like only shows, you know,

713
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,900
once an hour or something like that.

714
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,500
So you gotta kind of like keep your eye on the clock.

715
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,860
I think like growing,

716
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,860
I was a huge fan of the original Canada movie.

717
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,940
Again, I think my parents both liked it.

718
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,940
And so like we were drawn that way.

719
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,780
Or we would do,

720
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,580
this doesn't kind of fit neatly

721
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,700
into what we're talking about,

722
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,820
but I would juke over to Mexico,

723
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,540
go on, you know, El Rio de Tiempo or whatever.

724
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,420
Then we would go back around to,

725
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,740
you know, France and Canada,

726
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,580
and then make our way around.

727
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,340
You know, Maelstrom or et cetera.

728
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,500
Have you been catching the recent happenings

729
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,900
at El Rio del Tiempo,

730
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,380
the slow removal of the animatronics?

731
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,460
This has been an ongoing drama.

732
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,900
It's so delightful when they added them.

733
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,740
They were pretty good animatronics.

734
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,740
Yeah, very much so.

735
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,540
Mexico City scene.

736
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:13,100
Yeah, now they're, Donald died at some point.

737
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,220
So he's just a potted,

738
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,820
he became just a potted plant.

739
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,660
Am I getting that right?

740
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,180
Did it have Donald's hat or something?

741
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,020
Or was it just a plant?

742
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,860
Was it a cactus?

743
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,700
A cactus with a sombrero?

744
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,820
With a sombrero.

745
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,460
And then it was just, I think the plant,

746
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,260
and then I think it was gone entirely.

747
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,220
And then just this morning,

748
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,340
it's cut, it's flat.

749
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,260
They replaced all the robots today or yesterday

750
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,100
with just flats of all three characters.

751
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,220
So all the robots are gone,

752
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,780
even though the other two seemed like they were working fine.

753
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,140
And now it's just three cardboard cutouts,

754
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,980
station, like stationary.

755
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,820
I'm assuming, cause attendance is, I believe,

756
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,500
down now that the holidays are over

757
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,540
and that they are doing repair work or something.

758
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,380
Hopefully.

759
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,660
Assuming that's not permanent,

760
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,860
because it does look like suddenly there is like a bill,

761
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,940
you know, a movie billboard or something

762
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,300
in the middle of the ride.

763
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,540
Maybe it is a classic Epcot fan.

764
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,020
Maybe they have like a Phantom of the Opera

765
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,420
lives in the building and is like, Mrs. El Rio,

766
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,020
you know, Phantom of the...

767
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,060
Oh, the boat ride.

768
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,660
Phantom of the El Rio that's trying to like bring it back

769
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,060
and destroying the animatronics.

770
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,900
Oh, maybe so.

771
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,060
Or like taking them for himself

772
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,260
to build his own version or something.

773
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,100
That makes sense.

774
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,020
And then like, is like, tried to get rid

775
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,660
of the Judy Dench narration on Spaceship Earth 2,

776
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,380
somebody who goes around haunting Epcot,

777
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,460
trying to remove the newer stuff.

778
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,660
Yeah, going back to, was it Walter Cronkite?

779
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,340
And there's been like four narrators over the years.

780
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,660
Is Jeremy Irons in there at some point?

781
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,100
Jeremy Irons is one.

782
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:41,940
Yeah.

783
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,140
Dark, sinister version.

784
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:44,980
Yes. Yeah.

785
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,940
Is there one, speaking of that,

786
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,100
of things that you've taken out,

787
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,780
is there a Epcot removal that makes you the most upset?

788
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,660
Is there one that is the most heartbreaking

789
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,500
in the whole history?

790
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,460
Definitely Horizons.

791
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,420
That was always my number one.

792
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,540
Yeah.

793
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,340
It also just felt like, it just felt like so unnecessary.

794
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,940
You know, you hear stories there's sinkhole,

795
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,820
which I need to talk about this in a previous episode.

796
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,700
But like, yeah, I mean, I will say the like,

797
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,100
I was never a huge journey into imagination guy,

798
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,100
but like, you know, that was such a downgrade.

799
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,460
It felt like for no reason.

800
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,900
Yeah, those would be the primary.

801
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,660
I do, you guys talked about this a week or two ago,

802
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,420
but like, I do miss the original,

803
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:30,740
the ride part of Living Seas was great.

804
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,540
I don't know, I'm sounding like a real guy

805
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,940
that just wants to stay the same.

806
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,180
I get that, but you know.

807
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,100
Well, you know, with Epcot though,

808
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,060
for the most part, you don't end up with like,

809
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,340
that, you know, like the Frozen is one thing.

810
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,500
Frozen is like, let's put a new property in there

811
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,780
that younger people want to see.

812
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,260
I get the business logic of that,

813
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,540
certainly whether or not you like the ride.

814
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,380
The other ones are like,

815
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,180
what if we replace a ride with a worse ride

816
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:57,700
that also is an IP and that is like sleepy

817
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,340
and has less stuff in it?

818
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,060
Like the painting in the church where they like,

819
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,580
make the angels, Jesus's face terrible or something.

820
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,940
You know what I'm talking about?

821
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,980
Yeah.

822
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,740
They just took a beautiful picture,

823
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,300
Renaissance painting and just made it kind of like a

824
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,620
emoji version or something.

825
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,580
Yeah, yeah.

826
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,140
I would say the Frozen one is one where I like,

827
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,580
I was annoyed, like I always am when they change anything,

828
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,100
but like I had to be like, this is good.

829
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,420
They did a good job with this.

830
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,420
Features I think like a kid would like,

831
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,900
which is reasonable enough.

832
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,740
Right.

833
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,700
You at least see, yes, a child,

834
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,340
like someone would like this,

835
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,060
whereas Journey and some of these other things.

836
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,740
I mean, Mission Space, I think people would like,

837
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,580
if it didn't like, hurt you.

838
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,300
If it didn't almost, yeah, like leave me with a feeling

839
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,500
of like, my chest is about to cave in.

840
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,180
Yes, my brain doesn't feel great.

841
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,020
It was real.

842
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,740
I was, yeah, I walked around World Showcase in a days

843
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,260
after doing it for the first time.

844
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,420
It was crazy.

845
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,740
And then if you turn your head to the side,

846
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,420
forget it, you're out for a couple of minutes.

847
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,060
I don't even see, I don't think I did it.

848
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,060
I don't even think I did that.

849
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,100
And it was awful.

850
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,700
The optics of removing horizons,

851
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,900
like as Epcot was the center of the Millennium

852
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,460
celebration festivities at Epcot,

853
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,660
it's still so wild to me.

854
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,580
I mean, I know I talked about on the episode.

855
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,980
Yeah, it's really kicking the grind.

856
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,660
Yeah, just like, oh, the future's over.

857
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,500
Forget about it.

858
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,420
Yeah, this is the end of the future.

859
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,260
And it's like, no, no, the end of the future comes in 2001.

860
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,380
Don't worry about that.

861
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,020
Optimism will go away,

862
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,500
but we're getting an early start on it.

863
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,980
We're almost there.

864
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,420
Yeah.

865
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,780
Well, okay, so impressions to France.

866
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,780
I mean, let's say some basics about it,

867
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,460
about this unchanged remnant of Epcot 82.

868
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,740
So yeah, so if you, if for anyone listening

869
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,900
who doesn't go see the movies very frequently,

870
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,740
in World Showcase with all the different

871
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,820
country revolutions there are,

872
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:02,060
there's films, I believe, in Canada and in China.

873
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,620
And those are 360 degree films,

874
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,740
which we've talked about so sparingly, I feel like,

875
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,580
the Circle Vision 3D.

876
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,420
The Circle Visions, yeah.

877
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:13,580
Or 360 rather, where there's screens all around you,

878
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,180
I think nine screens,

879
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:19,740
and you stand with railings to watch the movies.

880
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,420
Which is a, that was always a roadblock for me,

881
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,580
and maybe my parents too.

882
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:27,540
Maybe just me as like a perpetually lazy kid

883
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,460
with weak chicken legs.

884
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,580
I just got so tired always,

885
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,340
and did not wanna stand against those railings.

886
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,180
So maybe I kinda did like impressions to France

887
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,820
for that reason, you could actually sit.

888
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,940
This was not a movie that's all the way around you,

889
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,500
but it is five screens.

890
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,260
200 degrees.

891
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,340
200 degrees, yeah.

892
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,220
So a little more than half.

893
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,820
So you can look all the way to the side,

894
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,900
and there is stuff.

895
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,260
And seemingly that was the intent,

896
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,940
that like, there's maybe even the thought

897
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,620
that this was going to be a 360 movie also,

898
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:02,160
but I think to make it a more elegant, stately affair,

899
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,880
where you could actually sit in a more traditional theater,

900
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,020
they opted for the five screens.

901
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:13,140
360 like, I feel like in concept is better maybe

902
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,940
than execution.

903
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,780
Like it's cool that you could look forward and back,

904
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,120
but it's like kind of, I don't know,

905
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,980
it's like kind of too much sometimes.

906
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,820
It feels like if, what are you saying?

907
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,660
You're supposed to be looking, right?

908
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,660
Exactly.

909
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,820
Everyone's always looking the same way,

910
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,660
and then you look behind you,

911
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,300
it's like, yeah, it's the scene that got away from me.

912
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,220
Exactly.

913
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,060
It is, yeah.

914
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,700
It's, I mean, yeah, I would say that like,

915
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,860
there is a tradition of like,

916
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,220
in all the Disney parks and other places,

917
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,620
there's the movie attraction is always weird,

918
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,460
because you go to this place

919
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,300
and you're supposed to walk around,

920
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,060
and get in the thing where you just go in

921
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,140
and watch a movie basically.

922
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,360
What's interesting to me about Impressions de France,

923
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,580
once again, the survivor,

924
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,100
the one that's been around the longest,

925
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,460
is it's not 3E, it's not a 360 movie,

926
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,740
it's kind of just a movie.

927
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,480
It has lasted a long time.

928
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,060
Which they don't often, yeah.

929
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,940
Sort of like a Cinerama movie,

930
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,460
when they bring back Cinerama movies

931
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,340
at the Cinerama Dome here in LA,

932
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,180
in a technology which was the precursor

933
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,620
to IMAX movies and stuff like that.

934
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,420
So it's like not just on a normal screen,

935
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,900
but it's a little less gimmicky than some other.

936
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,500
Yeah, and I think it's, I mean, it is interesting.

937
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,580
It's beautiful, you know, vistas and country sides,

938
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,140
and castles and abbeys.

939
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:34,140
Like it is, I think, justified in why they did this.

940
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,460
Though that begs the question,

941
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,500
why didn't they just do Cinerama?

942
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,620
Well, I would say the thing that,

943
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,980
as it occurred to me till now,

944
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,820
really the most similar,

945
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,500
I was opposite of a precursor,

946
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,620
thing after this that it reminds me of

947
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,500
is Soarin' Over California.

948
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,220
A screen, it's scenes of a very specific place,

949
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,380
it's California, not France,

950
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,500
and it's just low concept.

951
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,340
It's like there's not a lot of narration,

952
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,220
it's just cool and pretty to look at.

953
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,900
And just cuts.

954
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,420
I mean, this is obviously like suggest,

955
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,420
you're moving with thing, you're moving over hills,

956
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,900
you're moving in a lower, smaller scale too,

957
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,220
on like a cart.

958
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,580
So like it's also kind of,

959
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,940
it's trying to do a little ride stuff as well.

960
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,660
It just didn't have a theater or ride vehicle

961
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,900
that reacted with it yet.

962
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,300
It mixes around the country,

963
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,780
you know, like it starts in the north,

964
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,620
and you go to the south,

965
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,700
and you go to Paris at the end.

966
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,500
There's kind of like, you know, you could,

967
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,500
if you think about it,

968
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,300
you can kind of try to find like a little structure to it.

969
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,020
For the most part, it's just like a nice,

970
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,820
almost 20 minutes long, just.

971
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,860
Yeah.

972
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,220
The first thing, I was rewatching this,

973
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,060
and the first thing I was like,

974
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:50,340
man, this looks better than like everything I watch now.

975
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,020
This looks so good.

976
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,860
Yeah, yeah.

977
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,380
What great quality this is.

978
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,700
Like I was like, I could watch this all day.

979
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,820
Beautiful, yeah.

980
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,460
It must've been so expensive to make.

981
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,380
Yes.

982
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,220
They didn't have,

983
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,300
like every one of those flying shots

984
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,060
had to be with a full like helicopter with,

985
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,540
what is it, five cameras,

986
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,540
dash to the bottom of it, I mean.

987
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,300
Five cameras, and then like whatever mechanism

988
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,220
that you needed to sync it all up

989
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,180
and keep it all on the same level,

990
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,220
like technology had to be invented to be able to use.

991
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,060
The old cameras,

992
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,420
like each one with like, you know,

993
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:28,100
its own film cartridge going

994
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,820
that had to be perfectly timed, I mean.

995
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,420
Yeah, which aren't like,

996
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:36,380
shooting film remains very difficult,

997
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,380
I think was very difficult at the time.

998
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,620
I listened to a podcast interview

999
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,300
with the director of this, Rick Harper,

1000
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,420
who explains how they didn't really have

1001
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,900
like a way to watch it.

1002
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,740
Like you couldn't,

1003
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,260
like there was not a very good viewfinder

1004
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,020
to see what you were even getting

1005
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,660
while going to these like very hard to get through,

1006
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,740
to get to settings and getting up on helicopters.

1007
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,580
Like he used the phrase,

1008
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,580
or is it like a,

1009
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,740
well we have the vibration detector.

1010
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,060
Like instead, you couldn't see

1011
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,420
if it was level or shaking or not,

1012
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,380
you just had to see is the vibration detector going off.

1013
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,460
It's real like NASA kind of stuff.

1014
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,380
That sounds fascinating.

1015
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,300
Like I'm, you know, in anticipation of doing this today,

1016
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,820
I watched the great, it was a great YouTube,

1017
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,780
you know, pretty high quality version of it.

1018
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,020
And I noticed a couple of things.

1019
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,220
One is that you can tell,

1020
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,420
like they shot a few of the scenes on the same day

1021
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,180
because they're,

1022
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,220
the first thing you're on this kind of rocky coastline,

1023
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,980
which according to Wikipedia is Normandy,

1024
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,500
you know, like Northern France,

1025
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,900
like on the coast that, you know,

1026
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,580
but England and all that stuff.

1027
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,340
And then you see that landscape

1028
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,180
and a couple other shots that aren't about that at all.

1029
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,580
Like, so there's these like fishermen walking

1030
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:48,420
with like fishing crates and stuff.

1031
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:52,340
And you can see that the coast that we just saw

1032
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,340
at the very beginning of the movie,

1033
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,340
this is like halfway through in the background.

1034
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:58,660
There's a church on the top, on top of this cliff.

1035
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,660
And then I think a little bit after that,

1036
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,020
there's this great shot of this old couple walking

1037
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,980
along the rocky cliffs next to a church.

1038
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,460
That's that church.

1039
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:12,100
So line producer brain, you're like, oh, like they,

1040
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,340
they got a bunch of pieces of it that day

1041
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,860
while they had all their stuff there.

1042
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,900
And then they kind of, you know,

1043
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,580
made it look like a bunch of different things.

1044
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,660
Sure, sure, sure.

1045
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,500
That's interesting.

1046
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,660
That would be interesting to see.

1047
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,220
And I assume there would be an appetite,

1048
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,380
and I'm not being facetious.

1049
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,180
There would be an appetite to see like shot list

1050
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,740
days for shooting of Impressions de France.

1051
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,340
And we could get like two episodes out of it

1052
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,580
if we could find this.

1053
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,420
Yeah.

1054
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,020
Good thing I would bid on and spend a lot of money.

1055
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,580
Yeah, yeah, no kidding.

1056
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,940
It's crazy auction.

1057
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,780
Sure.

1058
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,620
I was just so delighted.

1059
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,100
Like even the smaller scale stuff,

1060
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,260
like when I realized what the flower cart,

1061
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,420
like it was like, oh, they just put the cameras on the cart.

1062
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,580
This is delightful.

1063
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,220
Like, this is so charming.

1064
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,900
Yeah, those little four grand flowers.

1065
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,980
It's pretty cute.

1066
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,740
There is like a nice,

1067
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,660
like it's feeling nice, like slice of life feeling in this.

1068
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,980
And I was thinking like, I think it's, I don't know how,

1069
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,940
I think it's pretty popular,

1070
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:14,020
like trends on YouTube of just walking tours of cities.

1071
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,380
So like I've been, and I've been doing that.

1072
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,780
I've been watching like 20 minute videos

1073
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,540
of people walking through Tokyo,

1074
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,060
cause we went there a couple of years ago and we loved it.

1075
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,260
But I was like, well, this is just,

1076
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,020
these are just longer form versions

1077
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,540
of impressions de France.

1078
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,540
It's just the same, like it's the same,

1079
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,180
but you're getting like snippets as opposed to like truly

1080
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,140
like 40 minutes kind of getting lost and like,

1081
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,580
oh, look at that's a street.

1082
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,900
Yeah, and it's long enough and you're out all day

1083
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,900
in Florida, it's hot.

1084
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,700
And so you're in this little nice cool room for 20 minutes.

1085
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,220
It's very like, you know, really transports you.

1086
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,060
Yeah, it is.

1087
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:49,580
It's like a VR, it's precursor to VR in a way.

1088
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,540
With the wraparound?

1089
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:57,500
I was drawing a parallel to like world's fair stuff.

1090
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,380
Like to me, it really reminds me of like

1091
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,660
the great IMAX movies.

1092
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:04,020
Another thing that I love and IMAX movies were developed

1093
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,260
for the Montreal Expo of 67.

1094
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:10,580
And, you know, yeah, it's like these movies that

1095
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,980
these days we watch, you know, they'll have like, you know,

1096
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,860
on PBS they'll show like flying over England

1097
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,700
or something like that.

1098
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,380
But that style of movie was really designed to be,

1099
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,820
to show off the technology.

1100
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,500
So it was like designed to show off new cameras

1101
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,900
and the fact that you could attach a camera

1102
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,900
to the bottom of an airplane.

1103
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,220
And, you know, it was designed to be experienced

1104
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,860
in a special setting, like a theme park or a fair.

1105
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,060
Very good.

1106
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:34,900
Yeah.

1107
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,460
To go back to, actually to go back to Simpsons ride,

1108
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:39,820
is that like, like, was that crazy for you to get to do?

1109
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,060
Like, because that room is meant for,

1110
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,500
it's a like pretty insane format that can only be done

1111
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,340
in rooms like that.

1112
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,180
Yeah, it's an OmniMax screen.

1113
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:49,540
And OmniMax screen is a curved IMAX screen

1114
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,060
in case people don't know.

1115
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:55,260
So like, it's why if you, you know,

1116
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,220
these days when they'll show like, you know,

1117
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:00,100
a normal movie like Dark Knight or whatever,

1118
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,860
in an IMAX theater, they usually show it

1119
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,900
in a normal IMAX screen because it's flat.

1120
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,540
Whereas an OmniMax screen is like the shape

1121
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,100
of like contact lens.

1122
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,940
And so it kind of distorts a lot of the images,

1123
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,180
but gives you the feeling of like being sucked

1124
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,060
into the picture.

1125
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,820
But it's, that's the reason, for example,

1126
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,540
the Simpsons ride couldn't be 3D,

1127
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,260
which is a question we get a lot.

1128
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,020
You can't do a 3D OmniMax.

1129
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,060
Interesting.

1130
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:24,900
Just like,

1131
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,340
Yeah, which is why Thorin is also Thorin over California.

1132
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,300
Right, right, right.

1133
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,780
Oh yeah, yeah, cause that's not 3D.

1134
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,620
It's an OmniMax.

1135
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,460
Yeah, same format.

1136
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,300
Right, right.

1137
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,020
Is that also why it's, the characters are,

1138
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,540
it's all done in 3D as opposed to 2D,

1139
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,340
where I imagine like doing the curvature

1140
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,540
doesn't make any sense.

1141
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,780
I don't know how that, that's an interesting question.

1142
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,180
I don't remember why that decision was made.

1143
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,020
I guess it was like,

1144
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:50,140
if you blew up 2D animation that big,

1145
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:52,860
it wouldn't look immersive or something like that.

1146
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:55,500
It would just, it would be a lot of like big blocks

1147
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,100
of like Homer Simpson's big yellow head.

1148
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:58,940
Oh sure.

1149
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,780
So like sort of oddly simple image.

1150
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,260
Like it needs dimension, I guess.

1151
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,780
It just inherently needs dimension.

1152
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,260
Like a 3D model needs, like if it's,

1153
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,340
if something's 3D, it'll look like flat or something.

1154
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,180
This is an interesting tidbit that they,

1155
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,700
the guys that were, that knew what they were doing

1156
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,780
that helped us kind of come up with what happened

1157
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,060
in the ride is that in one of those

1158
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,860
where you want to simulate motion,

1159
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,180
it's always better to have something

1160
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,500
that you're flying behind.

1161
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,660
You're not just like kind of in a vacuum

1162
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,140
looking out at a nice piece of scenery,

1163
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,940
but if you're actually tracking something

1164
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,900
that's in front of you, it's like, if you go in,

1165
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,580
it's why in like the Avatar, quite a passage,

1166
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:42,860
there's a, you're following another thing the whole time,

1167
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:45,620
because it actually, your eye kind of like

1168
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,740
looks at the thing ahead of you

1169
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,260
and it draws your attention to the middle of screen

1170
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,820
and kind of gives you, it helps sell the motion.

1171
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,300
So when you're like doing a,

1172
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,500
you don't want to just like an IMAX screen.

1173
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,500
If you want it to feel like you're actually moving,

1174
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,020
it helps to have like some kind of

1175
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:01,820
Point.

1176
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,340
Some kind of moving thing in the middle of it.

1177
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,420
And so we tried to do, you know,

1178
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,060
we had Maggie dragging you around,

1179
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:09,460
and Sideshow Bob, and like all these different things.

1180
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,260
But 360 where you like, you flip all the way around

1181
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,260
while Homer's is in your, like being dragged by a rope

1182
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,540
or something, that's a really amazing part.

1183
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,580
That was, I believe the first time that had ever been done

1184
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,700
in one of those simulator rides,

1185
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,780
it was one of the things they were like,

1186
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,020
oh, let's try to do a barrel roll.

1187
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:25,820
Oh wow.

1188
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,300
A parody of like Waterworld stunt show.

1189
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,900
And actually, I thought it was pretty convincing.

1190
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,740
Yeah, yeah.

1191
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:33,580
Yeah.

1192
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,420
Yeah.

1193
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,140
Real quick while we're back,

1194
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,580
were there any other bigger blue sky things you were like,

1195
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,700
oh, I wish we could have done this,

1196
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,380
or like we had this on the drawing board

1197
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,580
and it didn't quite work?

1198
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,420
This is long enough now.

1199
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,820
Hopefully none of this is stuff that would get me in trouble.

1200
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,340
But a big constraint we had was that we only had some

1201
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:52,500
of the cast initially.

1202
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:57,780
And so that was why we ended up coming around

1203
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,580
on a Sideshow Bob story,

1204
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,740
because we didn't have like Harry Shearer,

1205
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,420
who was gonna, you know, who's most of the like,

1206
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,420
the adversaries like Mr. Burns,

1207
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:09,020
which would like drive a theme parky type of story,

1208
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,940
where you'd went like, you know,

1209
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,500
Mr. Burns is trying to kill you or whatever.

1210
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,740
We were kind of limited.

1211
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,060
Luckily we got Kelsey Grammer,

1212
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,500
who's Sideshow Bob wanted to do it.

1213
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,540
So that was sort of the thinking behind that,

1214
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,380
which I think was great.

1215
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,780
I mean, he's a very kind of theme park energy,

1216
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,700
and he's such a great voice actor.

1217
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,980
Yeah, yeah.

1218
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:30,980
I, there's a short story by this writer named

1219
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,340
Stephen Milhauser, he's one of my favorite writers.

1220
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,420
He wrote a short story called Paradise Park,

1221
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:41,340
in I think the collection is called The Knife Thrower,

1222
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,820
that is always one of my favorite short stories.

1223
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,780
And it's about like a guy who creates a theme park

1224
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:51,820
that's like so messed up that it starts to be dangerous

1225
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:53,060
and starts to kill people.

1226
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,380
That was actually a thing that I brought and was like,

1227
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,900
let's try to do this.

1228
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,780
Let's have Sideshow Bob messes with the theme park

1229
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,020
so that it's broken.

1230
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,420
And you're going through these different things

1231
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,580
that are parodies of different things,

1232
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,420
like Disneyland and Universal,

1233
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:08,620
but it's all falling apart around you.

1234
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,740
That was the initial idea.

1235
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,460
So like the fact that, I mean, really,

1236
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,660
which was just a vehicle for me, honestly,

1237
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,420
to do, to like create little parodies of like,

1238
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,580
fun theme parks.

1239
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,860
And then there's this guy, Scott Trowbridge,

1240
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,740
Disney Imagineer, he like, he did a Galaxy's Edge,

1241
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:25,580
charged with that program.

1242
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:29,260
He was the, he was our like head guy at Universal at the time.

1243
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:32,020
He took that idea and kind of like helped us say,

1244
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,140
okay, here's what that could look like.

1245
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,980
It could be a thing that's kind of like part of the Caribbean

1246
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,180
and we could do a big fall.

1247
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:39,060
And, you know, he helped us like beat it out into a reel.

1248
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,460
Oh, and like what they can, like, here's the, like,

1249
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:44,020
the gags, so here's the stuff we know we can pull off.

1250
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:46,220
Yeah, and it's like things that we could sell with motion.

1251
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:47,540
So it's like, it's good to like,

1252
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,020
and you could, you don't want it to be the same thing

1253
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:49,860
time and again.

1254
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,340
So like you should do a thing where you're going backwards

1255
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,420
and you should do a thing where it's like fall

1256
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,180
and a thing where we can spray water at you

1257
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,020
and stuff like that.

1258
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:00,380
But then I think, Grating or somebody was like, well, hey,

1259
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,100
you know, people are going to want to go to Springfield.

1260
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:03,940
Yeah.

1261
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:06,540
That's like getting to sort of fly through Springfield,

1262
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,980
like the opening credits.

1263
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:08,820
Oh, yeah.

1264
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,060
It could be a big thing for people.

1265
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:13,020
So that ended up influencing us and became like

1266
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,700
the second half of the ride is like,

1267
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:18,060
Maggie drags you through town and you know, you do all this.

1268
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,340
I remember the first time going on, I feel like,

1269
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,540
it certainly didn't occur to me,

1270
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:23,940
oh, I wish I was doing Springfield stuff,

1271
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,380
but when there's that reveal and you sit suddenly feels

1272
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,500
like the opening sequence, you are like, oh, right,

1273
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,460
we can do this stuff.

1274
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:30,740
And you start to wonder like,

1275
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:33,580
will there be kind of a couch scene sort of thing?

1276
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,420
And then.

1277
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,260
Yeah, that was cool.

1278
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:36,540
It was a really good idea.

1279
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,540
It was a real like, hey, do what people want.

1280
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,980
Like, you know, it was like a service moment of like,

1281
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,260
oh, like, oh yeah, have your fun with like parodies

1282
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,540
of like your own up your butt,

1283
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,620
like favorite moments from theme park history,

1284
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,460
but like,

1285
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,540
They like to see the quickie mark.

1286
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,980
Yeah, I'm glad.

1287
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,580
People do want to see the things they like.

1288
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,940
I was going to be slow.

1289
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,180
It was just a period of each scene from World of Motion.

1290
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,020
Like it was.

1291
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:04,860
Mm hmm.

1292
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:08,860
Oh, that's the version we didn't get to make,

1293
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,420
but you know, okay, fine.

1294
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,780
People flying through Springfield.

1295
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:13,860
Okay.

1296
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:17,340
It's funny that you bring up like the theme park trope

1297
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,820
of like, oh, something has gone wrong

1298
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:22,660
because I feel like in literature,

1299
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:26,220
like specifically thinking of like George Saunders

1300
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,020
stories about theme parks,

1301
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:30,340
like the big one that I think of,

1302
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:33,460
it's literally called Civil War Land in Bad Decline.

1303
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:37,180
Like they, I always wonder, it's like, wait,

1304
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,700
do you realize that like,

1305
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,220
the stories are always about theme parks falling apart

1306
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,300
or something going wrong.

1307
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:47,860
It's like, do you know this is like a main like plot point

1308
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,540
at a lot of theme park rides,

1309
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,900
whether you're criticizing it intentionally or not.

1310
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:53,380
Yeah, we knew that or not.

1311
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:54,940
Yeah, I mean, I would say that like,

1312
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:57,380
they actually adapted it into a great ride called

1313
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,780
Grand Fiesta Tour in Sad Decline,

1314
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:01,420
which is a great right now.

1315
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,260
They have not won.

1316
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:06,980
Cool of them to just like low key do that

1317
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:09,300
and not like announce it as like a big George Saunders thing,

1318
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,780
but that's pretty cool of them.

1319
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,620
Yes.

1320
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:12,460
You know what they're doing.

1321
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,300
I don't know that it would get them

1322
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,780
a MacArthur Genius Grant like he received.

1323
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,620
But I think there's something,

1324
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:19,340
there's like a postmodern turn that rides had

1325
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,780
in like the nineties.

1326
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,260
Like when people are like, people are sick of like,

1327
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,540
his rides are cheesy.

1328
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:25,580
Like it's just like,

1329
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,860
no one wants to just like ride through,

1330
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:31,180
you know, a bunch of little dolls singing at you

1331
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,540
or whatever it's like, yes, that's all anyone wants.

1332
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,380
But the guys that got too clever

1333
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:37,220
and everything had to be like, you think it's this,

1334
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:38,420
but then it's this other thing.

1335
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,140
You know, it's a twist, like the ride breaks.

1336
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:41,420
And I mean, this is what,

1337
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,220
just describing what we did on this.

1338
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:47,420
But like that was its own trend that burned out.

1339
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,060
And what I like about things like,

1340
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,180
you know, at the end of that area,

1341
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,820
you have something like Soaring Over California,

1342
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,020
which is like, there's no concept.

1343
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,260
It's just like, there's no, there's no,

1344
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:00,580
oh no, the glider is gonna crash into Yosemite or whatever.

1345
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:01,740
It's just the thing.

1346
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:02,860
It's just a fun experience.

1347
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,340
It's like of a piece.

1348
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,260
It's not reminding you that this is like,

1349
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:09,100
cause I think that rides work better

1350
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,100
when they're not big complicated stories.

1351
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:12,500
It's like, you're gonna follow stuff,

1352
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,460
but like no one's like, oh man, I wish,

1353
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:16,420
or I don't think they are.

1354
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,460
Like I wish Pirates of the Caribbean

1355
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,860
was more like about tracking characters and stuff.

1356
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,780
And when they do that, it's like lame.

1357
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,860
It's, you know, it's like a song.

1358
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:28,460
You don't want, you ever listen to like a story song?

1359
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,300
When it was like eight minute, like Johnny Cash things,

1360
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,140
you're like, ugh.

1361
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:31,980
Right?

1362
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,460
You hear it once, it's fine.

1363
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,300
You know what happens.

1364
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,860
A guy like shoots a guy and gets hung or whatever.

1365
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,740
It's just like the songs you listen to a million times,

1366
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,660
the more vague, they're just like a general

1367
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:42,620
to give you a feeling.

1368
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,100
And I feel like that,

1369
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,060
that is another thing about Impressions of France.

1370
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,860
It's not a story, it's just a feeling.

1371
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,980
Yeah, I mean, we were talking,

1372
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,300
we've talked about like, especially pre-shows

1373
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,940
and like Avatar and Plight of Passage is awesome.

1374
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,620
But the pre-show, there's like three rooms

1375
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:02,180
and there's just so much explanation of what you're doing

1376
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,140
and why you're standing there and what they're scanning you

1377
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:06,140
for and what you're gonna, versus like Big Thunder

1378
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,860
where it's like, here we go, we're riding a train.

1379
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,860
And then it's all, then once you get on the ride itself,

1380
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,420
it's unbelievable.

1381
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,460
You're gonna play a passage, but there's no story at all.

1382
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:15,500
You're just flying around, it's great.

1383
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,700
Right, you sort of didn't need to know any of that.

1384
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,540
I'm not sure any of that.

1385
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,740
I think it's like, they just want to give you something

1386
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:21,900
to do because the line is long.

1387
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,820
And so they have like, they make you sit in three rooms.

1388
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:27,580
We did this, there's two full pre-shows on The Simpsons

1389
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:28,500
for the same reason.

1390
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,860
It's like, they divide you into little groups

1391
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:32,900
so that you can go into a place and like,

1392
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,580
you don't have to sort that all out at the last,

1393
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,620
it's all like crowd management.

1394
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,140
I wish they would just put up a blank screen

1395
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,820
and you just look at your phone or something.

1396
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:42,300
Well, this is.

1397
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,340
Dinosaur, oh, you got two movies about this

1398
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,060
and you're going to look at dinosaurs.

1399
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:48,580
Yeah, but The Simpsons feels like,

1400
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,140
I mean, The Simpsons has that, the ride,

1401
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:53,100
you guys have that narrative, a little of like,

1402
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,660
Bob and everything, but also it's just like,

1403
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:57,700
the pre-show room is you get to see Patty and Selma

1404
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,380
in a booth goofing, like everyone's goofing around

1405
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:03,660
versus you're getting information shouted at you

1406
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,300
that's like important.

1407
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,540
Danny Chun, one time Simpsons writer

1408
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:08,540
at the office, bunch of her stuff,

1409
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:12,260
he was sort of in charge of that part of the writing.

1410
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,380
And it was, yeah, it was fun to do that.

1411
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:16,660
It was like picking the characters.

1412
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,820
It did give us, I will say like,

1413
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,660
the script for the whole ride ended up being

1414
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:25,260
about 35 pages long, maybe the ride script,

1415
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:28,060
and we just write the final draft, like a normal script,

1416
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:32,660
but the ride itself is maybe seven pages long,

1417
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:37,180
but then, there's like 20, there's two full long,

1418
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,580
there's more than a full Simpsons episode

1419
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:42,620
worth of writing and animation in the pre-show

1420
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,020
to that ride because.

1421
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,660
There's several rooms and all the characters.

1422
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,340
Yeah, but that one is also, it was like,

1423
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,180
we were kind of stuck with the infrastructure

1424
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,420
back in the future, so it was like,

1425
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:55,460
you couldn't just like change the structure

1426
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:56,740
of the rooms and stuff, you knew like,

1427
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:59,060
okay, we need something that's exactly the same length

1428
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:01,580
as this thing, and then you have to go into this room.

1429
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:05,420
Oh yeah, did you have to watch like this dock and biff thing

1430
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:08,940
and go, okay, so it's gotta be sort of equivalent to this,

1431
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,420
at least time and maybe feel like.

1432
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:11,660
The timing was more important,

1433
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,540
like, because whatever the timing of the ride was,

1434
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:16,260
that's the key thing, it was like four minutes.

1435
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:19,620
You have to, each of the things before that

1436
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:22,540
has to be exactly that length

1437
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:25,820
so that everything can turn over at the same time.

1438
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,980
I'm sure that flight of passage is the same way,

1439
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,340
but like, whatever the length of time is,

1440
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,540
it takes to get all the people in and like,

1441
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:34,980
sit in the things and stick their head in the hole.

1442
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,140
You've gotta cover that.

1443
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,780
Just the length of the ride has to be

1444
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:42,620
the exact length of the pre-show or whatever.

1445
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:45,220
Which is maybe why Avatar is so crazy.

1446
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,060
Yeah.

1447
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,500
It's a complicated.

1448
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,500
Plus, hopefully they're hosing down those little glory holes

1449
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,140
you stick your head in or whatever.

1450
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:54,420
Oh yeah, because right now, yes.

1451
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,860
Give them 10 seconds to do something.

1452
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,900
Can you believe people are doing that right now?

1453
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,260
Like, there's people on that ride

1454
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:02,620
as we're all holed up in our places forever.

1455
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:04,260
Well, and you'll be happy to know

1456
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,820
they've recently increased capacity, so you know.

1457
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:10,500
How weird is it right now to go into one of those rooms

1458
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,220
where they're scanning you for viruses or germs?

1459
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:17,500
You all have it.

1460
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:18,460
You all have it.

1461
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,380
Shake off, move your body around a little bit.

1462
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:21,700
Yeah, move your body around.

1463
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,300
Some of you are asymptomatic.

1464
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,060
Now we can't tell which of them.

1465
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:29,620
Yeah, that's odd, that's odd, I'll say.

1466
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:31,340
You can go do that right now if you want.

1467
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:32,180
Right now.

1468
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:35,580
But, impressions of France, you can spread out a little.

1469
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:38,460
You know, it's a theater, the Palais du Cinema.

1470
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,340
It's probably not full.

1471
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:44,500
I'm a big, remember movie theaters, you go, remember that?

1472
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,340
Yes.

1473
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,620
Kinda.

1474
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:47,820
For the audience, doesn't remember that.

1475
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:48,820
These would be a thing pre-COVID,

1476
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,860
you go to a movie theater and watch things.

1477
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:52,620
Impressions of France,

1478
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,780
because it doesn't have a lot of dialogue,

1479
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:58,180
is it has that phenomenon you get in movie theaters

1480
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:59,740
when you're there during the day

1481
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,300
and there's a lot of old people,

1482
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,140
they want to talk through the whole thing.

1483
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,740
So I would say that like, even in particular,

1484
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:07,780
there's something about sitting down,

1485
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:09,780
you're watching the nice scenery,

1486
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:12,340
maybe there's an old lady that speaks a few words of French,

1487
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:13,420
she wants to use them,

1488
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:15,380
she wants to impress the other old people

1489
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,220
that she's with in the movie.

1490
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:18,100
It was one of the most talked through

1491
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,460
film experiences you can have,

1492
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,700
to the point where I'm a big guy,

1493
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:24,060
I'm a big, drives my wife crazy,

1494
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:25,500
I'll just get up, I'll move.

1495
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,900
Like, I'm not a shusher, I just very showily get up,

1496
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:32,580
walk down, move a couple rows back,

1497
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:35,100
maybe I'll make a big, ugh, or whatever.

1498
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,180
I do that, yeah, I know it's great.

1499
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,420
I'll do it multiple times in the same,

1500
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:39,980
in the Impressions of France theater,

1501
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,100
it's nice as it's a big, not usually that packed,

1502
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,780
bad news for the movie, probably going away someday.

1503
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,140
But I will move around multiple times

1504
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:51,540
to get away from the like, oh, that's Paris.

1505
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,140
That's, that's no good.

1506
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,900
You know, it's like, everyone wants to show off

1507
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,420
that they went to Paris one time or whatever.

1508
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:02,060
God bless, I get it, but it's a new experience.

1509
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:02,900
Yeah.

1510
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,700
That kind of goes, I mean, really,

1511
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:05,900
I think we've mostly talked about it

1512
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,220
on the Haunted Mansion episode,

1513
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:09,020
people that want to talk, that's a different thing,

1514
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,900
talking along with it, but I think in general,

1515
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:15,900
all three of us are no talking, don't talk, please don't.

1516
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:18,420
And I think that's controversial,

1517
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:19,900
and I remember us saying that,

1518
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,620
and I think some people were like, but I like to talk.

1519
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:24,100
I like to do it.

1520
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,620
Like three minutes.

1521
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:29,020
I don't want to, you know, yuck anyone's yum here.

1522
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,740
Like, I want to talk great, I'm just,

1523
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,780
as long as this theater is big enough that I can move.

1524
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:33,620
Sure.

1525
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:34,860
And go nuts.

1526
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,940
Yeah, and I don't think people were talking about like,

1527
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:39,180
oh, I want to talk along to Impressions de France.

1528
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,260
I think that's probably a smaller amount of people

1529
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,100
that want to mention.

1530
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,100
Oh, another thing, I don't know that anybody's ever,

1531
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,700
I was watching again,

1532
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,180
just seeing maybe jumped out of me.

1533
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,300
Has anybody ever noticed that?

1534
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,060
I'm pretty sure that they had to like paint out

1535
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:55,100
of ladies boobs in a scene.

1536
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:57,140
Huh.

1537
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,500
A scene where you're on a dock going,

1538
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,220
it's on like the French Riviera,

1539
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,340
and there's a bunch of sunbathers.

1540
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,540
You can't really see it on the YouTube,

1541
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,460
but it always jumped out at me in the theater.

1542
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:10,020
There's a woman in the kind of, I would say like,

1543
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:13,020
facing the screen, upper left hand,

1544
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,340
laid out on a thing,

1545
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:19,340
wearing a blue bathing suit that is clearly painted in later.

1546
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:21,540
Like she was clearly just a woman top, it's France, right?

1547
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:22,980
I mean, that's part of the French experience.

1548
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:26,780
Topless lady, young woman, just a blue block.

1549
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:29,780
Like, like, like an old, you know,

1550
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:32,140
an old computer graphics thing where you just like

1551
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:33,780
draw a little outline of something

1552
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:35,580
and fill it in with a blue paint can

1553
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:39,380
to cover up this nice young ladies.

1554
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,220
Hmm.

1555
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:41,820
Does it wobble when it moves?

1556
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:44,140
Does it like not follow exactly?

1557
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:48,060
I tried to see it today on the 4K, whatever YouTube

1558
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,900
video someone took, and you can't,

1559
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,500
I know where it is though, I know where to look for it,

1560
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,780
but it doesn't, it won't jump out at you.

1561
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,580
If you see it in the theater,

1562
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:02,580
have a listener, someone go rush to the theater, be safe.

1563
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:06,380
The woman you will see is blue,

1564
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:11,180
like a bright blue block where nudity was supposed to be.

1565
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,020
Wow.

1566
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:14,060
Huh, I mean, I'm glad they got.

1567
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:18,860
The woman on the beach listening, let us know.

1568
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:19,700
Oh yes.

1569
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:20,900
We'll have her on.

1570
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,540
If you're hearing this, I'm glad they got that

1571
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,900
because Topless sunbathing, I feel like,

1572
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,820
is a national pastime for France,

1573
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:32,940
just like smoking cigarettes and having toured affairs.

1574
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:36,420
And those they can't really put into this movie.

1575
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,340
There's a wedding in this movie,

1576
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:41,820
I guess because there's a big abbey in this movie,

1577
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:43,540
the abbey that's hard to access.

1578
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:49,860
In the back of my mind, I think I used that wedding reception

1579
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:53,220
in the France movie as an image I wanted

1580
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,500
during my actual wedding.

1581
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,300
I remember asking for the lighting,

1582
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,020
and I wanted the lighting to look exactly like that,

1583
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:01,860
where it's outside, there's string lights over it,

1584
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,540
everybody's having a nice time.

1585
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,820
It felt, yeah, it's very like, and very like.

1586
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,020
Like obviously, I'm a big fan of this thing.

1587
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:10,540
I will say one thing, I don't think I've ever,

1588
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,420
I don't think this is like on the Wikipedia page

1589
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,540
or anything for this Simpsons episode.

1590
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:17,020
I used, I pulled a music cue from Impressions to France

1591
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:19,580
and used it in a Simpsons episode.

1592
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:26,060
It's in the episode, a totally fun thing,

1593
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:27,460
Bart will never do again,

1594
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:30,060
which is the episode where Simpsons going to cruise.

1595
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:34,220
And I'm sure, let me see the way you look at that.

1596
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:39,220
The song is called Rondo by Francois Adrian Blaldu.

1597
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:44,860
I pray the most obscure song in Impressions to France,

1598
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:45,900
I would have liked it.

1599
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,860
There's a scene where they're going on a cruise

1600
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:51,700
and we had this really dramatic shot flying over cruise ship

1601
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:53,700
to show how cool it is.

1602
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,260
And I was like, oh, this is like that scene

1603
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:57,620
where they're flying over the castle in Impressions to France.

1604
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,620
I was like, I want that exact song.

1605
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:02,380
This was great, this is another real,

1606
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:04,020
I can't believe this happening moment.

1607
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:05,140
Because the Simpsons that time

1608
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:06,740
was scored by a live orchestra.

1609
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:10,420
They had to actually find the music, get the orchestra,

1610
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:12,860
and it's a really hard song too.

1611
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:16,860
So it's a really challenging piece of classical music.

1612
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:18,580
And so they had to learn it.

1613
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:22,740
And then later in the episode, the cruise ship, it goes bad.

1614
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,380
They're stuck on it for a really long time.

1615
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:26,860
And so they do another flyover

1616
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:29,220
where it looks to compare it to earlier.

1617
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:33,580
And the composer redid that song from the France movie

1618
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:36,540
is like a janky, like messed up version

1619
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,420
to show crappy instruments.

1620
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:40,300
Whoa.

1621
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,140
Check it out.

1622
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:42,580
Geez, that's amazing.

1623
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:46,540
And also, did you just manage to break a piece of trivia

1624
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:49,660
that is not archived by Simpsons fans online?

1625
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:50,500
I don't think so.

1626
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,580
I don't think anybody.

1627
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:54,900
That might be the only piece of info

1628
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,860
that people don't know like that.

1629
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:59,540
Did you get to go watch the orchestra do it?

1630
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:00,380
I didn't see that one.

1631
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:01,660
I had been there other times.

1632
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:02,500
It was cool.

1633
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,580
They would just like, they didn't like do it right next

1634
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:05,420
to where we were writing.

1635
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:06,260
So we didn't.

1636
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:08,260
I think at one time I went to go see it.

1637
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:09,220
Since then they've stopped doing it

1638
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:10,060
because it was unbelievable.

1639
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,500
The only shows ever that would do this

1640
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,780
were Lost and the Simpsons.

1641
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,060
And it's just like you picture in a movie,

1642
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:16,020
like a giant sound stage with the whole orchestra

1643
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:17,540
and like everything.

1644
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:19,220
It was really cool.

1645
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:20,060
Yeah.

1646
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,340
I guess over 30 years of Simpsons,

1647
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:22,380
they got enough music cues now

1648
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,820
that they don't need a bunch of new ones.

1649
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:26,220
That's fair.

1650
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,340
Are there any other little theme park tidbits

1651
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:31,460
you've snuck in in other places that people wouldn't know?

1652
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:33,420
In that scene, that was the last episode

1653
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,260
I wrote for the Simpsons.

1654
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:36,540
It was sort of my place to try to pack in

1655
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:38,580
all the things that I liked.

1656
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,060
I don't think it really worked.

1657
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:43,220
I did try to put, there's a thing where they're stuck.

1658
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:45,740
Once again, they're stuck on a cruise ship for a long time.

1659
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:49,940
They think the world has been destroyed by a viral outbreak.

1660
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:51,340
So very prescient.

1661
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,380
Not so prescient that I thought a cruise ship

1662
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:55,980
would be the safest place to be.

1663
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:57,820
Oh yeah, right.

1664
01:02:57,820 --> 01:02:59,140
Where the episode goes.

1665
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:04,140
But in the episode, Lisa decides like medieval monks

1666
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:09,100
like preserve culture for the posterity

1667
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:10,820
now that the world is gone.

1668
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,220
And so there is a part where you pan across

1669
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:14,980
a bunch of monks and I showed them the monks

1670
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:15,820
in Spatial Birth and I said,

1671
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:17,540
I wanted to look like this and I want one of the monks

1672
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:19,100
to be asleep on the book.

1673
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:21,380
I want it to look exactly like Spatial Birth.

1674
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,780
And they were just like, eh.

1675
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:25,860
I have 10 frogs.

1676
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:29,180
At a certain point, I think they're right.

1677
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,380
At a certain point, they were like, hey man,

1678
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:32,980
enough with this.

1679
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,380
Satisfying fetishes essentially.

1680
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:36,220
Yeah.

1681
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:38,380
Wait, they're an orchestra to play a song

1682
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:39,940
from Impressions de France.

1683
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,420
God, that's amazing.

1684
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,140
This is making me think about though,

1685
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:48,660
there was this, there's a certain timeframe

1686
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:50,860
of Simpsons episodes where there's some

1687
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:53,660
California adventure digs in there.

1688
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:54,860
Was that you?

1689
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,620
No, no, that was Al Jean.

1690
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:02,020
He's like, he really, I think it comes from a place of love.

1691
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:04,020
He had it really in for any time.

1692
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:07,340
He was, back in the day, there were a lot of Euro Disney.

1693
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:14,780
Al really, I think he held the Eisner era

1694
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:17,380
to a very high standard and was disappointed

1695
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:19,980
when it fell short, I guess is the one way to put it.

1696
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:23,700
Because he loves Disneyland, but just like,

1697
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:28,700
the other, lesser imitations of Disney parks is enough for him.

1698
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:30,260
Interesting.

1699
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:32,580
Not wrong, I know what he's saying.

1700
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:35,300
Real quick, I'll say I did search and see

1701
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:38,420
how many listeners we may have from France.

1702
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:39,260
Oh yes.

1703
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:41,020
Because we can do that on our analytics.

1704
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:44,380
And I believe, this is I think just in the last month,

1705
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,860
this is like amount of listens,

1706
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:48,660
I think we might have 43 listeners.

1707
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:49,500
Wow.

1708
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:50,460
That's not bad, yeah.

1709
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:53,300
One of them is gonna be a guy from this,

1710
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,940
who's in the movie, like the guy with the grapes

1711
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:56,620
on his head or like somebody.

1712
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:57,940
The topless woman.

1713
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:59,900
The topless woman with the grapes on his head,

1714
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:02,660
the groom, so many.

1715
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:05,420
Yeah, there's a lot of people, a lot of possibilities.

1716
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:08,300
So yeah, if you were in it and you're alive still,

1717
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,740
tell us your story.

1718
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,740
If you are a listener from France,

1719
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:15,660
do you think the French Pavilion should be the one place

1720
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:18,020
in park in Walt Disney World where you could still

1721
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:20,900
smoke cigarettes, like in the pastry shop,

1722
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,540
in the movie theater?

1723
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:26,740
I mean, I'm just saying, like limited time magic maybe.

1724
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:29,380
Nude sunbathing, like they have a more French experience

1725
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:30,380
when you're there.

1726
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:31,500
Sure.

1727
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:34,380
Do it in the courtyard, you drop the kids

1728
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:36,300
around the corner at Ratatouille.

1729
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,340
I mean, I'm optimistic for Ratatouille,

1730
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:42,540
because I think when they do insert character,

1731
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:45,420
or when they do put more intellectual properties

1732
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:47,380
into the parks, I think usually when they start

1733
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:49,420
from scratch, it's more successful.

1734
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:51,900
And it seems like they've done a good job

1735
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:55,100
at matching the architecture of the French Pavilion.

1736
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:58,940
And I'm just thrilled that they left the movie in place.

1737
01:05:58,940 --> 01:05:59,780
Yes.

1738
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:01,220
That's what I was worried about.

1739
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:03,420
They did, I looked it up on the app,

1740
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,380
your current option to see the movie,

1741
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:09,620
you have a small window from 630 to 745.

1742
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:14,380
So I guess that's three showings,

1743
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:16,220
four maybe if they squeeze.

1744
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:17,380
That's true, because they have.

1745
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:18,220
Yeah.

1746
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:20,220
This is it guys, this is the last date.

1747
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:23,620
We need to get people in there to get some different style

1748
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:25,540
or something, this is not looking good.

1749
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:28,380
But they just up converted it to 4K.

1750
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:30,820
So, I mean, that's the nice thing about shooting on film,

1751
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,620
it's easier to up convert.

1752
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:35,620
I see which way the wind is blowing here.

1753
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:38,820
I mean, maybe it's the kind of thing where they do a special,

1754
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:41,740
the way they bring back the California movie,

1755
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:45,380
in the theater where it's usually soaring around the world.

1756
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:47,580
It could be that kind of thing.

1757
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:50,740
I always think that they have all these movies

1758
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:52,940
that they've banked over the years

1759
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:54,580
that they could bring back and people would like them,

1760
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:56,020
maybe, maybe no one cares.

1761
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:57,860
It's unclear what you do with them,

1762
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:58,700
your magic journey.

1763
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:02,100
Magic journey, there's all these old weird.

1764
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,460
It would be nice, yeah, just like, I mean, in this spot,

1765
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:09,300
I mean, it seems easy enough to just put a different movie in.

1766
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,620
So yeah, it would be nice in different,

1767
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:11,980
like a theater like this to show,

1768
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:13,340
I mean, not this France one,

1769
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:17,740
but like in a place in the parks to be able to show old stuff

1770
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:18,580
once in a while.

1771
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:20,940
I mean, it's like they have retro nights at Disneyland and.

1772
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:24,780
I mean, they easily, pretty easily brought back Captain EO back.

1773
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:25,540
And, you know, they can, they can.

1774
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:27,260
Sure. Yeah.

1775
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:31,260
So they can convert, you know, the new French Mandalorian

1776
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:34,900
goes to France short into this later at night

1777
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,940
for 30 minutes once in a while.

1778
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:37,980
Yeah, because they actually bring back,

1779
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:39,700
like, I don't know if the audience is familiar with this.

1780
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:42,820
There's some really weird.

1781
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:45,820
Theme park movies they used to make, like if you ever watched Magic Journeys,

1782
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:49,140
it is one of the weirdest and this was in a theme park.

1783
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:53,980
It is one of the weirds, like fever green, like acid trip, bizarre, spooky.

1784
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:55,700
Sort of dark and scary.

1785
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:56,580
It was a 3D movie.

1786
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:58,980
It was an imagination. It was all over the place.

1787
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:01,420
I remember as a kid being like, even as a kid, I was like,

1788
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:03,180
I don't want to be an adult anymore.

1789
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:06,300
This is what is what is this?

1790
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:08,900
There was like a movie called Symbiosis that they showed it.

1791
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:11,860
It was in the land.

1792
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:13,820
Yeah. What was it?

1793
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:15,020
What happened in Symbiosis?

1794
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:18,020
It was the thing that preceded the like Timon and Pumbaa movie.

1795
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:19,940
Yeah. Yeah.

1796
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:21,660
Where the carpeted wall is kind of.

1797
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:27,140
Anyway, it was a really scary movie about like pollution and,

1798
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,180
you know, the environment being destroyed and so like

1799
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:32,820
there's all these movies that, you know, there's at least a couple of weirdos out there that would.

1800
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,940
Yeah. I need to see them.

1801
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:36,580
Throw them up in like the Odyssey or something.

1802
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,020
I don't know. Yeah, right.

1803
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:39,420
That's perf. That seems good.

1804
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:40,380
Unless they're going to demolish it.

1805
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:44,980
But yeah, if that would be a great spot for you, you get through the journey theater also.

1806
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:48,420
Which you what if they just like said by day like like at 1030,

1807
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:51,980
we're showing Magic Journeys at 12, we're showing Symbiosis.

1808
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:55,700
You just like shuffled all the if they're going to bring back retro Epcot,

1809
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:57,340
just make that the retro Epcot.

1810
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:58,980
Yeah, I would be there in a heartbeat.

1811
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:01,340
Yeah. And they did it in California Adventure.

1812
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:05,900
They stuck Seasons of the Vine into the Blue Sky Cellar for a little while.

1813
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,700
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1814
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:10,340
And they remember correctly, they had seasons of the vine

1815
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:14,900
featuring our friend Jeremy Irons, a dark look at a year in California winemaking.

1816
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:19,660
It was it was in the Body Wars building.

1817
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:24,540
During the Food and Wine Festival, they would say they do.

1818
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:27,380
They bring these things back sometimes.

1819
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:28,860
There's some venue repurposing.

1820
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:30,100
Were you saying, Mike?

1821
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:33,620
Oh, I was just saying, I just I just quickly Googled also Magic Journeys.

1822
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:35,300
And I you're like it is bringing back.

1823
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:36,340
I do remember this.

1824
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:38,700
And it's like this evil is like an evil circus in it.

1825
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:41,420
Well, it is so weird.

1826
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:44,700
Yeah. Maybe the weirdest thing that's ever been an attraction

1827
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:47,780
at Disney theme park, you can watch the whole things on YouTube.

1828
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:49,660
It's disturbing.

1829
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:52,860
Epcot is so we've talked about this in our Epcot.

1830
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:55,580
So it's so traumatizing for kids.

1831
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:57,860
And it's so odd.

1832
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,540
And it's so it's like they were trying to do so much different

1833
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:03,060
that they just got. Yeah.

1834
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:04,900
I think I was thinking about like, what, you know, why?

1835
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:07,060
Why do I still years later still care about it?

1836
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:10,220
But you know, as a kid in Ohio, it.

1837
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:14,060
You forget that Epcot is fancy.

1838
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:18,460
It's like it's the fancy theme park for fancy boys and fancy girls like you go.

1839
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:20,900
I was a fancy little boy.

1840
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:23,660
I wanted to go and you learn about France and you see all these different countries.

1841
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:25,620
And like it really affected me.

1842
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:29,580
Like it's the futuristic part definitely affected me my whole life.

1843
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:34,380
You know, I still like I'm like my dream house is like

1844
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:38,500
the house and horizon, like the city apartment that the grandparents live in.

1845
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,140
I'm like, that's what I show real estate is what I want.

1846
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:45,060
Like it affects you when you're a kid and these things stick with you.

1847
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:47,740
And like and I think that like the world showcase part of it,

1848
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:50,220
it's like all these kids all over the country, you know,

1849
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:52,860
making fun of like, oh, Apcasio, lame or whatever.

1850
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:56,140
But like I think a certain percentage of kids go there

1851
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:59,220
and it messes with their brain and they're like, I want to go to all these countries.

1852
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:02,700
I want I want this kind of fancy experience as an adult.

1853
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,740
Yeah, I think you have to be like

1854
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,820
because I liked Epcot a lot as a kid.

1855
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:11,780
I like I probably was not that into World Showcase.

1856
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:14,700
I was probably like I needed some stimuli.

1857
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:17,300
Yeah, same movie.

1858
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:20,380
Yeah, like a movie wasn't going to have pleasantness is like, oh, OK, yeah, yeah.

1859
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:21,980
But I can. Where's the robot?

1860
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:24,700
Where? Show me the robot.

1861
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:29,300
But it definitely it definitely feels like a a field trip.

1862
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:31,180
Some of it feels like a field trip.

1863
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:33,260
And that's a good thing as you get older

1864
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:35,700
because you just want a nice, pleasant experience.

1865
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:38,260
And it is, hey, it is fun to learn, actually.

1866
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:39,780
I like to learn here and there.

1867
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:41,340
If I remember it, that's a different story.

1868
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:46,060
But it is I'm sure it's a specific type of kid that goes to Epcot.

1869
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:50,420
And all of you, you know, having been to some of the countries

1870
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:53,220
that the Epcot is based on, that some of the experience are very,

1871
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:56,300
very similar to really being like if you go to a gift shop in the Japan

1872
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:59,260
Pavilion, that is very much like being in actual Japan.

1873
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:02,780
Like that is like there's plenty of stores that have that feel like

1874
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:07,620
if you're just from a normal town in America, it's it's a pretty good simulation

1875
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:08,860
of being in some of these places.

1876
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:12,180
And at the very least, like it'll give you a little bug where you're like,

1877
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:14,580
OK, when I grow up, I'm sure I want to go to.

1878
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:18,980
Have you also then been annoyed by like

1879
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:23,260
there's like the the feeling of like, well, World Showcase,

1880
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:28,620
it's just plastic Europe, like why, you know, avoid the like go to the real thing.

1881
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:31,660
Why would you not? And I feel like people know what World Showcase

1882
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:34,300
Yeah, it's like watching a movie and be like, that's a set.

1883
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:36,780
That's not it's like, yeah, that's what it is.

1884
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:40,620
Yeah, I'm trying to like get you to not travel

1885
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:43,860
if anything, they want you to travel the world after you don't think you're a cave

1886
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:47,100
man that thinks you've gone through a time for France like.

1887
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:51,220
Yeah, it's also like, yeah, go to Europe.

1888
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:54,300
That's a very theme park experience to the real one.

1889
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:55,740
It's like, you know.

1890
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:59,420
It also discounts that like there's there's also like dumb stuff

1891
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:04,060
to do in Europe and Japan and stuff like it's as if it's all a cultural

1892
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,460
enriching experience.

1893
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:08,620
Like that's why I go to the places for the dumb stuff

1894
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:11,100
mixed with some enriching stuff. Right.

1895
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:14,100
This is reminding me all this talk about like the moot,

1896
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:17,900
you know, impressions to France is so ethereal.

1897
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:22,580
It really does remind me a lot of like early like in film school,

1898
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:27,700
they would show us like not not exactly kundun,

1899
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:31,700
but like stuff like that, where it's like this is a movie made of just visuals

1900
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:34,140
and and music, visuals and audio.

1901
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:37,060
And you can tell a story with visuals and audio.

1902
01:13:37,340 --> 01:13:40,580
And I'm now realizing like I was like, OK, yeah, got it.

1903
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:42,780
Sounds good. This feels very familiar to me.

1904
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:45,660
And I'm wondering if that's because I watched all these Epcot movies

1905
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:49,060
so many times as opposed to like some classmates who are like,

1906
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:51,260
I can't wrap my head around that.

1907
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,900
Like the issue of travel, I mean, I mean, like, you know,

1908
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:55,580
there's all this.

1909
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:59,220
There was a great one I saw recently that I I'm sure there's some sort of

1910
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:02,780
like connection to like some of the people who worked on one Epcot movie.

1911
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:08,140
It was the first IMAX movie, which was in the if you look at pictures of the

1912
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:14,220
the big Buckminster Fuller sphere at the Montreal Expo in 1967.

1913
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:16,260
It's still up is an IMAX theater.

1914
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:18,180
It was built for that World's Fair.

1915
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:20,260
The first IMAX theater.

1916
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:24,180
Ever made, I think in this movie, it's called North of Superior.

1917
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:28,100
It's just like a tour of Canada, like forests and stuff.

1918
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:31,660
Anyway, you can say it's on YouTube.

1919
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:34,380
They posted like a Toronto Film Festival,

1920
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:37,900
did a retrospective of the directors and it's all there.

1921
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:42,380
It's it's it is so the DNA of this sort of grand spectacle.

1922
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:45,940
You know, soaring music and flying around

1923
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,860
that I think probably goes back

1924
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:52,180
to like travelogue movies from the early days of movies when it was just like a way

1925
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:55,100
to get to see a place that you'd never been before.

1926
01:14:56,100 --> 01:15:00,340
One of the earliest uses of movies was to just,

1927
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:02,580
you know, show you stuff you couldn't see otherwise.

1928
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:03,780
Thank you. Yeah.

1929
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:06,700
Which you sort of take for granted with stuff like this,

1930
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:09,380
with these early Epcot movies, like how that.

1931
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:14,420
Yeah, like it travel wasn't as easy and technology wasn't as advanced.

1932
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:18,180
And now that cameras can be very small and get to obscure places

1933
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:22,220
like to do the work and to take a 500 pound rig

1934
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:26,020
up into the sky or into a balloon or into the Eiffel Tower.

1935
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:28,060
Like, yeah, there's an appeal to this.

1936
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:31,260
I think that feels very National Geographic or like that.

1937
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:34,900
You know, it's still cool to watch now, but you have to think about how in 82

1938
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:38,460
it was like really remarkable and truly taking people to places

1939
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:40,020
they maybe couldn't go.

1940
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:43,620
Well, it does follow like the Disney nature or Disney's

1941
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:45,020
like travel log.

1942
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:47,420
I feel like Disney doesn't.

1943
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:49,780
It's like almost as an afterthought.

1944
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:53,460
They dump this like archive stuff on Disney Plus.

1945
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:56,140
We're like, yeah, we have National Geographic to we bought that.

1946
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:01,820
But it's like, well, that's kind of was one of your core things for a long time.

1947
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:05,580
And I think I think that they won like Oscars and stuff for the short movies.

1948
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:08,220
Oh, yeah, the Earth Day,

1949
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:11,860
the short ones and then the Earth Day ones that they put out every year.

1950
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:14,180
But like back in the 50s and late 40s,

1951
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:16,540
oh, yes, we innovated all this like camera.

1952
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:21,460
Now, I think Seal Island or like some old Disney movie won in Oscar.

1953
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:22,980
There's a really messed up one.

1954
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:25,260
I think it's on Disney Plus.

1955
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:27,060
Some someone posted there.

1956
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:29,060
It's it's called Perry.

1957
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:33,620
It's a narrative live action about the life of a squirrel in the forest.

1958
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:37,260
Pretty good. But there's a thing that is one of the trippiest,

1959
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:40,980
weirdest things where the squirrel has a dream.

1960
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:44,380
And you actually shoot in live action.

1961
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:47,820
The squirrel going through like a fantasy

1962
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:52,660
sequence of like crazy dream stuff, but with a real squirrel.

1963
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:54,900
Check it out.

1964
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:55,620
Well, it's great.

1965
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:59,620
But it's like the ways that they combine like near they still found like weird

1966
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:02,420
Disney ish ways to.

1967
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:06,020
Zazz up like a documentary that's just like animals walking around. They think.

1968
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:08,740
This is by far the weirdest.

1969
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:11,060
Wow. Wow. I think is the name of it.

1970
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:12,180
Check it. It's.

1971
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:14,980
Well, in the time, I think it's on Disney.

1972
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:18,140
I saw it in like Turner Classic one time.

1973
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:21,740
They did when they used to do those like obscure Disney thing.

1974
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:26,460
Just sitting there with no indication that it's bizarre and has a squirrel.

1975
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,260
I mean, you don't watch the whole thing.

1976
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:30,780
You sit through a lot of just like a squirrel eating a nut and all that stuff,

1977
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:32,660
which, yeah, God bless that you think.

1978
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:35,460
But there's a dream sequence about two thirds of the way through.

1979
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:39,860
It was like a Wanda vision of its day with a trippy.

1980
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:43,580
Very nice.

1981
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:44,780
Can I point out something?

1982
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:49,020
So though we've we've been talking about how this thing is very like impressionistic

1983
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:52,900
and it's, you know, mainly music and visuals.

1984
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:55,820
There is sparing narration.

1985
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:57,180
Let's not forget about that.

1986
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:59,860
You do have my friends wakes up at the

1987
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:04,780
which is a little card to decipher in the YouTube clips.

1988
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:07,620
Some of the narration, the accents a little thick and, you know,

1989
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:11,420
an iPhone or a GoPro is not the best way to capture.

1990
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:15,300
Sort of impossible by the time it's translated several mediums. Yeah.

1991
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:18,620
Here's something that I was wondering.

1992
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:23,140
Me not being a terribly cultured person, I was thinking like, well, is this

1993
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:27,580
whoever's narrating this is probably like one of the great French actors.

1994
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:30,260
Right. And I'm a fool for not knowing who it is.

1995
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:32,860
And then I looked up the name Claude Gaube.

1996
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:36,380
And I'm like, well, of course, he's probably I'm going to look at this IMDb

1997
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:39,820
and there's going to be a hundred entries and this is going to go and go and go.

1998
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:42,020
And how could I not know the great Gaube?

1999
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:46,140
It turns out that this is one of only two credits for this actor.

2000
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:50,220
And the other credit is a film from 1977.

2001
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:53,100
The film is called Chatterbox.

2002
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:56,220
This is a film mainly starring Rip Taylor.

2003
01:18:56,620 --> 01:19:00,780
And it is a movie Chatterbox refers to.

2004
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:06,180
There is a woman who, after an unsatisfying sexual encounter,

2005
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:11,460
her vagina comes to life and reviews the performance of the man.

2006
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:17,580
And you follow the, you know, the really the rise in fame of her vagina.

2007
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:20,700
Virginia, the talking vagina. Wow.

2008
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:23,580
I was not familiar with Chatterbox before that.

2009
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:25,820
And we're like, we've got the guy.

2010
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:30,500
Disney. The only one way we have all the great French actors lined up.

2011
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:34,020
But only the guy who plays

2012
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:37,940
only the guy who plays the Maider D

2013
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:42,300
with two lines in Chatterbox, the talking vagina movie.

2014
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:46,580
Rip Taylor had a conflict, so they could not get him.

2015
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:48,420
I guess so.

2016
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:51,300
I and it really is just like the woman comes in.

2017
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:52,660
Can I have a tail over to? Yes.

2018
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:56,340
Wait a minute. Are you the owner of Virginia, the talking vagina?

2019
01:19:57,180 --> 01:20:00,580
It's truly that's all it is.

2020
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:03,940
So Claude Gaube, one of the stranger filmography's club.

2021
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:05,860
Gaube. Very interesting.

2022
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:09,260
Mm hmm. And check out several Perry and Chatterbox.

2023
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:15,220
Chatterbox, which is on Amazon Prime, actually, as is a lot of bizarre old junk.

2024
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:17,660
So what is it? What a double feature.

2025
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:20,180
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Plan a little night for yourself.

2026
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:23,060
Was that the only time that talking vagina character appeared?

2027
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:27,220
Or did they spend his vagina off at all or into other

2028
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:31,460
in into Virginia Vision or some vagina?

2029
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:35,300
So they've been magic during the circus.

2030
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:38,380
OK, is a brief caveat.

2031
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:43,660
I do want to mention some of the soundtrack stuff.

2032
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:47,660
And I OK, there is you met

2033
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:52,940
Matt, you mentioned the kind of obscure song in the soundtrack.

2034
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:57,260
There is a song that recurs in the soundtrack.

2035
01:20:57,260 --> 01:20:59,780
And I looked at the name because I never knew the name of this song.

2036
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:04,900
And it is called Aquarium from the suite

2037
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:10,020
the Carnival of Animals by I'm going to try Camille Saint-Saens.

2038
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:15,180
And I just know it as the spooky wonder music.

2039
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:18,260
Like it doesn't play after the Amblin logo,

2040
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:22,780
but it plays after people's movies who have been called like the next Spielberg.

2041
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:25,820
Like every kid's movie of like.

2042
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:28,220
Yeah, we use it in the beach.

2043
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:30,460
It's a very common here.

2044
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:32,700
It is very spooky. It's a great song.

2045
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:35,260
Yeah. And it's it's great in this.

2046
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:37,580
I mean, but I just couldn't.

2047
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:39,700
I was like, oh, my God, that song.

2048
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:42,740
I immediately just had to react.

2049
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:47,140
Every kind of like the Indian in the cupboard kind of children's movie,

2050
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:49,980
I feel like at some point uses that song.

2051
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:51,820
Yeah, there's there's another one.

2052
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:53,660
It's once again, I don't speak French.

2053
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:54,780
Sorry, guys.

2054
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:57,740
Gymnopédie by Eric Satie is in there.

2055
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:01,660
That's in a ton of movies like the versions in Impressions of France is like.

2056
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:04,820
I think orchestrated where it's a piano song,

2057
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:07,900
but it's in like Royal Tenenbaum, and it's in so many different things.

2058
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:12,260
The songs at the end of this movie,

2059
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:14,660
I remember hearing somewhere, I'm like, oh, where's that from?

2060
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:17,700
And then I put it together. It's the song.

2061
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:24,220
It's it's the public, the organ symphony or something in the original version.

2062
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:28,780
But it the melody of it is the theme from BAPE.

2063
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:32,060
Oh, oh, oh.

2064
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:35,980
So it's like over the end of Impressions of France, there is this like organ song.

2065
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:39,260
It's like really built to a big climax, and they show all these different cool shots.

2066
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:44,700
But I've turned on all the stuff that like a low key version of that song is that

2067
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:48,060
I'm pretty sure the theme from BAPE.

2068
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:49,220
Well, that's crazy.

2069
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:51,100
Or news a lot or maybe the BAPE in the city.

2070
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:53,380
One of the BAPE. Right, right.

2071
01:22:53,380 --> 01:22:57,860
The the the same song, if I'm saying it sort of right.

2072
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:00,820
I didn't I didn't realize until I looked it up.

2073
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:05,140
I never put this together that it's the it's a version of that is the melody

2074
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:09,180
from the the Space Mountain Dick Dale version.

2075
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:11,500
That's what he's that's what he's playing.

2076
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,140
Wow.

2077
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:17,900
Right. Another great piece of theme park music.

2078
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:21,860
Yeah, yeah. It's like it's certainly like rearranged enough.

2079
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:23,220
You'd never put that together.

2080
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:26,940
But yeah, it's like the it's a carnival vibe, I guess.

2081
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:29,340
So these different.

2082
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:34,460
The the soundtrack notable to for the way Buddy Baker arranged it.

2083
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:38,700
He did a lot of a number of Disney projects, some of the animated movies.

2084
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,700
It's the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra

2085
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:46,700
playing these arrangements at Abbey Road Studios.

2086
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:50,780
Yeah. And it was the this.

2087
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:52,940
There's a few.

2088
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:59,340
Titles are honorary things that impressions to France hold.

2089
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,180
This is the first movie.

2090
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:03,060
Let me get this right.

2091
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:06,740
This is the first movie with a digital soundtrack

2092
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:10,460
recorded from beginning to end on a digital record.

2093
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:12,540
Like there were only two

2094
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:14,940
Sony digital recorders in the world,

2095
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:20,820
and they got the one from Los Angeles to Abbey Road Studios to record this.

2096
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:22,620
Whoa. OK.

2097
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:26,780
Oh, which I guess is just part of the like technology boom that was going on

2098
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:30,020
because they wanted to show off so much technology like in all these movies.

2099
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:33,260
They've got so yeah, there's a lot at their disposal.

2100
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:34,460
That's pretty crazy.

2101
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:38,300
The other the other title it holds from the Guinness World Records

2102
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:42,940
people, this is the again, very specific.

2103
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:48,180
This is the longest running daily screening of a film in the same theater.

2104
01:24:48,860 --> 01:24:51,540
Hmm. Oh, wow.

2105
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:54,420
I guess what else would it be?

2106
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:57,100
I mean, is anything ever going to beat it?

2107
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:59,380
I had 35 years, I believe, like 80.

2108
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:03,020
They're counting 82 to 2017, I think, when it shut down.

2109
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:08,860
Sing Along with Belle will, you know, in the 20 80s or something like that.

2110
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:11,540
It's there to stay.

2111
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:14,820
Well, let's wait. Let's talk about that because the yeah.

2112
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:18,620
So they have started during the day, mostly you go and it is this

2113
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:20,580
Beauty and the Beast Sing Along thing.

2114
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:24,420
Has anybody done it for any reason or learned what it is?

2115
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:28,060
I have not done it. I have not since they allowed it in.

2116
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:31,460
Yeah, since it invaded.

2117
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,100
It invaded. Frey let the wolf in the head.

2118
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:34,340
We all know each story.

2119
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:37,740
It's like the newcomer comes and, you know, bad, you know, slowly,

2120
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:40,220
slowly takes away the spotlight until

2121
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:42,020
until the presence of France

2122
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:44,580
washed, you know, walks into the ocean and drowns death.

2123
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:49,260
It's it's it's an odd.

2124
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:53,700
I looked it up and it's like they did get new voiceover from Angela Lansbury,

2125
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:56,780
who kind of steps you through the story quickly, but it's this bizarre

2126
01:25:57,020 --> 01:26:00,380
reimagining of the story where Lefou,

2127
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:05,700
a Gaston's friend, was the secret like guardian angel behind everything

2128
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:09,420
and was like helping bring Beauty and the Beast together.

2129
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:13,620
Like, oh, like he like helps in the kitchen during the our guest.

2130
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:18,540
And he I seem to maybe like sows or at least like gets the dress

2131
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:22,660
ready, the famous yellow dress, the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern kind of thing.

2132
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:24,460
Oh, I guess so. Yeah.

2133
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:26,660
You didn't see like the true. Yeah.

2134
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:31,300
Yeah. Apparently, which is interesting, but also not by.

2135
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:33,540
But Lefou is evil, right?

2136
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:37,020
I mean, I guess maybe that's it's made it's made to make you question

2137
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:39,340
your feelings on Lefou.

2138
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,060
This little applet.

2139
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:42,700
Does he make them fall in love?

2140
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:46,460
Like, does he send a romantic letters to each of them

2141
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:49,580
from his own perspective to try to get them to get like

2142
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:53,020
he might just like, hey, it kind of like nudges them.

2143
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:58,020
Maybe he might like whisper in their ears in a Cyrano fashion.

2144
01:26:58,220 --> 01:26:59,300
I'm not sure.

2145
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:00,780
The video I watch is very confusing.

2146
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:03,340
It just like only shows you the Lefou parts.

2147
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:05,060
It's a Lefou supercut.

2148
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:09,140
So I really couldn't make heads or tails of what was going on most of the time.

2149
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:11,100
It sounds bad.

2150
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:12,140
That sounds bad.

2151
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:15,780
And thankfully, the video cut out any time anyone started singing

2152
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:20,580
is the little bits that I heard of like a bunch, like several tired parents

2153
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:22,620
singing, there's something sweet.

2154
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:26,380
I don't really want to see that kind of uncool that they didn't bring

2155
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:29,620
Paul Goubet first of another credit, you know?

2156
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:31,700
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

2157
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,780
He's the spirit of that theater.

2158
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:36,860
And we know his versatility like Wonder Woman 84.

2159
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:40,260
They bring, you know, just as a courtesy, they bring it back for one.

2160
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:42,420
Right. One line.

2161
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:44,180
Yeah. Post credits. Post credits.

2162
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:48,460
Goubet. He's a Mater De now at the Beast's Castle and has been ever since

2163
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:50,900
his encounter with Virginia, the Talking Vagina.

2164
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,340
I did not know they made an original.

2165
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:56,940
I just assumed it would be the set pieces of the movie with little animated

2166
01:27:57,020 --> 01:28:00,300
transitions or little cards in between like.

2167
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:03,140
But it's a little more than that.

2168
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:05,580
Interesting. But yeah, a little more than that.

2169
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:11,300
But it seems to lean lean towards are more like, well, that's complicated.

2170
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:14,860
Like, oh, yeah. Oh, Yago actually is the hero of Aladdin.

2171
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:17,380
Didn't you know? Yago helped.

2172
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:20,620
Yeah. It's like I thought that story went a little too neatly.

2173
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:22,540
There was somebody behind the scenes.

2174
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:26,380
Yeah. And then that was obviously the villain sidekick.

2175
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:28,900
He's the one who helped. Yeah.

2176
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:32,300
Turtle Talk with Crush reveals that Crush both

2177
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:35,700
disappeared Nemo and helped him come back.

2178
01:28:35,860 --> 01:28:38,140
So he was playing both sides.

2179
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:41,660
Yeah. Like Yo Jimbo, like Fistful of Dollars.

2180
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:43,620
He was playing both sides.

2181
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:44,860
Makes sense.

2182
01:28:44,860 --> 01:28:48,380
Well, I like I like reinventing the stories to bring them to the parks.

2183
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:50,260
But like, yeah, what do we do?

2184
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:54,340
I mean, you were kind of alluding to is this is this episode the best chance

2185
01:28:54,340 --> 01:28:57,300
at the moment to try to encourage people

2186
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:01,700
currently defying the pandemic and in Disney World to go

2187
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:04,300
sit in this movie theater.

2188
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:06,940
I don't know. Should we not tell people to go to a movie theater right now?

2189
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:09,500
Probably not.

2190
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:12,100
Yeah. Maybe when it is safe.

2191
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:14,100
You know, like I said, you got to have it.

2192
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:15,900
You got to have kind of a philosophical attitude.

2193
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:17,660
These things, you know, it's in the spirit.

2194
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:19,220
Like I said, a world's fair stuff.

2195
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:21,220
It comes and goes and you have to accept it.

2196
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:22,660
I don't want to go. I want it.

2197
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:24,220
I do like.

2198
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:28,300
It is cool that for whatever reason, all these other things have changed.

2199
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:32,540
This little movie that is just in the forgotten corner of Epcot

2200
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:35,140
has lasted this whole time and is shown every day.

2201
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:36,460
And it would be nice.

2202
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:38,620
It would be nice if it lasted as long as the park lasted.

2203
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:40,100
One little piece.

2204
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:41,980
It doesn't hurt anybody. Show one time a day.

2205
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:43,580
And you know, come on, give me a break.

2206
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:45,660
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2207
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:49,900
Imagine you're Joe Rody was saying he thinks of these things like Broadway shows.

2208
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:52,180
They don't have they don't go forever.

2209
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:54,220
So they had a great run if it is going away.

2210
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:55,860
But why not?

2211
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:56,980
It is nice these days.

2212
01:29:56,980 --> 01:30:00,580
You know, you can your your favorite movies like this, you can watch them on YouTube.

2213
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:02,900
They're nice. They don't pull them down.

2214
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:04,260
Mm hmm. There's great.

2215
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:08,180
You know, the resolution is really good.

2216
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:11,140
It's not the same thing, but I mean, like, it's nice that you're able,

2217
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:14,340
like now, before talking about this, I could watch the whole thing and, you know,

2218
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:18,140
you know, yeah, I discovered on Spotify

2219
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:22,300
the entire soundtrack, Compressions of France is one track is available

2220
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:26,820
from one of the official Disney albums of only like 18, 19 minutes long.

2221
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:28,140
The whole thing music is great.

2222
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:30,180
I'm sure it'd be great to like you were to or something.

2223
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:32,820
Mm hmm. Right, right.

2224
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:35,180
Yeah. So it's like, you know, hey, it's exists.

2225
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:37,740
It can live on. It can live.

2226
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:42,380
What if they to keep it, they just like insert LeFou into many of the shots.

2227
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:46,300
Right. He explains like he he got the couple to get married.

2228
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:49,260
Yeah. He he stole the woman's top.

2229
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:51,740
That's right. He releases the balloon.

2230
01:30:51,740 --> 01:30:53,700
He stole the woman's top. That's great.

2231
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:54,860
Thank you.

2232
01:30:54,860 --> 01:30:57,660
So, yeah, maybe that's something that compromise also that can be reached.

2233
01:30:57,700 --> 01:31:02,020
People like like backstory, if that's really what people want is more

2234
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:04,580
machinations and backstory.

2235
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:06,460
That's like the way that the future we can do that.

2236
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:11,580
We can add that to, you know, space your birth, like, oh, you know,

2237
01:31:12,260 --> 01:31:15,020
here's Judy Dish teaching the Phoenicians out of like right or whatever.

2238
01:31:15,020 --> 01:31:17,540
Yeah, it's more complicated.

2239
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:18,980
We can do that. Right.

2240
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:20,580
Some of these great attraction.

2241
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:22,580
Yeah, yeah. Let's complicate them all.

2242
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:26,580
But maybe maybe several pre shows also, maybe like as many.

2243
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:30,260
Let's build a bunch of tiny pre show rooms to one

2244
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:33,020
additional thing where we're talking about the great

2245
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:35,900
the great world showcase films.

2246
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:38,700
Did you guys happen when you were talking about

2247
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:41,500
Olaf?

2248
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:45,420
The place was talking about the old the old Norway film

2249
01:31:45,740 --> 01:31:47,500
called Spirit of Norway.

2250
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:48,980
Check it out. That might be my favorite.

2251
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:50,300
I've been gone for a long time.

2252
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:52,700
It was like the post show.

2253
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:53,700
Right.

2254
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:57,740
That even they they were like people just like walked right to see this.

2255
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:00,380
It is great. It is.

2256
01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:03,100
To me, it is like the pinnacle of art form.

2257
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:04,740
And we're checking out.

2258
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:07,820
Yeah, we haven't done Maelstrom yet, so I assume it'll be part of that,

2259
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:09,860
but I could easily see it being its own.

2260
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:12,700
Well, forget it. Don't be like every person who ever wrote Maelstrom

2261
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:14,700
and just walk right by them.

2262
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:16,260
It's worth like five seconds.

2263
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:17,500
It's it's.

2264
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:21,100
Yeah, my very bookish family would always sit and watch it.

2265
01:32:21,140 --> 01:32:23,100
And I was always mad when people walk by, like, hey, hey,

2266
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:25,460
have a little respect.

2267
01:32:25,460 --> 01:32:26,940
I didn't think you were allowed.

2268
01:32:26,940 --> 01:32:29,060
Like as a kid, I'm like, no, doors closed.

2269
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:32,340
Can't cool like a blue chairs.

2270
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:33,540
It was like a great little theater.

2271
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:34,580
They had it was great.

2272
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:35,940
I do like that room a lot.

2273
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:39,660
Yeah, we should do a proud people, as the movie told me,

2274
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:42,980
proud people of Norway with like just a few minutes of your time

2275
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:45,140
to tell you about their fascinatical.

2276
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:46,180
It's not a lot.

2277
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:49,780
We should do a Maelstrom episode and then like bring it to a climax

2278
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:52,300
and finish and then, oh, wait, the movie.

2279
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:55,500
Here's another hour about this movie.

2280
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:56,300
Mm hmm.

2281
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:57,540
So don't go.

2282
01:32:57,540 --> 01:32:59,940
There's a couple of businessmen signing a paper.

2283
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:05,460
A man falling asleep, literally a long scene of a man falling asleep in a chair.

2284
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:09,580
Don't they show like sort of like massive IBM type,

2285
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:12,500
like like really old computer technology?

2286
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:15,140
That's one of my memories of it. Yeah. Mm hmm.

2287
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:16,820
You could fall asleep in a chair.

2288
01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:18,700
They were just showing you what you could do.

2289
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:21,860
Like you can fall asleep if you're going to sit and watch. That's OK.

2290
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:24,420
Harder to fall asleep in Impressions de France,

2291
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:27,540
because while the narration is a little hard to read on YouTube,

2292
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:31,020
the volume of it is very clear.

2293
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:33,380
They play that music loud.

2294
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:34,300
They're always talking about it.

2295
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:35,820
They're always looking for IP these days. Right.

2296
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:37,740
Again, canceling IP.

2297
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:41,340
I'm yeah, I'm going to shop to Disney World Showcase

2298
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:44,380
expanded universe with just the movies,

2299
01:33:44,420 --> 01:33:48,180
the characters from the movies and all the impressions of France.

2300
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:51,380
You just you shoot a little runner at the end to be like where

2301
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:55,260
Paul Gabbay goes and he recruits the all stars.

2302
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:58,820
And then they meet in like the American adventure at the end or something.

2303
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:02,500
They meet

2304
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:05,060
Neil deGrasse Tyson and.

2305
01:34:05,060 --> 01:34:06,420
Right. No, that's it.

2306
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:09,380
That's the bad guy. Oh, good. That's better. Oh, go.

2307
01:34:09,380 --> 01:34:12,780
We have to go clear American adventure of all the pedophiles

2308
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:15,700
that live in all the sex from not Neil deGrasse Tyson.

2309
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:17,820
No, no, that's a different that's a different thing.

2310
01:34:17,820 --> 01:34:20,140
That's all the suss. All the suss.

2311
01:34:20,140 --> 01:34:22,660
People who have scandals behind them.

2312
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:22,940
Yeah.

2313
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:26,540
I have to be ridded from like Ghostbusted out of the American adventure.

2314
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:28,980
Yeah, yeah.

2315
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:31,180
So they meet all meet in the.

2316
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:33,820
You know, from from the animatronics that are still there.

2317
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:37,620
They got to do like a me to swipe of all the backstories of all those guys.

2318
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:40,340
Yeah. This is good.

2319
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:42,380
A lot of potential, I think.

2320
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:47,500
Yeah, just good, honest people rounding up people who got corrupted by fame

2321
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:51,740
and living too much of an American adventure.

2322
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,980
Mm hmm. Too much.

2323
01:34:54,540 --> 01:34:57,700
They just they adventure a little too.

2324
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:00,900
I honestly those things are important part of the American story as well.

2325
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:02,540
You know. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2326
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:03,580
Yes. Yeah.

2327
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:06,420
You risk, you know, drug problems like all that stuff.

2328
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:08,100
All of it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2329
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:09,820
Getting drunk with power.

2330
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:13,940
It is unfortunate they did insert the head of the Robin Hood app

2331
01:35:13,940 --> 01:35:15,500
into the end of that.

2332
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,580
It seems like that was misguided.

2333
01:35:17,580 --> 01:35:21,380
All the things every time they keep stepping in it like. Yeah. Yeah.

2334
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:27,100
Well, final any last impressions to France to

2335
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:30,860
to have on record to encourage people to check this thing out

2336
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:33,180
when it is safe to do so.

2337
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:35,700
A lot of good hot air balloon stuff in there.

2338
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:37,140
Oh, some great hot air balloons.

2339
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:38,580
Yeah. Great hot air balloon stuff.

2340
01:35:38,580 --> 01:35:42,060
We were talking about that recently and I forgot there was more in this.

2341
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:44,540
Yeah. Yeah. Non Air Force One related.

2342
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:47,100
You know what you have to give it up to is

2343
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:50,980
and what apparently part of the 360 thing was is now we can do camera moves

2344
01:35:50,980 --> 01:35:53,700
because 360 those rigs are so crazy.

2345
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:55,820
You can kind of only move back and forth.

2346
01:35:55,820 --> 01:35:59,020
But you with this 200 degree thing, you could tilt.

2347
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:02,420
And it is very striking when it tilts up the Eiffel Tower.

2348
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:06,620
And you think it's cool and like, wow, that's a big, wide grand shot.

2349
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:10,500
But the I didn't realize how difficult it was to do that.

2350
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:14,140
Just a mere tilt was really insane and they had to build a special rig

2351
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:16,340
to be able to do it.

2352
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:19,260
So good job on the tilt, everybody. Great tilt.

2353
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:21,660
Yeah. Yeah, I don't know.

2354
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:23,100
It's just a pleasure. It's just pleasant.

2355
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:26,540
It's it's that thing that we say about some rides.

2356
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:28,620
Pleasant. It's very pleasant.

2357
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:30,580
And that's good. Yeah.

2358
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:31,580
There's a dog parade.

2359
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:33,980
A bunch of dogs go by. Shout out the dogs.

2360
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:38,460
Yeah. Pastry window revs you up for the pastry shop next door.

2361
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:41,140
Yeah, I love that train car. I love the train car.

2362
01:36:41,260 --> 01:36:45,380
Oh, the train car sequence where it's all where it's like a bunch of the screens

2363
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:49,620
and then it goes down to the middle and it feels like the the scenery is rushing

2364
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:51,260
by you. That is a great effect.

2365
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:53,220
We're eating a nice full meal on a train car.

2366
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:55,700
Wouldn't that be? Yeah. Oh, my gosh.

2367
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:58,780
So nice. I mean, it certainly helps that we've been inside for a year

2368
01:36:59,380 --> 01:37:01,420
to make me want to get on a train car and get a meal.

2369
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:03,420
But yes, it looks lovely.

2370
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:05,660
Food off of a real plate at this point. Yeah.

2371
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:08,300
Yeah. Instead of me, you just like crouched by my fridge,

2372
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:12,980
like shoveling peanut butter into my mouth from like this counts as a meal.

2373
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:16,660
I miss you would do that before we recorded at your house.

2374
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:19,540
Like Jason impressions, the Europe army.

2375
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:21,340
That's new, Jason.

2376
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:23,260
That's a new behavior. OK.

2377
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:27,020
It's only quarantine.

2378
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:29,140
Oh, you know, one more thing. I like the wallpaper.

2379
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:32,660
Now you talk about fancy Epcot for fancy boys and girls.

2380
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:34,500
Nothing fancier than that wallpaper.

2381
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:38,380
It's nice. And I don't know if it's gold leafed or but it's a golden hue.

2382
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:40,060
And I like being in that lobby.

2383
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:43,620
The little area they keep you in before you go in with a little art displays of

2384
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:45,340
art and architecture.

2385
01:37:45,340 --> 01:37:47,180
France is great people.

2386
01:37:47,180 --> 01:37:50,980
Fancy French people talking to you, welcoming you there. Yeah.

2387
01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:53,980
And it's a nice it's just every day.

2388
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:57,700
Really get all the all the aspects of it, the great scenery

2389
01:37:57,700 --> 01:37:59,740
and the intimacy of the towns.

2390
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:04,660
And and it's one of the it's a country that really has a great history

2391
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:09,540
of cinema and really respects the form so that they they have a big grand

2392
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:15,060
like movie house to show you scenes of their country is is very nice.

2393
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:18,100
Anyone want to try to pronounce how they say what the

2394
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:23,780
when we know it's palace, but do you want to guess how that palace is said?

2395
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:26,260
Mike, you're the French expert.

2396
01:38:26,260 --> 01:38:28,220
Oh, yeah. That's a good question.

2397
01:38:28,220 --> 01:38:30,420
Isn't it? Palace with the A.I.S.

2398
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:33,460
How do you say it? I have a place.

2399
01:38:34,180 --> 01:38:36,460
Palais, probably Palais, Cinema.

2400
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:37,860
All right. All right.

2401
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:40,660
We well, thanks for rescuing us, Jason.

2402
01:38:41,620 --> 01:38:43,900
We didn't embarrass ourselves further.

2403
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:47,820
And Matt, thank you for giving us an opportunity to talk about this thing

2404
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:49,220
for for a while.

2405
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:51,740
You survived podcast, the ride.

2406
01:38:51,740 --> 01:38:53,820
I really appreciate you being here.

2407
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:55,220
Let's exit through the gift shop.

2408
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:57,620
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2409
01:38:57,620 --> 01:39:00,380
I know I came here to plug impressions to France.

2410
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:02,740
Check it out. Go it.

2411
01:39:02,740 --> 01:39:04,300
Get those numbers up. Let's keep this in.

2412
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:05,540
Let's push.

2413
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:07,980
It's it's opening at six p.m. now.

2414
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:09,500
Let's get down to five.

2415
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:13,620
Let's get popular enough to carve an hour out of the Beauty and the Beast thing.

2416
01:39:14,140 --> 01:39:15,540
Let's small achievable goals.

2417
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:19,700
Yeah, let's get a Reddit going to make sure everybody gets into

2418
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:22,540
impressions to France, driving the popularity of it up.

2419
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:24,580
Let's short it.

2420
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:26,100
Let's no, not short it.

2421
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:27,340
We're going to Disney short.

2422
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:29,340
Now we're doing collective action.

2423
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:30,380
Oh, you're right.

2424
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:31,420
I don't know anything works.

2425
01:39:31,420 --> 01:39:34,300
That's why I just so don't know how this works that I thought that was shorting.

2426
01:39:34,780 --> 01:39:36,940
No, no, no, not short it.

2427
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:38,500
Yeah, we're not shorting it.

2428
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:41,300
We're sticking it to Disney who's shorting it.

2429
01:39:41,580 --> 01:39:42,700
That's right. That's right.

2430
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:45,340
You know, you can people should just like watch the YouTube on repeat.

2431
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:47,540
Maybe that's the way to get the numbers up now if you want to.

2432
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:50,220
Because let's make impressions to France go viral.

2433
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:52,460
And then, yeah, that's a good start.

2434
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:53,300
Yeah. Yeah.

2435
01:39:53,300 --> 01:39:57,660
Yeah. You can find like high res copies both head on and from the side.

2436
01:39:57,660 --> 01:40:02,540
And I honestly think the side ones, when you can see a little of the extra screens,

2437
01:40:02,540 --> 01:40:05,500
it's the effect worked a little more for me.

2438
01:40:05,820 --> 01:40:10,140
You can see happy wedding guests who seem to approve of the ceremony.

2439
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:13,460
And it's like being in a in the pew like you're sitting next to.

2440
01:40:13,780 --> 01:40:17,260
So it gives you the same the sensation of sitting next to someone,

2441
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:18,740
something we can't do right now.

2442
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:20,060
Oh, yeah, that's yes.

2443
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:22,060
Yeah, that's really the main reason.

2444
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:24,100
Well, yeah, lots of reasons to watch it, Matt.

2445
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:26,820

And so I'll have one, I guess.

2451
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:49,380
I'll say just sweet desolée.

2452
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:53,500
I'm sorry to our French listeners for not speaking more French.

2453
01:40:56,020 --> 01:40:59,100
What else do I can I just we Michael?

2454
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:01,300
No, that's wait, Jim, a pal.

2455
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:02,860
Michael is how to say my name.

2456
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:04,780
So I get a little more French there.

2457
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:07,020
So the end of the episode is I am Michael.

2458
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:10,340
I am. Yeah.

2459
01:41:10,340 --> 01:41:14,660
I guess we Michael Michael is what I'm saying to the good people of France.

2460
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:17,180
So on that note, I am Michael.

2461
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:19,460
Uh, he is Michael.

2462
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:21,100
