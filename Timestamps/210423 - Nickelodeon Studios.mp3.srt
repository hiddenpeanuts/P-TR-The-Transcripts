1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,800
On your mark, get set, go!

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,240
These three hosts will go head to head to head to find out who ooze is the most obscure information

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,400
about a Defunct TV filming location.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,640
And you, the super sloppy subscriber, wins the fabulous prize of being talked at.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,800
It's Nickelodeon Studios on podcast The Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:56,220
Welcome to podcast The Ride, the first world headquarters for adults who can't get over

9
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,560
being kids.

10
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,760
I'm Scott Gardner, joined by Mike Carlson.

11
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,520
Yeah, that's a club that I don't know, maybe we should all be arrested.

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
I'm not sure.

13
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
There's a pro-

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,080
There's millions though.

15
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:17,280
This is a epidemic, a different kind of epidemic within our generation, I think.

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,320
In various ways, that's the problem.

17
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,360
I don't know if it is a problem.

18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,800
We shouldn't lock all of us up.

19
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,800
I think there should be a different set of things that need to be done for the different

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,600
subsections of people in that category.

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,480
But this is the headquarters and I'm happy to be staffed there.

22
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,440
Yeah, Jason Sheridan, agree, disagree.

23
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:48,080
As comes up surprisingly often on this show, society has failed us.

24
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,960
Government failed us, religion failed us, education is a real hit and miss.

25
00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:02,960
So we need to take comfort in either buying the vintage Nickelodeon studio shirts on eBay

26
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,480
or be cost effective and head on over to T-Public where you can get perfectly good replicas

27
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,200
for a fraction of the price.

28
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,600
Wow, the leftist politics coming out hard on the Nick Studios episode.

29
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,200
I was going to say, I've bought Nickelodeon things, but I'm not thinking about how I'm

30
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,280
mad about being generationally screwed.

31
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,280
I don't like the orange.

32
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,800
We are generationally screwed.

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
I mean, that is if you...

34
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
There are facts.

35
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,240
I mean, I like tying them together.

36
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,360
It's interesting, but I would just, you know, I just like gags.

37
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,760
We take comfort in a, yeah, take, it's fun and you take comfort in more simpler times,

38
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,400
you know?

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,600
If it's philosophical things we're thinking about, or if it's more like, I kind of feel

40
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,440
like it's more that our parents were a little more coddled and didn't have to put up with,

41
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,200
like, not all, a lot of them had, didn't have to fight in a major world war.

42
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:03,320
So they coddled their children way more, kept them young, kept them like a little boy forever.

43
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,400
Maybe I'm just speaking about my own situation.

44
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,600
And he now doesn't even realize he's maybe in his mid to late 30s.

45
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,560
He doesn't know that.

46
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,560
So yes, he has to go to T-Public and purchase a replica Nickelodeon splat

47
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,160
or some replica GAC that he can buy and he can pretend that he's getting messy all over again,

48
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,440
like he did when he was a little boy.

49
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,640
I swear there is a way that it doesn't have to be dark.

50
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,720
There's a way to be fond of these things.

51
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,240
We've just gone all the way to, well, I just disagree a little bit with Jason.

52
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,760
I agree with his politics in general, but I think maybe the reason for our, you know,

53
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,240
you're taking it as dark.

54
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:52,360
I am accepting the world as it is and taking comfort in the light of, you know,

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,320
the first neck work for kids.

56
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,760
It's acceptance for, well, and our heroes have failed us, as you said, and we don't,

57
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,560
and we like, you know, what do we worship?

58
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,240
And I guess the answer is Olmec.

59
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,960
It's Olmec, the temple god.

60
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,520
That's true.

61
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,800
Our literal god.

62
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,880
He is the closest thing we have to a godlike figure, yes, who watches over and protects us.

63
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,720
Yeah, yeah.

64
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,600
He's one of the characters who lived in the magical world that we're exploring today,

65
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,160
the world of Nickelodeon Studios.

66
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,400
It's a big one.

67
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,720
It's a thing that the more that I thought about it and have meditated on in the last week,

68
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,320
I think Nickelodeon Studios is one of the things that makes

69
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,400
Universal Studios Florida perennially very 90s, very early 90s.

70
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,320
It's like a sheen that it'll never shake in a way, in a good way.

71
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,200
And I think having that initial Nickelodeon core is part of it.

72
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:58,200
And I think it's a thing, I think, like, is Universal Studios Florida, was it ever

73
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,080
really a working studio without this at the center?

74
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,440
I know parenthood filmed there or some odds and ends every once in a while.

75
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,120
But to me, I'm like, oh, this is like it's a real studio.

76
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,800
It shows that I watch.

77
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,320
It's every show that I watch is filmed at this theme park.

78
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,200
Yeah, for sure.

79
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,840
There is a documentary called The Orange Years that I watched last night,

80
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,440
and it talks about how the perfect timing of Nickelodeon was like,

81
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,760
man, we might need our own productions.

82
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,280
We might need a studio.

83
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,960
Can we get space somewhere?

84
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,480
Right when Universal Studios Florida is starting to break ground and it's just

85
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,720
the most perfect sequence of events that it ends up happening.

86
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,400
This is like when you're watching a documentary like Sound City about all the great albums

87
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,680
produced in this one studio and you see, yeah, you watch anything about Nick Studios and you go,

88
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,920
everything I liked as a kid on this one channel was here.

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,480
Like 90% of it, 90 whatever.

90
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,960
Yeah, and same two or three buildings, like mainly two.

91
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,880
They sort of used a third sometimes.

92
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,440
I don't think I was aware of how to me,

93
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,120
Nickelodeon's years might have been like 19 sound stages.

94
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,960
I don't know, but it all happened and mostly in two magical buildings.

95
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,360
It was Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory in my mind of like,

96
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,280
it doesn't even really have a form.

97
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,800
It doesn't have a physical form.

98
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:33,640
It can change shape to be whatever it needs to be when it shoots one of its shows.

99
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,200
Like that's where it was in my mind.

100
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,320
I'm sure this we'll talk about.

101
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,080
I never got to go.

102
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,520
It's another thing that haunts me to this day.

103
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,960
Oh, you never went to this at all?

104
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,460
Never.

105
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,220
Wow.

106
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,920
I haven't even looked at it in the last few years going to Orlando.

107
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,520
I won't even go over there.

108
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,720
It's kind of odd to me to even see it sort of as a shell of its former or not even a shell.

109
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,080
That's been a Blue Man group place for a number of years.

110
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,760
I won't even look at the Blue Man.

111
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,800
I can't even.

112
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,300
I can't.

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,720
They're mocking scowling faces.

114
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,920
You take them as judgment.

115
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,440
They're gone.

116
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,000
They're done.

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,880
It's over.

118
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,760
That's done.

119
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,320
That's done.

120
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,040
Boy, so this is really nothing now.

121
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,760
This is just an office building that happens to be next to our favorite theme parks.

122
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,600
Jason, did you go?

123
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,200
Did you experience this in any way?

124
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,960
Yes, I did.

125
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,800
Right in the middle of the Golden.

126
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,720
Like 91 or 92.

127
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,600
I took the tour.

128
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,080
I did not audition for a show because that was a big thing.

129
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:44,440
You could audition to be on Double Dare or what would you do or some of the ones that I forget.

130
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,840
Nick Arcade, I think, was an option.

131
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,640
Guts.

132
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,520
Later on Guts.

133
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,120
Yeah, and I took the tour.

134
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,200
My big memory of it is at the end,

135
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,080
you guys may have come across the game lab where they put everyone in bleachers and they

136
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,080
demonstrate some games and they slime a kid in a tiny little pool at the end.

137
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,440
I did come across the game lab.

138
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:06,840
Yes.

139
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,160
Yes.

140
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,760
I saw that.

141
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,160
I did not volunteer.

142
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,000
This was before I got bit by the acting bug, so I was terrified by everything.

143
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,720
Especially terrified when we went into this room,

144
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,520
which is in my memory was the size of a high school gymnasium.

145
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,880
In reality is the size of like a two bedroom apartment.

146
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,120
They said, all right, parents sit in that bleacher, kids sit in this bleacher.

147
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,680
I was like, oh my God, we got to be separated.

148
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,600
What if I can't find them?

149
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,160
What if something happened?

150
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,200
That's hitting me too.

151
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,080
It stressed me out.

152
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,200
We're right.

153
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,000
The separation.

154
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,800
It stressed me out so much.

155
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,280
I watched the clip of this and I had the thought, man, that would have stressed me out as a kid.

156
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,640
I swear to God, I would just watch a couple hours ago and I was like, oh, they separated them?

157
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,600
Oh, that would have.

158
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,880
I would not have cared for that.

159
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:07,640
And this is after the high of the tour, which was walking by a room with like very dramatic

160
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:14,680
lighting that had a snick couch in it, like a museum display, like behind glass, the big orange

161
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,400
couch.

162
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,520
And I was like, holy shit, that's the couch.

163
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:18,840
Nice.

164
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,480
Smithsonian for kids.

165
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:21,720
Yeah.

166
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:22,920
Wow.

167
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,600
This is, boy, we both, we, all of us even like, this is a little show where we will sit in a

168
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,480
separate section from our parents.

169
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,360
And this was too much.

170
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:35,560
Yeah.

171
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,160
It would have been far too much.

172
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,560
Yeah.

173
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,440
I wanted to get, I would watch what would you do.

174
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,280
And for the younger ones who might not know, a lot of these shows were

175
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,640
shows where it would be some sort of game show elements.

176
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,640
And then kids would get hit with pies, whipped cream.

177
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,000
They would get slime.

178
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
They would get like goo dumped on them.

179
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,960
They would get messy.

180
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,560
A lot of these shows were based on mess.

181
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,040
A lot of the names were based on mess.

182
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:06,600
So as a kid, I wanted to be on these shows really bad, but it did make me also very

183
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,320
uncomfortable.

184
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,080
The idea that I would have a bunch of like orange goop dumped on my head.

185
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,800
Yes.

186
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,440
I don't know.

187
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,360
Like that, that was stressful as well.

188
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,280
So it was interesting because it was both of those feelings at once as a kid.

189
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:19,880
Right.

190
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,440
Right.

191
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:20,600
Yeah.

192
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,520
You get, so you get the, you would take a tour of the studios and then get the

193
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,200
opportunity to audition potentially.

194
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,760
And I think I had the same thing where like I was sure that I would.

195
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:36,760
And then something, and then the intimidation of being in the space was like, absolutely

196
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,080
not.

197
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,960
I, I, the day came and I flop sweated and I blew.

198
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,920
I wouldn't even put myself up for the challenge.

199
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:52,360
Mike, you talk about, you said you, you like avoided the building as an adult because

200
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,720
you're upset you didn't get to go.

201
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:00,200
I remember, I think every trip I ever made to the studios and I probably got to see it

202
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,320
in person three times.

203
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,080
I think at 94 and then the 99 in 2003 when much less is going on.

204
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,080
I think still in 2003 when I'm in college and especially when I was a kid,

205
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,600
like walking up to the building made me nervous.

206
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
It was such a Shangri-La.

207
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:24,440
And like you would, I remember it's like a very undramatic view.

208
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,760
You know, you go into Disneyland and the castle, it has, you have a clear view of the

209
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,600
castle all the way down at the end of the street, at the end of main street.

210
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,560
This is the opposite.

211
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,200
You go down, it's a weird, awkward left turn.

212
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,160
I have pretty much pretty quick after you've entered Universal Studios and you don't see

213
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,200
the splat.

214
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
You don't see it like facing you.

215
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,880
Ah, there it is.

216
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,480
It's like weirdly off to the side.

217
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,560
So you approach it in this very like bad eyeline way.

218
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,840
And even that, in a way I was relieved.

219
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,000
I feel like I just like my heart would sink.

220
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,480
I need a little time here.

221
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,000
I just let me see that splat really flat from the side.

222
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,400
But I just, I have such a strong memory of like that awkward view and being like,

223
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,240
can I even walk up to it?

224
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,120
This is so, this is this, the shot of the studio is at the end of everything that I watch.

225
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,660
Yeah.

226
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,880
Will I be able to stand if I go up in front of the building?

227
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:28,360
As big to me as a child as the White House, as important a piece of architecture,

228
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,400
because it was on the end card of everything I watched, whether it was the picture,

229
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:40,200
whether it was the zooming, like a plane shot or the little doodle one where the

230
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,640
universal ball is like perfectly, or the globe is perfectly rotating in front of the Nickelodeon

231
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,000
building, which was never the, not the actual architecture in real life.

232
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,400
But I, it just loomed so large in my mind.

233
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,280
Yeah, those shots, a lot of the nostalgia is definitely from that.

234
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,080
Yeah, that the show would end, the double there would end, the guts would end.

235
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,120
Nick Arcade would end.

236
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,880
And then the little package of this program was taped before a live studio audience at

237
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,600
Nickelodeon Studios at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida.

238
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,720
This, that little thing and seeing that at the end of almost everything,

239
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:24,520
just like built up not only the, just like the legend of Nickelodeon, but Universal's Florida too.

240
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,020
Yeah.

241
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,200
Like, is this why, is this a big missing component of why I'm so

242
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,760
unstoppable into theme parks? Like, was like the idea of going to this place where there's rides

243
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,160
and stuff, but also everything you watch is made.

244
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,440
Well, sure. And it, in, in, I think the narrative of the early days of, you know,

245
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,320
sure, studios, Florida, especially very early on is everything is broken.

246
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,360
There's no background music walking around. The rides break down a lot.

247
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:01,240
Universal, Nickelodeon Studios at Universal worked. It did its job as a production facility,

248
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:08,520
and it did its job as a marketing device and drawing people down there because kids saw that

249
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,760
and heard that's where it was. And they went, mom and dad, we got to go to Universal. I gotta

250
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:18,920
see Nickelodeon Studios. Yeah. Yeah. Big time. I remember that, okay, you're describing all the,

251
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,040
the different iterations of that little end card. There's one where they draw on it and there's one

252
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:29,240
that's like a, you know, kind of a big helicopter shot. And then there's one, I even saw it on

253
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,920
YouTube awkwardly labeled as like Nickelodeon logo, the one where the kids are running,

254
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,520
which is probably also what I'd call it anyway, without that title.

255
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,760
And so, so sometimes you would see this grand shot of the studio and a big, nice lawn. I liked

256
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,840
the lawn in front of the, it was a very well-manicured lawn in front of the Nick Studios building.

257
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:55,480
And a bunch of kids are just running feverishly, pumping their arms, cause they get, they get to

258
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,760
go to the place. And I just remember always thinking like, when they get there, when they finish

259
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:06,600
going across the lawn and land at the studio, they're going to have more fun than I have ever

260
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:13,080
had or will ever have. These, these 12 children, certainly this isn't just some shot and their

261
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:19,720
extras who were hired and like, then they left after nine takes. No, no, no. They are like this,

262
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,200
they are entering heaven. They will enter the kingdom of heaven when they get to the cowhide

263
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:31,480
patterned building. Yes. I, yeah, I, I also had that thing where like, I can't even imagine

264
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:38,760
what it's like. I couldn't even, there, this must be just like you're whisked away by Ren and Stimpy

265
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:45,720
themselves or any of my favorite characters. They say, hello, nice to meet you. It's not just like a

266
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,480
facility of some kind where cameras are and it's cold in there because that's how they shoot TV

267
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:58,200
shows. Like I, yeah, I couldn't even dream of what it might, must be like, Hey, what's up? I'm looking

268
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:05,400
for a new best friend. Doug, the cartoon Doug. Yeah, I'll hang out with you. What?

269
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:13,880
No, you want to go play in the double dare nose for several hours? Anything you want, Doug?

270
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,800
Doug, Michael hop in the car. Doug creator, Jim Jenkins. What are you doing here?

271
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,680
An adult man who very clearly is the basis for Doug.

272
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,840
Jim Jenkins is going to push us down the pie slide all day.

273
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:39,000
Hey, yeah, looking back though, cause I, this is exactly the energy I'm coming into this with,

274
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,520
like a mit, like watching it and imagining. And when I am there, if I'm even close to there,

275
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:49,320
then I'll finally be happy. What were we thinking? Like what is, there's, yes.

276
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,600
Ultimately, what was there that even made us do this?

277
00:16:52,600 --> 00:17:00,280
Well, the cards, the production, the, the branding of Nickelodeon and like the commercials,

278
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:07,720
the little animated in betweens, the splat, the, all the different logos, like the, the Pantone

279
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:15,320
zero two one orange, which is the official color, the official Nickelodeon orange color.

280
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,160
That was so good. And I, I did find out watching this documentary that like, yeah,

281
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,880
they talk to kids a lot. Like they really interviewed kids. Like, what is it like to be a

282
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:33,080
kid? What do you want? And, you know, what do you guys want? And, and that is where a lot of the

283
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,200
vibe came on. I feel a lot of the early Nickelodeon when they didn't have a lot of budget was vibe.

284
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:45,400
And we were texting the other night, like, did we want this much like repurposed Canadian content?

285
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:52,440
And I also learned that the reason there was so much like repurposed, like Japanese cartoons and

286
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:58,440
Canadian content is syndicators would not sell them anything. Like a Sint, like a big syndication

287
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:05,160
person literally told a VP, like, I'm never going to sell you a show ever because so much money was

288
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:12,360
still in the broadcast field, like in, in like broadcast syndication. And then cable was just,

289
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,600
yeah, a rocket ship. But then like once double their hit that put Nickelodeon on the map. And

290
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:25,640
then they started doing smaller scripted stuff. Salute your shorts and hey dude, and then eventually

291
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:31,800
get into original cartoons. And it's just kind of like a stepping stone. It just gets bigger and

292
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:37,800
bigger. Yeah. I feel like it's what you're saying. It's the aesthetic of like orange and it's outside

293
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:44,680
of the building is so fun to be like for a kid to see. And then most of the shows at least leading

294
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:50,360
up to when they had the Nicktoons, Doug Rugrats and Stimpy, which are all good. We all liked those

295
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:58,440
was most of the shows involved kids running around screaming. They would like wild and crazy kids

296
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:05,960
because running around and screaming kids were screaming in the audience at, at double dare.

297
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,080
It was a lot of like, I don't know, it was just like a fantasy as a kid to just be like,

298
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:15,160
I want to get out there and I want to yell and I'm going to do that for a long time and I want to

299
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,080
make a mess. I'm just like, it's like a frustration. Maybe like as you're a little and you have all

300
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,400
this, you're starting to get all this energy. You were watching just like you were watching,

301
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,640
what would you even say? Like you were aspiring to do that. You were aspiring to go wild.

302
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:36,120
Yeah. Wild and crazy kids. The only place I go where there's only kids is school and we have to

303
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,920
sit and be quiet. Exactly. Unless you're on the playground, but that doesn't quite the

304
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,160
playground doesn't look cool. It doesn't look cool like these places there's, and then there's

305
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,240
Chuck E cheese and there's discovery zone and stuff, but there's, I don't know, even those

306
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:55,160
leave you cold in a way. Yeah. You, if you yell and run around Chuck E cheese, somebody at adult

307
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:00,840
does say like, don't do that. I mean, or a teenager is supposed to tell you to do that, to not do that.

308
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:08,680
But yeah, Nickelodeon was just like back to back programs where kids were screaming and making a

309
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:15,400
mess and it would look nice. It looked like a nice break from your life. Yeah. That was a big

310
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,640
thing early on. They're like, yeah, it's kind of hard to be a kid. It does kind of suck.

311
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:26,680
Looking back, some of the marketing went too far of like the most, the opening day broadcast starts

312
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:33,000
with like the most oppressed group in history, kids. And it's like, Oh, I don't know about all

313
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,520
that. I don't know. Maybe you're swinging too far in that direction. Yeah. Yeah.

314
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:46,040
I wouldn't say that today, but, but it's, that's what it was all. It primed us with a very important

315
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:53,720
lesson, which is to hate adults. Adults are bad and they want you to not be yelling and adults,

316
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,760
you know, all right, your mom and dad are in front of you and you know what they look like,

317
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:07,720
but every other adult you're ever going to meet has, has like a far side hair, big like horn rim

318
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,560
glasses. Yeah. And they're always looking at you from a perspective where it looks like fish eye

319
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:19,720
and they bulge once they get in your face, cause they have to lean down and scold and nag you with

320
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:28,200
a finger. So you're going to meet a lot of gross lunch ladies in your life with big warts. So fear

321
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:37,000
and distrust adults, when possible, spray them with liquids and goo and get them out of your face.

322
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:43,720
But don't, don't put yourself in danger. And also like all adults are either one of our two types of

323
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,520
stage managers. They're either like Harvey from double dare and he's kind of like a cool square

324
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:55,880
dad, or it's like this maniac from, you can't do that on television. Who's just like, I guess it's

325
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:01,720
just before, you know, the phrase going postal catches on, but like the, the, you can't do that

326
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:08,200
on TV guys. Seemed like he was about to kill someone at all times. Ross shouldn't have had

327
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,280
that job. No, his job is to organize the show. A stage manager puts people where they need to be

328
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:21,400
for the tapings and the shootings. So his entire lot in life is to tell kids to go be on these

329
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:28,040
points and do what he says. Wrong line of work Ross. Yeah. Ross really big mistake. Whoever hired

330
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:33,400
Ross. I feel like, I feel like you just hit on exactly what is stunted a generation. Also was

331
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:39,560
helped a stunted generation is Nickelodeon successfully made us feel, man, adults are awful.

332
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:46,520
They are awful. They get in your face with their weird lens, faith, their lens heads, their bulbs,

333
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:53,240
their fish, I heads. Uh, and you do not want to be them because they just nag and they tell you not

334
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,680
to do things. Don't do that. Be like, they dress like it's the fifties. It's not the fifties. Stop

335
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,760
dressing like it's the fifties. And when you go to bed, they watch boring Nick at night with

336
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:09,000
Dobie Gillis. Yeah. Lassie. Well, sometimes they showed Lassie during the day. I guess Lassie falls

337
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,920
on either side of the line. Dobie Gillis though. Boring. Yes. Boring. Yes. I not like Dobie Gillis

338
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:21,240
as a kid. No, no. Ozzie and Harriet. No, no. So they, you know, even Nick at night, I feel like,

339
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,480
were they even intending to draw that connection that like all the mean adults are, it's their

340
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,680
like from the fifties. And then we, like the only other culture I know of is like, I just assumed

341
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:40,120
all parents like wait for us to be gone for the day so they can just mainline old shows on Nick

342
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,480
at night for four hours. Yeah. To watch Donna Reed all night. Oh, there's one. Yeah. Is Donna

343
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,840
Reed the one where it's triplets? Is it the triplet show? Does Donna read of triplets? I don't think.

344
00:23:50,840 --> 00:24:00,200
There's one where a girl plays her own sisters. Not the Patty Duke show? Maybe that's Patty Duke

345
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,400
show. Yeah. Yeah. They're cousins. They're identical cousins. Cousins. That's in the theme.

346
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:12,360
I never bothered to look it up. Boring. It's what the lunch ladies watch. My mom with her big

347
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:19,720
red perm and her necklace, she would say, you're watching Dobie Gillis and Patty Duke and Donna

348
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,840
Reed and you're learning lessons from these. And she would say she would point at me and her head

349
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:31,240
was like kind of fish eye lens. And that's how I know this stuff is because I had that experience.

350
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,680
Yeah. You want some fun. Lawrence Welk has a bubble machine. That's pretty, pretty out there.

351
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,640
You know, the difference though, is that you were saying that to your mother.

352
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:48,040
That's true. I look, this is a podcast. We all love Nick at night too. I mean,

353
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:53,320
of course we're doing some jokes. We're doing some jokes here. Doing some jokes. And a lot of what

354
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,600
you're mentioning are blank spots for me because they were not on Nick at night. Hogan's heroes

355
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,560
and Dobie Gillis and like that. Dobie Gillis was on Nick at night. Was it? I never thought Dobie

356
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:09,400
Gillis and Patty Duke show all on Nick at night. But I will say three shows that did not connect

357
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:15,480
with me. I like Dick Faddyke. I like, I love Lucy. I liked Get Smart. I liked all that stuff, but I

358
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,960
did not connect with the other ones as much. I really like the stuff that would play both,

359
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:25,960
like classic Looney Tunes or Rockin' Bullwinkle. When they got the Rockin' Bullwinkle rights and

360
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:31,320
they would like dump it on either Nick at night, I was like, yes, any hour of the day, please.

361
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:38,120
Yeah. That stuff was fun too. But hate adults. This is a place to hate adults. This is where the war

362
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:44,920
might begin. And that maybe it's worth talking a little about the Nick Studios opening day

363
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:51,000
special, which Jason alluded to. There's a three hour, three hours. Three hours. You can watch

364
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,400
on YouTube. I remember finding this in the past and the video said first hour only. And I said,

365
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:03,480
fuck you. Why would you do this to me? I loved this special growing up so much. I think they

366
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:12,600
reran it a lot and I watched it anytime it was on. To me, this was like a, like that's an earned

367
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:20,520
three hour. That's like Magnolia. Every minute counts. And the scope of the story,

368
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:29,160
I remember thinking like similar to Ernest Goes to Splash Mountain, which I have described as

369
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:37,480
feeling like a terrifying Cronenberg ordeal because Ernest gets zapped a little bit in it

370
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:44,680
or turns into a skeleton. Similarly, the push and pull between the live opening special with lots of

371
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:50,680
bands that I've never heard of and Mark Summers and Brad and Melody from Hey Dude in character,

372
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:57,960
the fun that they're having over there mixed with the villainous presence of awful, the adults who

373
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:04,360
find fun unbearably loathsome. The live broadcast keeps getting interrupted, pirate radioed with

374
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:11,240
static by this awful group of evil adults. And I just bought this hook line and sinker. This was

375
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:20,120
like, I mean, as scary as if anybody's scared by the jokers interrupting things or like the tapes

376
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:27,080
that he makes, Anthony Michael Hall, the news anchor Reed, I was so terrified by awful,

377
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:33,320
which now you watch and it's just the like broadest Groundlings rejects actors you've ever seen.

378
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,640
But this was like an epic film to me. Yeah.

379
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:43,880
Yes. I don't have a good memory of watching this at the time. I don't know. It's hard because so

380
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,040
much of it is familiar, but I don't think I did. I don't want to say I watched this because I don't

381
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,720
think I don't have a strong memory about it. But going back through it, yeah, that as I've said

382
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,400
before on the coming out of Rochelle's episode and that was live obviously, but like Shredder,

383
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:04,440
he's obviously, he looks, he looks scary to a kid, but Shredder is very silly in that. And I was just

384
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,560
terrified that this man would take away our fun. And I'm sure I would have felt the same way about

385
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:14,200
these adults in this video where I would just be like, Oh, I cannot believe what they're trying to

386
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,560
do here. These are the, these are the scariest people I've ever seen. Yeah.

387
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,640
These twisted bastards. Yeah.

388
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,160
Must be stopped at all costs. Sickos.

389
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:32,280
Because the, the not nothing beyond the first hour had been on YouTube until recently. I just,

390
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:37,960
I just remember the, whatever the end of it looming large, similar to, to like Boyd,

391
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,320
I think Earth's Coast is Splash Mountain was the scariest thing I'd ever seen. And then I watched

392
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:48,440
it like that was it was like 10 seconds that I, my kid brain just fuzzed into oblivion. I, I just,

393
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,600
and I announced to Aaron when we rewatching it, like whatever this end is, let me just declare

394
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:57,480
that I thought that specifically the ending was like the scariest thing I've ever seen.

395
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:02,840
I don't know if you guys watched the special and know what the ending was. I don't know. What is

396
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:08,680
the, yeah, what is the end? I ended up watching like multiple perfect gentlemen performances,

397
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:14,760
but I don't think I gentlemen are good. I love those suits and they're great singers.

398
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:20,840
Perfect gentlemen. Yeah. A lot of time is seeded to the performance from this kind of like sub new

399
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:28,440
edition in polka dot bright color polka dot suits. They kind of, it's sort of Dick Tracy villain-esque

400
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,800
and you wonder who are perfect gentlemen. And it is, they are, one of them is the kid of Marie Star,

401
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:39,880
the mastermind of new edition and new kids on the block. So he was attempting to do this with his own

402
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:46,120
kid. Okay. So not great success seemingly being that I only know them from dancing in front of

403
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:52,520
the double dare set in this one thing. Yeah. Anyway, perfect gentlemen. But you get past all

404
00:29:52,520 --> 00:30:02,680
that. You get to the end. The end is like they have to like tap into a slime valve to stop the

405
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:07,320
adults of awful who are trying to stop Nick Studios from ever opening because they're like,

406
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,600
if they're, there cannot be a world headquarters for kids. If this place opens, we awful are screwed.

407
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:22,520
So they're in a, in a live acted out segment, Mark Summers, other kids who I've never seen on any show,

408
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:30,280
but I don't know who they are. And then like a contest winner are all just fake shaking around

409
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,560
as if there's some, you know, earthquake or turbulent kind of situation in the building.

410
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:41,960
So they're like bopping around like a bad play. The camera's shaking around all fake. Then the

411
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:49,560
contest winner misses a cue, turning a big dial that makes slime release into the room that off

412
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:56,760
the pre-taped room that awful is in. And then like, you know, uh, like a, a two liter soda bottle

413
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:04,280
worth of slime unleashes at their feet. And they're like curses. You foiled it. Oh, your studio.

414
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:11,240
We'll be watching you. Um, it is the most nothing of nothings. There's clearly a cue missed and Mark

415
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:17,080
Summers is silent for a while and trying to fill space because something didn't happen that he

416
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:23,240
wanted to have that needed to happen. Um, no idea why I found this. So in your mind, it was like a

417
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,040
snuff film of some kind at the end or the actually everything you say about hellraiser. Yeah. I thought

418
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:33,080
there might've been like the actual death in it. They're like, it was going to cut to like a, you

419
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:38,760
know, like that creepy Fox corpse getting eaten by the maggots. It was going to be something as

420
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:44,200
disturbing as that. And then it cuts to Mark Summers bopping around. Whoa. This is how they

421
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:52,840
killed Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the spies. He flooded the room with slime. Um, I was just going

422
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:59,000
to say, why is aesthetic for scary adult like Roz from monsters, ink with those glasses? It's

423
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,240
like an older stern lady with those like fifties glasses. What, what is the origin of that being

424
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:11,080
like a mean adult? You know what I'm saying? There's gotta be a specific, who started it?

425
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,920
I'm not sure. Like those are the light famous librarian, like who was mean and wore those

426
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,320
glasses. Like those, I don't know. It's just interesting that that's lasted for so long

427
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:28,280
and you still see it as like a trope of like kind of a stern older lady. I think sitcom character

428
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:35,080
Hazel look like. What were you going to say, Jason? Well, I think like, uh, like a lot of stuff,

429
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:43,080
I think it was like one or two TV writers had a teacher like that and use that as a template

430
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:50,200
for a character. Just like, did, did every TV writer have bad luck like with, with, you know,

431
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:55,240
boys and girls or girls they liked, or is that just the sort of person that is attracted to

432
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:03,640
making television? Like, perhaps Hazel did not have the glass. Hazel did not. But maybe there's

433
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:08,840
something else. There's, yeah, there's, there's, it's, it's gotta come from one place. And if we

434
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:17,240
knew it. So if you know where like scary horn rim glasses, dowdy adults came from listener,

435
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:23,960
if you can direct us to why the stereotype, uh, still maintains in a way, please let us know.

436
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:30,280
Yes. It's or that was just a style of educating teachers. Like, okay, you can be a strict,

437
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:34,280
like you're either going to be a strict teacher or fun teacher. We can't have too many of both.

438
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,600
We can't have too many strict teachers or the kids fucking check out. We can't have too many

439
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:44,680
fun teachers or nothing gets done. You gotta have a balance. Pick your lane. Yeah. Yeah. Um, the, um,

440
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,120
in general, this Nickelodeon opening day special, and by the way, I think it's really insane that

441
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:57,560
this entire thing is going on while universal studios, Florida entirely is opening and having

442
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:02,360
all of the problems that it's happened lately. Like that's one of the more notorious bad opening

443
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:09,240
days because so many of the big attractions broke. And then also you got Mark Summers going live

444
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:16,760
with the Hey Dude cast and, uh, acting out all these weird little scenes. Jane Seymour pops by

445
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:24,920
at some point. Yeah. Very odd celebrity assortment. Uh, Linda Blair, Linda Blair. She's in a, uh,

446
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:32,360
remote. We also need to, a key to this is said very early in the broadcast, right at the top.

447
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:39,320
He's Mark Summers says this is the first ever live broadcast Nickelodeon live broadcast.

448
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:45,480
And you can 11 years in 11 years. And you can tell because a number of times they have people

449
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,840
on camera and they have not turned off the channel with the warmup guy is like, all right,

450
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:56,520
now everyone's sheer, like you're hearing two different parts of the room at once and you

451
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,840
should not be. And it's like overshadowing the guy who played super boy that the girls

452
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,920
either have a crush on or they're pretending they have a crush on.

453
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:10,680
Yes. Super boy. Yeah. There's so much like they're just filming a live broadcast in a big party and

454
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:16,440
you're always hearing the party. It's never not present. Um, so like there's an interview,

455
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,320
Steven Spielberg is there. There's an interview with Spielberg and there's a bunch of like noise

456
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:27,800
interrupting him. He seems distracted. Um, and Spielberg, I didn't, I didn't know this part of

457
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:33,400
it at all. Um, that Spielberg gets slimed. We have to watch Steven Spielberg gets slimed. Very cool.

458
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:39,560
Yeah. Fun. Uh, he and Mark Summers, what a crazy seeing these guys together.

459
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:46,280
Spielberg, two legends meet at Spielberg plays along to, he's into like a construction hat,

460
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,320
construction helmet and like poncho. And he goes like, I don't trust you and I don't trust your

461
00:35:51,320 --> 00:36:00,280
network. Like he, um, he also makes sure to tell Mark summer that he, uh, doesn't picking a favorite

462
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:05,160
movie is like picking a favorite child, but making empire of the sun was a great experience.

463
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:13,880
It's, I guess he did pick, um, let me show you another crazy one. This is, uh, when I did a deep

464
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,520
dive on a, a Facebook group with a lot of good photos that I think is called Nickelodeon studios,

465
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:24,440
past, present and future. Um, this is, this is a little crazy to see. Um, here's a shot from

466
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:30,280
outside Nickelodeon studios, I believe on that very day. And, uh, who do we have here? Oh,

467
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:37,960
the man himself Lucas, George Lucas at Nickelodeon studios. I had no idea this occurred. I don't

468
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,920
know what he's doing. He's maybe just like popping by to see a little, a little shoot happen, but,

469
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:49,320
um, that's, that's a, that's a wild like combat. Like these, those things don't go together for me,

470
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:54,440
the Nickelodeon splat and George Lucas, those are different universes. So crazy seeing them collide.

471
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,080
That is wild. Was he down there? Yeah. For to see Spielberg as Spielberg obviously was,

472
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,960
this was involved pretty heavily with universal studios. So it would make sense that either he

473
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,920
was down there for some other reason and they got him or just making an appearance to help boost the

474
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:14,120
place or whatever. But yeah, George is George's along for the ride. The cab, who knows the source

475
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:18,520
of the caption. The captions seem to imply that he was there with Spielberg, but I hadn't thought

476
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:24,120
about that either that he's so on the Disney side of the line. So seeing him at universal studios is

477
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:29,480
kind of strange too. Yeah, he didn't do it. George didn't produce like super sloppy double dare or

478
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:37,000
something. Did he? Do we don't know? I want to make it, can we make it sloppier? Um, that I don't want

479
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,240
to get on this tangent because this is its own thing, but, um, for the, for the second time in

480
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:46,440
a little bit, let me name check, uh, fellow forever dog podcast, double threat, uh, which played a

481
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:52,040
clip. I sent you guys this of the show of a, uh, not Nickelodeon studios, but a different shot at

482
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:58,600
universal Florida game show called, let me, it's the clunkiest name of all time. Let me see if I

483
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:07,000
get it. Secrets of the crypt keepers haunted house. The game show is a game show, but it's called

484
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,920
secrets. Like so clearly a legends of the hidden temple stand in weirdest cheapest thing ever. I

485
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:18,920
was so delighted by this, never knew this existed. It's a, it's a tales from the crypt game show.

486
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:23,000
And because of the tales of the Crip connection and the Crip keepers in it, they have to give

487
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:31,720
producing credits to all of the, the producers of the show, which include, uh, Robert Zemeckis and,

488
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:41,240
who's the Richard Donner. It's the crappiest, like worst 96 CGI you've ever seen. And just like,

489
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:46,120
it's for bad kids and they have attitude and they're like, screw you dude. And then you see a big

490
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:52,280
Zemeckis Richard Donner shared credit on this syndicated crap is amazing.

491
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,680
And that's, that was the Nickelodeon difference. You could tell they were just a little loose.

492
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:03,320
They were a little like wilder, a little less like buttoned up about stuff. You know, obviously

493
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:09,720
it's it's Nickelodeon stuff is made by, you know, uh, development people and marketing people too,

494
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,240
but it, it just felt like they were having more fun, you know?

495
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:20,360
Yeah, it seemed like a real like, um, you know, like let's actually have fun in this new space

496
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:25,000
and not like focus group this stuff into oblivion focus group it in the right way,

497
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,800
like find out what kids want, but then not like note things within an inch of their life.

498
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:35,320
I think the vibe too was that like once they greenlit something, they were very hands off.

499
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:40,840
They just let the people making it make it. So yeah, it wasn't like, um, you know,

500
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,280
chaperone to death. There wasn't a lot of people looking over your shoulder.

501
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,960
It was like, yeah, the, like the seventies filmmaker revolution was Scorsese and, uh,

502
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,360
Altman. It was like that. But for kids TV in the nineties, it was like, you know,

503
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:59,400
the auteurs could really go and do their thing. Get to get the kids sloppy in any, which way they

504
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:08,760
wanted slime, Gac pies, pie coasters, pie throwers. The law. Yeah. Your imagination was the limit in

505
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,880
the nineties where how messy you could get kids. I really want it real quick. Uh, I was zooming

506
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,560
through this thing, uh, and I noticed that they have all the commercials on this thing too,

507
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,760
which is great, which is obviously we could do an episode on each commercial. Yes. Kid quiz. Do

508
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:30,840
you remember kid cuisine? I, a real treat. I was not allowed to have kid cuisine. I tried and I

509
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:35,480
tried, but I was not allowed to have it. My mom thought it was junk. I'm sure she was correct,

510
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:43,080
but man, that food in that commercial looks like shit. Of course they say is pizza. If they didn't

511
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:48,600
say it out loud, this is pizza. I wouldn't recognize it. And Erin and I were both recoiling

512
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:53,880
while watching that ad. And then she said, I definitely specifically recall throwing up

513
00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:00,440
because of kid cuisine definitely happened. Uh huh. Uh, and I quit real quick and I, I don't know

514
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:06,200
the name of that. Like there's a bear chef on the, on the image. I don't know his name. I only

515
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,680
briefly took a look. There is a character that's now the kid cuisine still exists.

516
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,240
And he has a kid, there's a new mascot and his name is Casey

517
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:23,000
and he's like a cool duck with a jacket that says Casey. And he's like, he's like a real like slick

518
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:30,120
kind of guy. He's kind of like, Oh yeah, maybe he's a pet. Or is he a black duck, like Daffy?

519
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:35,400
I think he could, I think he's a duck, but I guess you're right. It could be a penguin as well. Does

520
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:43,240
it say frozen? It's frozen food. So it's probably a penguin. Yeah. Um, but it says, what do you,

521
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,400
what do you love? And he says, keeping the fun going by giving kids their favorite foods and

522
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:53,800
real meals that are still really fun and getting the last laugh when I can. Now that's suspicious.

523
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:59,560
I agree it is. So then they say, Hey, what do you dislike? And he says, just like any other kid,

524
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:06,120
I don't like for the fun to stop even at meal time. Uh, and then how would you think,

525
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,080
I'm just going to do the last, but yeah, sorry. How would you describe your personality? He says,

526
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:16,280
playful and curious. That's because I wear a lot of hats. You can tell if you look at me,

527
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:23,240
look at all my different meal boxes. A man's gotta have a code. And sometimes that means

528
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,640
watching someone's soul leave their body because of violence he did to them. Rock and roll.

529
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:35,880
Yeah. The best question though, I feel is the question. What's your full name? And Casey says

530
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:44,280
kid cuisine is it's not just the abstract idea of cuisine for kids. His name is kid.

531
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:50,280
Was it like name is kid quick or something? Right. It's a, it's a final evolution of that

532
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,960
theory of like picks up every Pixar thing is like, you are your job.

533
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:01,560
Casey is kid cuisine. Um, and he is, he is being literal with his hats. He wears a,

534
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,800
like an uncle Sam top hat for his all American chicken breast nuggets.

535
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:12,120
And, uh, he's wearing, what is he wearing in this? Uh, what's that? What are we looking?

536
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:17,560
I recognize the mac and cheese. What's next to the mac and cheese? Is it a roll? Is that a big

537
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:23,960
roll? This thing you're guessing? It's Casey's strawberry cake. Oh, it looks awful. Oh man.

538
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:31,080
Never changed. Uh, gross today as ever. Pop star popcorn chicken.

539
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:38,680
There's that cake again. And the strawberry Casey's strawberry roll. That's like insulation.

540
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:44,360
That's foam. It looks like if I squinted, you'd go, is that someone's tongue that was cut out of

541
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:52,280
their mouth? Scott, if you ever let us babysit your child, we're going to feed them garbage.

542
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:58,760
So we have a reason to sample the garbage. Hey, here's your kid cuisine. And for me,

543
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,200
another kid cuisine, the same one you are eating.

544
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:10,520
You just gave him mini corn dogs and strawberry cake. Yeah. Two food groups, two major food groups.

545
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:17,960
Not fruit. Uh, yeah. And you'll, you're, uh, he'll, he'll be, uh, coloring kid cuisine coloring pages

546
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:25,240
that let the parents know that this is advertising. It's a fun coloring page that we're looking at.

547
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:31,240
And at the top and smaller font, it says, Hey parents, this is advertising from kid cuisine.

548
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:36,040
Yeah. So I think there's more kid cuisine to look into, but I just, I got a little,

549
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:40,920
I got a little taste here and I felt like we'll go back and see which, what the names later of the

550
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:46,520
old characters. And I was obsessed with it. I just, it was such a strong memory of like being like,

551
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:53,240
mom, please, please. And she's like, that's bad. That's food is bad. We can't get that.

552
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,080
You're right. You made my, made my future wife sick.

553
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:03,720
Our parents had to lay down some boundaries. Mine was we did not get Dunkaroos. I don't know why.

554
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,040
Other kids got Dunkaroos and I just kind of, and I would have it sometimes at friends house,

555
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,280
but I was like, you know, we don't do that. And I think my mom was just like, ah, they're too

556
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:18,120
expensive, which probably means like it was, you know, uh, $3 a box instead of a dollar 50,

557
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,920
like little Debbie's, they practically pay you to take it away. But hostess,

558
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:29,240
I think has a couple actual ingredients, not a lot, but hostess was always more money,

559
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,960
but little Debbie's is always dirt cheap, you know?

560
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,920
And you were a little Debbie family. We were a little Debbie family back East too. There's a

561
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:43,080
lot more variety in Debbie single serve Debbie content. Like I think my school made a small

562
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:48,120
fortune on selling single serve little Debbie packages. I hate to bring us right back in the

563
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,360
Kid Cuisine territory, but take a look at this real quick. Take a look. It's an advertising break.

564
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:56,760
This is a commercial break. Oh, no, no, no.

565
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:06,920
Kid Cuisine Shrek shaped fun nuggets. Turn your tongue green with Shrek shaped fun nuggets.

566
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:13,080
Shrek shaped fun nuggets. Wait, and look what turns your tongue green. Swamp pudding.

567
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:21,000
It's not even spinach. It's that's the dessert. It's green dessert.

568
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,560
Shrek nuggets are, oh, they are Shrek shaped. They have little ears like him.

569
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:32,920
I genuinely, this does not happen to me. I feel a little nauseous and it's less looking at the food

570
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:39,800
and more the words. I think Shrek shaped. I'm like, I think I'm gurgling up a little Shrek shaped

571
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,680
fun nuggets and swamp pudding are really doing a number on me. Okay. Let me say to the listener

572
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:50,440
out there, a quick little assignment. If you're with somebody in your apartment or house or

573
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,920
something, turn to them. And if they're listening or not, it doesn't matter. And say, I'm going to

574
00:46:54,920 --> 00:47:00,760
say a phrase to you and I want you to react to it in real time and know that the phrase is something

575
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:08,040
that existed in real life. And then say Shrek shaped fun nuggets and see what the reaction is.

576
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:12,920
And then we'll tweet about it and you can tweet at us what this person's reaction was to Shrek

577
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:22,520
shaped fun nuggets. I like this is this is a trigger. This is like, I, this is as if I went

578
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:29,320
to see a hypnotist show 15 years ago and the secret word. And then when you hear Shrek shaped

579
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:37,640
fun nuggets, you will vomit on command. It'll be nauseous for an entire day. You are a Manchurian

580
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:43,000
candidate now. You have been, you are now the winter soldier. You've been, you've been activated.

581
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,960
I have to go puke on Biden now.

582
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:55,800
You meet your cohorts and you say, I saw her face and they say, I'm a believer.

583
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,040
I thought love was only true in fairy tales.

584
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:09,880
This is wow. Awful. Anyway, all right. I got Kim Possible's involved. Yeah,

585
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:16,120
I got to get out of here. And yeah, I'm, I know for me to be able to speak anymore. What are those?

586
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:22,040
What's that black stuff? What's it? It's next to Chewbacca. Is that like a,

587
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:25,560
those are like little crispies that look like Darth Vader's helmet. Oh my God. Some weird

588
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:31,080
YouTube video with a man and a weird mask popped up. It's a scary puppet, like the old Genesis

589
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:37,160
video. And it's an ASMR video somehow, but it's with little crackers that look like Darth Vader's

590
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:43,640
helmet. This is the darkest territory we've been in in a while. Wow. This is, yeah, there's a really

591
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:48,360
kid cuisine here. Can you read? I'm trying to read what it is. No, it's pretty pixelated.

592
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:52,440
BBA and R2D2 shaped breaded white meat.

593
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:00,680
No. Chicken. Wait, hold on. I'm going to take the microphone off the stand here.

594
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:08,360
Uh, chicken patties with rib meat, corn pasta and cheese sauce and battle cookies.

595
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,200
Oh, it's like little death stars. Yeah, they're battle cookies. Battle cookies.

596
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:21,960
Oh, I genuinely, I, this has to be off the screen. This has to, I have to hide the zoom window soon.

597
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:28,360
Okay. All right. I'll stop sharing here. Uh, man. This is going to unleash some madness.

598
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:35,880
We're now to like keep trolling me. The listeners will like film themselves happily eating kid

599
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:43,880
cuisine and swamp pudding and battle cookies while their insides just rot. I want the next live show.

600
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,120
Every listener brings got some swamp pudding.

601
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:54,360
I, what I fear when we're back recording in person, we're making a little, a little

602
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:59,480
tasting board of kid cuisine for us to enjoy. Oh, damn it. Let's stay on zoom.

603
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,160
Oh yeah. We got to do kid cuisine as soon as we're back in person.

604
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:11,000
Country bears off. Kid cuisine on. Kid cuisine on. Wait, Scott's going to be mainlining the

605
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,200
sleepy time tea supplies. He's going to be mainlining the tea to try and settle his stomach.

606
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:23,720
I am not, I'm not having one lick of any of this. The challenge is for me to be able to look at it

607
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:29,400
in front of my actual eyes. That's what I, if I could survive that, that's the challenge.

608
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,880
Eating is off the table. Oh, I just scrolled. I just scrolled again through the kid cuisine

609
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:38,200
and I saw the pizza and I went, like I went, I felt it. I felt what you're talking about. I'm like,

610
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:44,360
it's just, I don't, if this is going to be prepared, it's not going to be in my microwave.

611
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:49,320
This needs to be, this needs to, if we're, if we're doing it in my place, this has to have an off site

612
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,160
is that you need to find an industrial kitchen that will prepare it.

613
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,720
Ghost kitchen. We, the podcast, the ride goes kitchen.

614
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:06,120
Oh man. Okay. Okay. All right. Let's get, let's commercial break over, disgusting commercial

615
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,960
break over. I have, we will get off of this opening ceremony. I have one more thing to say about it

616
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:16,120
that I really like, which is there is a continuing presence in it from a young Will Friedel,

617
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,920
Will Friedel later from boy meets world who is I think really, really funny. He's the older brother

618
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:28,840
on that show. You see him as a kid. He, he does a, he does a rap song that's about editing and

619
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:34,040
graphics and like old analog editing equipment that isn't used anymore. I think they played this on

620
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:41,080
the tour, Will Friedel rapping. He's charming throughout, but there is this part, I don't know

621
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:50,440
if you guys found this where a, he talks to some skaters from the about to premiere Nick show

622
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:56,360
skate TV. So there's a couple of skaters and they're going to do tricks around, around universal

623
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:01,800
studios in the Hollywood Boulevard area. And Will Friedel is a little like, I think he reminds me of

624
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,200
little me because he's got big cheeks and brown hair and he's just got like an upbeat attitude.

625
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:11,160
So I see myself in it. Like, this seems like a sweet, nice kid. And then he's with these taller,

626
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:17,320
jerkier, older skaters and he's trying to be nice to him and ask him questions about skating.

627
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:23,400
And he says, uh, well, where do you guys skate pretty much? And they're like, you know, ramps and

628
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,160
pools. They're giving him nothing. And then he's like, oh, pools. Is that pretty tough to skate on,

629
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:31,880
you know, with the water? And then one of the skaters says, no, we do it empty idiot.

630
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:39,240
And they use this, they use it on the scene, the special and it's real. It for sure is

631
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:47,400
the 16 year old Jackass calling the host of the show an idiot. It really broke my art for young

632
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,720
Wilfredo. I mean, I'm glad they left it in. They wouldn't do that today, but,

633
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:56,520
but it's all skate TV jerks. How dare you.

634
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:02,920
That old TV thing where like they didn't make sure everything was good or like,

635
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:08,120
like I've, I've talked about it on old tonight show clips where it's just like,

636
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:13,400
no one had, no one was editing this. They were like, yep, great. Put it on TV. We, we shot it,

637
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:19,480
go for it. You know, what's funny is you talk about old tonight show clips and the sloppiness

638
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:24,920
of old tonight show. And you think of people like Burt Reynolds being drunk or just, uh, you know,

639
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:32,200
not together on the Carson tonight show. And then a rare moment that was like this in the later era

640
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:40,040
on Jay Leno was the Burt Reynolds, Mark Summers feud. Yes. One of the only major memories I feel

641
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:45,240
of the Leno tonight show. I don't remember how it escalate where they, where they just like,

642
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:51,400
kind of like zinging each other and then it went too far and Burt was actually mad and, uh,

643
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:56,920
and then it culminates in some sort of like they turn their backs, take a couple of steps and do a,

644
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:02,040
do a duel with pies. Am I, you guys know this clip? I have seen this clip. I'm trying to remember

645
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:07,480
how it starts. Mark is like very passive aggressive toward Burt, but Burt probably said something

646
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:14,120
jerky to start Mark off on that track. So they're going back and forth and then Mark like splash,

647
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:19,800
or no Burt splashes. I forget who splashes like water first on them. Yeah. Yeah. Uh,

648
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:25,080
very Andy Kaufman esque. It's kind of for something in like 95, 96, you're like, this is pretty

649
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:33,000
old school feeling. So I commend Mark Summers for engaging in this talk show. Yeah. The danger,

650
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,680
the danger of it. Uh, yes, you don't feel that any, like it wouldn't air if that happened on

651
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:42,680
Jimmy Fallon and it wouldn't happen on Jimmy Fallon cause everything's like planned out very

652
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:47,640
specifically. I'm of course talking about when I say like, when I'm talking about like nothing was

653
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:53,480
planned or it was boring or a little more raw. I'm talking about a interview I just watched two

654
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:59,160
nights ago where Richard Dawson was a guest host in the tonight show with William Shatner on,

655
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:05,240
and they were boring the shit out of everyone. Just nothing, no interesting thing to say.

656
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:11,640
Yeah. You forget the golden age of TV. A lot of it is spliced together in montages or best

657
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:18,040
if you watch, like there's a bunch of Johnny Carson stuff on Tubi and, um, there's a lot of

658
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:24,120
audience silence during some of those monologue, like the monologue is very lazy, like barely got,

659
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:30,840
got those jokes out, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah, no, I, we, we start to think that,

660
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:36,280
like that thing where the guy throws the tomahawk and it lands in the, uh, there's a little shape

661
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:40,920
of the body and it lands at the crotch. Yeah. Like that's an old famous Carson clip. Like we

662
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:48,520
think that happened like over and over and over again. There were 40 crotch tomahawks per episode.

663
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:54,600
But in fact, that was the one good thing that happened in 10 years. Right. Yeah. He's the king

664
00:55:54,600 --> 00:56:02,280
of TV though. Let me say, well, okay, you talk kings of TV. My childhood affection for Mark Summers

665
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:09,880
was so strong. Um, like I really do. It's almost weird to me that he's a real person

666
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:16,600
because with his universal studios presence, he almost is like King Kong or jaws to me. He's

667
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:23,160
almost otherworldly. I liked him as much as I liked Michelangelo. Like, you know what I mean?

668
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:29,800
Like he was a pillar of what I watched as a kid so that there, that it is a real man. Um, I liked

669
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:35,000
him so much, just so charming and everything always love double dare. Love. What would you do

670
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,040
the best? And then we were a little older unwrapped started and I was just like, there's my friend.

671
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:47,960
He's back doing a new job. Yeah. That was a similar feeling I had when like Keenan Thompson was on

672
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:54,040
Saturday Night Live. I was like, oh, he made it out. He made it from my kid interests to my adult

673
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,640
interests. And the same thing with Mark Summers were like when unwrapped started, it was like,

674
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:03,880
whoa, hey, that's cool. There is life after. Yeah. Like, cause a lot of people don't get out.

675
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:08,520
They're sort of stuck in kid world or they aren't. And yeah, no, he's, he's got a pretty big like

676
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:14,920
reality career. Um, my little thing of like how I came the closest to living my Nickelodeon dreams,

677
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:20,840
cause I was never on a show. I was never slimed. I was too scared to audition. Um, but about 10

678
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:27,800
years ago at this point, Funny or Die produced a Double Dare themed music video. There was a

679
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:34,040
full recreation of the set and they got Mark Summers to participate. This was a music video for

680
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:42,520
one of history's great bands. I'm talking of course about Good Charlotte. Um, so, uh, I just,

681
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:47,480
my friends, Josh Martin and Ryan McNeely, uh, oh, you guys know them too. They, uh, they put this

682
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:53,000
together and I was in the right place at the right time and they asked if I wanted to be like a

683
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:59,320
helper, like the, um, uh, I guess a Harvey or more like one of the people like helping with the games

684
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:04,840
and like, you know, cleaning up water balloon spill and stuff. So I got the shirts. I got to be in a

685
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:11,560
shirt. Erin came, she did it too. Fellow, uh, podcast, podcaster, uh, Ryan Stanger is in it,

686
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:18,280
unrecognizable in his mega long hair that he used to have. Um, anyway, just, um, this was like

687
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:25,880
the dream of all dreams. I'm on a recreated Double Dare set with Mark Summers, be standing in the

688
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:34,440
wings in a shirt. And then he does the thing. He does the on your mark, get set, go such chills,

689
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:41,880
heart beating so fast. The coolest thing ever. And then the greatest thing was that, um, you know,

690
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:48,360
probably a situation they encountered in the early days of Double Dare. Um, the setup to do this

691
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:55,560
thing was just mammoth. It was so crazy to flip it from the game show part to the physical challenge

692
00:58:55,560 --> 00:59:01,480
or obstacle course part. It took forever. And Mark Summers was just standing around and then me and

693
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:05,480
everybody else who were wearing the Double Dare shirts and who grew up watching him all kind of

694
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:12,120
poked around and like, Hey, so, uh, is this cool to be here? And he just told us stories for 90

695
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:16,360
minutes. Everything you would ever want to hear the nicest guy, the greatest guy, everybody got

696
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:22,920
pictures with him. Like I am just glowing in my Mark Summers, uh, uh, experience. Um, he, and he's

697
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:27,880
just volunteering. Like, well, you probably also want to hear about that. Uh, uh, what's the, the,

698
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:32,040
the Magic Castle special I did. Oh yes, of course. Yes. We'd love to hear about that.

699
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:36,760
He just like volunteered, like everything you'd ever want to hear at a Q and a, but just for us.

700
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:42,760
Um, so, so cool. Um, so if you want to see that and hear a great, good Charlotte song,

701
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:49,480
and I don't know if it's in the cut, but you might get to see my wife fish up high out of Benji Madden's

702
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:57,400
pants. Um, so if you have any desire, I've heard, was he, uh, he's like a tabloid famous person,

703
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:02,440
right? Was he married to, I think was he married to Hillary Duff, Hillary Duff, perhaps. Yeah.

704
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:08,440
I think, I think so. Um, did the other one married Nicole Richie? Am I wrong? Or maybe I'm mixing

705
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:14,280
those up. Yeah. Um, I wonder if this is the rare place that the, the good Charlotte people were

706
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:21,160
where like no one on the set is fawning over them. Like the, not one person is like trying to get

707
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:27,240
pictures or autographs. Like it's just bees to honey for Mark Summers. Wait, no, Benji is married

708
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:34,920
to Cameron Diaz. Whoa. Now? Oh, she's married to Cameron Diaz. I was right about Joel Madden being

709
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:42,040
married to Nicole Richie, but I did not realize really Cameron Diaz is married to Benji. Wow.

710
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:49,240
Or at least was. Yeah. We gotta keep up with us weekly. We're not reading the tabloids like we

711
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:54,920
should. I feel like sometimes I know what I'm talking about. Let me hear. Let's see. I'm gonna

712
01:00:55,800 --> 01:01:03,400
yeah, Jason's right. 2015. Wow. All right. Hmm. And here I am like being snarky about him

713
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:09,720
on this podcast. Well, yes, they're a list. The man who has $500 million. I mean, they were very big

714
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:17,080
when we were teenagers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Geez. Well, anyways, yes. Watch these A-listers and I'm

715
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:23,800
in the, I'm in the background. So that, that's my, that's my Mark Summers enthusiasm. I don't know.

716
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:28,600
What else are we like excited about in terms of what you could see there, that what was taped

717
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:33,080
there? What are the, what are the big tent poles of this place? Yeah. I mean, when I toured it,

718
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:39,400
I asked my dad, like, was anything taping? Because you would go through, they had like big glass

719
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:45,320
windows, big soundproof glass windows. So you could look in on makeup and hair. There's, there's

720
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:49,880
footage of Mark Summers complaining about, like, you have to turn the mic. I don't want people

721
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:54,680
watching me get my makeup done. This is weird. And, and so there were all these little fish

722
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:59,400
balls. You would go above the sound stage, like up by the lights and you could look down on the set.

723
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:05,480
I think I asked my dad, his memory is that double-deer. I don't think like was in the

724
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:10,280
middle of a game when we were there, but at least the set was standing and we saw the set.

725
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:15,720
And so I'm sure it was either dark or there was just some guys, you know, coiling cables.

726
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:20,920
Because that's the thing. If you take a tour of sound stages or a movie studio, a lot,

727
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:27,560
you're going to see a lot of silence because, you know, when you film stuff, they're trying to

728
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:34,680
record sound. So like, they did plan this to be like both a working exhibit where like people

729
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:40,440
could go through and tour it while stuff was filming. But there, there was some sparse areas,

730
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:44,760
certainly the courtyard by the slime guys are, well, it was thrilling to see the slime guys are,

731
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:51,400
it was kind of empty. Otherwise an occasional photo op, a small gift shop, kiosk kind of thing.

732
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:58,360
But yeah, if they like, you imagine it always being like, you imagine there was some party

733
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:03,000
going on there all the time, whether or not there was show was taping just because you'd see it.

734
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:07,880
I feel like with what would you do, they started using that zone all the time. So you imagine

735
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:13,080
there's always some hubbub. But yeah, it was pretty little sleepy, little like photo ops.

736
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:20,920
I also will say my recollection of slime guys are, is that my kid memory made it 200 feet tall.

737
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:27,240
Getting there and realizing like, oh, this is like a, you know, like a PVC pipe art exhibit that

738
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:31,560
like a handy little collective would make, you know?

739
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:37,240
Yeah. And the thing you may forget is the ground of the courtyard was black asphalt and it was

740
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:42,680
always very wet because the slime guys are kind of splashed or wasn't kept up well. Like

741
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:51,480
it was always so wet over there, but largely silent except for like the like fake sirens

742
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:55,560
when the slime guys are would kind of erupt and it was water. I mean, it was mostly water.

743
01:03:55,560 --> 01:04:00,360
There was some tubes that were dyed green, you know, and there was like fake fog.

744
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:06,840
I remember that that that's another thing that disappointed me a little is that I,

745
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:12,120
I probably watched whatever, you know, launch of it there was or opening of the slime guys,

746
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:19,160
or there was, and like I'm picturing just the deepest greenest slime. And then it is like,

747
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:24,520
it's, it's like murky water. It's like sewer water, basically. Like that's the,

748
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:29,160
what came out of that guys are looked disgusting. Oh yeah. That's the whole,

749
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:36,120
I'm trying to think like everything, everything looked disgusting to me at the time it like,

750
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:42,440
I think I was always like thinking logistically too. Like if I got hit with this stuff from the

751
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:47,720
guys or what am I going to do? Am I going to get a new shirt? I don't want to put a different

752
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:53,080
shirt on because like, I remember how traumatic it was for me when I did. And I posted that already

753
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:59,560
and I talked about it on the Chicago show. I sang a song with my mother, which I'm blanking on the

754
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:06,520
name of it. Gloria Estefan, Gloria Estefan song. And because there was a green screen

755
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:13,960
behind me, I had to put a different shirt on that they had in the actual studio. And it was weird.

756
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:19,960
I hated it. I hated, I remember this really well. Like this is not my shirt and I'm wearing it.

757
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:24,200
So I had like these like paranoid feelings about like, if I hit hit with that fountain,

758
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:27,720
I'm going to have to put on a new shirt and I don't want to do that. It's not my shirt.

759
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:34,520
Well, when they would slime the kid in the pool and again, the smallest amount of slime, like a,

760
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:41,080
like a orange home Depot bucket, half filled worth of slime. He's there. They would put the kids

761
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:48,360
yet in another outfit or a pair of coveralls with like a helmet and goggles. And the other thing is

762
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:56,360
slime. It's mostly like cornstarch and water and dot. Like we would make slime so much in elementary

763
01:05:56,360 --> 01:06:02,840
school science class and middle school science. I can't die. The number of hours that science

764
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:10,440
teachers ate up making slime in the 90 where they're like, Oh my God, I'm hung over. I have to,

765
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:15,240
it's experiment day. They're making slime. That's the other thing. Slime is always edible too.

766
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:19,960
There's footage of Mark summers eating it in the, in the opening day special.

767
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:26,280
How much slime did you guys have as kids? And it didn't have to be Nickelodeon brand slime.

768
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:30,680
Cause at a certain point they started making like GAC and you could buy that, which we had a thing

769
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:37,880
of GAC at home, which was not quite slime. It was a little bit more like a spongy than slime,

770
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:44,200
but slime would come in my Ghostbuster toys. My Ninja turtle toys. There was a catapult thing

771
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:49,000
that would come with like slime and you'd always have in a little like bucket or like not bucket,

772
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:55,160
like almost like a Play-Doh container. And I, we had slime around the house. We care. We,

773
01:06:55,160 --> 01:07:00,120
we kept slime in the house because of how much many toys came with the slime.

774
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:07,480
Yeah. Multiple IPs, I guess all had like green slime. A lot of different sources of green slime.

775
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:13,800
You would, you could buy separate retro mutagenoos for the Ninja turtles, which I think we probably

776
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:18,840
had an extra little thing of slime just in case we needed it. In case during my play.

777
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:23,640
There's a blackout or a storm. If there was a pandemic at that time,

778
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:28,040
there would be a run on slime and we would have at least had some in the house in case.

779
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:35,960
We were very, our slime was rationed. Like I, if we made it in school, we usually came home

780
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:42,520
in like a grungy Ziploc bag or a sandwich bag and we could keep playing with it until it started to

781
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:50,360
break down. I feel like my mom, if a toy came with slime, we either used it until it like dried out

782
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:57,560
or she like palmed it like, and like, so we didn't have it. I remember once going to Chuck E. Cheese

783
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:01,160
and getting a free thing of Gack. Like that was like, I was like, we got to go to Chuck E. Cheese.

784
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:07,480
They're giving away free Gack and it was pizza. It smelled like pizza. It was special pizza Gack.

785
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:12,440
What? Yes. It's, it smelled like pizza. We got home, we opened it and it smelled like

786
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:17,800
garlic that had gone bad. And my mom was like, this is going in the trash.

787
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:26,680
I'm a little sad, but I also can't disagree with you too hard, but I feel like a fool that we,

788
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:31,880
we went through all that to get free Gack. Oh, wow. Smell. Here it is. Smell my Gack.

789
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:39,320
Okay, Scott, did you ever have Gack? Yeah. Yeah. I believe I had one reasonable container of Gack,

790
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:45,560
but it didn't smell because we didn't have a Gack that smelled. Yeah. Yeah. There's a, wow,

791
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:52,840
interesting. And then there was smud and floam as well. Floam was fun. Yeah. Yeah. Floam had some

792
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:57,400
like physical properties, right? It was like little, almost like, like mustard seeds. Right.

793
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:04,280
Yes. The little, the tiny balls made it stand out. There was texture to it. Yeah. So yeah,

794
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:08,760
I feel like slime and I don't know, do kids, do the kids today, are they? Oh,

795
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:13,480
there was a big slime trend a couple of years ago. Kids were crazy for people were making slime.

796
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:20,840
There's slime TikToks and Snapchat. I've seen like Mentos and like soda TikToks recently. I've seen

797
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:26,680
a lot of that. That's back. We're just not, we're in a new, we're in a new cool packaging of Mentos

798
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:32,360
and Coke. Yes. Yes. There's, I saw like three of them yesterday going through like YouTube,

799
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:36,040
whatever fleets, whatever YouTube calls fleets or whether it's version of TikTok.

800
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:43,160
Have I talked about that on the show? The men, when I was a PA and I had to help the Mentos and

801
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:50,840
soda guys set up a massive rig of Mentos and soda on the Vegas strip. EP Bird? Huh? Was it a group

802
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:57,640
called EP Bird? I think so. We were outside of Caesar's Palace and we had to do this and then

803
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:01,240
clear it up real quick. Cause Don Rickles was getting a lifetime achievement award.

804
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:10,040
What was this for? I was a PA at what was called the Comedy Festival in Las Vegas

805
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:16,040
at Caesar's Palace. I lived in Caesar's Palace for like 10 days, like in 2006, working this event.

806
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:25,240
Lucky. Lucky. People were, the audiences were drunk and unruly and no one seemed super happy

807
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:32,200
to be there. Both performers and audience. Zach Galvanakis was very nice. We had to

808
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:37,240
scramble to get him a big pad so he could write it on. And he was super cool.

809
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:42,680
A big pad? Not like a, what's a big pad? Like a big pad of paper when he would do the bits

810
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:46,680
where he tears off the jokes. Oh, the bit where he tears the... The big pads. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Zach

811
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:52,520
Galvanakis is an incontinent. Okay. No, no, he's not. No. But yeah, I had to set up, they had rigged,

812
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:57,080
they had just bottles and bottles of soda and we had, they had invented these capsules that you

813
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:02,120
would pull a string out of that would drop the Mentos into the soda thing. So it was just a

814
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:10,760
massive puddle of Diet Coke in the like promenade at Caesar's Palace. Was it two guys in lab coats?

815
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:17,480
Yes, it was. Definitely. Yeah. I might, like I had this editing job in 2008, 2009, where we did a ton

816
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:23,560
of work with those guys. Like they had cornered the, we are the Diet Coke Mentos guys. And then

817
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:29,960
there was this whole thing where we've, we're doing our new exp... We're not just the Diet Coke Mentos

818
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:37,800
guys. We've got a new experiment for you. It is sticky pads, like, like, like Post-It notes. And

819
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:42,520
they were going to like do, it was going to be like a bunch of cool designs where like Post-It notes

820
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:47,960
flowed like water. And we made all these videos with Post-It notes flying around and no one liked

821
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:54,520
any of this. Nobody cares. That's not remotely as cool as Diet Coke and Mentos. There's this long,

822
01:11:54,520 --> 01:12:00,440
arduous project that was a tie-in like EP Bird's special Post-It note experiment to promote ABC

823
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:07,240
family's Samurai Girl. What do you, what's any of this? What is the... Those guys were nice.

824
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:12,680
I think they were having a lot of fun. They had other jobs. They kind of fell into it and they were,

825
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:27,960
they were nice guys. And in my experience, I don't know. I never met them, so I don't know. Yes, they

826
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:33,880
could be perfectly nice. So, but yeah, but that similar appeal, like, oh, you make a big mess.

827
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:39,480
That was what Nickelodeon, you weren't, like Mike said, we were saying earlier, you make a big mess

828
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:44,120
and you're not allowed to do that in your home, but you can do it at Nickelodeon. Well, this is maybe

829
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:50,520
a good point to talk about one of the big temples of the tour, which is the Gack Kitchen. That was

830
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:55,480
sort of the, you know, because the other things that you see, I think you are outside a like

831
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:01,640
control booth. I watched a video where, you know, you're at all the monitors and the switchers and

832
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:07,560
like the director who's calling the shots up there and they prove that the glass is soundproof by

833
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:13,560
having a bunch of people all scream Nickelodeon at the top of their lungs. Yes. If you could hear it,

834
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:18,040
what an annoying place to work. I guess you couldn't. The person didn't turn around, but it's,

835
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:21,960
you know, it's cool. And I ate all this up as a kid. Like, this is totally what made me want to

836
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:28,200
work in TV or media or whatever the hell. Like I definitely ate all this up. But for, in terms of

837
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:34,760
like kid color, the Gack Kitchen is probably the craziest thing. And that was where, because you

838
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:40,120
don't like, I don't think I was ahead of it. I wasn't like smarter than everybody. I know that

839
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:44,920
it's edible and it's just cornstarch. I really don't think I knew what it was made of. And it

840
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:50,360
was cool seeing it come together and get mixed up in a bowl and they'd let people take a bite or

841
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:57,080
whatever. I don't remember a lot about what the Gack Kitchen presentation was. Oh, sure. Yeah. I

842
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:04,040
remember seeing that. Yeah. It was later. I think I saw that first. And then it was later. I had a

843
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:09,640
teacher who was a, had been a scientist or a science professor and was very into like,

844
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:15,080
yeah, oh, did you know this is really this? And then that they would do the slime stuff.

845
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:20,600
And they certainly got our interest. Yeah. That's a good, that's, that's a good fake science. Yeah.

846
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:24,920
Yeah. I kill time with, I mean, I think there were probably a point where I thought, oh, maybe like

847
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:31,880
the slime burns you really quickly. Yeah. You just scream after you were getting slimed or something

848
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:36,920
or it would change your, I would like, I like the Joker. It would change my face, my color. It would

849
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:41,560
change me to green permanently or something. Yeah. I mean, I'm sure I had those thoughts.

850
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:47,480
Maybe I thought it would be like, like a drug, like you, you for it. Like maybe it would make

851
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:54,520
me happier. Like as soon as you're kissed by Gack, then you just feel lighter than a cloud.

852
01:14:54,920 --> 01:15:03,000
Yeah. So there's no easy solution like that other than, you know, six ounces of white wine.

853
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:07,320
That's as close as I can come to what I thought Gack would do. I don't know. I think if you,

854
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:12,440
Jason seems like he knows exactly how to make some slime in the lab. I think if Jason can whip up

855
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:17,000
some slime for you, maybe have that white wine and then we'll just dump it on your head. Next

856
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,640
time we're in person and let's see if we can't recapture that old magic, that old feeling.

857
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:27,880
Yeah. Now look, I'm excited that I'm very excited for the forthcoming,

858
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:33,000
us returning to in person, but look, germs are still, you know, we're all still a little

859
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,600
psychologically scarred from the last year. How was this suddenly becoming super sloppy podcast,

860
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:43,800
the ride now we're sliming each other. Now we're eating kid cuisine, which will probably make us

861
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:49,880
vomit. Now suddenly there's all kinds of fluids going on fluids being exchanged on super sloppy

862
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:56,120
podcast, the ride. And I don't know how I feel about it. Has Dr. Fauci weighed in on super,

863
01:15:56,120 --> 01:16:02,680
sloppy slime and if it could actually increase the spread of COVID or I would really like to know

864
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:08,680
before we do this, because you're right. You're right. We are getting a little ahead of ourselves

865
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:13,640
here about getting sloppy when we're back in person. And I think we should just follow the

866
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:19,800
CDC guidelines about how sloppy we are allowed to be. Yeah. You know, it's almost paradoxical. They

867
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:26,520
want to say, I don't know without any repercussions. And then when they say it, they get slimed and

868
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:32,120
what do they think is going to happen? Well, we've all seen Rand Paul getting very testy with Dr.

869
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:37,880
Fauci lately, because he wants to get sloppy immediately. He's wanted everyone to be sloppy

870
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:43,960
this whole time. Jim Jordan wants to be super sloppy. It's our, and our, our basic liberties.

871
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:50,520
We're guaranteed the right to get sloppy. Well, Rand Paul got sloppy with his yard work and

872
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:54,760
he got to come up for that. So we'll see what happens if he gets sloppy with his ass work.

873
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:06,680
So what have we missed here? What's the part is? Gat kitchen. Gat kitchen. It seems fun in general

874
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:12,520
and that the person, the official chef there is called the Gatmeister. I like that. I could see,

875
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:18,440
I could see like, yeah, the reality as a kid there, I would have gagged having like eating

876
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:23,880
it even like, even if somebody was like, you know, it's just, it's candy. You eat the same

877
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:29,640
colored candy all the time. Like it's nerd, color of nerds. And there's no, I would still be like,

878
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:35,560
oh, but it's, oh no, I can't. Like it would, it would still psychologically be like disturbing

879
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:41,400
to me, I think. But that, you know, I feel like I might've liked it. I was watching a video where

880
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:46,600
a kid tried a little bit and then like got nauseous, but I, I feel like I'd like eating

881
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:53,400
gag. I don't know. Hey, I could, I could see now I would love it, but I'm just trying to remember

882
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:57,480
I'm, look, I'm doing my best cause I didn't get to experience this thing, this thing when I was

883
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:03,560
younger, cause we couldn't go to Universal. We only went to Disney, you know? Yeah. Like you're

884
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:08,840
talking to your parents right now. Am I? You went into that tone of voice. Maybe I am. Maybe I,

885
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:13,000
maybe I feel like we didn't get to go to Universal till it was like 1998, you know?

886
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:19,480
My family always went clockwise back to like, or counterclockwise back to like ET and back to the

887
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:25,480
future first. So I think like I got the glimpse of Nickelodeon Studios the first one or time,

888
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:29,720
two times we went, but usually did it later in the day. And that was probably a good move

889
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:34,600
cause I saw the more like behind the scenes stuff like Alfred Hitchcock and Murder She Wrote.

890
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:41,000
So that kind of prepped me for a lot of spare sets, like empty sets with like fluorescents on them.

891
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:48,920
Because again, it's a tour. It's not going to be like you're walking into a middle of a commercial.

892
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:55,960
So I did very quickly temper my expectations. I think that like, yeah, I'm not going to get hit

893
01:18:55,960 --> 01:19:01,560
with a pie out of a secret door. I wish they had done more like people jumping out of secret

894
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:06,600
entrances or stuff or like, you know, some weird stuff in the tour.

895
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:12,120
Yeah. It could have been sillier. It could have been wackier, I suppose. It is a little,

896
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:18,600
a tad functional from what you can tell about it. But did the game lab do anything for you?

897
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:24,200
We talked about splitting up into kids and adults, but then like, was that show a satisfying show?

898
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:29,720
I think it was fun to see it demonstrated in person. Yeah. Once I was like,

899
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:37,080
got my shaking down to a manageable level, I could try and look and I saw the slime

900
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:40,920
and I could see that it was far away from me. And yeah, as Mike, as you said,

901
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:43,560
it's not going to burn me. It's probably not going to get on me.

902
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:48,440
Yeah. Not going to turn you into like clay face, like a slime monster.

903
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:53,800
Yeah. I found, oh, go ahead. No, you go.

904
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:59,480
Well, I was going to say I found some of the merchandise. Like I, I don't know why I never

905
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:06,440
got one of these shirts that everyone wore in the broadcast because they surely had them for sale.

906
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:10,680
I did have this shirt, which I apparently, yeah, I know it's at my mom's. I can apparently get

907
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:17,000
$80 for it on eBay. This is a shirt with the Nick Studios logo, which by the way, there's the Nick

908
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:23,080
logo, which is a big splat. But then the Studios logo where it's a splat that has different shapes,

909
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:31,240
like a camera and film strips and a blimp for some reason. I really like that outline,

910
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:34,680
what they, how they modded it out for the studio setting.

911
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:39,960
Apparently that was heavy, heavily influenced by like the MTV logo could kind of do anything

912
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:42,680
and go anywhere. And they're like, we got to be able to do that too.

913
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:49,400
Oh yeah. How you never like associated with a particular color scheme. The whole thing

914
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,880
was that it would flash through different crazy patterns.

915
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:57,000
Yeah. So that's why I like it'd be a blimp sometimes and then it'd be a shit, a plane

916
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:02,360
or like a big splat. Like it could, it could, the font, they said the font was always the same and

917
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:06,520
the orange was always the same. But then you could do a lot with it.

918
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:13,000
Gotcha. My general takeaway going back into the Nickelodeon archives and watching a bunch of shows

919
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:19,880
in the last week, just that, I mean, the shows are great, but the, it's the look and the graphics

920
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:26,200
and the promo department and the odds in it and just all the various pieces of media that where

921
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:31,880
they sing, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick. I, all of the stuff between the shows,

922
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:37,320
they did such a great job. And then you take that into SNCC and the couch and that is so memorable.

923
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:42,520
I feel that way about MTV as well because yeah, it was like, you know, two branches of the same

924
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:49,720
company and it was like, you know, as, as much all the stuff between the shows as what was in the

925
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:53,720
shows. I just, just all that middle crap. They did such a great job.

926
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:59,640
Yeah. It's, it's really, it's a vibe. It's what Jason was saying earlier, like truly like the

927
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:07,240
vibe of Nickelodeon was like perfect. They really like figured out how to make you feel like it was

928
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:12,920
all part of a piece. And like, this is like, you hear the Nick, Nick, Nick song and it's like,

929
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:18,600
that's my, that's made for me. This is this, everything is almost not everything, but almost

930
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:25,640
everything is good on this channel. There was, there was not like a poochyism in this, you know,

931
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:32,440
like with poochy being the character added to it, she and scratchy who is completely the product

932
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:36,200
of focus groups and out of touch adults thinking what kids might want to see.

933
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:43,320
It would, that was never the situation. Like they, they calibrated and defined our taste

934
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:49,320
in the process. Like they put something out there. Is this your taste? We said yes. And they kept

935
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:54,280
going. And then it completely became our dominant taste for the next five years or so.

936
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:58,600
Yes. Can I real quick, I want to go down the list of the things that were shot here and just,

937
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:02,360
I'm going to point out highlights because so many, so many things were shot at Nick Studios.

938
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:11,400
Eureka's Castle is a show I liked a lot. My sister was a little younger, but I'm big. Puppets,

939
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:19,080
if you don't know, Dragon, Batpuppet, Bat Lee. I like his voice. I like doing his voice still.

940
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:24,920
Magellan, you know, Eureka. I like that. A fun puppet show. Obviously Double Dare we were talking

941
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:30,520
about. I liked the show, My Brother and Me. Do you remember My Brother and Me?

942
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:35,160
I did remember that as I was watching clips. I oddly watched a lot of My Brother and Me.

943
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:40,280
We loved My Brother and Me. We loved, the kids, the two kids had a friend named Goo.

944
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:46,760
Goo. Oh, Goo was so funny. Goo was so funny. The show only lasts like a season and they would

945
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:51,560
just replay them over and over again. But we watched all of, there's like what, 10 episodes

946
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:57,880
probably. Burned into my brain is the one where a basketball player shows up and they say his

947
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:02,360
name so many times and I only knew who he was because of the episode. But just how many times

948
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:09,400
they said his full name, Kendall Gill, Kendall Gill. Kendall Gill's gonna be here. I like,

949
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:15,720
I love Kendall Gill now because of that episode. Yeah, underrated show. I feel like anybody who

950
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:21,000
knows it is like, yeah, I watched a lot of that. Yeah, you bring it up. I guess I'm more fond of

951
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:27,400
it than I realized. Yeah, we loved it. Get Goo on SNL. Goo should be there too. I agree.

952
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:35,000
Now, Weinerville is a show I watched but it was creeped out by. I loved it but I was creeped out

953
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:40,200
by it. I was very conflicted. I was afraid I would get puppeted. I would get turned into a puppet.

954
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:44,600
I wouldn't be able to get turned back. Something would go wrong. I was terrified of that happening.

955
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:51,480
Well, I saw Mark Weiner live at the Arlington racetrack too, like in 1994 or 5. Betting on the

956
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:56,600
ponies? No, no, he was doing a show. He was not just there with like a racing form. He was actually

957
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:02,840
doing some kind of show and we went to see him and they had kids like get Weinerized there.

958
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:08,120
Even though I was like older, I still was like, I don't want to risk it. Yeah, I'm not going to

959
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:12,760
risk getting turned into one of those characters permanently. Are you being permanently Weinerized?

960
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:18,360
I didn't know, you know. I think there was still a feeling in my head that that was possible. I

961
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:22,760
don't know if it was as strong as what Jason's describing but I did have that feeling of like,

962
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:27,800
oh, I don't know. If you were Weinerized, that means that because he had like little puppet bodies on

963
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:33,320
his own full-sized head. Is that what Weinerizing was? Yeah, sorry to explain to the audience who

964
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:41,320
might not know Mark Weiner's Weinerville. I know nothing beyond the title. Again, I probably watched

965
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:47,080
more episodes of this than shows that I like a lot today. I probably watched 50 episodes of

966
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:52,040
Weinerville but remember nothing. Right, that's fair. I don't have such strong memories. He had

967
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:59,560
like a biker character, is that right? He was like a greaser, maybe a greaser type. Was he a sort of

968
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:07,400
a kids in the hall style like blonde office lady who'd go like, oh, I think so. Was it Dottie?

969
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:12,760
Is my memory correct? Is it Dottie from Weinerville? I believe it is. Yeah, there was definitely

970
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:19,880
some sort of Dottie involved. It says 93 to 94, so much only shot for a year or two and they would

971
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:24,920
just grind it out or what would happen with like Clarissa explains it all and Keenanica, like they

972
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:30,200
would shoot some of it in Florida and then the person would get, you know, momentum in their

973
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:36,040
careers. They're like, all right, we got to move this to Los Angeles. Yeah, all that says season

974
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:40,120
one and two only shot there, which I liked all that as well. But I think we've talked about it

975
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:43,480
on the show before. It was like when I started watching Saturday Night Live and I was like,

976
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:49,960
I can tell Saturday Night Live is better, but I do like all that. I still like watching all that.

977
01:26:51,960 --> 01:27:00,440
What else is on this list? Nick Arcade. Oh, Nick. Oh, God. I mean, Roundhouse season one. Oh, go ahead.

978
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:05,480
Yeah, sure. Oh, I was just going to say that everyone, everyone is upset, still like traumatized

979
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:11,880
by how badly everyone did in the final round of Nick Arcade. Yeah. Because it was like,

980
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:16,440
like they were on a green screen or a blue screen or something and they were like looking at a

981
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:21,400
monitor to see where like the bad guys were coming as if they were in a Nintendo game or an old arcade

982
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:27,080
game and it was impossible. They failed almost every time and as a kid you were like, you didn't

983
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:33,400
understand the physics of that. So you were so frustrated watching them just eat shit every time

984
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:38,680
they went to the bonus round or the final round. Yeah. And there's footage of like the stairways

985
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:43,240
were practical. Those were real or the orbs. Those were real. But then everything else. Yeah,

986
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:49,480
like you said, it's just an empty blue screen and a weird monitor, a giant monitor, but at a very

987
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:56,840
weird spot. It's wild. This is a pretty good video that I just found that's three to four

988
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:03,480
Orlando local news outlets who clearly all got invited to some media day of Nick. Like there's

989
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:07,560
a new show, Nick Arcade launching and you can go be part of a taping and maybe be on the show and

990
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:15,160
they have their report, their wacky reporter go do a round of it and they all completely eat

991
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:21,480
shit, including a weatherman and a weatherman. That's what they do for a living. Yeah. You're

992
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:25,640
in front of green. You're watching. I have to point this way, but it's going to be flipped the

993
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:30,760
other way and I have to base what I'm doing off a monitor. So if a weatherman, a professional

994
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:36,120
fails at that, then how is some kid going to understand the intricacies of chroma work? Yeah.

995
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:46,200
No, the kids, poor kids. There was roundhouse, I think is the one that we have that. That's what

996
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:50,600
when you start thinking about these shows, when it is not your child, when enough time has passed

997
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:54,040
that it becomes nostalgia. Oh, remember this. Remember that roundhouse is like the first one

998
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:59,960
where you go, Oh, some of them were bad. It's like the first that it occurs to you. There's

999
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,840
other shows you might say, Oh, that didn't like this. And other people would say, Oh, what are

1000
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:05,960
you talking about? That was good roundhouse. I don't think you're getting any argument.

1001
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:11,000
Well, not with she's all that right after or not. She's all that all that.

1002
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:19,640
There's all that. All that did is she's all that to the concept of children's sketch comedy. Like

1003
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:27,400
they elevated it above like a roundhouse or a welcome freshman. I liked that justification.

1004
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:33,320
I liked that. I got it. He fixed it. He fixed it. He retconned it. No mistakes in podcasting.

1005
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:38,680
Well, I was going to say about what would you do, which I really, really liked. What would you

1006
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:43,560
do? It was Mark Summers other show and it was just the same concept, different set, basically.

1007
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:47,880
I mean, it wasn't the same exact game show, but kids, there would be different ways to get slimed.

1008
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:53,640
I will say so at Nick Studios, which was in a theme park, there was a ride on what would you do

1009
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:58,840
that I feel like was not used a lot. You guys know what I'm talking about? I vaguely remember

1010
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:05,080
this. Yeah. The pie coaster, the pie coaster. And I believe they only use this once in a while

1011
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:09,400
because I don't remember seeing it a lot because they'd have the pie pod, which was like their

1012
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:14,360
signature, I believe on what would you do, which was you'd sit in a seat and then like arms would

1013
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:19,640
like fly like fling pies at your face, which I remember being scared that would hurt as well

1014
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:25,080
as a kid. I was like, I liked the body of the pie pod, but it was very, I was a little traumatized

1015
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:30,360
by it. But then I remember this very distinctly. And I remember that it wasn't on a lot and it's

1016
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:35,480
probably cause it was hard to maintain, but it was the pie coaster and they built.

1017
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:44,280
It's a little soapbox Derby. That is so low rent. Oh my gosh. And it's the biggest

1018
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:50,520
pie and it goes backwards. Yeah. Wow. And I bet that they were like, we can't, this isn't that

1019
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:58,120
good. This it's not good enough to justify the insane set up. You feel the Bob Gurr in this,

1020
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:04,680
like not literally Bob Gurr, but you feel some guy rolling up his sleeves and banging this together

1021
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:08,760
two in the morning. And there's like a hard like bank up at the end here. Do you see that?

1022
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:15,080
Yeah. So it can swing back with momentum. Right. Not into the audience. Kid probably got her like

1023
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:20,200
neck hurts. Her neck probably got hurt on this and they were like, we can't maintain this pipe pie

1024
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:25,880
coaster much longer. It's a little whiplashy. It looks more architecturally sound than rip ride

1025
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:32,760
rocket though. I'll say that. That's fair. Like a more pleasant experience too. That's where they

1026
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:38,840
got the idea for a rip ride rocket. Yeah. This is the, I was looking for Reddit threads of people

1027
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:43,640
who got to go to Nickelodeon tapings or be part of the shows. And I saw a post from somebody who

1028
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:47,640
was disillusioned by the whole thing because they got to go to a taping of legends of the hidden

1029
01:31:47,640 --> 01:31:53,080
temple, which was such a grand show with huge games and huge sets. And they said that the taping

1030
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:58,520
was not very fun because they had one of the games set up, you know, whether it was one of the ones

1031
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:03,880
running across water or whatever, those are so involved. And it was basically here's the game

1032
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:09,400
and now we're going to play it six times with six different groups of kids because they're block shot

1033
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:15,080
by set. Not so much, but they don't like film the whole episode in half an hour, real clean,

1034
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:20,840
like a talk show. So I think it was a sort of like laborious and boring. I wonder if that was the

1035
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:26,600
case with the pie coaster too, like not worth the setup. Yeah. I bet they had to wheel that thing out

1036
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:32,120
and test it like 10. You would think like to move a roller coaster, even a little one,

1037
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:37,160
you then have to test it to make sure the person in the coaster is going to fall off

1038
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:42,680
because moving a coaster is a big pain in the ass. So you would imagine that, yeah, that was

1039
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:46,600
probably a logistical challenge. I wonder if-

1040
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:47,560
Logistical challenge.

1041
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:53,960
That's my favorite thing about the double day is that they, in the way that kids all adopt a way of,

1042
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:57,720
you know how everyone says, all kids say the pledge of allegiance in the same way.

1043
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:03,720
I pledge allegiance to the flag. It was like that with physical challenge where nobody said

1044
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:08,600
physical challenge. It was always physical challenge. Just a big lean in right up on the

1045
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:13,560
fuzz and physical challenge. Like why did they, somebody could have said it in a different way,

1046
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:18,200
but by then the tone just got adopted. Yeah. You had to lay out the, whoever the first,

1047
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:23,080
whoever the pioneer of that was the first kid to say it. Yeah. Set the tone forever. Set the tone

1048
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:28,680
for it. Yeah. By the way, one of these, you know, also to continue praising Mark Summers,

1049
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:34,360
I guess maybe equal to Michael Eisner in my kid. I just liked these nice guys in suits, spoke clearly.

1050
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:41,720
Looking, you know, the whole thing with him became, oh, but he's kind of crazy. He's got OCD.

1051
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:46,920
He doesn't like, he was a host of Double Dare and he doesn't like messes. This guy, let me tell you,

1052
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:52,280
he washes his hands all the time. That's how crazy he is. He'll wash his hands for like upwards of,

1053
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:59,720
I don't know, 20 seconds. What a like vindicating era for Mark Summers. This all has to be. Yeah.

1054
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:06,360
We are all mega germaphobes. And what a hero because like, not only is there all this mess,

1055
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:12,680
children are, Scott, I'm sure you've learned, gross, disgusting. Like so much goo. They're

1056
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:17,640
their own little slime factories. They're their own little GAC labs. You know, so.

1057
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:23,320
Personal GAC labs. Yeah, I know. And that he did that. He like had this problem and yet suppressed

1058
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:29,720
it to have this crazy specific job. Yes. It's pretty amazing. And someone said about Mark Summers,

1059
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:35,800
the thing why I think he immediately caught on with kids is he always treated the kids as adults.

1060
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:40,680
He always talked to them like equals, whether they were excited, whether they were nervous,

1061
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:46,520
whether they seemed like a brainiac or like just kind of out of it. He always was like, you know,

1062
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:53,720
acted like, you know, Alex Trebek would act to the Jeopardy contestants, you know.

1063
01:34:54,440 --> 01:35:02,520
Yeah. Yeah. Super great charismatic. He also that story, there's a story in that Orange Years

1064
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:07,400
documentary that he told to us in person. I think this is part of his little like, like,

1065
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:13,640
I'll give you the inside stuff, but the story where like a kid almost like bends their leg and

1066
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:19,640
hat like, like, this is super dislocation of a leg from a slip and fall, you know, which I think

1067
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:23,880
in person he might have described it as like, I feel like I was like, am I seeing bone? What

1068
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:29,800
happened? Like it was really bad. It was a truly horrendous accident on the obstacle course. And

1069
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:34,440
they were like, everybody's already thinking this is going to be lawsuit city. We are so screwed

1070
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:40,520
here. And then the parent comes up and says, hey, so that next one before he slipped and fell on

1071
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:46,920
your set, the next game was going to get us that big screen TV. You give us that big screen TV.

1072
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:55,080
Maybe none of this ever happened. Oh, sure. I think we could make that work. And then backstage,

1073
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:58,680
they're all like, oh my God, we can just give him the TV and make this go away. Holy shit.

1074
01:35:58,680 --> 01:36:05,000
Like they save Nickelodeon three million dollars with this one free TV. Yeah. TV,

1075
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:10,120
the resolution these days would look like shit. It would look horrible. Yeah. I can't believe

1076
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:16,600
there even were big TVs and all these. Why? Why did they even bother? Well, my mom's keeping hers

1077
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:21,000
going. God knows how many times she's gotten it repaired. It's in a big wooden cabinet.

1078
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:28,040
It is a massive, it's probably as tall as I am. How old is it? Oh, I would say that was the event

1079
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:35,960
of the year in 1995 when we got it. 1994. Yes. Whoa. And it's a piece of furniture. Yeah. How

1080
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:41,400
much is the repair on it? I don't know. She got it repaired like years ago and it, I mean, it still

1081
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:49,960
works. My dad had the exact same thing where the cabinet that the TV is in is driving the lack of

1082
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:56,200
replacement of the TV. Like, hey, it's nice. It's, you know, that's good wood panel. It's good varnish.

1083
01:36:56,200 --> 01:37:03,400
You don't replace that. Yeah. My dad also, I have to say, because this happened yesterday and I

1084
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:13,080
have to unload this burden of what my dad said, which is he pronounced the word sushi,

1085
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:23,400
su-chi. He did a C-H-I and I'm like, dad, we have said the word sushi to each other. You know

1086
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:31,640
that it is not su-chi. He said it in the context of like that weird stuff you eat and like su-chi

1087
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:38,600
and I stopped him like, hang on. I will not let this stand. You know, in your heart, it is not su-chi.

1088
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:45,400
You have been on this earth since the fifties. This is not a new word to you. You know what?

1089
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:51,400
Someone in my family did that to me recently with the very bitter, with a kind of bitter leafy green

1090
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:56,440
you get in a salad, you know, arugula. And I don't even remember how I, I don't even remember what

1091
01:37:56,520 --> 01:38:01,720
they were trying to say. Arugula? Arugula. Yeah, something like that. And I'm like, you've had

1092
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:08,840
arugula. No, no, no, no, no. This isn't oat milk. This is, come on. It's in every bag of pre-packaged

1093
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:14,760
mixed greens. Come on. Oo-roo-gluck-gluck. What is that California crap you're eating?

1094
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:22,200
Jason, is your dad at sushi? Yeah, my dad's at sushi. My dad, so my mom's repairing the same TV

1095
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:29,160
from 1995. My dad moved a number of years ago and immediately bought the biggest Sony widescreen TV

1096
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:36,600
he could get and opted for like a pool table instead of a dining room kitchen, like dining room

1097
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:42,200
table. So he's, he's the, a little more hipper. Yeah, my dad had put on the biggest platter of

1098
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:48,360
sushi ever. He put, he put on the sushi channel. I don't think he goes to sushi. He likes nice

1099
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:54,280
restaurants. He gets sushi. I don't think it's his favorite, but yeah. Dads, dads just don't like

1100
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:59,640
sushi. They're scared of sushi for some reason. I don't know what it is. I'm not a big sushi guy

1101
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:08,280
either. So I, you know, I, but I'll, I'll eat it. It's rice and avocado and some fish. Pretty base,

1102
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:13,560
I feel. Stuff you have. What else? These boys' parents, you know, as you think about this,

1103
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:18,040
then they're on adventurous food tape. I know. These parents, I hate them. They're stupid

1104
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:23,240
glasses. Always saying don't eat sushi with their, yeah, horn room glasses. Sushi's for all of us.

1105
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:31,480
Stop eating sushi. You're muckling. Don't, they should have sushi and kid cuisine, I think.

1106
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:40,840
Yeah. Okay. What if we not, well, we're, we're name and show is still. Guts. Gotta mention guts.

1107
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:46,280
Guts and legends of the hidden temple was kind of that. I feel like is the dividing line somewhere

1108
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:52,520
around there and secret life of Alex Mack, which I don't think shot here, but like soon after that,

1109
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:59,080
a couple of years after that, they get to where the Explorer and SpongeBob square pants. And then

1110
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:03,560
it's just like a rocket ship. Like it's, it's a different era. Things, things change a little,

1111
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:08,520
you know? Sure. Yeah. There's stuff that just, there's, there's stuff on this list is like just

1112
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:14,680
out of the time I was watching. Like mystery files of Shelby Wu, I didn't watch. I was like,

1113
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:22,040
I was onto much more sophisticated shows at that point, you know? Like, I don't know, in 1998, what?

1114
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:31,160
VIP. VIP relic hunter. All the different shows I watched on a Saturday afternoon on

1115
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:39,080
UPN or whatever. You know, that all these future luminaries that Kenan Thompson's,

1116
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:45,080
you know, doing his early, we're cutting his teeth there that Mike O'Malley on several shows before

1117
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:53,000
he wrote the Margaritaville musical, you know, all the greatest talents. That still is a bizarre fact

1118
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:57,880
to me. I don't know if listeners know that fact that guts host, Mike O'Malley wrote the Jimmy

1119
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:04,040
Buffett musical. Yeah. Well, wrote the book, wrote the book. Yeah, of course. He didn't have it.

1120
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:09,080
We know who wrote the songs. We know the gentleman who did that. Yeah. Yeah. Mike O'Malley, very

1121
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:13,240
interesting career if you look, because obviously as kids, we were like, Oh, the guy who yells a lot,

1122
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:21,160
who yells a lot on the game show. We like to watch kids run around. But yes, it's like sick,

1123
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:29,560
multiple sitcoms created things. And yes, the Jimmy Buffett musical. He's in Sully. He's in the

1124
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:35,880
scene with the constant recreation and the birds. That's, that's Mike O'Malley in there.

1125
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:45,400
So yeah, he, so he, I liked him a lot. I liked him and I liked Mo. I liked them both a lot

1126
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:53,480
on the show. But Mike specifically, sometimes a little much for me. Sure. You know, he was a lot,

1127
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:58,440
he's very, very aggressive. So while I did like him, I definitely was like, all right, well,

1128
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:05,400
you could not always yell at me. You need the balance, you know? Yeah. I guess I preferred the

1129
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:09,880
friendliness. Like I sense that if I, yeah, if I met them in person, Mark Summers would be nice to

1130
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:16,280
me as he was when it happened. And Mike O'Malley might yell at me and bully me and tell me to go

1131
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:20,760
up that rope quicker. I imagine what happened today. He, but he, while, you know, when Jimmy

1132
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:24,360
Buffett was meeting with Mike O'Malley, Mike O'Malley was yelling at Jimmy Buffett. You could,

1133
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:29,960
there's no way they couldn't work like that. Jimmy would, he changed his tune. He softened it up.

1134
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:36,920
Yeah. To be able to hang out, to be, be shifted to island time. Tully Mars wouldn't do that.

1135
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:42,120
Don't make me write Tully Mars in a way I don't like, Jimmy. He wouldn't do that. He would not

1136
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:46,040
say that to Jimmy Buffett because Jimmy, nobody knows Tully Mars, the character that Jimmy wrote

1137
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:52,200
in multiple novels better than Jimmy Buffett. Yeah. We got a tight story here. Volcano doesn't

1138
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:57,880
make any sense. They're never going to be able to pull off the set of the volcano spewing on stage

1139
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:03,720
every night. Are you crazy? Well, actually in the context of the musical, the volcano is probably

1140
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:11,000
one of the things that makes the most sense. That's right. I didn't see the, that's the last

1141
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:16,520
thing we all did before pandemic. Yeah. With Eva Anderson. With Eva. And we should have done a

1142
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:20,680
second gate. I mean, maybe we still will, but we should have, if it weren't for pandemic, like

1143
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:25,640
watching that away, there definitely should have been a second gate on that musical. Which was

1144
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:31,320
honestly pretty fun. I'll be like pretty fun. Yeah. We had a nice time. The story is not so

1145
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:37,880
sophisticated. It's a fairly simple story, believe it or not. But you know, throwing O'Malley into the

1146
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:43,080
bus, bad book. Oh, I don't, you know, not a bad book. I don't want to say O'Malley wrote a bad book.

1147
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:47,960
I would never say that. I just think that he knew what the, what the show should be and he

1148
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:52,680
wrote appropriately. You want the hits. It's hard to write simple. It's hard to write simple. You

1149
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:57,800
know, it's a great compliment to say like something is simple and pared down, you know, the biggest,

1150
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:01,880
the biggest disappointment was that it was the final performance. And I was so hoping

1151
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:07,240
Mr. Buffett himself would come out at the end, like he had been in previous. Yes. Cause he was

1152
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:12,360
in the city. He had posted on Insta. Well, at least if he believed his Instagram. I was tracking

1153
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:18,200
him on Instagram and I was like, he's in Los Angeles. Why would he not come out at the end

1154
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:24,120
and play Margaritaville with everyone? And he did not. So, Oh well. Oh well. You put a tracking

1155
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:30,520
device on his personal assistance car. Yeah. I, they're in town. So, uh, and I had a, I trained

1156
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:39,320
a Pelican to be on look out for him and it had like a little earpiece. And then I would give it

1157
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:44,520
the Pelican directions and say like, where, where is he now? Follow, follow that car, follow that

1158
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:53,880
surfboard or something. And the Pelican, go Heinz 57 fly. Yeah. The Pelican's living here now, by the

1159
01:44:53,880 --> 01:45:01,400
way. It's been living with us the whole pandemic. He's in your pod, your pod again. Yeah. There's

1160
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:07,640
only been three people, me, Lindsay and the Pelican. Um, guys, if I could circle back before

1161
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:16,600
we talk more Nickelodeon stuff to the Kid Cuisine world. Um, I, I messaged, uh, our, our Shrek expert,

1162
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:22,680
Griffin Newman, um, to say, what is your off the cuff reaction to this box? And he, he's,

1163
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:29,320
he sent quite a bit. Uh, so I'm going to summarize, um, probably the biggest things he said. I would

1164
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:36,600
not touch that fucking tray. I find the sad bastard dinner that Shrek eats alone in the first movie

1165
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:42,760
more appetizing. And then, uh, you can see it's tomatoes and peas and like a fucked up sausage.

1166
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:49,720
I think that's real stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Yeah. And more organic than Kid Cuisine could ever

1167
01:45:49,720 --> 01:45:55,320
be. He says this, says this too, is someone who eats chicken nuggets at least three times a week.

1168
01:45:55,320 --> 01:46:03,800
So, um, if he's turning against the Shrek Nugs, um, yeah, need a Shrek shaped or he doesn't like

1169
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:10,200
on his own turn them into Shrek tree. He doesn't carve Shrek ears out of his own nuggets. Well,

1170
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:15,080
we'll have to ask him when we talk to him again. We'll have to ask him, uh, PTR legend Griffin

1171
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:22,920
Newman. So that's two for two against. Okay. So the rules are always if it sucks,

1172
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:27,640
Mike and Jason have to stand up for it. Hi, did I stand up? Scott's gagging.

1173
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:35,720
Know that I def necessarily endorsed the Shrek. I'm, maybe I forget it. Wait till we get to the episode and we'll see.

1174
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:42,920
We know where things land. Um. When I like eat the Shrek nuggets and I go, this is so, oh, it's good.

1175
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:46,760
Look, it's cute. My stomach feels cute. I'm in the bathroom like,

1176
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:55,000
feel good. My voice is a little horse. Can I go take like a 40 minute break? Okay. Bye.

1177
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:01,480
Run away. Don't even make it to a bathroom. You see I'm like tweeting from the show account.

1178
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:10,200
These are good. I love these nuggets. It's just a shame that was 10 years after the time capsule was

1179
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:16,920
buried. I couldn't preserve them. Now that's a good segue. And my, you know, hey, we're talking

1180
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:23,160
Mike O'Malley. One of the big moments of Mike O'Malley was his hosting of the Nick time capsule

1181
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:31,480
ceremony in April, 1992. Uh, what we're now, how many years out are we from the, it'll be opened in,

1182
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:42,200
in 21 years, I believe. Yes. Uh, a long traveling time capsule. Yes. Yeah. So I remember watching

1183
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:48,680
this one as well. This was a big deal to me. Nickelodeon in April, 92 buried a time capsule,

1184
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:54,600
an orange time capsule that was full of things that are important to the children of 1992.

1185
01:47:54,760 --> 01:48:02,280
There is a special hosted by Mike O'Malley, uh, where he makes, uh, declarations guaranteed to

1186
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:09,560
become not true. Like kids will come to this spot, this spot that'll stand forever and they'll find

1187
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:14,840
out what it was like for you guys. Now that you guys are the adults running the world. Um, but of

1188
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:20,440
course, as we'll get into, there is no Nickelodeon studios. It hasn't been there in a long time.

1189
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:25,960
So it, uh, this, uh, that was my big concern. I remember when I heard that the studios were

1190
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:30,920
closing, like what if, what if the time capsule, this is like an important thing in my life now,

1191
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:36,520
like I'm seven watching this and where will I be by then? What will be my life in 2042?

1192
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:41,640
And I need to know, I need to track this thing. So it's moved. They've, they've had to move it

1193
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:47,320
several times. Yes. And it's at, it's been moved what twice? Is that right? Still it's at the new

1194
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:53,160
hotel after they closed the worst hotel, the worst Nick hotel. Oh no, no, it, it went to the

1195
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:58,920
Nickelodeon suites hotel. Now it's here in fucking Burbank by the office tower. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah.

1196
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:07,160
Uh, we can go now. We can go see it today. Yeah, we can't, but we need like a drive access.

1197
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:12,760
The Nickelodeon studios in Burbank are not open to the public. Like the old ones used to be,

1198
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:15,880
they're restrictive and they need key cards and stuff. They're blocking.

1199
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:22,120
We're, it's, we're still the kids of 92. We should have automatic access to that thing

1200
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:28,760
anytime we want. So I'm, this does bother me. If there are any listeners to the show that have an

1201
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:37,320
in for us to go see the time capsule behind the gates, I, this, this, the genuinely would be very

1202
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:44,280
cool and important to me to get to check in on the time capsule. I like, I've even walked by that.

1203
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:48,600
I've like parked my car and walked around there and gone like, is it in the courtyard? Is there

1204
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:55,480
like a place I can see through the fence and see where does it even get the kind of a taste of it?

1205
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:59,480
But I don't know. I think you need, you need to know somebody. Do we know, do we know anybody?

1206
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:02,440
We know people at Cartoon Network, but I don't know if we know people in Nickelodeon. It's a good

1207
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:07,880
question. I don't know off the top of my head. I have never actually been to the Burbank Nickelodeon.

1208
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:12,760
I auditioned for some weird wizard show a couple of years ago with the closed one on sunset.

1209
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:19,720
Yeah. Were you, could you have been the new Mr. Wizard? No, it was not Mr. Wizard. It was like

1210
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:24,680
some show about a kooky wizard. And I acted like an ass in this audition for like five minutes.

1211
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:30,680
Okay. I left. I think I actually did okay. Yeah. But I did not get it. And it was not for a Mr.

1212
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:35,800
Wizard. I could look up the sides again, but I have never been on that Burbank Nick, which

1213
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:40,840
literally is very close to here. I was to where all of us. Yeah, that's true. We're all like

1214
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:45,480
within pretty close proximity. It's all equidistant. We're all equidistant. We're all equidistant.

1215
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:50,520
We can all start running and get there in a little bit. I mean, I don't know. We feel great.

1216
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:57,800
Oh man. If only we're open. We can unite at the Nick time capsule. Perfect. Yeah. There was a

1217
01:50:57,800 --> 01:51:02,600
couple articles. Can we put new stuff in there? Oh yeah. Shrek 2 nugs.

1218
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:08,760
Slime pudding. Yeah. Swamp pudding. What was it? Swamp pudding. That's right.

1219
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:14,760
There was a couple articles, but you can kind of tell it was like maybe PR people just tossing

1220
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:19,240
something off of like, oh, they're hoping to give tours of this because they build a like new office

1221
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:24,040
tower there. The five or seven story office building. It's like, oh, they're hoping to give

1222
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:29,000
tours and you could walk by where the time capsule is and like, oh, we moved it in conjunction with

1223
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:34,360
this building, this new office building. And it's like, I feel like you're falling asleep as I'm

1224
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:39,880
reading this and I could hear the sleepiness and their voice saying stuff like that. Nobody. I don't

1225
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:44,520
think anybody cares about this thing. I don't think people realize that people were, there were kids

1226
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:50,200
watching this special and thinking how this is going to be a way to frame my life. Like how much,

1227
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:56,280
how many feelings, how many emotions I'll have when I get to watch whatever now incredibly sad

1228
01:51:56,280 --> 01:52:02,280
thing occurs to open this time capsule. Like by that point, there is no Nickelodeon. There is no

1229
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:08,520
cable. Just like nothing's going on. It's just like a bad little like, it's like a sad convention. Not

1230
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:16,440
like it's like Comic-Con in 1988, not Comic-Con in the 2000s. It's like a, it's like a funeral. Like,

1231
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:20,120
all right, we got a good turnout. This is nice. Well, does anyone want to say something that's

1232
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:25,480
I'm fearing that's what the time capsule opening is going to be like. Tesla has acquired a lot of

1233
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:31,320
Paramount and Nickelodeon's programming. Tesla owns most of the world's entertainment at that point.

1234
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:38,840
And it is like, yeah, it's on fire. The time capsule is on fire. 60 year old, 65 year old,

1235
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:44,760
Elon Musk opens the capsule up and like says, took it to Mars. You have to go to Mars to see the time

1236
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:53,480
capsule. Well, now it was being dark. I, now you say that, but one of the video montages I found of

1237
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:59,960
like, here are the videos that would play throughout the tour was uploaded by the Nickelodeon rewind

1238
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:05,400
YouTube accounts. And it's so rare that these vintage videos are actually uploaded by the

1239
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:11,960
companies. We're watching like VHS rips to get ready for episodes. And this was like as good quality

1240
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:20,680
as you could get of like ripping, you know, DV tapes or ripping DV cam tapes or whatever.

1241
01:53:20,680 --> 01:53:25,880
I do appreciate that. Yeah. The Nick official YouTube has posted the clips that you'd watch

1242
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:31,800
on the studio tour. And did they post the, did they officially post the time capsule

1243
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:36,360
ceremony? I feel like they might. Or there is, there is a pretty good quality of it on YouTube.

1244
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:40,680
Yeah. The good quality with the commercials for Pizza Hut, Cheeseburger Pizza and the

1245
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:47,960
soon to open Gremlins 2. What a time to be alive 1990. Jesus Christ. All of that at once.

1246
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:54,840
Well, I mean, 1992, there's the, you got to, there's a lot of what a time to be alive because

1247
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:59,560
I mean, we could talk about some of what's in that, that capsule, but the, the maybe in my mind,

1248
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:03,960
the most notable thing is that they've like, it's, it's all been picked by kids. It's, you know,

1249
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:09,080
they've sort of old kids. What do you want to see in there? But then right before it goes down,

1250
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:14,280
who shows up? But Joey Lawrence and Joey Lawrence has a baseball cap that says,

1251
01:54:14,280 --> 01:54:22,600
whoa, 92. And that goes in there right before it goes in the ground. Will children of 2042

1252
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:30,440
find the catchphrase, whoa, as important as the 1992, as I know I did in 92.

1253
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:34,600
I would like to hope so. I would like, maybe they'll reboot

1254
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:40,520
Joey Lawrence's catchphrase, whoa, soon for a streaming service. I don't know how they'll

1255
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:45,880
do it, but woe should come back in some context. And then it's almost bizarre that there has not

1256
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:53,320
just the billion dollars in cash just like backed up to Miami Alex house to do a lazy

1257
01:54:54,920 --> 01:55:01,000
blossom reboot. Oh yeah. Well, she's got the cat show. She's got the cat show. She's doing great.

1258
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:06,360
So I guess she doesn't need to do it. Well, oh yeah. Cause like all these reboots are always

1259
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:15,880
people who need to do it. Kelsey Grammer, I know that you have more money than some small countries,

1260
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:22,280
but would you like to do four bad Frazier's? There was more story to tell for Frazier.

1261
01:55:22,280 --> 01:55:27,880
That's a different situation. This was always the intent for it to finish and then be brought back

1262
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:33,240
17 years later. How long has it been? Many, many years. And it was always the intent for it to be

1263
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:37,800
done after the death of the dad and probably without David Ike Pierce. That was always the

1264
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:44,040
plan from the creators of the show. Oh yeah. But some of the, I mean, I think, I think reboot

1265
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:51,240
punky Brewster is going to give 110% compared to like reboot Frazier, you know, maybe I don't

1266
01:55:51,240 --> 01:55:57,640
know much about your punky Brewster. Here's what I say. Reboot my brother in me. That's what I say.

1267
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:05,400
Hell yeah. Absolutely. That they didn't get to finish that show. I also, they shot the,

1268
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:12,280
see the mystery files of Shelby Wu. I liked that show a lot. What else? That one came up already.

1269
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:16,280
We did. That was like an hour ago. And I said, I didn't watch it cause I was stopped. I kind of

1270
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:20,200
was not watching. I was watching different junk at that point. Oh, I got that confused with something

1271
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:24,440
else, but that, that was later. They were still like even up to shooting the live action of the

1272
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:29,880
early SpongeBob's they were shooting down there, you know, Gullah Gullah Island. There was sort of

1273
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:36,760
a, like a reprise of, they attempted to get a new little pack of shows going, Slime Time Live,

1274
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:41,400
their equivalent of Total Request Live and some other shows it didn't really seem to take. And

1275
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:47,880
once that little pack of shows didn't happen, they, and so many operations had moved to Los

1276
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:53,880
Angeles to, for a while it was Sunset Gower, which side note is where the Chevy Chase talk show was

1277
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:59,160
shot. So if you ever get to go there again for anything, just know that similar with these

1278
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:04,520
declarations that are made that are proved to be not true. You can watch footage of Johnny Grant,

1279
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:11,000
the mayor of Hollywood's, christening it the Chevy Chase Theater only for the sign to be thrown in

1280
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:18,440
the garbage seven weeks later. Oh man. That's where, so Latter Day All That was in the same space as,

1281
01:57:18,440 --> 01:57:24,760
as the Chevy Chase show. But yeah, so it all, you know, they just sort of stopped making shows there

1282
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:32,520
combined with how Universal Studios was not really a working movie studio anymore for the most part.

1283
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:37,720
And same with Disney MGM Studios is everything sort of changed their premise. Nobody cared about

1284
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:44,440
behind the scenes anymore. It was just that natural thing that happened to both parks. So they quietly

1285
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:49,240
closed it. There was a little window of time where they made the color scheme a little less

1286
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:54,760
obnoxious, but also a little more boring. I think it had to be obnoxious. That's the way

1287
01:57:54,760 --> 01:58:03,320
Nickelodeon Studios has to look. You need cow hide. So yeah, 2005 it sort of quietly shuts down. And

1288
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:09,240
then before the Blue Man Group shows up is mostly non-operations. They sort of aren't doing anything

1289
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:13,320
with those stages, you know, which happens, like, you know, places where you make shows

1290
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:19,160
sit empty and that makes sense. Unless you're a YouTuber and I don't know. Oh man.

1291
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:27,240
People act as if like, you know, the Sistine Chapel got bombed. Like it's crazy.

1292
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:33,080
The people's and look, there's drama at all this for me. I really want the time capsule to be

1293
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:40,680
protected. However, calm down YouTubers. Like the studio closed. Like it's not your mom didn't get

1294
01:58:40,680 --> 01:58:48,040
shot. Cool it. Well, and there's a lot of 2012, 2013 urban exploration when there was still a

1295
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:55,000
lot of remnants and they were still kind of standing off the rough edges of YouTube. People

1296
01:58:55,000 --> 01:59:00,520
are a little more polished on YouTube now, but some of those were on goddamn nightmare to watch.

1297
01:59:01,240 --> 01:59:07,240
There's, I mean, these are not bad. Specifically, like the most popular video that you'll find that

1298
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:13,160
refers to the site of Nickelodeon Studios as abandoned. It is not a bad video and it's not

1299
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:19,400
badly made. I would maybe take umbrage at the phrase abandoned. Because abandoned implies like,

1300
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:25,240
that's like a nuclear site that nobody could go into for 20 years. This is like,

1301
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:29,800
there's a ride next door. Like they're going to do something. This is not abandoned. I guess

1302
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:34,680
it's a little weird that they kept, you know, posters of Ren and Stimpy painted on the wall

1303
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:40,600
or that you can go in the bathroom and there's still green tiles representing Gack. Like they're

1304
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:46,520
being such odd little remnants is definitely strange. Abandoned, I don't know. And then really,

1305
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:52,200
I had a problem with a less popular video that is where the thumbnail is a picture of Nickelodeon

1306
01:59:52,200 --> 02:00:00,280
Studios and then a big title splashed across it. Left to rot. I listen.

1307
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:07,560
Do you think there are corpses inside the building? Cool it, YouTube.

1308
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:14,040
Yeah, I mean, we've talked on the show before how some of these videos, even things that were like

1309
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:20,040
kind of legitimately abandoned, like, you know, Six Flags in New Orleans or something, everyone is

1310
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:25,240
acting in those videos. And this video, like, you know, Indiana Jones and they've just discovered

1311
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:30,840
like some sort of temple that's been lost to time or something. Oh my God, it's here. I can't believe

1312
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:36,280
it. Like there's a lot big, there's a lot of theatrics. There's a lot of hyperbole I feel like.

1313
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:44,440
And this, yes, your point is correct. That, you know, the Rip Ride rocket is mere feet away.

1314
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:49,640
They know this exists here. They just haven't figured out what to do with it.

1315
02:00:49,640 --> 02:00:54,680
There's plenty of examples. For instance, some of a big part of Tomorrowland, you could say.

1316
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:59,960
Oh, yeah. I mean, I know there's more things in there, but it's like sort of been abandoned.

1317
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:07,960
Yeah, yeah. I just don't know. Abandoned, there's just drama to it. That's like what, like a person,

1318
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:14,760
a person who's, that's like when the mom in AI leaves the robot David and drives away in the car.

1319
02:01:14,760 --> 02:01:20,280
That's like, that's abandoning. I don't know when it's like a building and a corporation left

1320
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:25,320
and the corporation is fine. They're doing better than they were. Yeah. Like there's nothing sad

1321
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:30,760
about the story. I don't think. Other, I mean, look, I am wistful for all this stuff. I'm nostalgic

1322
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:37,720
for this stuff, but it is very, you know, this, this was the home of early nineties Nickelodeon.

1323
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:43,320
It is not the home of today Nickelodeon and I'm okay with that. It's nice to look at pictures

1324
02:01:43,320 --> 02:01:49,240
and watch videos and remember it. And I don't need, why would I sign a petition saying,

1325
02:01:49,240 --> 02:01:54,760
bring back Nick Studios? Nothing's going to happen if I do that. Why would they do it?

1326
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:57,640
That's funny you bring a petition because I have something for the very end, but I won't,

1327
02:01:57,640 --> 02:02:03,400
I'll save that for the very end. But yes, I, I, my philosophy and I'm not even being funny here is the

1328
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:08,680
energy has to move elsewhere. You know, it doesn't always have to stay somewhere. It doesn't always

1329
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:13,880
have to be in an institution. It doesn't have to be in Orlando. Things can change. Things can move.

1330
02:02:14,440 --> 02:02:19,640
There's a new fun place maybe for kids now. I am not aware of where it is, but it has to be,

1331
02:02:19,640 --> 02:02:23,720
it should be somewhere. Maybe it's important. I think it's online. I think it's like not a

1332
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:28,840
literal place. I think it's in our hearts is what you're saying. It's in our hearts and on our phones.

1333
02:02:29,480 --> 02:02:36,840
You know, I, I do miss, uh, they, they, they don't lean on this, which I appreciated as a kid. And I

1334
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:41,960
really appreciate now they were like, and we're not the magic kingdom, you know, we're not stuffy.

1335
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:48,280
We're not this, but they didn't lean on like being like the anti Disney, but I do like the devil may

1336
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:57,320
care kind of like, uh, fun of like early Nickelodeon. And I, I feel like entertainment like that didn't

1337
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:03,640
grow up with us. Entertainment got so serious. Like I've been thinking lately about like,

1338
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:09,560
and it's probably because, uh, you know, Disney bought them, but like a Marvel and Star Wars are

1339
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:18,360
just so deadly serious now, like so capital I important. Uh, and, and in a way that like

1340
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:25,400
the comics never sat with me, they, I never, that's like, I made them important because I was a kid,

1341
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:33,080
but like, I don't know. I wish that Nickelodeon vibe had continued into more media, you know?

1342
02:03:33,080 --> 02:03:37,400
Yeah. Well, that's, I mean, I think, I think you can make the argument Star Wars is more serious,

1343
02:03:37,400 --> 02:03:41,160
at least the Marvel, not that Marvel doesn't have its own like set of problems, but like,

1344
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:46,280
at least you'll get like a guardians of the galaxy Christmas special, which I don't know if it's

1345
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:51,080
funny yet. It's not out obviously, but at least that's the, that's the spirit I'm looking for

1346
02:03:51,080 --> 02:03:56,680
in some of this like crazy. Yeah. It's a little more of a vibe. Yeah. Yeah. Getting rid of the

1347
02:03:56,680 --> 02:04:03,640
hyperspace hoopla for Star Wars. Come on. Yeah. I'll go on record saying I'm fine with that one.

1348
02:04:03,640 --> 02:04:09,720
We want to see Darth Vader. We want to see Darth Vader twerk. Okay. To popular music. That's what

1349
02:04:09,720 --> 02:04:16,840
we like. Um, so yes, I agree. I'm not signing a petition for that one, but feel free to go ahead

1350
02:04:16,840 --> 02:04:20,840
and sign if you wish. Okay. Well, we'll put that together. Do you want to see Darth Vader twerk

1351
02:04:20,840 --> 02:04:28,280
again in a hyperspace hoopla to popular music? Um, what is your, uh, what, what, what do you have?

1352
02:04:28,280 --> 02:04:33,800
Or maybe we are. Well, I mean, I'll do a real, okay, here, I found a petition and it involves

1353
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:46,200
kid cuisine. It says, it says make kid cuisine less depressing. And it's seven people have signed

1354
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:51,560
it and it's made by somebody named concern citizen. And the picture of the item on this,

1355
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:59,960
in this petition is kid cuisine pizza painter and it's cheese pizza and it's a, it's a Casey

1356
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:08,040
and he's dressed like a French painter, I guess. And he's painting, uh, like tomato sauce, a face

1357
02:05:08,040 --> 02:05:13,960
on just a, I don't even know, I guess it's supposed to be crust. And it's, he's holding like a little

1358
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:21,320
sauce packet of tomato sauce, like a little like Taco bell sauce shaped package. And he's painting

1359
02:05:21,320 --> 02:05:27,000
a gross face of tomato sauce on this little piece of crust, a really perturbed face,

1360
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:32,760
almost like an angry Nickelodeon adult. Yeah. Um, and then there's some sort of muff muffin or

1361
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:38,040
something in this as well. That's a brownie. Is that a brownie? Oh yeah. You're right. Yeah,

1362
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:42,680
it's brownie. Oh yeah. You're right. It looks like it has a bite taken out of it or something.

1363
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:46,680
Like it looks like incomplete somehow. That's how you know it's good.

1364
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:53,720
So yeah, so anyway, that apparently we're not the first people to have this thought that kid

1365
02:05:53,720 --> 02:05:59,240
cuisine is a little bit strange or depressing. Should we, should we pump this petition up then

1366
02:05:59,240 --> 02:06:03,480
make kid cuisine less depressing? Cause they're trying to get to a hundred and only seven have

1367
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:08,040
signed. Should we, uh, I don't know when this was posted. I don't, uh, well, but I think maybe

1368
02:06:08,040 --> 02:06:14,040
everybody should. Oh yeah, we will post that. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, uh, you know,

1369
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:19,720
yeah, we, we talk about, you know, this has all been about nostalgia and, uh, you know, bringing

1370
02:06:19,720 --> 02:06:24,120
back the energy of stuff we liked when we were kids. And I think this is a good first step. Sign

1371
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:29,400
the, sign the petition to make kid cuisine less depressing. You can probably, we'll post it,

1372
02:06:29,400 --> 02:06:35,000
but you can probably Google that phrase. Um, I like the description too. Kid cuisine is sad to me.

1373
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:41,640
It should be less sad. I don't know. I don't know what part of a pizza painting,

1374
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:47,880
little like French Pierre of a penguin. I don't know how this isn't a cheer in this concerned

1375
02:06:47,880 --> 02:06:53,480
citizen up, but well, I think the characters and the logo are still fun. I think they're saying the

1376
02:06:53,480 --> 02:06:58,200
food itself is a little, so they make it match, you know, make it fun like the guys, you know?

1377
02:06:58,840 --> 02:07:04,360
Yeah. Um, all right. Well, everybody get out there and sign this petition. This is very important.

1378
02:07:04,840 --> 02:07:09,640
That's, that's piece of homework. Number one piece of homework. Number two, if you have any way to

1379
02:07:09,640 --> 02:07:15,800
get us to go look at the site of the time capsule, please let us know if there's any weird strings.

1380
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:21,320
You can help pull for the good boys. Come on. You want to help us out? We've given you some laughs

1381
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:28,440
over the years. Um, you owe us. Come on. I just want to burn the hammer CD. I just want to rip

1382
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:35,640
it to my laptop. Um, and, uh, well, let me say, well, let me say, all right, that's the, that's

1383
02:07:35,640 --> 02:07:42,200
the homework. You survived podcast, the ride Nickelodeon studios edition. Um, and, uh, you know,

1384
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:47,720
find us on the social media at podcast, the ride merchant T public and, uh, for three bonus episodes

1385
02:07:47,720 --> 02:07:53,560
a month, go to patreon.com slash podcast, the ride. I rushed through all that to say we got, uh,

1386
02:07:53,640 --> 02:08:01,800
an episode coming out next week that has a little bit of runoff of Nickelodeon studios. Um, it

1387
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:06,200
involves the time capsule. We didn't talk a ton about that ceremony and there's something that

1388
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:12,760
happens in it that was so inspiring to us that it inspired a whole other second gate episode. So it's

1389
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:17,080
not quite Nickelodeon studios part two, but it's something else related to the time caps. So if you

1390
02:08:17,080 --> 02:08:21,160
want to hear more time capsule talk, head to patreon.com slash podcast, the ride, there'll be

1391
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:32,760
something up next week. Um, well, uh, good stuff. Um, uh, do we feel, um, as high as if we've, uh,

1392
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:39,080
huffed some GAC? I, yes, I, or yeah, tasted, uh, slime or GAC or, or what was the other one?

1393
02:08:39,880 --> 02:08:46,280
Chud? Floam? Flood? Uh, uh, yeah, I feel, I feel good. I feel like, um,

1394
02:08:46,440 --> 02:08:50,680
I feel like I actually got to go there. Now, you know, I feel like now I've kind of implanted

1395
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:57,000
this memory that I did get to go there as a kid and maybe it's like, maybe like I won't, you know,

1396
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:00,280
wake up in the middle of the night and be upset at my parents for not taking me now.

1397
02:09:00,280 --> 02:09:03,080
Cause I feel like I've been there and I've explored on this episode.

1398
02:09:03,080 --> 02:09:09,640
You know, if you just go outside and hose down the street a little, um, and just stand there,

1399
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:19,480
cause it's pretty hot in Southern California right now and play the audio of the geyser and look away,

1400
02:09:19,480 --> 02:09:23,640
like looking to the distance, you can trick yourself into thinking the geyser is behind you.

1401
02:09:24,280 --> 02:09:32,600
Just wet, wet concrete. Wet. Just the wettest empty, like no one else around soaking wet concrete.

1402
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:37,560
Yeah. And play kind of a muffled klaxon and then maybe like, and then when that's over,

1403
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:42,920
play like a, just like a really quiet version of the Doug theme. And that's how you'll feel.

1404
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:47,720
Do it in like an office park and just imagine that one of the walls you're looking at is painted

1405
02:09:47,720 --> 02:09:53,640
like a cow and then you'll feel like you're back at the world head, world kids heads headquarters,

1406
02:09:53,640 --> 02:09:56,840
the best place that could ever be and ever was.

1407
02:09:56,840 --> 02:10:00,440
Uh, well I'm gathering my materials to do this right now as we speak.

1408
02:10:02,440 --> 02:10:06,920
I'd also like to say, I just see that, uh, Gavin Newsom just announced that on June 15th,

1409
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:10,040
Los Angeles will be allowed to get super sloppy again.

1410
02:10:11,080 --> 02:10:18,280
All right. All right. So I won't, as soon as I leave the Kid Cuisine depressing petition,

1411
02:10:18,280 --> 02:10:25,480
I won't go sign the recall petition. Done deal, Gavin. Thanks for it.

1412
02:10:25,480 --> 02:10:28,520
Gavin Newsom, thanks for a super sloppy summer.

1413
02:10:31,480 --> 02:10:35,640
Is that under other petitions you might like under the Kid Cuisine one?

1414
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:37,400
Recall a governor?

1415
02:10:38,680 --> 02:10:41,640
It's got to be. It's the same person concerned citizen.

1416
02:10:41,640 --> 02:10:42,200
Oh no.

1417
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:46,760
Delete it. Delete it. We're getting super sloppy this summer. It's going to be a blast.

1418
02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:48,680
Thanks for listening everybody. Goodbye.

1419
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:49,000
Bye.
