1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Yeah, well, here's another one today.

4
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:11,560
It's a gosh darn team up with Zach Reno and Jess McKenna on the Off Book Podcast crew to

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,560
do an improvised Country Bear Jamboree.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,440
We're doing a real show, not just talking about one.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:38,080
We are Country Bear Jamboree Week Day 5 Podcast The Ride.

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,080
Hey guys.

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,080
Hey.

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,000
Hey, isn't it so nice that Podcast The Ride and Off Book are getting together to see-

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's like we don't hang out enough.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We don't hang out.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,560
We're so busy working, doing podcasts and we don't, we never like, it's so nice to get

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,400
to like go out and see a show.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,800
We like have a share a culture between us events and talk about them and not necessarily for

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
content.

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:05,240
Well, when Mike came to me and was like, do you and Jess, we got, we have five tickets

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,640
to go see a Country Bear Jamboree.

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,480
And I said, do you mean the Country Bear Jamboree?

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,040
And he said, no, a Country Bear Jamboree.

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,440
Very hard to get into the, the one.

22
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,720
But there are Country Bear Jamborees happening all over.

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,720
You just got to know where to go.

24
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,720
And some of them are great.

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,720
The Indy circuit.

26
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,040
I was going to say, I don't know too much about them.

27
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,040
It's there.

28
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,560
They're so I'm excited to see this, but yeah,

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,100
overall the bears are safe.

30
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,100
That's what I can tell you.

31
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,320
I don't, you don't, you never know, but you don't really have to be worried about danger.

32
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,320
Oh, okay.

33
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,120
You don't mean like, like real bears or like bears being scary or-

34
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,480
It's definitely not just a room where there's a bunch of loose bears running around.

35
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,520
There's there's kind of a control to it.

36
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,400
And the idea is that they're actually, they're trained and they do music and sing songs about

37
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
their life.

38
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,640
I didn't even know there was a theater in this part of the Angeles national forest.

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,560
That's what the it's see if you're like a city dweller, you know, it's if you're trying

41
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,160
to just stay around the Orpheum or the ACE theater or whatever, you're probably not going

42
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,160
to get a Country Bear Jamboree.

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,640
But if you hike, yeah, you'll find it all over.

44
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,680
Can I say thank you for dropping a pin because otherwise I think I would have gotten lost.

45
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,120
And Jessica McKenna and I would not have been able to make it out here to the woods.

46
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,120
Thank you, Zach Reno.

47
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,120
Oh, yeah.

48
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
Well, it's no problem.

49
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,280
I actually learned how to get here because Van Morrison played here last week.

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,280
Oh, secret shows.

51
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Okay.

52
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,280
Yeah, one of the secret shows.

53
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
He's doing the whole album.

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
When he's topical material.

55
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
Yeah.

56
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
All his anti-mass stuff.

57
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
Yeah.

58
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
Yeah.

59
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,280
He's trying to stay off the grid.

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,880
So what you can do more easily in a cabin in the woods.

61
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

62
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,040
So he's playing to mostly an audience of woodland creatures.

63
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,480
But that's probably good for him just to keep workshopping.

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,480
Yeah.

65
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
Yeah.

66
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
So he's not going to be a witch really, except for the birds.

67
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,480
Except for the birds.

68
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,480
Well, shall we, Mike Carlson?

69
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,480
Yeah, let's go in here.

70
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,480
Let's go get him.

71
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Head on into the theater as well.

72
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
Yeah, sure.

73
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
Oh, gosh.

74
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
This stump is so cozy.

75
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
Oh, yeah.

76
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,480
Oh, wait.

77
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,480
We each have it.

78
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,480
There's like a number carved in it.

79
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480
Yeah.

80
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,480
Did you want to be in four or do you like the aisle?

81
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,760
I like to sit in the stump.

82
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,760
My tickets.

83
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,760
I'm weird.

84
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,760
No, I get that.

85
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,760
We'll scoot down.

86
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,760
We'll scoot down.

87
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,760
Sorry.

88
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
No, no.

89
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,760
You can sit between Jessica and I.

90
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
Sorry.

91
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,760
No, it's fine.

92
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,760
I don't care.

93
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
No.

94
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,760
It's a thing.

95
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,760
No, I get it.

96
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,760
I get it.

97
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,960
Do you guys want any like concessions before we start?

98
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Oh, yeah.

99
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
Yeah, yeah.

100
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
What do they have?

101
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
Oh, grubs.

102
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,960
Yeah, there's grubs mostly.

103
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Popcorn.

104
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Not popcorn.

105
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Popcorn.

106
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Yeah.

107
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
I'll take a grubs, I think.

108
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,960
Yeah.

109
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,960
Popcorns are too risky.

110
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
Like what is it?

111
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
What is it actually?

112
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

113
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
Grubs, at least you know what you're getting.

114
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,240
There's a peppermint bark as well.

115
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,240
Oh.

116
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,240
I wonder if that's what we think it is.

117
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,640
Do you think it's what we think it is or do you think it's probably actual bark?

118
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,640
Actual bark, yeah.

119
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,640
I wouldn't mind that.

120
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,440
They just, some peppermint got stuck to it.

121
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,440
Yeah.

122
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,440
But they don't really blend the best.

123
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
Yeah, it's not blended.

124
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
Oh, I think it's starting.

125
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,440
Oh, yeah.

126
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,440
Boys.

127
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,440
Wow.

128
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,440
Country bird camp, baby.

129
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
How did they get the lights to dim?

130
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:04,400
Have you found your way into your stump?

131
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,040
Are you all comfortable sitting out there?

132
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
Everybody fit?

133
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,340
Your seat ain't too big for your seat.

134
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,240
Or too small for your ego?

135
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,840
Are you all ready to hear some music?

136
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,240
I can't hear you.

137
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,480
Are you all ready to hear some music?

138
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,760
Oh, sorry.

139
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,760
Yeah.

140
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,640
I love you, Bears.

141
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:36,680
Well get ready because what we're about to do has never been attempted before.

142
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,600
Do a show following Van Morrison on the schedule.

143
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
We've never done it.

144
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Van Morrison was our opener, that's what I say.

145
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
That's what I like to say too.

146
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,600
He hit the road. This is our place in the woods and we're gonna tell you a little bit about what it's like to live here.

147
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Yeah, maybe we should introduce ourselves.

148
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
My name's Rudy.

149
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Oh hey Rudy. Oh it's just me, Cur-San-Thum-um-Su.

150
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,600
It's me, Oh Turnip.

151
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Why I'm good old Gumfrey.

152
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
And I'm Juniper.

153
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Have you ever seen a bear with another bear singing a song?

154
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
A song.

155
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Have you ever seen a bear with another bear singing a song?

156
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Only if you come out to these flungy woods.

157
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Well, if you do, you might start to think that you could sing along.

158
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Go ahead, try it.

159
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Because we're a bear and we're with another bear singing a song.

160
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Sounds so lovely.

161
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,600
We're a bear group that likes to be safe on stage.

162
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Safe on stage.

163
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,600
You don't have to worry, we're not gonna attack you.

164
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
In an angry rage.

165
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,600
We're not gonna say weird stuff.

166
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,600
We're not gonna be offensive, is what I'm saying.

167
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,600
We're not gonna be political.

168
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,600
We're not up on current events.

169
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Have you ever seen a bear with another bear singing a song?

170
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Well how about five bears?

171
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Have you ever seen a bear with another bear singing a song?

172
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
I suppose they have now.

173
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Hey you're right.

174
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:56,600
You've seen a bear, one or two.

175
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Singing a song, singing just for you.

176
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Now you've seen five bears singing and a singing and a singing a song.

177
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Singing a song.

178
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,600
If you're brave enough we won't attack you if you try to sing along.

179
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
I guess we're supposed to sing along.

180
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,600
Okay.

181
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,600
Have you ever seen a bear with another bear singing a song?

182
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Yeah, I'm not mad.

183
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Have you ever seen a bear with another bear singing a song?

184
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,600
It would be helpful if they put the words up on the screen.

185
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
We just heard this the first time.

186
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:44,600
Hey good job all you fun folks singing along.

187
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
That one's Ruby, what's the name?

188
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:53,600
You're with the bears and you're singing and you're singing a song.

189
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
Juniper's cute.

190
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Yeah.

191
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Yeah I like.

192
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Is that Juniper with the jug?

193
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,600
Yeah, Juniper has a jug.

194
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Yeah, Juniper's really cute but Juniper seems like he's falling asleep.

195
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Now I do have to tell you all sometimes I go off and when I am awake you gotta keep your eye on me.

196
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:21,600
So be forewarned I have covered my legal basis and you signed away and it rots when you bought this ticket.

197
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Whoa, does Juniper have a knife?

198
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Wait, so what happens when he falls asleep?

199
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Well he falls asleep and when he's awake you gotta keep his eye on him.

200
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Okay, yeah, alright.

201
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:41,600
And we sang a song.

202
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Yeah.

203
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Oh yeah that was great.

204
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Oh boy, it's just so nice to be back in the company of the bears who I love harmonizing the most with.

205
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Oh you know it's just so special to be out here on a moonlit night looking at the faces of my family favorite bears.

206
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Now all you youngins you may not remember this but Van Morrison was here somewhat recently.

207
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
That's right.

208
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Yeah, I heard about it.

209
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Boy your memory's going. We talked about this nearly a few minutes ago.

210
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
You don't remember when you came in the place, did you?

211
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Don't mind old turnip.

212
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Old turnip, old turnip. We already spoke about Van Morrison and how he was our opening act.

213
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Where did I put my hat? Do I have it?

214
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Oh no.

215
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Oh it's right here on my head.

216
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Old turnip, that's why we keep 25 hats on the ground. See you always got one even if you forget.

217
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,600
These old hats change so much these days.

218
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Oh old turnip.

219
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Well now we've got more hats than I ever seen. Some are blue, some are green, some are wide, some are thin.

220
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Pick a hat and put your hat right in. If you want another hat you want more.

221
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:16,600
We've got 25 hats right here on the floor. Some are big, some are small, but they're all hats after all.

222
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Now this one's got a feather and I gotta say it looks pretty nice.

223
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,600
But you gotta be careful about every hat cause everyone is covered in lice.

224
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Every hat, oh when you pick a hat oh you might want to switch.

225
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,600
But it doesn't matter which hat you put on your head because it's gonna give you an itch.

226
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
This one sure does.

227
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,600
This one's black and this one's white. This one's made out of a rug.

228
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:59,600
This one's straw and this one's grass. But all of them are covered in bugs.

229
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:06,600
We gotta stop storing our clothes in a closet full of bugs. That's what I know.

230
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:13,600
We gotta get those dang bugs out of here before our family can grow. We have to raise a family too.

231
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:27,600
We're trying to raise a family with all these hats.

232
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Well thank you for reminding me. I was wondering what all these hats were doing out on the floor.

233
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Oh we just told you. We did a dang song about it.

234
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Now be careful when you put these on your head because some of them are covered in bugs.

235
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Oh thanks old turnip.

236
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
You're welcome.

237
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,600
It's best to humor remain it.

238
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Old turnip you should do those puzzles with numbers to keep your mind sharp.

239
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
The Sudoku?

240
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
The Sudoku, yeah.

241
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Why won't you Sudoku?

242
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Now if I remember correctly, y'all were working on a bit of a tune about a Sudoku.

243
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Yeah, oh yeah we were doing that. I was having a problem though figuring out what it was and how it worked again as far as the Sudoku.

244
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,600
But I love the word Sudoku. I love the idea of it.

245
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,600
I just end up with a page with the numbers one through nine scrolled all over it.

246
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Well I think that's a mighty good step Juniper since that's basically the nature of the game.

247
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,600
It's a start. I've been trying to channel my bear-like urges into more productive activities.

248
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
I think that's grand Juniper.

249
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Keeping your paws busy. That's what it's about.

250
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,600
That's right.

251
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Because you're the one most likely of us to get a mauling.

252
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,600
That's what the knife is for but I'm trying to wean myself off of it.

253
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Now I knew ever since you were little Juniper that you were dangerous if I didn't keep my eye on you.

254
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Now with Chrysanthemum I ain't never had to worry about that.

255
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:03,600
No, no you don't have to watch old Chrysanthemum Sue unless you're watching her do a dance.

256
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Now I'll take your eyes on the stage while Chrysanthemum Sue presents part of the Sugar Plum Ballet from the Nutcrackers.

257
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,600
That's right this is our holiday show y'all.

258
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:26,600
And hit and one two three one two three part of the ray and spin.

259
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:34,600
And arabesque in second position and you can do it too.

260
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
They want us to do it too?

261
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
I think they want us to do it too.

262
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
That can't be right.

263
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,600
I don't know if I can ballet.

264
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
It's ballet that can't be right.

265
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
I don't know if he's moo I have not a dent on the top.

266
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Everybody get up and do the dance.

267
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Okay that's fine.

268
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Ever look in on your feet and dance.

269
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Oh he's brandishing his move.

270
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,600
And part of the ray and part of the ray and aeroette and spin.

271
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
That's not right.

272
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Arabesque in second position don't make us start it again.

273
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,600
You call that an arabesque?

274
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:13,600
Where is your turnout we don't want to eat you please try to move from your hips.

275
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
They're all getting mad.

276
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,600
That is better and that looks better and give it a cute little dip.

277
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Alright they ain't doing it send security out into the audience to make them do it.

278
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,600
The security bears are much more frightening than the second one.

279
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:35,600
Security bears are always mad so it's not just me for once and that puts my mind at ease.

280
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,600
Oh my gosh these bears are I mean okay just everyone.

281
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,600
We're far from the worst people here as long as we try we're going to be fine.

282
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:51,600
And part of the ray and part of the ray and aeroette and spin.

283
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Security bears will eat you alive if you do not come in.

284
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Rough up the one and see three.

285
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Bring them up here bring them up here bring one of them up here on stage.

286
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Make an example of them.

287
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Why me?

288
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Okay just tell me how to do the moves or just grab me gently and I will try to do them.

289
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Alright here you go.

290
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Ouch that's not gentle.

291
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Part of the ray and part of the ray and aeroette and spin.

292
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,600
They're more delicate than your bears.

293
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:32,600
I could simply crush your body and tear off all of your limbs.

294
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
No please don't.

295
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:41,600
But I won't if you try just give it your all.

296
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,600
Part of the ray now part of the ray will eat you if you fall.

297
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Don't fall Scott.

298
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Don't fall.

299
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
But I'm up on only one toe I've never done this.

300
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
You've got it.

301
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Oh they're not much for yoga.

302
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Oh my god his joints his joints are manipulated.

303
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Part of the ray and part of the ray and aeroette and spin.

304
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,600
This isn't so bad now that I'm trying it.

305
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Bear ballet is kind of fun.

306
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,600
I'm glad that I've tried but please let me go.

307
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Juniper is that a gun?

308
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
It's okay.

309
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Now this is for my protection but I'm just showing you it so you know I have it.

310
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,600
We're not going to get political but that's going to be for protection.

311
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,600
It's for protection.

312
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Now keep up the moves or else we're going to be playing Mumbledy Pagle.

313
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Don't worry about Juniper.

314
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,600
It's just the right for a bear to bear arms.

315
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,600
That's so funny.

316
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
That's so funny.

317
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
Don't hurt me.

318
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Let's give it up for our volunteer.

319
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Now all you have to do is one final move.

320
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Okay.

321
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,600
You're going to run and jump and I'm going to do the dirty dance and lift with you.

322
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Okay.

323
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
That's not the other way.

324
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Do you trust me?

325
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
I guess I have no choice.

326
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
You trust me.

327
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
I trust you.

328
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
You're my god today.

329
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Everyone clap.

330
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,600
Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott.

331
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Here we go.

332
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,600
He has the time of his life.

333
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Bear arm.

334
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Okay.

335
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
You only dug your claws into my chest a little bit.

336
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,600
That was kind of invigorating.

337
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
You can return to your seat now.

338
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Thank you for, let's give Scott a big hand and remind you that pause can't help but do a little Mumbling.

339
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,600
That's true.

340
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Guys, okay.

341
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
You need to stay in line.

342
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600
I can't say, I wasn't pretending.

343
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,600
I'm so jealous that I didn't get to get, but that was so cool.

344
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,600
It was really, it was like really playing along with how dangerous that was.

345
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Scott, that bear lifted you into the air.

346
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
That was amazing.

347
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
That was great.

348
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Grace, thy name is Scott.

349
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:00,600
If they hadn't have confiscated our phones at the door so that we could be in the moment, I totally would have had a great video.

350
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Yeah, me too.

351
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
I'm kind of only focusing on the negative.

352
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,600
I guess actually I unlocked kind of a beautiful graceful side of myself.

353
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,600
You're bleeding a little bit, but I feel like it'll be fine.

354
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,600
I can't, I mean, like it seemed like you were playing along with the danger of it as well.

355
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,600
But did you like actually feel, I mean, I thought I could tell they were kidding.

356
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
I wasn't like actually scared.

357
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,600
No, I think some of these cuts and scars might be permanent.

358
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,600
I think I have these forever now, but hey, it's nice to have some souvenirs of a visit.

359
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Scott, the security bear is offering you a bandage.

360
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Okay.

361
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Can I put it on myself, please?

362
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
No, they're putting it on Scott.

363
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,600
No, they're putting it on and they're mostly using claws.

364
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
No, you're making new cuts.

365
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
They're cutting him.

366
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
Oh, well.

367
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
It was a ginger ending.

368
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,600
You know what?

369
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,600
One more might as well.

370
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,600
Oh, you guys, I'm getting a little used to it.

371
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
I think I like a country bear.

372
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Just real quick.

373
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,600
There's just for my own sort of identification.

374
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
That's Chrysanthemum Sue.

375
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Old turnip.

376
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Old turnip.

377
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
There's Juniper.

378
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
Is that Rodney?

379
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
My name's Rudy.

380
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,600
I can hear you.

381
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Yeah, we can all hear you.

382
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,600
The whole damn theater can hear you.

383
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
We'll be black.

384
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Hi, y'all.

385
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
It's a small house.

386
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
It's a small house.

387
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
It's an intimate affair.

388
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
What's that one's name?

389
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
Gunther?

390
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Good old Gumfrey, I believe.

391
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Gumfrey is his name, yeah.

392
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
That's right.

393
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Know it and fear it.

394
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Yeah.

395
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
If you got any other questions, I guess just ask them out loud.

396
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,600
You don't normally do a question and answer part of a country bear jamboree.

397
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Yeah, but I don't know.

398
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
I guess we could.

399
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Has anybody got any questions?

400
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,600
Yeah, me too.

401
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,600
I would need anyone to see my hat.

402
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
There's 25 hats on the ground.

403
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Oh, well.

404
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Don't turn up and remember they all got bugs.

405
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,600
Well, if it wasn't, if it don't have bugs on it, it's no hat of mine.

406
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Yeah, I'd just like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that we have merchandise

407
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,600
in the lobby and if you want to go out and get it anytime you can.

408
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Me?

409
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Well, you can.

410
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,600
I don't know what's going on.

411
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,600
You could wear your own merchandise, but it's a delicate line.

412
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Yeah.

413
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Yeah, and plus the merchandise is just hats with bugs on it anyway.

414
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,600
So you already got a bunch.

415
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
You got 25.

416
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
That's a good point.

417
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
I don't like it.

418
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,600
But listen, good old Gumfrey's recently divorced, so I'm going to need some souvenir sales for

419
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
the Alamoni payments.

420
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
I remember your wedding.

421
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
It was a beautiful day.

422
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Oh, it was wonderful to have all of you there, except for you, Juniper.

423
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Sorry I didn't invite you.

424
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,600
We were going through a rough patch.

425
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,600
You know how it is.

426
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Bro, you're the right call.

427
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
I have a question.

428
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Why are, why, why'd you get a divorce?

429
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Oh, geez.

430
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
Well, are you serious?

431
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
I don't know.

432
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,600
They said they were opening a Q and A.

433
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:52,600
Well, you know, if I'm reflecting on it, I guess I, I'd have to say that my, my, my

434
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,600
bare eyes started to stray.

435
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,600
I might've had a, might've been a party to some of this myself.

436
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:05,600
It's a sad, it's a sad story, but I guess I could try to tell it.

437
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,600
If people's, everybody's hearts are willing to break a bit.

438
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Yeah, we'll make sure that we fill in any sort of details that you leave out.

439
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Okay, sure.

440
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,600
Yeah, we remember all of it.

441
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Oh, well, it was a, it was a few years ago.

442
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,600
I remember it well.

443
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,600
Well, I got married and she was the, the belle of the ball.

444
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
Oh, yeah.

445
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:38,600
And then it just started to seem like she wasn't true love at all.

446
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:46,600
My eyes started to stray and I decided to take a risk.

447
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:52,600
I realized I was more in love with all of my tics.

448
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:59,600
They lived on me and I started to find them appealing.

449
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:06,600
So when it comes to affairs, I started wheeling and dealing.

450
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:13,600
There's a little cabin in the woods and I arranged a romantic time.

451
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,600
I made love to all of my tics.

452
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,600
They gave me a disease they call Lyme.

453
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,600
He caught the love bug.

454
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
Oh, you know I did.

455
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
He caught the love bug.

456
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,600
And it hurt.

457
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Breaking his wife's little heart, he was supposed to be thinking of.

458
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,600
But he caught the love bug.

459
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
It happens to everyone.

460
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,600
He caught the love bug.

461
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
Oh, well, literally.

462
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,600
Oh, and he was falling in and out of love.

463
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Yeah, well, I remember when he went to the woman and he said,

464
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,600
Hey, I got a, I got a thing I got to ask you.

465
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,600
Is it possible we become poly?

466
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,600
Can we be poly with bugs?

467
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,600
Yeah, that's right.

468
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,600
I said, would there be willingness to open things up?

469
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
And she kicked you out.

470
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Is that what, is that what, and chased you around the riverbank.

471
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Yeah.

472
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
That's pretty accurate.

473
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:14,600
She said she didn't want to be in a polycure with you and 300 tics.

474
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,600
And then she came back and said, how do you even make love to a bug?

475
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
You're a bear.

476
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
Yeah.

477
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
She had a lot of logistical questions.

478
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
She wanted to see a chart.

479
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Yeah.

480
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,600
She made you draw it.

481
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,600
You got to have rules in those kinds of non-traditional relationships

482
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,600
or else they fall apart.

483
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Even I know that.

484
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
Sure.

485
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Well, I bet I decided to describe it a bit.

486
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,600
Lay down here, my love.

487
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,600
I'll show you how this works.

488
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,600
You let them crawl all around your genitals.

489
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,600
You'll see they're tender.

490
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,600
They ain't jerks.

491
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,600
I showed what tender lovers.

492
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,600
Those tics could be.

493
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,600
But she walked on out the door.

494
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,600
She said, you're on your own now, you see.

495
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,600
Oh, what a day.

496
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,600
He got the love bug.

497
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
Oh, why don't I know it?

498
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,600
He got the love bug.

499
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
Good day and a sad day, both.

500
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,600
His wife said, no, thank you.

501
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Goodbye, please.

502
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,600
He got the love bug.

503
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,600
300 of them.

504
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,600
He got the love bug.

505
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
Kind of nice, though.

506
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:31,600
She said, I hope you enjoy life with these fleas.

507
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Love bug.

508
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,600
But now I got 300 alimony.

509
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Oh, no.

510
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,600
300 won if you counted wife number one.

511
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
Oh, I'm sorry.

512
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
Oh, life's been rough for good.

513
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,600
What a heartbreaking tale.

514
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,600
You know, I feel a little better getting it off my chest.

515
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
And my chest is pretty big.

516
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
I needed it off.

517
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
It was a good question.

518
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
I did not expect.

519
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
Yeah, it was an excellent question.

520
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,600
I'm relieved I wasn't eating, but I feel like it unpacked something.

521
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,600
You're speaking of good stories.

522
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
Hey, hey, Julip.

523
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Yeah?

524
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
Juniper.

525
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Juniper?

526
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,600
Well, they're friends.

527
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,600
You're not talking to Juniper.

528
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Oh, are you talking to Julip, the fast talking possum?

529
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,600
That's right.

530
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
Julip on Juniper's head.

531
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
Oh, look at it.

532
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
No, he came in.

533
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
He's up on Juniper's head.

534
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,600
Oh, hi, everyone.

535
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,600
I just got here.

536
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,600
I was running a little late.

537
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
Sorry about that.

538
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Hey, Julip.

539
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
Yeah?

540
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:35,600
Now, I was under the impression that you were out acquiring all sorts of nicks and nacks

541
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
and wares and tares.

542
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Yeah, you know, I like to go antique and I like to go yard sailing.

543
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,600
I like to go estate sailing.

544
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,600
And I just hit them all up and I got so much old crap in my house.

545
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,600
Why don't you tell me all about your latest haul?

546
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:58,600
Well, you wake up Saturday morning, show up in a yard, ask to buy their crap and they say

547
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,600
we don't starve for three hours.

548
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,600
And I say, I'm here now.

549
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,600
I'm here now.

550
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
I'm here now, yeah.

551
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:18,600
You go to an estate sale, you ask who died.

552
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,600
They don't really want to talk about it.

553
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
They just want to sell that stuff.

554
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,600
You keep asking.

555
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,600
You say, I'm here now.

556
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,600
I'm here now.

557
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
I'm here now.

558
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:37,600
And you're really bored of most of that crap anyway.

559
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,600
It was being crossed by like nine quads, you see.

560
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
What did you get?

561
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
What did you get?

562
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
Oh, what did I get?

563
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Now, you see, eventually you go to these estate sales, you can talk them down.

564
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,600
You see, you can talk them down because you get so annoying they just want you to leave.

565
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
Okay?

566
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,600
Tell me about it.

567
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:06,600
So they were like, hey, I'm sorry, but that attache is 75 and I can't go a dollar lower.

568
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:14,600
That attache, it's dinged up, it's holed up.

569
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:20,600
That attache is garbage.

570
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,600
And I'm here now.

571
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,600
And I'm here now.

572
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
I got $2.00.

573
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
I'll take it off your hands.

574
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,600
Well, all right.

575
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,600
You made a five point.

576
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,600
You go to a church parking lot.

577
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,600
They're trying to sell some goods.

578
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,600
To better do more church, they wanna do more church.

579
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,600
What do you say?

580
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,600
I'm here now.

581
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,600
If you want to do church, we can church, want to church, and the church wants more church,

582
00:27:52,600 --> 00:28:00,600
church wants more church, and the church wants more church, church wants more church,

583
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,100
I know what you're saying.

584
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,060
I'm here now.

585
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,560
I'm here now.

586
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,340
I don't care when you open.

587
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,620
What I care about is I'm here now.

588
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,520
I'm here now.

589
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,000
And you're here now, Julep, and we're happy you are.

590
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,640
Julep, you've gotten that tachy for $2?

591
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,000
When it was originally listed at $75?

592
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,320
My, what a deal.

593
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,280
What a deal.

594
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:25,920
That's right.

595
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,440
Little did they know, I had gotten there many hours

596
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,640
before that and scuffed it up myself.

597
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,200
Oh, Julep.

598
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,720
Oh, you fast talking possum.

599
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,080
What a Swifter you are.

600
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,280
I admire you for it.

601
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,400
I'll tell you what.

602
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,360
Oh, thanks.

603
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,280
That's wonderful.

604
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:41,880
Yeah.

605
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,800
I just got to say that's a lovely ensemble.

606
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,720
And I've been trying to work on my look too,

607
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,800
and what I'm carrying.

608
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,880
I'm going to say, Rudy, you look mighty fine.

609
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,360
Oh, really?

610
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,000
You think so?

611
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,880
Oh, yeah.

612
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,840
Got like, you part in your hair different ways.

613
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,040
You got highlights and lowlights extensions.

614
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,560
Yeah.

615
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,920
I got a little, I got a dickie on, like an animal.

616
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,120
Yeah, I love that.

617
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,640
Yeah.

618
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,360
Why wear the whole turtleneck?

619
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,320
Just wear the top.

620
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,320
Just wear the top.

621
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:09,920
Yeah.

622
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,480
Now, this is a no pants zone.

623
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,320
Y'all may have been aware of that by looking at us.

624
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,680
We like to wear, when it comes to accessorizing,

625
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,600
look in the mirror and then take your pants off.

626
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,360
Oh, yeah.

627
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,560
That's right.

628
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,200
Now, do they mean us too?

629
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,700
Are we?

630
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,160
Because we've kept our pants on.

631
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
Take your pants off.

632
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,680
Oh.

633
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,480
Look in the mirror.

634
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,040
Why did I say it out loud?

635
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,360
Take your pants off.

636
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,160
Took them off as soon as I sat down, because I'm the only one.

637
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,440
Jason was going to ask.

638
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,400
I understood the code.

639
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,720
Some people take coats off.

640
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,640
I just, you know.

641
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,480
Yeah, you wear those.

642
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,240
Jason wears those heart boxers, though.

643
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,320
I'm not really worried about this.

644
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,680
I've got a, I don't want to brag,

645
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,040
but I have a lot of Mack Weldon.

646
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,960
Hey, actually, we did ask for Mack Weldon too, you guys.

647
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,320
I think I have a lot of Mack.

648
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,760
Like, we got, like, did they send you stuff?

649
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,800
Yeah, we got sent stuff.

650
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,840
Yeah, you got a code.

651
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,000
Yeah.

652
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,920
You got to redeem the code.

653
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,040
Sometimes you forget.

654
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,320
Oh, yeah, I know about that.

655
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,240
It happens to us too on our podcast.

656
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,240
That's a good point.

657
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,200
We should probably now take a moment for our sponsors.

658
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,440
Firefly Hooch.

659
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,400
Yeah.

660
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,600
Firefly Hooch.

661
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,680
When you got to get drunk off of the remains of fireflies

662
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,840
that have been put in a machine, and then they

663
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,160
have been fermented over the course of many weeks.

664
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,160
Read the copy.

665
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,880
What do you mean?

666
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,120
Just riff and read the copy.

667
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,800
Read the copy.

668
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,760
They said, they got must reads.

669
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,240
They highlighted it in yellow.

670
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,280
You got to talk about the natural probiotics

671
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,880
that this booze has in it.

672
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,680
Firefly Hooch.

673
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,120
You said you wanted to do it.

674
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,840
Read the copy.

675
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,000
But it says at the top, make it your own.

676
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,520
All right, let me get another shot at it, all right?

677
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,320
Well, I just want to say that Firefly Hooch,

678
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,160
you can put it in a cup.

679
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,080
And when you get the cup, you're going

680
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,720
to want to put it out on the table first.

681
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,280
And what I like to do is I get ham and eggs.

682
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,680
I get the cup on the table.

683
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,560
And I get a napkin.

684
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,040
And I tuck it into my shirt first.

685
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,440
You have to paint a picture for them.

686
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,640
Yeah, thank you so much.

687
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,160
Yeah.

688
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,400
At least somebody knows what I'm doing here.

689
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,280
You make it sound real natural, or else you're

690
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,400
going to have to do it again.

691
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,320
Yeah, we'll have to do it.

692
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,920
We'll have to do a make good.

693
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,480
We're going to have to do a make good.

694
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,120
Well, I don't want to make good.

695
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,040
But I want to put this in my own words.

696
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,720
All right, well, if you like Firefly Hooch

697
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,680
and you like to have a good time,

698
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,160
let me remind you what I like to do.

699
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,440
Go to the table, get a plate of ham and eggs, get a cup.

700
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,880
It's very important, because do not

701
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,280
pour the Firefly Hooch just on the table,

702
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,640
because it will not stay.

703
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,120
That's good.

704
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,240
That part is highlighted.

705
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,520
You have to read that part.

706
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,040
Yeah.

707
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,480
Make sure they know that you need a cup still.

708
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,320
Yeah, so just pour it there.

709
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,440
Pour it in a cup.

710
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,680
And then crack the paper.

711
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,280
And read the headlines.

712
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,520
Read the news.

713
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:56,480
Read what's going on and try not to get the blues.

714
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,080
Read the paper.

715
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,720
Read the paper.

716
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,360
Read the news.

717
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,160
Read the news.

718
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:09,120
Read the obituaries and see who dies.

719
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,480
Who dies.

720
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,800
Spend your time reading the obituaries

721
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,280
and crying for people you don't know.

722
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

723
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:23,680
Try to see their names and think of all how they won't grow.

724
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,680
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

725
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,160
Think of their families.

726
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,720
Think of their friends.

727
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,840
Think of the cost of the funeral.

728
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,760
What are people going through?

729
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,360
Then take a sip of your Hooch.

730
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,880
Firefly Hooch.

731
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,800
Firefly Hooch.

732
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,760
Firefly Hooch.

733
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,960
Yes, right.

734
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,040
Read the people that died in the news.

735
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,000
Yeah, you've got to learn about all of them.

736
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,480
Firefly Hooch.

737
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,960
Firefly Hooch.

738
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,440
Firefly Hooch.

739
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:54,920
That's right.

740
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,920
That's good.

741
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,880
Read the people that died in the news.

742
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:08,400
And yes, so then what I do, I go on IMDB to find old celebrities.

743
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,880
Internet movie database.

744
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,360
People over 80 don't have long.

745
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,840
Don't have long.

746
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,800
How sad you'll be when all these people pass away.

747
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:27,280
Won't it be a bummer then you go back to your cup?

748
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,760
Firefly Hooch.

749
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,240
That's right.

750
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,720
Firefly Hooch.

751
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,720
Oh, I'm so sad.

752
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,720
Read the names of the people who died in the news.

753
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,720
Hell, yeah.

754
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,720
Firefly Hooch.

755
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,200
Oh, my goodness.

756
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,680
Firefly Hooch.

757
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:49,640
Won't it be sad when the rest of the Mary Town War Show cast us?

758
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,640
There's only a few of them.

759
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,640
There's only a few.

760
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,120
Few.

761
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,640
Promo code bears.

762
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,000
All right, well.

763
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,560
There's no way we're going to make good for that.

764
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,240
No way.

765
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,160
That was 90 seconds right on the down.

766
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,640
Right on the down.

767
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,840
Precisely, you're a pro.

768
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,200
Good enough time for a mid roll if this were fine.

769
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,760
Hey, y'all, I was thinking that since this is a very special

770
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,360
audience, then maybe we should tell them.

771
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,480
What do you think you're saying to them, I'm Sue?

772
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,720
Maybe we should tell them.

773
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,080
What are you thinking, Cassandra, I'm Sue?

774
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,560
I'm about to say it.

775
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,640
Maybe we should tell them.

776
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,280
Maybe we should tell them what, Cassandra, I'm Sue?

777
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,240
Oh, turnip.

778
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,120
Maybe we should tell them about all the special things we do

779
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,480
to get ready for hibernation.

780
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,560
Oh, it's quite a time of the year.

781
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,760
What should we tell them, Cassandra?

782
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,160
Oh, to shut down and just reflect.

783
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,640
All the things we do to get ready for hibernation.

784
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,040
Oh, yeah.

785
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,560
Well, yeah, we gather first.

786
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,160
We put things together.

787
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,080
We party so hard that we're ready to sleep it off.

788
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,920
That's right.

789
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,560
It's a big old bender, that's for sure,

790
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,520
because we know we party hard enough to sleep for three

791
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,520
months after the fact.

792
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,120
You don't want to wake up in the middle.

793
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,080
That's when it's coldest and darkest.

794
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,840
So you didn't make sure you get fucked up.

795
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,840
Yeah, I emptied this jug of the moonshot.

796
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,400
Oh, oh no, Juniper.

797
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,800
Oh, yes.

798
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,880
Yeah, you get the Firefly Hooch and you just drink

799
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,400
till you're fucking sick.

800
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,520
Can you give us a little bit of that jug, Juniper?

801
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,480
Oh, sure.

802
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,680
Yeah, I've been taking a master class from a guy named

803
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,800
Little Jimmy Dickens Jr. and he's been teaching me how to

804
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,560
jug. I've been doing a few master classes.

805
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,640
You got the subscription for all of them.

806
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,120
I got the two I'm learning about.

807
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,640
At the price point, it makes more sense to just get a

808
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,440
subscription to master class.

809
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
It does.

810
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,560
Hillary Clinton's teaching me about green.

811
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,480
Play the jug.

812
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,280
Milking.

813
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,280
Oh, wow.

814
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,040
Doesn't that sound so sweet?

815
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,240
Yeah.

816
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,080
Sounds real soulful like.

817
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,280
One thing's for sure, we can hear it real good.

818
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,040
There you go.

819
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,400
I've only watched the first one because I got obsessed with

820
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,640
Bill Gates's one on eating the mors.

821
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,760
Now first of all, Ms. Nomer, I initially thought that when

822
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,040
someone, and you told me this, Rodney, you were essentially

823
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,720
told that when someone is playing the jug, you would

824
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,920
think that the tone is made by blowing air across the top of

825
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,320
it perpendicularly.

826
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,080
Well, what I did, I was looking at YouTube and I learned that

827
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,960
jug playing is sort of, you got to make the noise with your

828
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,320
mouth.

829
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,200
It's more just humming into a jug.

830
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,920
You're thinking it's for the resonance?

831
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,200
OK.

832
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:36,680
All right.

833
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,400
Someone has watched more than the first master class of

834
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:39,880
jugs.

835
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,360
Humming into the jug, dude.

836
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,840
He bootlegged him, probably.

837
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,480
He stole him.

838
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,800
So you're not humming, you're just blowing.

839
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,720
Jason, this is great.

840
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,960
Jason, you could learn from this.

841
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,880
We've been trying to teach you how to do well at the jug

842
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,640
all this time.

843
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,360
No, I'm trying.

844
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,760
He seems sick up there.

845
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,560
You actually are better than him, maybe.

846
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,760
You're much better than this.

847
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,440
Yeah, there.

848
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,600
The clear jug on stage, you see it's full of germs now.

849
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,520
It looks really gross.

850
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,880
Yeah, it should probably be destroyed right now.

851
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,480
It's an old bong.

852
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,240
God, it's disgusting.

853
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,440
Yeah, it's like an old bong.

854
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,680
The bear looks lightheaded.

855
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,640
Oh, party's not a party.

856
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:22,560
Does someone pass us out from blowing on a jug too long?

857
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,200
About that, there's no doubt.

858
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,960
So we'll get tanked.

859
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,960
We'll drink all this Firefly hooch.

860
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,920
And then we'll sleep all night snoozily snoozily snooze.

861
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,400
Snoozily snooze.

862
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,880
Snoozily snooze.

863
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,120
I'd offer someone else the jug, but it's covered in my spittle

864
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,640
now, so I guess.

865
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,200
Yeah, the bear's got COVID too.

866
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,960
I guess I'm stuck with it.

867
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,480
Yeah, the bear's got COVID too.

868
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,400
Yeah, but didn't you guys hear Grant Van Morrison last week?

869
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,480
That doesn't exist.

870
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,000
It doesn't.

871
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,080
It's not real.

872
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,360
I'm just glad he's gone.

873
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,400
The forest has gotten significantly less cantankerous

874
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,440
somehow.

875
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,360
Somehow a forest of bears is less cantankerous

876
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,520
when Van Morrison leaves.

877
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,240
Oh, that's true.

878
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,680
I can't disagree with you there.

879
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,040
A forest is less cantankerous when Van Morrison leaves.

880
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,720
And you can put that on a stick pillow.

881
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,220
Yeah.

882
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,760
Yeah, there you go.

883
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,480
Oh, I'm hearing it a lot more now.

884
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,560
Yeah, this is perfect.

885
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,360
Oh, he's going to be sleeping for months, no problem.

886
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:31,840
You're going to miss the entire winter at this rate.

887
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,320
Oh, play that.

888
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:33,800
Oh.

889
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,300
Yeah!

890
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,760
Sounds so nice.

891
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,880
What a sweet sound.

892
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,320
He's like he's kissing the jug, isn't it?

893
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,800
Oh, he should throw that in there too.

894
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:51,880
Oh, a party, not a party until someone passes out.

895
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,000
From putting too much air across the jug

896
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,680
and last without a doubt.

897
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,640
So you hear that dulcet tone.

898
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,400
And you know that it's about time for the party

899
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,960
to keep partying on.

900
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,240
So you feel alive.

901
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,240
This guy is turning white.

902
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,200
He's looking such a fright.

903
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,640
I think he'll be asleep in no time.

904
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,920
What should this rhyme be?

905
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,040
It's like he's trying to navigate

906
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,360
the difficulty of blowing air out and also

907
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,560
humming at the same time.

908
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,840
His fur did turn white now.

909
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,920
He looks like a polar bear.

910
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,960
That's what polar bears are.

911
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,560
Polar bears are just brown bears that have been

912
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,840
playing the jug for too long.

913
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,840
Oh my gosh, I didn't know that.

914
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,560
Did you know that?

915
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,920
And then we exile him to the frozen north and south.

916
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,720
We send him out with just one Coca-Cola.

917
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,280
Hey, y'all, if you want a Coca-Cola, you can go get one

918
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,720
and get merch at the same time.

919
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,600
Van Morrison, you take one more step to my honey

920
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,720
and you getting the knife.

921
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,960
Oh, he's back.

922
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,480
Sorry, back.

923
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,120
He's all right.

924
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,640
He's fine.

925
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,480
Not quite polar yet.

926
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,440
But you know, we got to finish the show first.

927
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,560
We can't, you know, we're all going to turn polar

928
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,880
by the end eventually.

929
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,040
But not before we close this thing out strong.

930
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,720
Hey, y'all, why don't we go to the audience

931
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,080
and see what their favorite of our famous songs is?

932
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,480
Yeah, and make sure the pig rat.

933
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,400
If you don't pick right, we're going to eat you.

934
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,320
Oh, they are really looking at us, like really giving us

935
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,640
that eye.

936
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,240
Oh, the security guys.

937
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,040
Oh, they're back.

938
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,080
OK, the security guys.

939
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,520
OK, OK, well, what kind of I mean,

940
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,880
they probably like have to do with like a hoedown.

941
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,600
Well, Danny might be in there.

942
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,680
Like, yeah, but that's right.

943
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,200
I think one of my favorite songs of theirs

944
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,520
is called the tin can pool.

945
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,080
Tin can.

946
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,400
Tin can pool.

947
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,840
Is it like the game or the or like a swimming pool?

948
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,320
I think the swimming pool full of tin cans.

949
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,520
Oh, we like we like.

950
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,800
You know, they were all great.

951
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,880
We loved all of them.

952
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,120
But I think my favorite is wisely.

953
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,600
I think it's got to be tin tin can pool.

954
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,160
Jory.

955
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,760
We were made pausing to make sure you weren't pulling our chain.

956
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:16,000
You got us on Spotify, our number one track by a long shot of tin can pool.

957
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,760
Y'all are real fans.

958
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,480
That's for sure.

959
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
I love to hear that.

960
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,760
Yeah, thank you for being real ones.

961
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,600
This goes out to all you real ones out there on stump.

962
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:50,600
One for the real ones on stump.

963
00:41:50,600 --> 00:42:07,760
Oh, yes, you all are sitting out there, the real ones on the stumps.

964
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,280
I know you might be thinking, oh, are you talking about a dump?

965
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,120
Is this just a landfill or is it a trash can?

966
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,560
Well, I say no.

967
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,160
Thank you.

968
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,480
You do not understand.

969
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,680
And sometimes all the tin cans, they get taken away.

970
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:29,000
And so we fill the swimming hole right up with razor blades.

971
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,480
And that's what we got to do sometimes, although it is less cool.

972
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,160
Won't you come and take a dip in this razor bladey pool?

973
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,280
Razor bladey pool.

974
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,200
Razor bladey pool.

975
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,600
It cuts deep, but it's cool.

976
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,680
Razor bladey pool.

977
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,120
Razor bladey pool.

978
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,040
Ouch.

979
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,320
The water ends up pretty hot.

980
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,360
You're going to need a tennis shot.

981
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:00,680
But sometimes, though it hurts to say, you show up at the swimming hole,

982
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,360
but there's no razor blade.

983
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,880
Oh, no.

984
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,200
What's there instead?

985
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,160
Well, you are in luck.

986
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,240
It's just the headless bodies of a bunch of undead ducks.

987
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,240
Undead ducks.

988
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,720
Undead ducks.

989
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,560
Necromantic arts of risen ducks.

990
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,760
Undead ducks.

991
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,160
Undead ducks.

992
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,360
I'm pretty scared of what's in this pool.

993
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,320
Turns out ducks can be zombies, too.

994
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,000
My baby bear, he tried to learn to swim.

995
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,360
He was having a big problem when ducks were biting him.

996
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,480
He wanted to learn, so I said, stay in there.

997
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,400
You don't get out now.

998
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,640
I paid for these lessons.

999
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,600
You take those bites, or I'm not getting my money back.

1000
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,160
Tin can pool.

1001
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:48,680
Yeah.

1002
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,680
Tin can pool.

1003
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,680
Tin can pool.

1004
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,680
Tin can pool.

1005
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,680
Oh, hey, everybody.

1006
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,680
Thanks for coming to our celebration.

1007
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,680
Now we're getting time for a hibernation.

1008
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,680
Before I fall asleep, ain't anybody seen my hair, anyway?

1009
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,680
It's full of bugs, anyhow.

1010
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:18,680
Tin can pool.

1011
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:22,680
Oh, hey, everybody.

1012
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,680
Shake it out, junk man.

1013
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,680
Turn one.

1014
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:34,680
Mmm.

1015
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,680
Juniper Dunn turned bowler.

1016
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:42,680
Turn and bowler.

1017
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,680
Oh, folks, I guess we're heading for the end of it.

1018
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,680
Oh, starting to teeter a little bit here.

1019
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,680
Oh, god, they're going to stumble off the stand.

1020
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,680
Yeah, they might fall on us.

1021
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,680
We might be stuck here for three months.

1022
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,680
No, no, just get out.

1023
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,680
Follow me, follow me, follow me.

1024
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,680
OK.

1025
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,680
Does anyone want to get their stubs signed?

1026
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,680
What?

1027
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,680
They're asleep.

1028
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,680
Get out of here.

1029
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,680
This is our chance right now.

1030
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,680
OK.

1031
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,680
Maybe ask the possum.

1032
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,680
Does anyone see my pants?

1033
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,680
My Mac Welpons.

1034
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,680
Juniper's wearing your pants.

1035
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,680
Jason, grab the jug.

1036
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,680
Oh, OK.

1037
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,680
Let's cover up with that.

1038
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,680
He's asleep.

1039
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,680
Let's go.

1040
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,680
Is this a trade?

1041
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,680
OK.

1042
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,680
Yeah, don't.

1043
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,680
It's glass, but it's a little foggy.

1044
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,680
People won't be able to see you down there.

1045
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,680
OK.

1046
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,680
It's better than pants.

1047
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,680
It's almost as good as pants.

1048
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,680
I'm going to hide behind the jug.

1049
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,680
OK, you'll be fine.

1050
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,680
OK, so quietly.

1051
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,680
Don't creak.

1052
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,680
Don't creak.

1053
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,680
OK.

1054
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,680
I liked it.

1055
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,680
I liked that a lot.

1056
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,680
I felt scared more often than I thought I would.

1057
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:49,680
Yeah, they made a point of saying it to be you guys said the bears are safe.

1058
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,680
Yeah, I guess that was an assumption I was making.

1059
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,680
One of them straight up had two knives and a gun.

1060
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,680
And you're still kind of bleeding.

1061
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,680
I mean, those security bears gave you sweet kisses, but.

1062
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,680
Oh, yeah.

1063
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,680
I got a white shirt and it is the red is steadily spreading here.

1064
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:05,680
I guess that's a pretty cool.

1065
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,680
It was such a fun hang.

1066
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,680
It was good fun.

1067
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,680
Such a fun hang.

1068
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,680
Such a fun hang.

1069
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,680
So nice when podcasts get together.

1070
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,680
Yeah.

1071
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,680
And I just feel like I'm glad that was just for us, you know?

1072
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,680
Yeah.

1073
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,680
Does everything have to be content?

1074
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,680
Why does everything have to be content?

1075
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:23,680
Why can't you just hang out with your friends and witness like a horror show?

1076
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,680
Yeah.

1077
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,680
I'll tell you what, I'm adding Tin Cam Pool to my Spotify playlist right now.

1078
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,680
I think we all are.

1079
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,680
Yeah.

1080
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,680
When you go from tin cans to razor blades, I say short.

1081
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,680
Then you go to undead ducks.

1082
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,680
Well, now I'm a fan for life.

1083
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,680
Wow.

1084
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,680
Unexpected turns in those songs.

1085
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,680
I don't know if it was just them being sleepy that made me sleepy or if it's the blood leaving my chest.

1086
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,680
I might just like lay down here outside the cabin.

1087
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,680
Scott, how is this white?

1088
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,680
No, I think Scott's turning polar.

1089
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,680
No, this is me.

1090
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,680
No, I think he's bleeding.

1091
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:53,680
I don't get tan.

1092
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,680
No, no, he's turning polar.

1093
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,680
Let's send it to the North Pole with a Coke.

1094
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,680
Oh, just one Coca-Cola.

1095
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,680
Yeah.

1096
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,680
That sounds really nice.

1097
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,680
Those bears in those commercials look so happy.

1098
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,680
Good night, Scott.

1099
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,680
Good night, Scott.

1100
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,680
I love you guys.

1101
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,680
Guys, Van Morris is also coming through the woods.

1102
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:07,680
Oh, God.

1103
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,680
He's still selling cassettes?

1104
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,680
La, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

1105
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,680
I'm worried about...

1106
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,680
I am worried too.

1107
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,680
I'm more scared of him.

1108
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,680
I don't want to be part of this interaction.

1109
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,680
But you know what?

1110
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,680
It was a marvelous night for a moon dance.

1111
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,680
Remember when Scott danced with a bear?

1112
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,680
Yeah.

1113
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,680
Yeah.

1114
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,680
You did the dirty dancing thing.

1115
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,680
That was cute.

1116
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,680
He's fine, right?

1117
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,680
Yeah.

1118
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,680
How do we get our phones out of the bear bag?

1119
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,680
They put them...

1120
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,680
Those are gone.

1121
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,680
I think I saw Julep the possum take off with them.

1122
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,680
Oh, because he can climb up to the high tree and get...

1123
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,680
Yeah.

1124
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,680
Okay.

1125
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,680
Shoot.

1126
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,680
Well, Apple backups.

1127
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,680
I got burners if you need anything.

1128
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,680
Oh, Van.

1129
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,680
Oh, Van.

1130
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,680
No, we're good.

1131
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,680
No, we're good.

1132
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:51,680
We're actually good.

1133
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,680
We're good.

1134
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,680
Thank you.

1135
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,680
We're actually good.

1136
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,680
La, da, da, da, da, da, da.

1137
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,680
He's walked into the woods.

1138
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,240
I know that there wasn't a longer Q&A, but I wish I could ask the possum what he's going

1139
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,240
to do with an attache.

1140
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,240
Oh, I assume resell.

1141
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,240
Good point.

1142
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,240
Yeah, refurb it.

1143
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,240
Yeah, flip it.

1144
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,240
Flip that.

1145
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,240
Take that thing down to Sunset Vintage.

1146
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,240
Yeah, sure.

1147
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,240
Do you guys want to keep hanging?

1148
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,240
Do you want to maybe hit up Margaritaville?

1149
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,240
Yeah, maybe let's record it this time.

1150
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,240
Yeah, okay.

1151
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,240
That's a good idea.

1152
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,240
Yeah, I wouldn't want to hear...

1153
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,240
If I was a fan of either of those shows, I wouldn't want to hear that.

1154
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,240
I would want to hear us hanging at Margaritaville.

1155
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,240
Yeah.

1156
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,240
I would want to hear us hanging at Margaritaville.

1157
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,240
Yeah.

1158
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:27,520
Yeah, I think that's right.

1159
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,520
Margaritaville Forest, which is the one over here.

1160
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,520
Yeah.

1161
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,520
Yeah.

1162
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,520
They don't require masks there.

1163
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,520
La da da da.

1164
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,520
Okay.

1165
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,520
All right, man.

1166
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,520
Hey, that was Scott Passarello.

1167
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,520
Give it up, Scott Passarello is on the keys.

1168
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,520
We got Brett Morris on guitar and banjo.

1169
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,520
We also had Scott on bass.

1170
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,520
We got Dana on percussion.

1171
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,520
Dana Williams on bass.

1172
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,520
We got Scott on bass.

1173
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,520
We got Scott on bass.

1174
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,520
We got Scott on bass.

1175
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,520
We got Scott on bass.

1176
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,520
We got Scott on bass.

1177
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,520
We got Scott on bass.

1178
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,520
We got Scott on bass.

1179
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,520
We got Scott on bass.

1180
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,520
We got Scott on bass.

1181
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,520
We got Scott on bass.

1182
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,520
We got Scott on bass.

1183
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,520
We got Scott on bass.

1184
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:59,600
You can also check off Book, The Improvised Musical Podcast.

1185
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:07,380
Well, the same place that you can check out our friends and extremely recent collaborators,

1186
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:08,680
Podcast The Ride.

1187
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,680
Hey.

1188
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,960
Thank you guys so much.

1189
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,100
You survived Podcast The Ride from the Podcast the Ride side of things.

1190
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,720
And I guess I did too non- firstly.

1191
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,720
You survived Country Bear Jamboree.

1192
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,720
We all survived Country Bear Jamboree together.

1193
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,720
I was about to, usually we say,

1194
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,720
what would you like to plug?

1195
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,720
But you just did, so we're already, you know,

1196
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,720
that's covered.

1197
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,720
Why's everything got to be content, you know?

1198
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,720
And this is confusing being in two podcasts at once.

1199
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,720
How does it work?

1200
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,720
Yeah, so if you're listening on the off-book side,

1201
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,720
we're just completing a Country Bear week of content.

1202
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,720
There's no, like, we don't do fun songs.

1203
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,720
But we talk about, for hours,

1204
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,720
the history of the Disney Country Bear.

1205
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,720
Yeah, if you like fun songs,

1206
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,720
don't listen to the rest of the week.

1207
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,720
Because it was like three hours at a time

1208
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,720
of talking about Country Bear Jamborees.

1209
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,720
But if that does sound good to you,

1210
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,720
yeah, check out podcasts to the right.

1211
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,720
And you're listening right now,

1212
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:54,720
if you're learning on our feed,

1213
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,720
this is the final main feed of 2021.

1214
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,720
And thank you.

1215
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,720
You all survived 2021.

1216
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,720
You all survived the Country Bear Jamboree week.

1217
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,720
There's maybe one little treat coming for you

1218
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,720
over on the Grizzly Gate.

1219
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,720
But thanks for sticking with us through a crazy year.

1220
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,720
And thanks, Zach and Justin, everybody,

1221
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,720
for closing us out right here.

1222
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,720
Our pleasure.

1223
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,720
And if you're listening to this on the podcast,

1224
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,720
the right side, that is basically what every episode

1225
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,720
of our show is like.

1226
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,720
A lot of bears.

1227
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,720
A lot of bears.

1228
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,720
Yeah.

1229
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,720
It's all Country Bear Jamboree.

1230
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:27,720
Thank you for inviting us into your Country Bear Jamboree week.

1231
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,720
Yeah, yeah.

1232
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,720
It's an esteemed place to be, I think.

1233
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,720
Everyone stay busy out there in those woods.

1234
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,720
And if you see Van Morrison coming, turn the other way.

1235
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,720
Turn the other way.

1236
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,720
Do not buy one of those burners.

1237
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:42,720
Bye.

1238
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,720
Bye.

1239
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,720
Forever.

1240
