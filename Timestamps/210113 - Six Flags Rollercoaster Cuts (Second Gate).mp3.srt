1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,720
Are we kicking off the second gate in 2021

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,440
with an episode about a failed children's hair salon?

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,840
You're damn right we are.

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,880
I'm Scott Gardner, welcome to podcast the ride the second gate.

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,120
I think Jason Sheridan's on board with this plan, this note.

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,440
I am 100% on board.

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,200
I think it's a perfectly insane topic

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,280
to start off the year with.

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,840
I would call it a hair raising experience.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,080
I wouldn't go that far.

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,280
Oh, you got to, you got to use fun phrases like that.

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,520
You got to.

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,200
Mike Carlson, are you delighted

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,200
by the sheer insanity of today's topic?

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,720
Oh my gosh, now I'm feeling like such pressure

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,680
to do one of these.

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,520
Oh, okay.

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,960
Glad I thought of that, I would have been screwed.

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,240
Yeah, okay, well let's think.

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,160
What happens at a hair salon?

22
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,640
I don't know, like scissors?

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,960
Trim.

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,800
Trim.

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,240
There's a big one, there's a big shiny one

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,840
waiting right for you.

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,440
Okay, wait, is it one of the two things I just said?

28
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,560
No.

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,520
Is it like, okay, what does that have to do with the chair,

30
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,360
the swinging around of the chair?

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,360
Barbasol, how about Barbasol?

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,480
Am I getting closer?

33
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,240
No, you know, while you're getting a little closer,

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,040
it's, you just have a little of them.

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,920
A little of them go a long way.

36
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,520
A little, okay, a little of them as far as hairs.

37
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,280
Yeah, a little.

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,280
Okay, oof, oof, neck, like trimming your neck hair?

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,440
Is that what we're talking about?

40
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,880
I'll go with it.

41
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,480
I'll toss it out there.

42
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,560
Hopefully this episode is a real highlight

43
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,720
of the Second Gate catalog.

44
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,800
Okay, all right.

45
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,640
Yeah, see?

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,400
Not sure I would have gotten there.

47
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,680
I only got there because of one specific thing

48
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,200
I found out about this place.

49
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,040
Oh, great, great.

50
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,880
Oh, interesting.

51
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,280
And we'll get around to that.

52
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,120
Oh, how about this?

53
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,160
I hope this one, this episode is enjoyable

54
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,520
and you don't drink a half a gallon of Barbasol

55
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,720
because you're so upset.

56
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,320
Pretty good.

57
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,560
You know, you aren't so mad about the wasted time

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,520
from this episode that you glug Barbasol.

59
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,840
We definitely hope that.

60
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,840
Yeah, so today's episode, as you see in your inbox,

61
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,880
is Six Flags Roller Coaster Cuts.

62
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,040
So this got on my radar,

63
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,880
as many great things get on my radar,

64
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,760
because of Eva Anderson.

65
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,640
She texted me the snippet from an article

66
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,000
that was going around Twitter,

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,600
and I was about to text it to you guys

68
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,040
when I had my phone out and was about to send it,

69
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,960
and then Jason sent it at that exact moment.

70
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,600
So we were completely simpatico here,

71
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,800
obsessed immediately with the phrase roller coaster cuts.

72
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,160
Had you guys come across this in any way before?

73
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,920
I had never come across this.

74
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,960
I mean, the article from Dave McKenna on Defector,

75
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,600
I like Defector a lot.

76
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,360
It's all the expats from Deadspin, writer and editor owned.

77
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,880
Shout out to them.

78
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,040
And I was so excited to read this

79
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,960
at like 8.39 in the morning.

80
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,760
I was too.

81
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,320
And I also want to shout out,

82
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,320
there's somebody on our Facebook group, Joe Spence,

83
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,760
who apparently was trying to get this on our radar way back,

84
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,960
might've emailed us in a mailbag or something too.

85
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,760
So apologies, we didn't see it

86
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,680
when Joe brought it to our attention.

87
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,720
But so, you know, there was like a tweet going around,

88
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,080
there was a snippet from this article.

89
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,160
The article is titled,

90
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,440
Let's Remember Dan Snyder's Six Flags Disaster.

91
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,160
The Dan Snyder presence kind of makes this a spiritual heir

92
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,720
to the episode we did over the summer about Mr. Six,

93
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,600
who is of course the Six Flags dancing old man.

94
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,320
We started with him and ended up in this whole run

95
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,320
about the Six Flags era during which they killed off

96
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,560
Mr. Six and eventually brought him back.

97
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,000
And I'm excited to go back to that era for this episode.

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So knowing that it's about Dan Snyder,

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,480
when I saw Eva's text, I was like, roller coaster cuts.

100
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,240
What I jumped to was, is this some kind of like,

101
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,440
before I read it, I was like,

102
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,080
did he like institute a program

103
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,960
to like make cuts from roller coasters?

104
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,920
Like, was this about cutting back the budget

105
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,360
or like, do we have to repair them as much

106
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,880
or check them in a service way as much?

107
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,720
That was what I assumed at first.

108
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,160
Yeah, yes.

109
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,280
I also had that same confusion.

110
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,560
Is this what the, yeah, is it some sort of budget issue?

111
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,840
And then, yeah, and then when I finally was like,

112
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,360
okay, it has to do with haircuts,

113
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,800
I go, oh, it's like how they used to have maybe like

114
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,280
a barber on Main Street?

115
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,360
In the movie?

116
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,680
Good guess, absolutely.

117
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,720
Good guess, yep.

118
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,680
Okay, I go, okay, all right, huh.

119
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,320
That's a pretty good little slice to make there.

120
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,800
You're totally right, because you might see the title

121
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,640
and know that it's Arizona and think,

122
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,400
yeah, was there a barber shop in a Six Flags park?

123
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,680
Right, or it's like the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique.

124
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,160
That's obviously, there's precedent there for that,

125
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,640
even in today's world.

126
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,200
Yeah, there's a little salon on the Disney cruises,

127
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,000
but no, this is not that, this was off-site.

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,320
But before I get there, let me say some of the other things

129
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,160
in this article.

130
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,000
What I've realized now is that Dave McKenna,

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
is he's a Washington writer, and I think he was the source

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,280
of a lot of the things that we brought up the last time

133
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,200
all this came up.

134
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,200
I think he has been on a Dan Snyder tear

135
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,760
for the entire 15 years that this guy's been haunting.

136
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,600
Yeah.

137
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,560
I mean, I'm not sure when he took over

138
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,920
for the Washington football team,

139
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,920
but his Six Flags run ended in 2009, 2010.

140
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,880
Yeah, I found some of his posts

141
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,400
for the Washington City Paper in 2009,

142
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,800
where he also was doing the logic of,

143
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,800
okay, did Dan Snyder hear cuts from the accountants?

144
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Because Six Flags was in massive debt.

145
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,600
We're talking billions of dollars of debt at the time.

146
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,920
Because of him.

147
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,800
Yeah, he was so bad.

148
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,800
And seen like financial malfeasance and like,

149
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,800
got the, Six Flags had an official mattress you could buy.

150
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,000
We talked about that.

151
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,840
We talked about the mattress.

152
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,680
You could buy a mattress in a Six Flags.

153
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,520
Yeah.

154
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,240
$1400.

155
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,080
Yes.

156
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,160
We did, we talked though.

157
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,200
And I'm, maybe I'm forgetting that he had,

158
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,960
he owned Johnny Rockets through a different company,

159
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,560
which is why you see such a strong Johnny Rockets presence

160
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,360
in the Six Flags.

161
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,560
No, we missed this one.

162
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,680
Yeah, I noted that.

163
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,560
I did not realize that.

164
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,640
Yeah, through some weird holdings group,

165
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,920
he already owned Johnny Rockets.

166
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,840
So when he took over Six Flags, he was like,

167
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,160
just put a Johnny Rockets in there

168
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,240
and get it as like, as close to the entrance as you can.

169
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,040
Just kind of right when you come in, Johnny Rockets.

170
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,240
Yeah, and Johnny Rockets has outlived Dan Snyder

171
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,800
as part of the Six Flags family.

172
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,320
That's true.

173
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,000
We saw a darkened one from our cars over the Christmas

174
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,040
in the highlight of our Christmas season.

175
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,720
I cited it as a highlight as my recollection

176
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,040
during that episode.

177
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,800
I go, I really want to see the closed down Johnny Rockets.

178
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,400
Unlit Johnny Rockets.

179
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,960
Unlit Johnny Rockets in a theme park while I'm driving by.

180
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,320
He did such a shitty job.

181
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,920
Some of this we talked about before,

182
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,640
but as a reminder, among the things he did

183
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,840
while driving Six Flags to bankruptcy,

184
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,040
he put Harvey Weinstein on the board of directors.

185
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:20,040
So in order to attain the extremely valuable characters

186
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,120
from the movie Hoodwinked,

187
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,160
okay, there was something that Jason brought up last time,

188
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,560
which was that when they retired Mr. Six,

189
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,560
they replaced him with an Asian man in a little bubble

190
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,840
who popped up and said something.

191
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,160
And I didn't really know the ad super well

192
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,960
when Jason brought them up and alerted me to that,

193
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,240
maybe it's kind of racist.

194
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,560
And like, oh yeah, probably that sounds right.

195
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,080
But then this article illuminated that the,

196
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,160
or some article somewhere illuminated that

197
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,600
the casting notice for that part said,

198
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,320
we want people to imitate Charlie Chan.

199
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,560
Oh my God.

200
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,320
Yeah, Jesus.

201
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,120
So you were on it at a time, Jason.

202
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,880
Did they have to explain to the actors like,

203
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,520
oh, by the way, Charlie Chan is like, come on.

204
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,960
Why would you, you peripherally hear the name Amos and Andy

205
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,720
as like a bad thing, but Charlie Chan does not come up

206
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,360
in culture rightfully so.

207
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,200
Yeah.

208
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,400
Yeah.

209
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,080
So that's crazy.

210
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,200
Yeah, there were a lot of Snyder things we,

211
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,400
I mean, maybe we said this before

212
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,360
and maybe it just stuck out to me for some reason

213
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
that he had taken control of Six Flags

214
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,160
during a stockholder coup.

215
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,760
A coup, huh?

216
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,840
That's what it said in the article.

217
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,880
Maybe that didn't stick out to me so strongly

218
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,320
six months ago, that's all.

219
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,160
Yes.

220
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,720
You forgot what, you hadn't realized in your lifetime

221
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,080
what coups feel like.

222
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

223
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,360
So I saw that, I was like, oh, interesting.

224
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,320
Last night I watched.

225
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,160
Oh yes.

226
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,600
Oh, sorry, I was gonna say, last night I watched

227
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,760
Death of Stalin, a perfect timed movie to watch,

228
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,080
a perfect comedy to watch during these trying times.

229
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,520
Dan Snyder would have put a lot of the Congress Stormers

230
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,880
on the Six Flags board.

231
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,840
You're all in.

232
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,160
Yeah, so bad stuff from him.

233
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,600
He's done a ton of bad stuff like since we did an episode

234
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,000
about this in the summer.

235
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,360
Like it was all, at the time he was fighting the name change

236
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,440
of the football team, and I no longer wanna say

237
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,640
what the name of the team was.

238
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,400
The team now is called Washington Football Team.

239
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,120
Because of his inaction, they have to play

240
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,280
under this bizarre Halloween costume knockoff name,

241
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,440
and with the logo that's just a W.

242
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,200
So they're playing all season with this terrible name.

243
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,360
Oh, and only not because he ever decided to change it

244
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,480
on principle, but because FedEx, Pepsi, Nike, and Amazon

245
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,840
all were threatening to end their partnerships

246
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,560
with the Washington Football Team.

247
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,880
Pretty big companies to tangle with.

248
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,640
Yeah, yeah, sure.

249
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,800
Yeah, he's...

250
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,800
I feel like this is, well, this is not the last time

251
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,480
we'll talk about him on the show.

252
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,520
I feel like they'll feel, I feel like we're missing

253
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,800
a lot still, just from looking, even when we looked

254
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,680
at like five to 10 articles about what we're talking

255
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,320
about today, I feel like he's gonna be around.

256
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,280
Yeah, yeah, I think it's safe to call him at this point

257
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,840
the anti-Eisner, like for everything that Eisner brought

258
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,000
to the Disney company in a short amount of time,

259
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,080
despite a less good second half.

260
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,240
Eisner brought so many gifts, and Snyder brought only

261
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,440
failure and despair, and continues to, wherever he goes.

262
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,040
It's like if Eisner was like, all right, when you go

263
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,920
to Disneyland, you can buy aluminum siding now

264
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,760
at a store off of Main Street, $1,200 for a whole side

265
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,120
of your house.

266
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,760
Do I just walk out of the park with it?

267
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,760
No, we ship it, and that costume, that's an extra 500.

268
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,360
Breck owns an aluminum siding company.

269
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,400
It's under his name for legal reasons.

270
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,320
He is 10.

271
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,520
We were gonna put, we thought about putting Mickey

272
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,440
on the aluminum siding, but the paint would corrode,

273
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,040
it would make the aluminum weaker, so it's plain

274
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,080
aluminum siding, but trust me, it's Mickey's favorite kind.

275
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,080
Yes, same issue with Disney Airlines, you know,

276
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,080
if a plane goes down in a cornfield, there's a smoking

277
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,440
Mickey Mouse, if there's a tornado, tears a house down,

278
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,680
there's a Mickey Mouse in the rubble.

279
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,920
You don't want, bad optics, bad optics.

280
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,160
If you have a barn collapse or such.

281
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,080
Yeah, also worth noting, only a couple months ago,

282
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,960
we found out about when he was still in charge of Six Flags,

283
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,320
he was accused of, this only recently did this come out,

284
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,800
that he paid off somebody who made sexual misconduct claims

285
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,560
against him, oh, by the way, entire culture

286
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,920
of sexual misconduct all over the Washington football team

287
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,760
with this guy at the top, and before all this,

288
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,000
when he was still in charge of Six Flags, he took a private

289
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,240
jet to the Academy of Country Music Awards,

290
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,040
which he owned, because he also owned

291
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,840
Dick Clark Productions, and something happened,

292
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,120
I don't know what, but he ended up paying the person

293
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,920
$1.6 million, and this was covered up until recently,

294
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,080
until after our episode, this guy is the worst,

295
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,680
is he the worst active businessman?

296
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,520
I don't know.

297
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,360
I mean, there's no way to know, they're also.

298
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,600
That's such a bar high, I mean, I would say there's

299
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,240
a businessman I know of that's worse off the top of my head.

300
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,160
Sure, currently.

301
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,360
But I think, you know, you could certainly put him

302
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,920
in the top 300.

303
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,000
Oh, God.

304
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,440
Yeah, I wish you could narrow it down more.

305
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,440
I top 10 for worst people in America, like pretty easy.

306
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,440
He's pretty bad.

307
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,280
You forget about him.

308
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,120
And I think they're all friends, too.

309
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,560
I think all of the top 10 all know each other very well.

310
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,960
Oh, yeah.

311
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,800
Yeah, Hamptons.

312
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,080
They're like a sea, the society of explorers

313
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,640
and adventures, for sure.

314
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,640
The modern day version.

315
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,480
The dark sea.

316
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,960
Yeah, so, a bad guy.

317
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,000
So there's so much there and we might not even know

318
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,760
the full extent of it, but we, in talking about him

319
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,160
and, okay, just to remind you why any of this came up before,

320
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,160
his first act when he took over Six Flags in a Coup

321
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,440
was chasing Mr. Six out of town.

322
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,120
We don't want any more Mr. Six.

323
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,920
We don't want our brand associated

324
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,920
with the foolishness like this.

325
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,280
Apparently, something he did want his brand associated with

326
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,840
was children's haircuts.

327
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,320
I don't understand this whatsoever.

328
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,040
I can't begin to know, and no one ever explained why.

329
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,560
Why associate these things?

330
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,560
You know, and Mr. Six is around this haircuttery.

331
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,760
He is around and he looks like he's dying.

332
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,840
Like, he looks like this is killing him.

333
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,120
Yeah, by the end, I think 2006 or so, he took over.

334
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,200
By 2009, they're bleeding money and it becomes clear

335
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,840
that they have to get Mr. Six back in there

336
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,520
as quick as possible, and he's like the main attraction

337
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,840
by the time they open a regional children's hair salon.

338
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,920
I have a theory, and I couldn't find any confirmation

339
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,120
about this, but I was looking at the commercial

340
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,840
for this place, because that's like,

341
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,800
there's only one commercial online, I think, right?

342
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,880
There's a couple variants I found.

343
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,920
Yeah, okay, I think I watched it.

344
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,960
Versions are the same.

345
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,520
It looks a little bit like my memory

346
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,720
of what Club Libby Lou looked like.

347
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,560
Yes.

348
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,640
Club Libby Lou from Downtown Disney

349
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,280
in Eva's episode in the underworld.

350
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,680
Yeah. Exactly.

351
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,920
Jane clocked that too.

352
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,680
I showed her the commercial and she's like,

353
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,040
is this like Six Flags Club Libby Lou?

354
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,960
And it's like, well, you're not wrong.

355
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,120
Yeah.

356
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,640
But it opens just as all of the Club Libby Lou's are closing.

357
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,240
So Club Libby Lou, I think all of them close

358
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,680
or they're all done by 2009, which is when this opens.

359
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,760
So- Yeah, weird.

360
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,960
I either like, it's a complete direct connection of like,

361
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,720
oh, let's capture that part of the market

362
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,600
because this whole thing is failing,

363
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,080
or he's such a bad businessman.

364
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,560
He went, you know what we should invest heavily in?

365
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,800
Like a thing like Club Libby Lou,

366
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,640
look how well it's doing.

367
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,360
Cut to a year later, they're opening

368
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,320
as all the Club Libby Lou's are closing.

369
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,840
I like to think it's number two.

370
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,320
I like to think it's the second one

371
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,200
because it makes them look more idiotic.

372
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,080
I guess you also gotta include

373
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,680
the 2008 financial collapse in here.

374
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,560
Yes. Sure.

375
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,960
Now, if we place that, okay,

376
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,840
people are paring everything down to essentials

377
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,640
in their lives and cutting your hair

378
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,640
and your children's hair is essential,

379
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,800
even if you do it less.

380
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,280
Putting pink sparkles and crimps

381
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,360
and like action figures in your kid's hair.

382
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,280
Giving your son a green mohawk,

383
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,520
maybe not essential post 2008 collapse.

384
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,200
Maybe just a little trim.

385
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,920
Maybe not spending $50, which is what the cuts here cost.

386
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,120
Yeah, and it's also, okay, we'll get into the problems

387
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,120
with it, but it's like, if it was like Mickey's hair salon

388
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,560
and Mickey was there, you're like, okay,

389
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,360
I could see that kid would be like,

390
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,240
I'd like to go and see Mickey and get this hair thing done.

391
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,760
But what is really the draw for a kid

392
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,240
other than like video,

393
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,640
like you can play a video game in here.

394
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,680
Well, that's what I think.

395
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,040
It seems like someone half remember

396
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,520
with like a hangover headache,

397
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,680
remembering the nineties of like,

398
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,960
oh yeah, Disney tried,

399
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,560
like they can't go to theme parks every weekend,

400
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,720
but if they go to the mall a couple of times a month

401
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,400
and we do like Mickey's kitchen and Disney Quest,

402
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,080
DSPN, so like someone half remembers that.

403
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,600
And it's like, kids always need haircuts.

404
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,560
It feels like someone grasping for like the light switch

405
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,960
in the dark when you first walk into your home.

406
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,880
Yes, I totally know what you're saying.

407
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,320
I also do wonder if like, he just,

408
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,920
there's some like Intel or he was like,

409
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,400
there's a hole in the market right here,

410
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,280
or it's just some weird funneling scheme,

411
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,400
or there's some like controversy,

412
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,440
like how he was enriching himself with all these deals,

413
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,800
but like bleeding the companies dry.

414
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,080
Did he invest in barber chairs?

415
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,560
He had like 3000 barber chairs

416
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,520
sitting in a warehouse somewhere.

417
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,520
And he's like, we gotta figure out how to use this

418
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,000
so I can get paid and get make my money back.

419
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,600
He owned a fuchsia sparkles company

420
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,680
and needed to clear them out somehow.

421
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,600
Yeah.

422
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,880
Snyder opened, oh yeah.

423
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,880
He had a hundred thousand tons of sparkles.

424
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,800
Sitting in a warehouse.

425
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,840
Like a garbage dump.

426
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,240
Just like the wind blowing like sparkles

427
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,520
getting some of the maintenance guy's eyes.

428
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,360
Yeah.

429
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,920
This has gotta go.

430
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,720
They tried like using it to like celebrate a touchdown

431
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,200
for a little while and it got in the football player's eyes.

432
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
And he's like, we can't do this anymore.

433
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,400
This new artist, Katy Perry,

434
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,080
she might buy some tons of it for a concert tour.

435
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,480
She'll do some glitter blats at the end.

436
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,000
That's not gonna be enough though.

437
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,840
I need answers.

438
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,880
He's screaming at people on the board.

439
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,960
Gotta figure this out for me.

440
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,160
Like rats are burrowing into the sparkle pile

441
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,280
that they live there.

442
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,120
There's nests of rats who are all just permanently fuchsia

443
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,360
when they burst out of the pile.

444
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,720
Dan Snyder's sparkle warehouse.

445
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,000
It's like five miles long.

446
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,280
Before we get too far into this,

447
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,120
I guess we should say,

448
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,480
so the elevator pitch on this place

449
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,240
is that it was a kid's hair salon

450
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,840
where they could get their hair cut

451
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,040
while playing video games

452
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,960
or watching footage of roller coasters

453
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,600
on 2009 era flat screen TV.

454
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,880
So just before high def,

455
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,240
but everything is just kind of wide screen.

456
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,840
So you can watch that,

457
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,280
but it's also a toy store and it's also a candy store.

458
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,600
And also you can do kids parties there.

459
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,040
So a little unfocused, a little scatter shot.

460
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,000
This is the shows that your shark tanks

461
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,400
and your prophets would say,

462
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,160
pick a thing, pick a lane and stick with it.

463
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,840
God, there's even like,

464
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,440
there's some slogan somewhere in the store

465
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,000
that keeps going on and on and on.

466
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It is like haircuts and thrills with characters

467
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,080
and photos and surprises plus games.

468
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,280
That's a literal thing.

469
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,240
It's like a six, this is run on sentence of what they do.

470
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,520
Pick one maybe.

471
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,080
This is reminding me, I had a job interview

472
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,400
10 years ago when I didn't have a job in LA.

473
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,800
And it was like, we're opening up a retail space.

474
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,560
That's also gonna be a performance space.

475
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,680
And we will also be making like short form video as well

476
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,120
that we will play in store.

477
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,440
And we need somebody to work in the stock room,

478
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,520
but also perform on the stage when we do show.

479
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,880
Like it was a laundry list.

480
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,240
And I met a woman in like a suite

481
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,120
at like a hotel on Sunset Boulevard by the comedy store.

482
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,720
Like somewhere along there.

483
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,360
And she was just like, you are perfect for this.

484
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,720
This is great.

485
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,520
She goes, all right, what I want you to do is email me

486
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,920
with how much you would need to make an hour.

487
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,880
And I go, oh, okay.

488
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,480
And then I think I asked for like some just insanely low,

489
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,240
like $15 an hour, please.

490
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,520
Never heard anything.

491
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,360
I don't know.

492
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,120
I'm assuming whatever this place was, it never opened.

493
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,960
But I was like, this isn't real.

494
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,280
This can't work.

495
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,240
It can't work.

496
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,560
It's too much stuff.

497
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,240
You were gonna perform?

498
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,080
I don't know.

499
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,920
I mean, I don't know.

500
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,760
Was it magic?

501
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,600
What was it?

502
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,240
I don't, I should see if I can find the email.

503
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,080
I think I found it on Craigslist.

504
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,920
Yeah, I don't know.

505
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,800
I really don't know.

506
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,480
But it was like a list of 10 things

507
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,480
that this retail store would now do

508
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,760
that was going to open on Sunset.

509
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,600
I think on Sunset Boulevard, but.

510
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,240
These pitches that all sound like the Garth Brooks video

511
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,720
of like, I just joined Facebook.

512
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,600
I wanna share real stuff, cool stuff.

513
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,520
Let the conversation begin.

514
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,200
And then he immediately bails less than a week later.

515
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,960
Did he not do that?

516
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,000
I don't think he lasted very long at all.

517
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,640
Let the conversation stop.

518
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,080
Yeah.

519
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,280
Weird.

520
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,200
Yeah, so, and then I think the big facts

521
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,160
that we're missing as Mike was alluding to

522
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,200
is that this is not a thing in Six Flags.

523
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,920
This was at malls, namely two malls.

524
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,400
Two, that's it.

525
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,760
That's all I got to.

526
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,960
Like Mickey's Kitchen.

527
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,360
Oh yeah, yeah.

528
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,120
Which was in the LA area somewhere and at Woodfield.

529
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,040
We got it all at Woodfield.

530
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,880
I didn't forget, never forget the song.

531
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,000
It was at a mall in Hartford, Connecticut

532
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,240
called Blueback Square.

533
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,480
It was a very clunky name

534
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,800
and I probably won't attempt to say it again.

535
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,920
And then at the King of Prussia Mall,

536
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,720
which is where in Pennsylvania?

537
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,920
Did you grow up with this at all, Jason,

538
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,800
or have you been there?

539
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,840
Oh yes, yeah, that was one of my old stomping grounds.

540
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,160
I've never been to West Hartford, Connecticut

541
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,440
and I have no idea what differentiates it

542
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,800
from Hartford, Connecticut.

543
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,320
But King of Prussia Mall was about an hour

544
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,880
from where I grew up and that was like a whole day event.

545
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,880
Well, we're not just going to the regular mall.

546
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,200
We're not going to Granite Run Mall.

547
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,280
We're not going to Axton Mall.

548
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,960
We're going to King of Prussia Mall.

549
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,800
This is the whole thing because King of Prussia Mall

550
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,000
is two malls next to each other with a walkway in between.

551
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,960
And this was in the court, not the plaza.

552
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,040
The court is smaller and in the past,

553
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,560
it used to be the fancier mall.

554
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,440
But when I looked up the listing recently

555
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,040
of the King of Prussia Mall, it's like,

556
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,960
well, the Louboutin store's in the plaza now

557
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,440
where the, like around the corner from the comic shop

558
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,720
and the old American apparel building

559
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,440
or the old American apparel store front.

560
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,640
So I guess it's been a little more distributed

561
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,200
but it gets a lot of traffic.

562
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,720
There's a lot of high-end stores

563
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,000
and like at some point in time, it was

564
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,760
and it might still be one of the largest shopping complexes

565
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,360
in America.

566
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,000
That's one of the mega huge ones.

567
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,360
Yeah, in my mall wanderings, I know that's one.

568
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,320
And what is, is the Canada one West Edmonton?

569
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,040
I think it's come up before,

570
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,160
when we were saying what are topics we should do in the year,

571
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,680
people have definitely brought up West Edmonton,

572
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,120
but that's, man, I want to go.

573
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,520
So many topics have people brought up.

574
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,840
I'm like, I gotta go before we talk about it.

575
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,680
Yeah.

576
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,840
Especially, particularly Dollywood.

577
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,560
That's definitely the...

578
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,040
Are we the only people in America

579
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,440
who will get the second shot of the vaccine

580
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,520
and like burst out?

581
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,360
We gotta get the pigeon forage.

582
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,440
Sounds good to me.

583
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,280
I'm pretty cooped up.

584
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,080
Yeah, no, I bet there's a lot of people waiting.

585
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,360
Although I think, you know what?

586
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,880
The people that want to go to pigeon forage

587
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,160
are better there already.

588
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,480
They are there as we speak.

589
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,680
Yeah.

590
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,960
I don't think it closed.

591
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,200
But Dollywood has seasons though.

592
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,080
Have they had to, I guess they've been open and pinned down.

593
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,800
I have no idea.

594
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,640
Yeah, yeah.

595
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,800
I shouldn't talk out of my ass about Dollywood.

596
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,640
I've done that before.

597
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,160
Not a dry county.

598
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,120
We've learned that.

599
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,200
Okay, so let's...

600
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,400
What are some other basics about this place?

601
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,040
Okay, here's some official...

602
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,320
Is this their official copy?

603
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
I think it might be.

604
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,320
Roller coaster cuts clients, kids only,

605
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,040
will be treated like royalty from the moment they enter

606
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,440
the brightly colored salon boutique.

607
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,440
This state of the art design features

608
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:35,440
a 22 inch flat panel TV, as Jason was alluding.

609
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,120
An okay TV.

610
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,080
An okay TV.

611
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,160
About what I have in my bedroom.

612
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,720
It is eight years old.

613
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,280
Never have been able to quite get the settings right.

614
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,840
A TV that you've, the type of TV you would encourage

615
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,840
your parents to replace is in front of your child.

616
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,840
They are fully immersed into a Six Flags experience

617
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,720
by watching Six Flags TV, different thing,

618
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,400
or riding one of our virtual Six Flags roller coasters,

619
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,400
making it easy and fun for stylists

620
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,120
to work on children's hair.

621
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,160
So there's footage you could see if this were kids

622
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,680
to lay down to get their shampoo.

623
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,320
I'm, wait a minute, I'm sorry.

624
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,240
Don't wanna get ahead of myself, but it's not the shampoo,

625
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,200
but the shampoo-f.

626
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,960
I believe I saw the phrase shampoo,

627
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,800
the world's first shampoo theater.

628
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,280
Theater, what do you mean?

629
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,120
What?

630
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,960
No.

631
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,200
They don't know either.

632
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,960
So yeah, step one, you watch a small TV playing the POV

633
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,960
of a roller coaster while you get shampooed.

634
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,600
And it's in like the ceiling, it's like up above the child.

635
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,840
Yeah, like a dentist's office would have,

636
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,400
my guy go to a dentist that has,

637
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,000
that's playing like nature footage or something.

638
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,080
So there's that.

639
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,280
Again, don't wanna get off on too much of a tangent,

640
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,360
but I was like, what is Six Flags TV?

641
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,760
Cause Six Flags TV was also playing in the window,

642
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,720
like if you pass by it in the mall.

643
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,720
And Six Flags TV is very Disney World in Room video

644
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:23,360
where some agreeable, pleasant lady is showing you stuff.

645
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,760
But remember, this is the Dan Snyder era,

646
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,280
so there's bizarre tie-ins that this poor woman has to do.

647
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,600
So here's a quick clip of what Six Flags TV

648
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,720
was all about at the time.

649
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,920
Take it away, blandly pleasant lady.

650
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,400
Welcome back to Six Flags TV.

651
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,320
I'm your host, Kid Hoover, and I gotta tell ya,

652
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,360
I'm on a mission, cause something's up

653
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,720
with those Looney Tunes characters.

654
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,400
I mean, when you bump into them around this time every day,

655
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,440
they're kind of mellow, blissed out,

656
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,320
and I have a feeling something's going on right in here.

657
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,200
First of all, is she implying

658
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,160
that the Looney Tunes are getting high?

659
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,480
Yes, she is.

660
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,360
That is absolutely what I thought.

661
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,800
Around this time, and I don't know if that time is 4.20,

662
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,840
but if so, the Looney Tunes are getting mellow and blissed out.

663
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,180
Yeah, they are smoking up.

664
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,520
Yes, that's what she's saying.

665
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,640
That's what she thinks.

666
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,240
That's what Kit Hoover thinks.

667
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,600
That's Kit Hoover's official stance.

668
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,880
But you're going to find out it's not what you expected.

669
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,960
There's a different way they're getting loony.

670
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,560
Ah ha ha, I've been looking for them everywhere.

671
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,680
William, what is this place?

672
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,200
We're at AquaBeds, and this is where

673
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,040
our guests come to relax after walking

674
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,360
through the park for a long time.

675
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,920
You even let these critters in here?

676
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,240
Why not?

677
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:41,920
Looney Tunes?

678
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,280
Yeah.

679
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,280
I see you, Sylvester.

680
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,600
They even put that head down.

681
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,360
People are looking for you.

682
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,200
So the Looney Tunes.

683
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,680
This is like the water coffins that we

684
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,280
did during the City Walk saga, except there's no top.

685
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,960
It's an un-lidded water coffin.

686
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,920
It's an open casket.

687
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,040
It's an open casket.

688
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,160
It's an open casket.

689
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,920
The Aquabed challenge.

690
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,280
Yeah, yeah.

691
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,560
Where she has established the Looney Tunes are all hiding

692
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,600
so they don't have to see children.

693
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,320
This is something I feel like Disney would not

694
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,680
allude to, the Chip and Dale and Mickey and Minnie

695
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,760
don't want to see you today.

696
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,960
Yeah, because they might be high.

697
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,920
Yeah.

698
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,080
Well, they're covering their eyes in this shot.

699
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,000
Are they hiding that they're red?

700
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,760
Yeah, I think maybe.

701
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,680
I can't see them.

702
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,880
I can't deal with the kids.

703
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,640
They'll know.

704
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,680
This keeps going.

705
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,840
We might have hit the peak of it, but she.

706
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,440
Our high powered water jets.

707
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,880
And when you sit down on them, it

708
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,880
feels like three or four pairs of hands massaging you

709
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,960
all at the same time.

710
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,640
A little spa in the middle of Six Flags.

711
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,480
Exactly.

712
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,680
Who usually comes here?

713
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,200
Everyone.

714
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,720
No one.

715
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,280
Kids after a long walk through the park,

716
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,960
their kids like to come and relax.

717
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,200
It's just a nice way to chill for a little while.

718
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,120
Do you want to try, kid?

719
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,200
Should I kick Daffy off?

720
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,400
Daffy, come on.

721
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,120
Shake your tail feather.

722
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,000
Daffy, two minutes.

723
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,360
Two minutes.

724
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,240
Daffy is stomping.

725
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,200
Come on, Daffy.

726
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,840
He's angry that he's been forcibly removed

727
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,880
from his unsanctioned water massage.

728
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,640
Tweety bird, of course, looks very dirty.

729
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,640
And that guy's tie is very wide.

730
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,440
I will say that is one of the dirtiest

731
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,920
Tweety birds I've ever seen.

732
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,800
Just a filthy bird.

733
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,840
Not picture ready.

734
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,440
Lying in a Cleopatra, it's almost like a sultry stance

735
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,600
a little bit.

736
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,320
Yeah, Tweety also before this, I feel

737
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,760
like was lying on his stomach, which hot as exactly.

738
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:54,040
I don't want to cast anything.

739
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,200
But if you're lying on your front,

740
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,560
aren't you getting your genitals massaged?

741
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,600
And your tummy, your Tweety tummy.

742
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,480
Your dirty Tweety tummy is getting massaged?

743
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,360
Sylvester the cat is getting his weird cat penis rumbled.

744
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,480
Instead of doing his paid job of being nice to children.

745
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,440
Like, OK, wait a minute.

746
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,120
We were all in the water coffins.

747
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,320
Now, imagine you turn over and you're getting pummeled

748
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,120
with water in your dick.

749
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,480
Oh, yeah, we never flip.

750
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,680
Wait, wait, no, aren't we on our stomachs, though?

751
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,520
Which way were we?

752
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,880
We were on our stomachs, but because of the thing

753
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,560
on the top, that's where all the water,

754
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,240
that's where the massage was happening is on our backs.

755
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,120
Oh, you're right.

756
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,200
We were laying down just on a flat massage table.

757
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,800
Right.

758
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,160
This is a different deal.

759
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,960
The massaging is coming from underneath,

760
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,160
whereas the coffin is coming from on top.

761
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,840
So if you're on your stomach, you're

762
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,560
getting a massage on your chest, your stomach,

763
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,760
and your genitals.

764
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,320
That's just the fact.

765
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,960
Yeah, within fur, within...

766
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,520
If the person hired to be in the Sylvester costume is a furry,

767
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,320
today is their lucky day.

768
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:14,040
Six Flags was having people come in and use a sex machine,

769
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,120
essentially.

770
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,640
Yeah.

771
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,680
Did you also notice that earlier, there's

772
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,800
like some, when Daffy gets kicked out,

773
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,840
there's just like some guy sitting and watching

774
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,640
in the corner, just like a guy in a chair.

775
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,640
A couple of jackets next to him.

776
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,720
Uh-oh.

777
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,640
Uh-oh.

778
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,920
Little Alfred Molina and Boogie Nights vibes.

779
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,640
And then just this undressed set of stairs.

780
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,080
This is an unthemed room with black wood.

781
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,520
Could have done an episode about the AquaBeds episode

782
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,160
of Six Flags TV.

783
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,680
Are there any Six Flags with AquaBeds still inside?

784
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,800
Hmm.

785
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,960
That's a good question.

786
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,600
That might be worth...

787
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,600
Because you know they would be the exact same beds.

788
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,080
Did they convert these into coffins for the coffin

789
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,640
challenge during Fright Fest?

790
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,160
Yeah.

791
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,560
Scoop them out.

792
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,640
Scoop out the aqua-vart.

793
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,440
Scoop out the...

794
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,920
Get the water into the vlog flume.

795
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,720
We've reused these things for six different things.

796
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,840
They've been ride vehicles, they've been massage beds.

797
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,040
What if there's just a human being inside the bed rubbing?

798
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,200
He's just putting his hands up and touching

799
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,800
through the material and that's the massage.

800
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,240
It's just a teen, it's a bored teen,

801
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,160
massaging you through the AquaBed.

802
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,200
Possible.

803
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,880
Just got a hair spritzer in his hand.

804
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,800
Yeah.

805
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,120
Watching a three inch like iPod color,

806
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,080
like office on the iPod color.

807
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,480
This also brings up something that I had seen

808
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,080
in some of the videos of the Six Flags drive

809
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,200
through the park Christmas experience.

810
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,520
I don't think any of us, we were all complaining

811
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,120
because we didn't see the Looney Tunes,

812
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,600
but in the videos I saw where the Looney Tunes were out,

813
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,520
it was some very weird combinations.

814
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,840
It's like Bugs and Sylvester and it's like,

815
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,680
what, that's not a combo.

816
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,920
So this is like Daffy, Sylvester and Tweety.

817
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,760
And Sylvester and Tweety make sense to me,

818
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,280
but it's like, what is...

819
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,800
Is like Daffy is like a third.

820
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,400
That combo isn't when you see a lot.

821
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,280
They don't have the strict like character code

822
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,160
of a Disney either.

823
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,280
Mrs. Taz could hang out with Daffy

824
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,960
and they wouldn't give a shit.

825
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,480
Even though Mrs. Taz and Daffy never hung out

826
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,640
in the cartoon maybe.

827
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,560
Now somebody's really mad

828
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,520
because there's probably one cartoon from the 90s

829
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,680
where Mrs. Taz did hang out with Daffy.

830
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,720
So I apologize.

831
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,960
Send it to the gripes.

832
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,320
There probably is.

833
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,360
And that's like, Mike, you had sent me the,

834
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,800
JCPenney was selling Versace Popeye t-shirts

835
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,240
and then I found all the other,

836
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,520
they brought back all the other Looney Tunes

837
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,200
and baggy street wear t-shirts.

838
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,040
Yes.

839
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,880
Are very...

840
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,880
That's still around?

841
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,360
They call that a resurgence.

842
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,320
It's like retro merch now, I think.

843
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,400
So yeah, you can find,

844
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,720
I think at a lot of different stores,

845
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,680
like Bugs and Taz back to back

846
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,480
with baggy pants and shirts on.

847
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,320
Yeah, Taz.

848
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,000
That should have never gone away.

849
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,520
Back off.

850
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,120
Aggressive Taz.

851
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,080
Did we all have one of these at least?

852
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,680
I had like a Bugs shirt where he was like dressed cool

853
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,040
in the 90s.

854
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,880
But only one.

855
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,280
I might not have.

856
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,320
I guess now's my chance.

857
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,920
Jason, did you ever own a cool Looney Tunes merch?

858
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,920
Oh, yeah, I had like Taz in a backwards baseball cap

859
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,320
and like cargo shorts, I think.

860
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,200
That works.

861
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,480
That's part of it, yeah.

862
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,680
Maybe a Taz tearing through it.

863
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,040
Taz kind of sadly comes into play

864
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,800
and I found pictures of one of the roller coaster cuts,

865
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,280
I think the King of Pressure one, on a message board.

866
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:16,360
And Taz is just sort of like here.

867
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,560
He's just sort of placed in the front window

868
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,240
under a begrudgingly placed barbershop pole.

869
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,320
And if you look closely, Mr. Six is standing

870
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,160
facing away from the camera like the Blair Witch Project.

871
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,080
Boy, that's creepy as hell.

872
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,080
He's half shadowed.

873
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,920
Yeah.

874
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,800
Oh, God, that's unsettling.

875
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,120
Yeah, the theming for this place.

876
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,240
Yeah.

877
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,240
The logo is like old timey a little bit,

878
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,960
but then Taz is just in the window

879
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,840
like a little plastic Taz that is the same one they have,

880
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,480
I think, at all the Six Flags.

881
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,760
So I think I took a picture of Taz and Mrs. Taz

882
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,080
in that style on the way out of Fright Fest two years ago.

883
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,480
And boy, were the colors faded on those.

884
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,400
Well, and it looks like he was rescued

885
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,840
from the Warner Brothers store warehouse

886
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:13,560
and then just placed in like the glass storefront.

887
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,280
He kind of looks like he's in the Magneto prison

888
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,320
from X-Men.

889
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,480
The plastic prison. The plastic queue, yeah.

890
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,280
He's the only character because opposite him

891
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,480
is just like a fully white child mannequin.

892
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,200
Yeah.

893
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,960
So it's two, it's white children's mannequins

894
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,200
and then the Tasmanian devil.

895
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,040
Yes.

896
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,000
And was Taz that popular in 2009?

897
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,480
No, more hangover from the 90s.

898
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,560
Yeah, yeah.

899
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:45,800
I mean, Taz's heyday was the mid 90s, right?

900
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,480
Mm-hmm.

901
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,680
I've read all about it.

902
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,120
There's this thing going on, Tasmania.

903
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,880
It's Tasmania out there.

904
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,720
Right, it was Tasmania.

905
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,600
We've got to get it into the mall.

906
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,640
People loved Taz in the 90s, but I feel like he's popular.

907
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,400
Why did he come to represent being a wild man?

908
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,640
That's interesting.

909
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,320
I think 90s, there was like a lot of,

910
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,320
I mean, now we're finally getting

911
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,680
the full Deadpool movie treatment,

912
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,520
because we've had a couple of Deadpool movies.

913
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,280
But like the 90s was very much like

914
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,640
about extreme characters.

915
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,880
They were like aggressive, and in comics for sure,

916
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,600
it was Deadpool, it was, I don't know, Cable.

917
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,440
Cable kind of, or Lobo.

918
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,800
Begun to kill, Lobo, oh.

919
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,640
Yeah.

920
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,480
Did Lobo start in the 1990s?

921
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,960
Was it the late 80s?

922
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,680
Maybe late 80s, early 90s.

923
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,200
But his heyday was the 90s, yes.

924
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,600
And Wolverine got caught up in this a little

925
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,200
when they did the Marvel versus DC crossover.

926
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,040
Wolverine fought Lobo.

927
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,320
Very strange combo.

928
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,920
Scott, do you know Lobo?

929
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,440
No, it's Lobo.

930
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,720
Just do a quick Google search of DC Comics Lobo.

931
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,880
And he was like an alien bounty hunter, bad guy,

932
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,080
who would like curse, and he was vulgar,

933
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,040
and I guess he was sexual.

934
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,960
Was Lobo sexual, Jason?

935
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,800
I think he was. I think he was horny.

936
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,360
I mean, it was one of those things where it's like,

937
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,600
oh, well, in Britain, DC had those weekly comics

938
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,520
like 2000 AD, and they had a lot more

939
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,440
like grungy space opera kind of like stuff.

940
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,360
So then they introduced a kind of one of those characters,

941
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,640
some of the writers who worked on those

942
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,680
would introduce Lobo, and Lobo was very extreme.

943
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,040
Yeah, he's got a cigar in the action figure

944
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,280
I'm looking at, and a flamethrower,

945
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,360
and then like a toxic symbol.

946
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,880
Yeah, he was created in 1983, but yeah,

947
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:44,640
my memory is, yeah, he had his big popularity surge

948
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,560
in the 90s.

949
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,320
They were pushing him then.

950
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,880
This is making me remember when I was working on a show

951
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,880
where there was a joke about Tasmanian devil tattoos,

952
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,400
and I don't remember the joke, but the implication

953
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,720
was the Tasmanian devil tattoos are not cool,

954
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,080
if you can imagine that, but they are a lame thing to have.

955
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,320
And it was an animated show, so things have to be gone

956
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,360
over and over and over and over again.

957
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:18,920
So in like the 10th time this comes up in the editing room,

958
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,160
the producer of the show lifts his arm and like,

959
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,400
well, I guess I get the message, and he has one,

960
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,280
and it's all stretched and faded weird, like, oh no.

961
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,400
You've had to hear this so many times.

962
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,840
There might be a listener.

963
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,760
I didn't write the joke, let me be clear.

964
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,920
I'll keep it nebulous, my feelings about Tasmanian devil

965
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,760
tattoos.

966
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,920
Yeah, plus it's coming back, it's back, you know?

967
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,000
It's back, yeah.

968
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,960
It's back, Tas is back.

969
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,240
You look on eBay, you have vintage clothes or Depop

970
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,920
or vintage stores, like Tas, big bucks.

971
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,440
Do you see this, do you see I pulled up here?

972
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,760
This is a cover of a Lobo comic.

973
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,560
It says first fraggin' issue, and it's an angle

974
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,280
from under him, and he's pointing at his dick,

975
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,000
and it says, I got your cover enhancement right here.

976
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,800
I'm into Lobo, I want the Lobo movie now.

977
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,080
Scott loves Lobo.

978
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,040
I got my in finally, get him in the justice,

979
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,320
get him in the DC verse, and now I'm paying attention.

980
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,160
They did a little of it on TV.

981
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,240
Oh, he showed up, yeah.

982
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,280
Yeah, they did a little of it on TV.

983
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,240
Yeah, but the show was canceled.

984
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,280
Okay, sorry Lobo.

985
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,800
Future guest of the show wrote on that.

986
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,880
Oh sure, okay.

987
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,400
Yeah, yeah.

988
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,920
He got to write some dick stuff.

989
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,200
We'll ask him all about the dick stuff.

990
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,480
So Lobo's dick.

991
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,560
Okay, where were we here?

992
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,280
Oh, you were talking about the bizarre,

993
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,680
the color scheme of the place.

994
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,760
I, here's another corporate little message.

995
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,080
Roller coaster cuts is a unique opportunity

996
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,600
to inject Six Flags into the everyday lives of children

997
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,400
while pursuing new non-traditional growth avenues

998
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,640
for the company.

999
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,680
So that kind of tells you what they were trying to do maybe

1000
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,960
is like, as Jason was saying,

1001
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,560
like okay, so there's the Disney store.

1002
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,760
You can't always go to Disneyland,

1003
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,080
but you can go to the Disney store

1004
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,800
and then you see those characters

1005
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,680
and then the branding is in your head

1006
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,960
and that keeps the Disney spirit in your head

1007
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,320
and then maybe you want to go to Disneyland more.

1008
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,360
That's what they're trying to do with Six Flags.

1009
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,520
So they are, I think they do successfully communicate

1010
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,360
a lot about Six Flags.

1011
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,920
That it's very busy graphics,

1012
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,560
not well planned out,

1013
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,480
incoherent color schemes,

1014
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,360
the use of the Venga boys,

1015
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,200
licensed characters who you don't quite recognize.

1016
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,480
But, and so Mr. Six was there,

1017
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,480
also in the commercial is wags the dog

1018
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,800
and Henry the octopus, both from the Wiggles,

1019
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,400
which were popular and I think remain popular,

1020
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,120
like still do tours.

1021
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,240
But I probably know who they were

1022
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,560
if I were three years old when they were popular,

1023
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,520
which I was not.

1024
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,240
And I gotta say, I like Henry the octopus.

1025
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,240
I like how all of his little limbs have like pant legs.

1026
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,120
I think he's fun.

1027
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,720
We came across Henry the octopus before

1028
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,160
and I didn't know who he was at the time

1029
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,160
because when we did that episode,

1030
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,880
we did a tweet, which was Mark Shapiro,

1031
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,840
who was the guy under Dan Snyder,

1032
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:48,640
the president and CEO of Six Flags at the time.

1033
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,720
He now runs the agency Endeavor.

1034
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,120
And if you remember the last episode,

1035
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,120
he is a personal enemy of Papa John.

1036
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,440
Papa John thinks he should be in jail.

1037
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,720
But during this time, he had to answer questions

1038
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,840
live on television about a teenager

1039
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,840
who got decapitated by one of their roller coasters.

1040
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,320
He was not on, he snuck into the wrong area

1041
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,680
and the roller coaster went by

1042
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,240
and it was a very unfortunate accident.

1043
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,600
This guy had to address it live on TV

1044
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,000
and for some reason he did it in front of

1045
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
all of the Wiggles characters dancing,

1046
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,120
notably the octopus, which a couple people said,

1047
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,960
hey, he has a name, damn it, it's Henry.

1048
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,080
So I was delighted to see the ad and like,

1049
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:36,080
oh wow, that's the decapitation distracting octopus.

1050
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,720
Yeah, but he's just kind of like staring at a kid

1051
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,960
getting their hair cut.

1052
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,480
That's the funny thing.

1053
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,560
Here, let me see if I have the right commercial.

1054
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,040
I'll play one of these ads and you obviously can't see these,

1055
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,040
but you can look them up, Six Flags roller coaster cuts.

1056
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,960
Oh here, this one has it, I believe.

1057
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,840
And I'm gonna turn the volume way down

1058
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:00,280
because if you can imagine they are playing Venga Boys

1059
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,560
extremely loud.

1060
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,400
There we go.

1061
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,440
Getting a haircut is way more fun

1062
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,880
at Six Flags roller coaster cuts at Blue Bag Square.

1063
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,600
It's where you'll find great haircuts

1064
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,960
with all the thrills of Six Flags.

1065
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,440
This place is awesome.

1066
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,240
It's a full interactive experience.

1067
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,200
You'll wish we'd have been around when you were a kid

1068
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,320
or when you still had hair.

1069
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,160
One back.

1070
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,920
Visit us at rollercoastercuts.com

1071
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,240
or come on in to roller coaster cuts at Blue Bag Square.

1072
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,640
We're open every day.

1073
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,400
Oh wait.

1074
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,440
Warfags, warfum.

1075
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,400
Yeah, okay.

1076
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,280
That was Mr. Six earlier when they mentioned somebody,

1077
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:44,080
when you had more hair, what the hell does he say here?

1078
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,960
I was gonna ask that, I don't know.

1079
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:46,960
I don't know.

1080
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,800
I watched it six times.

1081
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,920
I was like, oh, I guess they'll know.

1082
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,760
I don't know, I can't tell.

1083
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,080
Maybe the seventh is the charm.

1084
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,240
Let's see, here we go.

1085
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,320
Or when you still had hair.

1086
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,160
One back.

1087
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,880
Want back.

1088
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,640
Want that?

1089
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,200
Want that.

1090
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,720
Want that.

1091
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,040
You like hair?

1092
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,360
Want that.

1093
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,920
Womp womp?

1094
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,640
Is it a womp womp like that?

1095
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,040
No.

1096
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,680
Hmm, one more.

1097
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,800
One more, yeah.

1098
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,360
See if you get it, listener.

1099
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,600
One back.

1100
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,240
I'm stumped.

1101
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:24,920
No.

1102
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,880
So, you see, can we take a screenshot of this,

1103
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,880
of us right now, three of us with this face?

1104
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,880
I'll do it, I got it.

1105
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,160
Oh yeah, sure, yes please.

1106
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,400
I don't know, I don't know.

1107
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,680
Yeah, hmm, okay, so a commercial

1108
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,280
with Loud Vankleboy's music,

1109
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,200
a sound bite that we can't understand,

1110
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,720
as Jason said, it cuts to, I like this kid.

1111
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,560
Big flags.

1112
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,080
This place is awesome.

1113
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:50,920
Itелич.

1114
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,720
This place is awesome, and then it cuts to the octopus

1115
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,840
with all of his arms shoved in front of his body,

1116
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,560
just kind of like moping around,

1117
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:03,480
interrupting the not, taking up a lot of the not very much

1118
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,960
space that the hairstylist has,

1119
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,960
blocking the view of the TV

1120
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,960
that plays the roller coaster footage.

1121
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,840
I'm realizing the one kid is like dead-eyed

1122
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,920
playing PlayStation 2, like he's so focused,

1123
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,960
and he just, he doesn't even seem like he knows

1124
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,520
he's getting a haircut, and I guess that's the,

1125
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,560
the idea, I guess that's, you know, to keep them wiggling.

1126
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,400
To keep them from wiggling.

1127
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,360
Then it cuts to, then it cuts to what he's playing,

1128
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:36,960
and it says high score in the middle of the frame,

1129
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,720
but then it's a roller coaster footage.

1130
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,280
Is he playing a roller coaster game?

1131
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,320
Hmm.

1132
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,160
What's the game you're playing?

1133
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,200
Attention to detail is not, you know, I don't.

1134
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,760
In general, not Six Flags Forte.

1135
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,760
Forte, yeah.

1136
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:58,080
This is a variant of another one of their commercials.

1137
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,400
What was different about this one?

1138
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,000
I'm trying, oh, oh, this one kind of gives you

1139
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,760
a broader overview of the activities,

1140
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,920
so this might be helpful to look at.

1141
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,240
This'll take us through the other.

1142
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,080
Besides, once the haircut's done,

1143
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,240
there's more fun in store.

1144
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,520
Six Flags are fun.

1145
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,840
Parties are way more fun at Six Flags Roller Coaster Cuts.

1146
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,360
With party on, it's easy.

1147
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,200
Just choose your theme, pick your fun,

1148
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,360
then show up and we'll do the rest.

1149
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,240
All right, I need to stop it already.

1150
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,280
With party on, it's, and you don't know what that means.

1151
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,880
With party on, I guess that's a program

1152
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,480
that lets you book the parties.

1153
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,920
There's several steps.

1154
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,800
One is your theme.

1155
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,480
These are seven little graphics in the corner.

1156
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,840
Your theme, your fun, show up.

1157
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,760
That's it.

1158
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,720
Well, that was definitely an issue to the business.

1159
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,440
People are not remembering step three.

1160
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,400
People would book and then not come.

1161
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,680
Who?

1162
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,120
Who is this clown, by the way?

1163
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,040
Oh, I don't know.

1164
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,000
He's not a wiggle.

1165
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,040
Oh my God, he's bearded.

1166
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,960
He's a bearded clown.

1167
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,960
He looks a lot like famous Bozo the Clown character Cookie.

1168
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,680
He's got a very similar color scheme and a similar haircut,

1169
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,520
but he is not Cookie.

1170
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,960
He's a flashback to Bozo era in that he's a 60 year old man.

1171
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,600
Yeah, he's drunk and he's 60.

1172
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,520
The way clowns used to be.

1173
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,600
Right.

1174
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:34,600
Boy, yeah, he looks real haggard.

1175
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,120
It looks like not a clown nose,

1176
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:42,000
but a bulbous WC Fields nose.

1177
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,080
It's his real nose.

1178
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,120
Something's wrong.

1179
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,600
That's why he was hired.

1180
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,280
We can save money on the clown nose.

1181
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,040
Just get a 1920s drunk in here, paint his face.

1182
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,320
Wanted, drunk with permanent clown nose.

1183
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:03,080
Wait, is he one of the, okay, I saw an article,

1184
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,200
wait, there's a list of other characters.

1185
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,400
You probably have this, right?

1186
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,560
Maybe, yeah, here, I'll switch over.

1187
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:15,080
I mean, I saw a list with the Wiggles characters,

1188
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,680
but you might have something I don't have.

1189
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,480
Hold on, let me find it.

1190
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,560
Talk amongst yourselves.

1191
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,400
Yeah.

1192
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,240
Right here, go ahead.

1193
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,800
Let me just say the digital artifacts of this.

1194
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:28,440
It was very fun to remember the internet of 10 years ago

1195
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,320
because you find a couple discoveries.

1196
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:34,440
One, if you look up the Yelp and Foursquare pages

1197
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:38,280
for this location, it categorizes them as toys.

1198
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,760
So that's what I was alluding to when I was like,

1199
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,640
well, they presented themselves as one thing,

1200
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,760
but then landed on another.

1201
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,840
The other thing you discover is there are snapshots

1202
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:52,120
of the roller coaster kites website on the internet archive.

1203
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,840
All the images are no longer there, though.

1204
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:00,840
So you just find copy about haircuts with shampoos,

1205
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:06,280
different options like divas delight, totally gross,

1206
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:10,240
pirates rock, princess pampering party,

1207
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,940
Mr., oh, and play fun stuff when you do,

1208
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:17,560
when you have a birthday party here.

1209
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:22,320
Birthday parties, by the way, $30 a head for each kid.

1210
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,120
I don't know if that's comparable to like Chuck E. Cheese,

1211
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:28,800
but like you can play Mr. Six's ball toss

1212
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,560
or pin the bow tie on Mr. Six.

1213
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,600
Was that just like a bozo buckets for Mr. Six,

1214
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,200
his ball, Mr. Six's ball toss?

1215
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,840
I guess so.

1216
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,320
Gridiron challenge football toss.

1217
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,920
Like this is the laziest mixed silly sand bath salt

1218
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,920
or lotion in our liquid lab.

1219
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,400
There's also not, there's no room in this place.

1220
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,560
There's no room.

1221
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,160
And you see the commercial and the kids are crammed

1222
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,600
in between displays of merchandise.

1223
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,020
Really packed, yeah.

1224
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:07,860
There's not even like,

1225
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:10,840
it doesn't appear to have like a party room.

1226
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,320
Yeah, and they're still like having to squeeze in,

1227
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,600
a red carpet.

1228
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:18,580
I think they refer to a divas red carpet or something.

1229
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:21,520
Yeah, you see, well, they have band jams too.

1230
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,160
There's so much.

1231
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,480
Let me find the red carpet.

1232
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,400
Face painting, band jams, costumes and a runway walk.

1233
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,600
Runway walk.

1234
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,240
And then it cuts to a girl and a pink feather boa

1235
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:37,240
and a bunch of miserable boys with guitar sunglasses.

1236
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,600
And also like when you.

1237
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,140
Like the characters from hackers.

1238
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,720
Bunch of cyber punk kid, be a cyber punk kid.

1239
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,480
Six Flags roller coaster kids.

1240
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,880
This backdrop is not big enough to do a fun like photo op

1241
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,820
to make it look like you're on a red carpet somewhere.

1242
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:55,820
Like you would take that photo

1243
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:58,680
and you'd easily see the merchandise to the left

1244
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,080
and the kids waiting there.

1245
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:01,920
Like if you wanted to be like.

1246
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,800
Yeah, there's two velvet ropes on either side.

1247
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,960
It's a length of two ropes.

1248
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,500
Yeah, it's not even,

1249
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,360
doesn't even look like a good photo op.

1250
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,200
No.

1251
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,040
I was wrong.

1252
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,640
I got confused.

1253
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,120
The names of the haircuts I thought were characters.

1254
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,080
Well. Oh yeah.

1255
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,640
I mean, we can't avoid those now, can we?

1256
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,240
I mean, this was one of the things that jumped out

1257
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,160
in the Twitter.

1258
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,680
Would you care to do the honors, Mike?

1259
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,840
Oh yes, sure.

1260
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,400
All right, here we go.

1261
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,400
I had something, it's in the Washington city paper

1262
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,200
and they really editorialized here.

1263
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,040
This is what they said.

1264
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,080
Snyder's sub Mensa-esque brainchild,

1265
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,200
the network of standalone kitty hair salons

1266
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,060
known as Six Flags Rollercoaster Cuts

1267
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:50,400
opened its first outlet in West Hartford, Connecticut

1268
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,080
and started hawking costly coiff makeovers

1269
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,720
with dumb ass names.

1270
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,720
The Glammy, Zoink, Big Kapow and Blamma Jama.

1271
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:07,200
All right, honey.

1272
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,680
Do you want a Zoink or do you want a Big Kapow?

1273
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,440
I want a.

1274
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,480
You're not going to the liquid lab.

1275
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,280
If you're not good, you're not going to the liquid lab.

1276
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,080
I want to go to the liquid lab.

1277
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,480
We'll do the divas red carpet dash,

1278
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,960
but first you need to sit and get your Zoink.

1279
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,000
The Zoink is what we're here to do.

1280
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,600
And don't whine, sit down and Zoink.

1281
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,760
And then the clown is like, yes, my name is Zoink.

1282
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,840
No, no, we're not talking about you.

1283
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:43,400
Oh no, we named the clown and the haircut the same thing.

1284
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,000
Because Zoink seems like a clown name.

1285
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,840
This is why I got.

1286
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:46,920
It does.

1287
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,240
Yeah.

1288
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,760
Might've been, I don't know.

1289
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,680
God damn it.

1290
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,960
How much for a Glammy?

1291
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,160
It's a $50 Glammy.

1292
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,800
You can go to, the dad is arguing with the mom.

1293
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,920
Like we could just go to God damn Fantastic Sam's.

1294
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,680
It's on the other side of the God damn mall.

1295
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,320
It's $20.

1296
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,160
What are we doing?

1297
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:09,120
They don't have feather boas there, Henry.

1298
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,520
And an octopus won't stand in the corner

1299
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,520
and stare at our son while he's getting his hair cut there.

1300
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,280
He's gonna be screaming.

1301
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,040
He's gonna be terrified of the razor

1302
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,160
unless there's an octopus distracting him.

1303
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:27,320
Now this brings up a good point that is something I had found.

1304
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,200
So like a lot of hair salons, kids cuts,

1305
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,640
back then you were looking at maybe like 10 to $15.

1306
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,040
I think the roller coaster cuts,

1307
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,320
you're looking like 16 to over $20.

1308
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,760
I found a write up on classymommy.com.

1309
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,560
And let me be clear.

1310
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,120
I want no beef with the mommy bloggers.

1311
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,280
There's a huge industry.

1312
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,120
I'm fascinated by the Disney parents panel,

1313
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,040
whatever they're calling it now.

1314
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,960
But I want no beef with the mommy bloggers,

1315
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,760
with fan fiction writers, with the K-Hive.

1316
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,400
I want no beef with any of these subcultures.

1317
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,080
But I did find a write up,

1318
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:12,080
a glowing review of roller coaster cuts on classymommy.com.

1319
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,360
Kyle loved every moment at roller coaster cuts

1320
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,720
for his little haircut a few weeks ago.

1321
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,560
No.

1322
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:24,640
I dropped his big sister off at preschool

1323
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,880
and the two of us took off for a special date

1324
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,480
at the King of Prussia Mall for him to get a cut.

1325
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,800
A date with my mom to get a little haircut.

1326
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,280
This is, I'm reading this

1327
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,080
because it sounds like something we would say.

1328
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,480
The salon was fabulous and not crowded at all

1329
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:42,800
since we went during quote school hours on a weekday.

1330
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,520
The store was full of bright colors

1331
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:48,160
and just about every tempting toy and candy imaginable.

1332
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,360
And now this is where I have paused

1333
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:56,360
because the prospect of a candy store

1334
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,720
sharing space with a hair salon

1335
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:03,380
is so off putting to me, a treat lover.

1336
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:05,460
The blogger goes into detail of like,

1337
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:06,820
and then Kyle of course,

1338
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:10,340
he loved jumping into his big lollipop

1339
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,900
while his cut was happening.

1340
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,220
And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no, no.

1341
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,940
You enjoy your lollipop after the cut.

1342
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:20,180
There is nothing, even as a kid I was like,

1343
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:22,140
oh, I don't want hair on this lolly.

1344
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,540
I want, when we get outside the door,

1345
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,480
I will chow down on this.

1346
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,740
But like, oh God, the sticky and hair like,

1347
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:31,580
is making me feel.

1348
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,420
The fragments just in the air,

1349
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:35,300
like even like minutes later,

1350
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,900
even after the kid left the chair.

1351
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,460
Yeah.

1352
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:42,100
Blows around, you blow it with a hairdryer.

1353
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,540
It could like move over from the next station.

1354
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,540
Hey, Jason, what was this blog called again?

1355
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:50,380
It's called classymommy.com.

1356
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:55,380
And again, I seen like a very popular,

1357
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,780
it's right up with glowing of like Six Flags Rollercoaster.

1358
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:00,740
Basically like, yeah, it's gonna be a few bucks more,

1359
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,720
but the kids get to do more fun stuff.

1360
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,860
The only issue I usually have with mommy blog

1361
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:05,700
is when they go like,

1362
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,480
Kyle usually hates getting his hair cut,

1363
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,780
just like he hates the sting of a needle.

1364
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,500
And what's in vaccines anyway?

1365
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:12,860
That's when they start to lose.

1366
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:15,780
Like I don't, I don't, don't cotton to that.

1367
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,060
I don't cotton to that.

1368
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:22,100
I tried to get, I tried to read a different mommy blog

1369
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,620
called one not so bored mommy.

1370
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:29,620
And I was, and because I found a tweet,

1371
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:31,820
cause I just, I just Googled,

1372
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:35,460
I just searched in Twitter this roller coaster cuts.

1373
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:38,300
And I found like another, it says retweet,

1374
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,700
what an incredible and blessed experience.

1375
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,400
Thank you Six Flags Rollercoaster cuts.

1376
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,060
And I clicked on the article and it was,

1377
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:47,200
it says permission denied.

1378
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,660
It doesn't look like you have been invited

1379
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:50,220
to read this blog.

1380
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:52,060
If you think this is a mistake.

1381
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:52,940
I got there.

1382
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,780
I got to one board.

1383
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:58,020
Okay, so I think this is rebranded at some point.

1384
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,260
Well, here's the thing.

1385
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:03,220
I think at one point in time, it was one bored mommy.

1386
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:07,100
And then, cause once I went, once I way back machined it,

1387
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,620
it was one bored mommy and then became one not so bored

1388
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:13,420
mommy, like maybe she did a little like positive spit

1389
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,420
or found so much stuff to do that she became

1390
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:16,980
a not so bored mommy.

1391
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:21,420
So there was a rebranding and I'm so glad I got through

1392
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:24,580
and I could fill in the gaps for you because

1393
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:27,840
also some fun details on one bored mommy.

1394
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:31,680
Classy mommy is not the only fun writer.

1395
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,280
We spent two fun and very exciting hours playing

1396
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,940
in the store with their fun staff,

1397
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,880
getting the kids hair decorated,

1398
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,360
their nails painted, doing the limbo,

1399
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:44,160
walking the red carpet and sucking in what it felt like

1400
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:48,160
to live the glamorous life through a child's eyes.

1401
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,000
It's a glamorous life.

1402
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:49,840
Excuse me?

1403
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:53,340
Suck in the glamorous life.

1404
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,520
Tell your kids to suck in the glamor.

1405
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,240
Huh?

1406
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:06,360
Suck in glamor kids as you get a big lollipop

1407
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,640
with your little haircut on your special day date

1408
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,200
with your classy mommy.

1409
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:14,960
Who's not bored.

1410
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,200
Who was not so bored.

1411
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,400
Was bored at the time.

1412
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,600
Was bored but not so much.

1413
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:21,880
Not bored anymore.

1414
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:26,000
Now that I'm doing the limbo and sucking in glamor.

1415
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,760
Oh, I love to do the limbo, lose my footing,

1416
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:33,200
put my hand on the ground and come up covered in hair.

1417
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,520
And then immediately reach for a lollipop.

1418
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,680
Reach for a big sticky lolly.

1419
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:41,000
Thanks, oh and Mr. Six is handing it to me

1420
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,240
and you know his white hands are covered in hair.

1421
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,480
His white gloves are just.

1422
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,960
I'm stuck to Mr. Six now.

1423
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:50,040
I'm fused to Mr. Six.

1424
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,880
Somebody needs to get a little blowtorch.

1425
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,280
Uh oh, Zoink the clown fell over again.

1426
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:00,000
Mr. Six is helping up Zoink.

1427
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,480
He didn't get enough sleep last night.

1428
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,560
Uh oh.

1429
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,680
How did you, Scott, how did you get to gain access

1430
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,600
to this blog?

1431
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:11,400
Why am I getting kicked out of this blog?

1432
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,600
Through the way back machine, through web.archive.org.

1433
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:17,800
One of the best tools when you're looking for inaneity

1434
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,680
that nobody bothered to keep around.

1435
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:21,520
Huh.

1436
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,480
I was thinking maybe it's because of the three of us

1437
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,880
you're the only authentic Disney daddy.

1438
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:28,880
Oh you're right.

1439
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,600
Hey, well thanks for the notice.

1440
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,480
I'm glad that I, I don't say it enough

1441
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:37,920
that I'm a Disney daddy, a classy Disney daddy.

1442
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:41,720
And I, yeah, yeah, no I didn't,

1443
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:45,840
there was no point where I had to scan my son's eyes

1444
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:48,680
to prove that, show us the baby pupils

1445
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,600
or else you're not getting into one not support mommy.

1446
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,480
Yeah.

1447
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,440
Internet Archive and Reader View are very helpful

1448
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,600
with these sorts of things.

1449
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:02,520
I don't know whether to say because the defector site is,

1450
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,280
I think it was Paywold on my phone

1451
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,880
but OK on my laptop browser.

1452
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,160
I'm gonna sign up anyway because it's a great site.

1453
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,480
It's worth it for David Roth's articles alone.

1454
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,400
One of the only writers who understands the Trump era.

1455
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:19,400
But certainly looking up ancient Six Flags rollercoaster cuts

1456
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,640
the Internet Archive was a godsend.

1457
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,920
Oh and I should say though, Scott,

1458
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:27,120
you found a Twitter account

1459
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:30,440
for one of the rollercoaster cuts locations.

1460
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,720
Oh yeah, that's right.

1461
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,520
There wasn't a lot of tweets so I read all of them.

1462
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,040
And you can kind of see, I mean once they get to like,

1463
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,480
show this tweet for a discount

1464
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:46,200
which was harder to show a tweet in 2010.

1465
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,280
70% off summer styles.

1466
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,680
You never wanna see that

1467
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,760
and they're mostly plugging the toys anyway.

1468
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:55,520
But the best tweet hands down just said,

1469
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,400
coming soon to Six Flags rollercoaster cuts, highlights.

1470
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,200
Coming soon.

1471
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,680
Didn't have them.

1472
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:08,040
Maybe wouldn't that be a day one option, highlights?

1473
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,120
You would think.

1474
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,040
My favorite tweet and if you wanna read

1475
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,440
any of these read the history of tweets yourself,

1476
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,160
it's at Coaster Cuts.

1477
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,040
And they have not been very active since 2010.

1478
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:24,800
So my favorite one, children and parents alike love reading.

1479
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,560
Every Tuesday from 10.30 to 11.30,

1480
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:31,000
story time with poor Fessor Curly Q.

1481
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,680
Just flip the R and the O.

1482
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,680
Poor Fessor.

1483
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,640
So it's not just Taz, Mr. Six,

1484
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:42,640
and the Wiggles characters and Zoinks the clown.

1485
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,920
So they also, some time for an hour a week,

1486
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,600
you get poor Fessor Curly Q.

1487
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,640
Yeah, you said it's at Coaster Cuts, right?

1488
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:53,480
Yeah.

1489
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:58,480
I like how you can clearly see the downfall of the store,

1490
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:02,680
but it's not said that that's happening.

1491
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,080
It's not said that that's happening.

1492
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:06,920
Oh yeah.

1493
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,880
You're gonna be like, 50% off all merchandise.

1494
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,440
Next tweet is 70% off all merchandise.

1495
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:14,600
And then that's the last tweet.

1496
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:16,640
Yeah.

1497
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:20,600
They also, they advertise something called,

1498
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:25,600
it's also very bluntly, Silly Bands with an E, not a Y,

1499
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,360
and a Z, not an S.

1500
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,840
Those were hugely popular.

1501
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:30,960
I don't know if they still are,

1502
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,680
but I believe they were a big short-lived trend,

1503
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:35,840
maybe long-lived trend,

1504
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:40,040
but I think kids liked Silly Bands.

1505
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:44,200
Silly, Silly Bands.

1506
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,920
We just got another shipment.

1507
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,760
We got the crates in, crates here.

1508
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:54,400
Dan Snyder has more Silly Bands for us to clear out.

1509
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,160
Put it next to the all things must go side.

1510
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,600
What have we not talked about?

1511
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:07,000
Well, there's other things you could get there

1512
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,880
that I wanna shout out.

1513
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:13,880
We mentioned shampoos, haircuts with a Z with shampoos,

1514
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,360
blow blasts, or a separate item,

1515
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,720
and I don't know what blow blasts are.

1516
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,520
That could just be getting your hair dried.

1517
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,360
I'm not sure.

1518
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:30,080
Blow blasts, mini mannies, girly updos,

1519
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,760
peekaboo highlights,

1520
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,400
and then they were offering a good deal

1521
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,400
at one point in time, special scissor savings,

1522
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:41,000
two shampoos and haircuts for $30 on Tuesdays

1523
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,760
and Wednesdays only, special excludes blow blast.

1524
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,880
Can we go to Six Flags roller coaster cuts today?

1525
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:50,720
No, we can't.

1526
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,960
I told you, we have to wait until Tuesday.

1527
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:53,800
Why?

1528
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,880
Because you and your brother can both get shampoos

1529
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,680
and haircuts for only $30.

1530
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,280
Can we get a blow blast too this time?

1531
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:03,760
Absolutely not.

1532
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,520
Are we? $30 is plenty.

1533
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,600
Are we poor?

1534
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,600
Daddy has just been,

1535
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:14,720
there's been some bad things in the economy,

1536
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,360
and daddy can't afford as many shampoos

1537
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:18,840
as he used to be able to.

1538
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,480
And don't even think about asking about peekaboo highlights.

1539
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:26,920
Not today.

1540
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,120
Until daddy figures out his mortgage, refinances.

1541
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:37,000
So I guess having a zoink is out of the question.

1542
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Oh no, no, no.

1543
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Let's not go basic, just a basic shampoo.

1544
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,360
You can get it, when you get a job,

1545
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:47,320
then you can get a zoink.

1546
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:51,800
How much did the clown charge for the balloons?

1547
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:53,600
Why?

1548
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,880
Well, we probably should make the leap

1549
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,000
that they're called baloofs or something.

1550
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,680
So, and then you get this,

1551
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,640
an upcharge for the custom name.

1552
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,520
So yeah, every baloof is 25 bucks.

1553
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,280
Oh man.

1554
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,480
This is actually all pure comedy,

1555
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:17,560
because I guarantee none of this ever happened.

1556
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:21,720
There was never a child demanding to go back here.

1557
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:26,840
Look, kids are smarter than Dan Snyder

1558
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,360
when it comes to shit like this.

1559
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,440
Like I can tell exactly how we would have felt

1560
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:33,200
about this place as a kid.

1561
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:36,280
I'd have been like, oh, it's cool to play a video game

1562
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:37,600
while I'm getting my hair cut.

1563
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,720
And that's about it.

1564
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:43,640
We have a Warner Brothers store, much better themed.

1565
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:46,280
I could see all the characters in there.

1566
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,720
Or at least at the time, I guess they didn't overlap.

1567
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,200
But if I was a kid and this existed

1568
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,800
in the same time I was a kid,

1569
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:52,920
and I would have been like,

1570
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,440
I'm not getting my hair colored.

1571
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,720
I want to have a birthday at Chuck E. Cheese,

1572
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:59,840
or even a McDonald's with a Play Place.

1573
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:01,520
Yeah.

1574
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:02,440
There's no.

1575
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:03,800
Let's just go to Supricots

1576
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,480
and then we'll go to the One Burger King

1577
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:09,360
where there's like an N64 with a CRT TV.

1578
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,200
Yeah.

1579
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,080
Let me climb around an Officer Big Mac's mouth.

1580
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,600
That's what I want to do.

1581
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,200
I want to get my hair cut quick out of the way.

1582
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:18,920
Let me play with my McDonald's.

1583
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:19,840
I wouldn't think so.

1584
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:24,280
But then that's where the zoinks and the gaffoos come in.

1585
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,440
Like they're fun.

1586
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,960
It's fun haircuts.

1587
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,920
So that's something you want to do with friends, right?

1588
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,160
You all want to glam out.

1589
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:36,840
You and your boyfriend, you and your male friends

1590
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:41,000
all want to glam out like rock stars.

1591
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,600
You want to have dyed hair.

1592
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:46,120
What band at this time still had dyed hair?

1593
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,520
Fallout Boy.

1594
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,280
Like what's a cool band?

1595
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,120
In 2009?

1596
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:50,960
Good Charlotte.

1597
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:51,960
Yeah.

1598
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:52,880
Huh.

1599
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,760
When does the black parade come out?

1600
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,160
From like the romance.

1601
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,000
Oh, right.

1602
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,720
Yeah, I don't know.

1603
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:03,040
Or maybe Billy Joe still dying his hair color.

1604
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,280
If you're an eight year old boy and your friends,

1605
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,280
you all want to look like Billy Joe.

1606
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,160
Also, how many kids came home

1607
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,960
and their parents screamed at them from a party?

1608
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,600
I'm like, what did you do?

1609
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:19,040
That's literally not allowed at your Catholic school.

1610
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,680
You can't go in the door on Monday.

1611
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:24,680
Scott, imagine you came home as a little boy.

1612
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,520
Oh God.

1613
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:29,800
Big purple, like big purple streak in your hair.

1614
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:32,880
My parents had problems when I started wearing sandals

1615
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:37,240
at 21, much less dying my.

1616
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,240
Which is funny because I know a certain carpenter

1617
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,520
who wore sandals all the time.

1618
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,960
Yeah, that's right.

1619
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:47,520
Up and through his 30s when he was crucified

1620
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:52,160
for his own orthodox beliefs, like sandal wearing.

1621
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:55,640
I think I wore white sunglasses when I was 26

1622
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,880
and my parents were like, huh, what?

1623
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,640
Look at this.

1624
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,320
And some ideas in LA, are you?

1625
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,480
What is this?

1626
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,240
Hollywood Michael. Mr. Hollywood.

1627
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,120
I don't know, they're white?

1628
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,800
The color is white instead of black?

1629
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,040
They weren't like Elton John glasses or anything.

1630
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,360
They were just white.

1631
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,440
The frames were white.

1632
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:18,600
Anyway.

1633
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,120
I have some insight, I think,

1634
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:23,800
onto the Six Flags perspective about children's haircuts

1635
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,000
because I found the Blue Loop,

1636
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,800
one of the trade group articles about it opening.

1637
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,800
Here is a quote.

1638
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:35,640
Roller coaster cuts is redefining the Six Flags experience,

1639
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:39,000
said Mike Ant and Tenoro,

1640
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,920
executive vice president, entertainment and marketing.

1641
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:43,720
What can sometimes be a dreaded,

1642
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:47,600
yes, necessary obligation for kids

1643
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:51,120
turns into an environment of fun, thrills and excitement

1644
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,120
that is the Six Flags brand.

1645
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:56,400
And I don't know, should we take that phrase,

1646
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,080
like podcast the ride, a dreaded but necessary obligation?

1647
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,960
Like, I wasn't thrilled about getting my hair cut.

1648
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,880
I found it a little annoying.

1649
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:11,680
Like, I don't, I like having-

1650
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:15,400
The three childless men in their 30s with a dreaded,

1651
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,960
a dreaded but necessary obligation?

1652
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,080
Yeah.

1653
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,520
Or at least put it on a shirt.

1654
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,920
I don't know that phrase to describe haircuts.

1655
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:25,080
Like, yeah, I wasn't wild about them,

1656
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:25,920
but that's a little heavy.

1657
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,920
Saying that that's still in their description

1658
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,480
of what the service they're offering.

1659
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:34,200
We're a place that fulfills dreaded

1660
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,760
but necessary obligations.

1661
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,200
It's like Six Flags also describing

1662
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:43,800
like when a child does its appendix out or something.

1663
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,800
That was the next step they were gonna offer.

1664
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,920
Six Flags surgical.

1665
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,480
Tonsils.

1666
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:54,720
Yeah, tonsils.

1667
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:57,400
Appendix.

1668
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,840
Yeah, anything that would happen as a kid.

1669
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,600
I guess wisdom teeth for the tweens and teens.

1670
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,000
They would explain to you why they can't,

1671
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,440
why you can't see grandma anymore.

1672
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,520
Yeah.

1673
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:15,200
They would do all the tough talks

1674
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,360
and then incorporate it into a diva dance party.

1675
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,200
I danced Snyder.

1676
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:26,840
I wouldn't put it past them if this was like a mild success

1677
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:30,400
to try to spin it off into other avenues

1678
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,120
of unpleasant things kids have to do.

1679
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,200
Oh yeah.

1680
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,560
Six Flags branded chore wheels.

1681
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:40,880
What's that?

1682
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:41,720
Chore wheels.

1683
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:43,880
Six Flags branded chore wheels.

1684
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:46,360
All right, you're washing the dishes this week, Tommy.

1685
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:48,640
How many chores, how many more chores you have to do

1686
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,480
before you get to go to Six Flags.

1687
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,400
More chores, more fun.

1688
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,560
Okay, Tommy has figured out how to rig the chore wheels

1689
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,880
so it always lands on go to Six Flags great adventure.

1690
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:00,720
No.

1691
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:03,720
He waited it.

1692
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:04,560
Tommy's cheating.

1693
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,600
I guess Six Flags like homework centers

1694
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:13,000
is where you would go to the mall to do homework.

1695
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:17,360
Oh yeah, one of those sinister divorce education

1696
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,920
like Khan Academy nonsense things.

1697
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,880
It's like just slowly destroying unions across America

1698
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:28,840
but like, oh, roller coaster at lunch.

1699
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:34,720
And octopus will stare at you while you do your homework.

1700
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,640
He's your SAT.

1701
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:40,160
You get a high five for each page that you finish.

1702
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,440
He'll high five you with a different tentacle.

1703
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,520
That actually sounds pretty good.

1704
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,360
Yeah.

1705
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:48,360
Maybe I would have wanted to do that one.

1706
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:54,000
I mean, we might, if this had been allowed to breathe,

1707
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,080
they might've redefined the Six Flags brand.

1708
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:02,480
It might've been like Six Flags is your source

1709
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:05,760
for holding your child's hand through unnecessary

1710
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:08,200
or through necessary obligations of life

1711
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:11,280
and then giving them a little dose of fun at the end.

1712
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,400
Yeah, I mean, that could have really influenced

1713
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,280
the whole thing.

1714
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,400
Like the theme park itself then more becomes

1715
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:21,320
about grooming children and not in the grooming.

1716
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,600
You grow grooming children.

1717
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:23,880
Careful, careful.

1718
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,080
I am being careful.

1719
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,520
Cutting their hair.

1720
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,000
And maybe that would be more Six Flags' identity

1721
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,280
at this point.

1722
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,800
And I know Dan was confused.

1723
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,960
I mean, he wanted the identity to be mattresses

1724
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,800
and to a water massage.

1725
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,280
He should have picked one, I think.

1726
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,160
And it would have stuck maybe better.

1727
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:46,200
As children, what place did you guys go

1728
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,240
to get your hair cut?

1729
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:51,520
I was recalling that I did go to like a fun place

1730
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:52,360
a little bit.

1731
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,640
That there was, it was fun, I think,

1732
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:57,640
because you got candy while you were waiting.

1733
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,160
You could play on a Pac-Man machine.

1734
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:04,320
And there was a poster of the 1976 King Kong,

1735
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,360
the one with the Twin Towers in it.

1736
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:07,200
Sure.

1737
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,160
And I remember it so strongly.

1738
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:11,080
I'm not sure why.

1739
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,720
King Kong, I think I'd never heard of it.

1740
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:16,760
And I would just stare at it every time I got a haircut.

1741
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,520
So it left an impression.

1742
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,440
Yeah.

1743
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,920
Jason?

1744
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,000
We were a super cuts family.

1745
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,920
Or occasionally there would be a mom and pop place

1746
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:33,920
that at best had one chair that was an airplane or a car.

1747
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:39,280
And then a few times we went to one of our friends' house

1748
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,440
because his mom was a hairdresser

1749
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:45,080
and she had a chair set up in the basement.

1750
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:48,280
And she would charge a little less

1751
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:50,400
than whatever salon she was employed at.

1752
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,720
But she kept everything.

1753
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,400
She got to keep everything.

1754
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,240
Interesting.

1755
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,440
You know what?

1756
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:01,440
Moms in basements doing business, I feel like, is common.

1757
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,520
I remember there was a mom in a basement

1758
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,480
who did that in our town.

1759
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:07,920
But then there was also a mom in a basement

1760
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,120
who sold shoes out of her house.

1761
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:15,520
My mom bought my sister's orthopedic little shoes

1762
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:19,080
because her feet had to go a certain way.

1763
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,280
And we bought them from a woman in the basement

1764
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,040
of a house.

1765
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:23,880
And I remember being like,

1766
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,920
this is the strangest thing I've ever seen.

1767
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:28,520
Like a five-year-old.

1768
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,920
It's like, she has a store in her house?

1769
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:32,760
A basement.

1770
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,880
For sale, baby shoes never worn in my basement.

1771
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:40,720
I went to...

1772
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:41,560
Yeah, go ahead.

1773
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:42,400
No, no, no, no, go ahead.

1774
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,200
I was just gonna say, I went to a place called Fantastic Sams

1775
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,160
which was basically standard,

1776
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,400
except they had a little TV plant,

1777
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,800
like a little box with a TV.

1778
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,080
And then there was a door.

1779
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:55,680
And after you were done, you would knock on the door

1780
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,480
and then they would like put a sucker in,

1781
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,640
like a ring, a spider ring.

1782
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,440
And then you'd open the door and it would appear

1783
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,000
and you'd take it.

1784
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,760
So you got a little treat at the end.

1785
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:05,920
Weird little box.

1786
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,000
That's strange.

1787
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:07,840
Yeah, it was like a,

1788
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,520
it was kind of like a big cabinet with a TV.

1789
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:12,280
And I can't remember if like the trick was like,

1790
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,720
they would say, open it and there would be nothing in it.

1791
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,520
You would close it and then you would knock.

1792
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,640
But then when you got like to be six or seven,

1793
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:22,600
you'd notice that the person was just clearly dropping it

1794
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,800
on the side so it would fall down and you'd open it.

1795
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:26,960
You'd get like a sucker.

1796
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:31,960
And then if we were lucky, we would get a slush puppy

1797
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,680
from the convenience, the white hen

1798
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:36,800
or whatever convenience store was next door.

1799
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:37,640
That was rare.

1800
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:38,880
That sounds pretty good.

1801
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,600
All right, well, that's what RollerCoasterCuts

1802
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,480
is trying to do is cut out the middle man.

1803
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,560
Now you don't have to walk somewhere else.

1804
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:49,560
You can get your slushy with only a few small hair follicles

1805
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:53,200
as an unwanted topping.

1806
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:57,080
Yeah, that's a small price to pay for treats.

1807
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,880
You know, one stop shop.

1808
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:03,440
This was, it's so weird.

1809
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:08,440
I guess I'll find out as this kid grows up that like,

1810
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,480
oh yeah, I guess I forgot the whole component

1811
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:14,120
of haircuts being unpleasant and like why many parents

1812
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:16,680
have to do them themselves.

1813
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,760
But I'm also like, you know, I'm adding up like,

1814
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:21,880
I'm remembering the things I have to do as a dad

1815
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:23,440
or that Aaron has to do.

1816
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:27,440
And like, if you had like green sparkly hair,

1817
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,680
like you have to clean that out.

1818
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:33,080
Like this is your, and it's probably hard as hell

1819
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:35,280
and toxic, it probably stinks.

1820
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:40,200
Like this is like really saddling the parents after the fact.

1821
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:43,920
Yeah, cause like, yeah, there's no way they were using like

1822
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,400
real legit permanent hair dye.

1823
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:48,760
Cause if you're dying someone, especially dark hair,

1824
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:50,360
if you're dying it purple,

1825
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,440
I believe you need to bleach it first.

1826
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:55,200
You need to bleach the hair, that takes a while.

1827
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,080
Then you need to put the purple dye in it.

1828
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:59,400
Cause if you just put purple dye in dark hair,

1829
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,160
it won't show up very well.

1830
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:04,160
I am confident they were not like bleaching

1831
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:07,400
the kid's hair first, then putting pink and purple in.

1832
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:11,400
They were probably putting some sort of temporary color on

1833
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:14,440
that for sure was coming out all over the pillow that night.

1834
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:18,920
Like there was no way that was like permanent hair color

1835
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:21,720
and was just like ruining kids bedspreads

1836
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:23,520
every single night.

1837
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,680
Six Flags pillow stainers.

1838
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,040
Oh, oh wait.

1839
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:27,880
Okay, I got it.

1840
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:28,720
I figured it out.

1841
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:30,240
I figured out the whole scheme.

1842
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:33,560
Dan Snyder wanted to sell more mattresses

1843
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,480
in Six Flags parks.

1844
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:38,600
So he wanted to ruin kids mattresses at home

1845
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:39,720
and then they'd have no choice,

1846
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:42,720
but to go to a Six Flags to buy a new mattress.

1847
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,040
This is it.

1848
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:46,120
This is what he was coming up with there.

1849
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:49,880
He had also bought a toxic paint company at some point.

1850
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:53,320
And that was, he thought he was gonna have to sell it

1851
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:54,400
because it was toxic.

1852
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,680
But then he realized, wait a minute,

1853
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:59,320
I have use for paint that never goes anywhere.

1854
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:04,320
Ace Chemicals purchased by Dan Snyder from Batman.

1855
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:09,220
Ace Chemicals, same thing that scarred the Joker.

1856
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:13,400
Yeah, man.

1857
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,320
This is a good new Joker origin story

1858
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:17,960
that he went to a roller coaster cuts

1859
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:21,040
and it's when he got a glammy

1860
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,200
that didn't go how he wanted it.

1861
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:27,160
And then he's asking for the mirror

1862
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:30,760
and the octopus is reluctant to give it to him

1863
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:35,160
when they show them what they've done to him.

1864
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,120
Henry, give it to me.

1865
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,520
And then he kills Mr. Six with like a joy,

1866
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,440
but the buzzer in his hand.

1867
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:47,240
One of the grimmer parts of researching this episode

1868
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:51,800
was if you Google the phrase Six Flags roller coaster cuts,

1869
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:55,440
you get the commercials first and second for results.

1870
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,400
And then you start getting news stories

1871
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:02,400
of roller coaster cuts off or drop tower cuts.

1872
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:07,480
And you're like, oh, the Vangabas is not coming.

1873
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:12,880
That's my other theory is that this was all an attempt

1874
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,960
to shift the Google results.

1875
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,360
Like we got too many results

1876
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:19,000
for six flags roller coaster cuts.

1877
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,400
How do we skip ahead in this line?

1878
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:24,480
People are getting caught on these coasters so often.

1879
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,360
Our coasters are cutting everybody.

1880
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:30,960
What are we gonna do?

1881
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,280
Wait, Jason, did you get cut in Six Flags?

1882
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:37,320
No, I got cut at King's Dominion.

1883
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,840
Oh, that's right.

1884
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:40,760
Jagged chain like chest.

1885
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:45,080
I got cut, yeah, I got cut very,

1886
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:47,160
it looked like it was very minor cut,

1887
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,240
but it did leave a scar and it just,

1888
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:53,000
it cut in a spot where it just would not stop bleeding.

1889
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,240
Like a very fine layer of blood on my belly.

1890
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:58,760
And yes, that is true.

1891
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:00,600
That was at King's Dominion though.

1892
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,360
Water play area.

1893
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:07,360
So after getting cut, I was then blasted with chlorine water

1894
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:11,960
and Nickelodeon logos as I attempted to get out

1895
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:16,200
of the water play area to go, hey, can we go to first aid?

1896
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,440
So they should have used the catchphrase.

1897
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:25,360
I got cut at Six Flags.

1898
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,200
Yeah.

1899
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,560
They really actually used, oh no good.

1900
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,200
Sorry, they need to figure out a way

1901
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,720
to flip the Google results from people

1902
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:38,720
that are getting their genitals crushed on roller coasters.

1903
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:41,800
And call it like Six Flags crush in the mall.

1904
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,600
Maybe they sell like different versions of the soda.

1905
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,320
It's like a soda bar or something.

1906
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:52,040
Or like, is it a, it's a preteen dating surface.

1907
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:52,880
Oh, that's good.

1908
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,200
That's much better, yeah.

1909
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,040
It's like a speed skate.

1910
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:58,040
What better place to take your crush than a Six Flags?

1911
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:59,960
Come in, make a dating video.

1912
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,080
Say all of your likes and dislikes

1913
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,120
and we'll pair you with the cutest,

1914
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:10,000
yeah, the cutest fellow preteen in town.

1915
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,280
Preteen dating surface.

1916
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:14,360
Yeah, that's a good business end up.

1917
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:17,560
I believe Dan Snyder would have invested in that.

1918
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:18,720
Yeah, I think so.

1919
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,600
He was just bored.

1920
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,960
He was like, like, didn't like the idea of theme parks,

1921
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:24,480
I think, and just went, no.

1922
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,640
Anything else we can stamp this name on.

1923
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:27,920
Man.

1924
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,240
Really quick also, that they, that the sub,

1925
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:38,000
the little like subtitle of it is a hair raising experience.

1926
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,960
That's one of those, I hate puns where it's not a word

1927
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,880
that you use in day to day life.

1928
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,520
Like nobody's ever said I'm getting my hair raised.

1929
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:50,520
So it just like, I have this issue

1930
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,640
with like popsicle stick jokes.

1931
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:56,480
Usually the puns are resting on the back of a phrase

1932
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,640
that nobody would ever say.

1933
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:02,520
Yeah, it's like hair raising is only used in jokes.

1934
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,200
Yeah, yes.

1935
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,200
I think they made it up.

1936
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,960
I think this was made up by the popsicle stick industry

1937
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:10,200
so that they would have an easier.

1938
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:13,200
Yeah, unless it was like a hundred years ago,

1939
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,440
somebody would say, oh, I heard you were stuck

1940
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,600
in the wilderness for two weeks, how was it?

1941
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,880
And they were like, well, it was very hair raising.

1942
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:21,560
Maybe people used to use it?

1943
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:22,880
I don't know, I've never heard anyone use it.

1944
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,280
Well, I mean, that definition, hair raising I get,

1945
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:29,880
but cutting being raising, like who's ever said that

1946
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:31,440
in the last century?

1947
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,760
Yeah, I don't know, no one.

1948
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:34,680
No one.

1949
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:38,360
Update your, this is a, your catchphrase

1950
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,400
is from the 1800s.

1951
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,200
That's problem number one.

1952
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:45,600
Problem number two, you offer services called

1953
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,360
Big Kapow and Blamajama.

1954
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:51,000
Problem number three, your mascot is an old man

1955
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,800
who hangs around next to an old drunk clown.

1956
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,960
And he looks like, again, I cannot emphasize enough,

1957
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:00,440
the Mr. Six costumes they gave to this hair salon,

1958
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:03,880
all the pictures and video look bad, you know?

1959
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:07,800
It's not like a film set, makeup artist quality.

1960
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:11,600
It looks like, it looks like in a movie,

1961
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,320
like Point Break or something,

1962
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:18,440
where they have the old president with the masks on.

1963
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:20,520
Yes, it does look like that.

1964
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:23,560
And I also, I know I was surprised by how many people

1965
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,360
love Mr. Six.

1966
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:28,960
I would like, it was like, what, 65%, 70% almost.

1967
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,120
But I still think it's also as a kid though.

1968
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:34,040
I think kids, Jason, you liked him as a kid, right?

1969
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:39,000
Yeah, I mean, I was hitting like pre-teen teen years,

1970
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I think when he was rolled out, right?

1971
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:41,840
You know?

1972
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,160
Right, but like an eight year,

1973
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:44,880
I bet if we polled eight year olds,

1974
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,880
do you like Mr. Six?

1975
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,120
The number would be lower.

1976
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:52,240
Now my point is like, I don't know that he's the best mascot

1977
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:54,600
for getting like kids under 10,

1978
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:59,600
some creepy old man who like dances in a strange way.

1979
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,480
You were, okay, so you're scared

1980
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:03,400
of getting your haircut, huh?

1981
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:06,320
How would you like, would you be more willing

1982
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:09,800
to get your haircut if this old man stared at you?

1983
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:13,120
Yeah, and he like, and he's gonna like,

1984
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:14,920
he's gonna bother you.

1985
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,760
He will pester you.

1986
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,240
You'll have to deal with him.

1987
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:20,920
The place is too small for him not to bother you

1988
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:22,280
at some point.

1989
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:23,120
And you'll have to-

1990
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,240
There's not gonna be enough people in there.

1991
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:26,800
You will for sure interact with this old man.

1992
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,680
If you have sunglasses on, he's gonna take them.

1993
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:33,640
He's gonna like point at anything unusual on your person.

1994
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:34,480
Right.

1995
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:36,640
You're gonna be like, as a kid, you're gonna be like,

1996
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:40,520
I know he's not old, but maybe he is.

1997
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,240
And I know that I'm not supposed to like

1998
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,000
talk to strangers like this,

1999
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,080
but like it's gonna be so confusing for you.

2000
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,920
And he's the mascot.

2001
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:50,800
Why not just put a Taz outfit?

2002
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:52,760
Like a guy in a Taz outfit.

2003
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:53,920
Yeah.

2004
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:56,440
If they have Taz, if they're using, yeah.

2005
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:58,480
And why are they even using Wiggles characters

2006
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:01,280
who older kids are less likely to know?

2007
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,680
We fucking Taz-ed.

2008
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:06,720
Well, look, Mr. Six was the compromise.

2009
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:09,200
All of Dan Snyder's other pitches

2010
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:12,200
were the most racist things you could imagine.

2011
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:15,200
And they're like, just tell him we already bought

2012
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:19,080
Mr. Six costume, we gotta stop him from saying this stuff.

2013
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,320
Dan Snyder sent us 10 ideas,

2014
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:24,720
and I took the liberty of shredding the document

2015
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:27,080
before sharing it with anyone else.

2016
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:29,120
I reported him to HR,

2017
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:32,480
but they were all in the process of resigning anyway.

2018
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:37,360
So I don't know that anything is going to happen.

2019
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,600
He dissolved the HR department.

2020
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,480
There could be no more complaints.

2021
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:44,680
I missed a thing about Dan Snyder also earlier

2022
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:47,160
that this is, I think also in the reporting

2023
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:48,760
of Dave McKenna.

2024
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:52,280
He got a quote from somebody who,

2025
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:54,160
I think we said this in the last episode

2026
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:58,080
that Bill Gates invested over $100 million

2027
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,840
into Six Flags around this time,

2028
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:02,320
and he lost all of it.

2029
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,440
Just totally toast investment.

2030
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:05,520
Same with Dan Snyder.

2031
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:08,080
All the money he put in to doing the coup,

2032
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,400
he lost every cent.

2033
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,080
This guy, this is a fellow Six Flags investor.

2034
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,280
Bill Gates gives away more money than anybody,

2035
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:18,400
and his main cause is malaria,

2036
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:21,880
says this guy who also is a person who fights malaria

2037
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:27,240
through a group called Hedge Funds versus Malaria.

2038
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:28,840
That's strange.

2039
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:32,200
Anyway, quote this guy,

2040
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,880
that was money that could have gone

2041
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:35,760
to save kids from malaria.

2042
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:39,880
So by looping in Bill Gates,

2043
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:44,880
Dan Snyder kept the malaria problem going full speed.

2044
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:51,280
He's, his primary children's issue is making it more fun

2045
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,920
to get their hair cut, and in the process,

2046
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,880
he gave thousands of children malaria.

2047
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:05,280
I wish that all, anytime like a billionaire wastes money

2048
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:07,120
on the news or whatever, and then at a total,

2049
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:09,160
like somebody, after they've explained what the story was

2050
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:10,440
and how the money was lost, they go,

2051
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:14,160
and that money could have gone to curing malaria.

2052
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:18,480
Like Mike Bloomberg has dropped out of his presidential bid

2053
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:22,520
after spending $750 million.

2054
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:25,160
That money could have gone to curing malaria.

2055
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:28,000
Just to give us perspective,

2056
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,040
because I think people need to know we could cure malaria

2057
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:32,440
with all this wasted money.

2058
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:35,120
I think it's smart.

2059
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:39,960
Elon Musk, Elon Musk smoked a thousand dollar bill

2060
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:42,680
like a cigar with Joe Rogan.

2061
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:45,360
That money could have gone to fighting malaria.

2062
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:48,840
Yeah, do it with any of your favorite

2063
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:51,320
rich maniac wasting money stories.

2064
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,240
If we're winding down here,

2065
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:59,160
and feel free to throw in any last things,

2066
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:03,480
but I just have a little assignment

2067
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:06,120
that I think would be good.

2068
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,440
Just a little bit of social media fun,

2069
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:12,400
because you know what, honestly, boy, you know,

2070
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:15,200
in this particular week in 2021,

2071
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:18,480
things could not be uglier and crazier on social media.

2072
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:21,440
And isn't it fun to go back to 2010,

2073
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:26,360
and just see innocent tweets about shampoos

2074
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:28,840
and silly bands and poor fessers.

2075
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:33,640
We all remember how kind of fun and novelty

2076
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:35,600
Twitter was at the time.

2077
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:40,000
So I would encourage everybody to take that trip,

2078
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,680
and go to at CoasterCuts,

2079
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:45,680
which currently has, as it stands as we record this,

2080
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:47,960
it has nine followers.

2081
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:49,840
It never got two out there.

2082
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,800
There weren't a lot of likes in general.

2083
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:54,360
You'll be confused when you look it up,

2084
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:55,760
because it's at CoasterCuts,

2085
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:58,200
but the username is Darlene Reese.

2086
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:01,720
Now again, more branding issues.

2087
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:04,760
But I have a couple proposals

2088
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:08,560
for our followers to do on Twitter.

2089
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,960
I think if you follow at CoasterCuts,

2090
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,520
everyone listening to this, go follow at CoasterCuts,

2091
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:16,200
and let's see what happens to the numbers.

2092
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:19,000
Starting at nine, where is it gonna go?

2093
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,680
And I have another fun idea, I think, within this.

2094
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:27,000
Another favorite of my tweets that I found,

2095
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,720
let me read it.

2096
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:30,200
Fall is coming.

2097
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,600
Rock out your piggies while you still can

2098
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:34,760
with our new piggy paints.

2099
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:38,480
Try colors like solar power or radioactive.

2100
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,120
And that's a lot of fun.

2101
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:43,720
And I'm gonna propose doing something,

2102
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:47,640
the rarely, maybe never done reverse ratio,

2103
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:50,120
a good ratio.

2104
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:53,320
Ratios are where there's not a lot of likes,

2105
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:56,080
but there's so many comments that imply

2106
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:58,840
that there's something problematic about what you said

2107
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,120
or something that has to get RU.

2108
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:01,800
You don't wanna get ratioed on Twitter.

2109
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:03,640
But why do those YFs always have to be bad?

2110
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:05,000
Why can't they be good?

2111
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,480
I think we should good ratio this tweet.

2112
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:13,000
You know, just say, let's say you're also looking forward

2113
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,080
to fall.

2114
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:17,880
Talk about which of your piggies you want to rock out.

2115
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:20,200
The big one, the one you wanna give the little one some love,

2116
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:21,160
or how about the middle?

2117
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:23,120
The middle gets forgotten.

2118
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:26,480
Suggest different colors of piggy paints

2119
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:28,120
that you might be thinking about.

2120
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:30,080
Or something unrelated, just say you're looking forward

2121
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:35,320
to having a great diva jam with Mr. Six this weekend.

2122
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,760
Just transport to 2010.

2123
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,800
Yeah, ask what hours the clown is in.

2124
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:44,400
Ask if you just make sure that he's there.

2125
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:47,320
What's the asking price for Baloofs right now?

2126
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:48,160
Right.

2127
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:55,280
I like this, yeah, this is good.

2128
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:59,440
Can you, will the clown or the octopus

2129
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:02,240
give me a Tasmanian devil temp tattoo?

2130
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:04,760
Or a permanent one?

2131
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:10,240
Will it almost lose my hair before dying it purple?

2132
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:15,640
A couple of people have sent us this over the months

2133
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:20,400
of the CityWalk Hollywood account is locked now.

2134
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:23,000
And I don't think there's anything sinister behind it.

2135
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,320
I think they just was like,

2136
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:26,160
oh, we're just gonna announce everything

2137
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,880
on the Universal Hollywood account.

2138
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,360
So we're not gonna use this one anymore.

2139
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:30,520
But it's still up.

2140
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:34,760
So do you think Universal Hollywood knew we would come

2141
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:38,120
for that account eventually with something like this?

2142
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:40,200
They're like, lock it down, lock it down.

2143
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,200
Guys are paying too much attention.

2144
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:47,960
My guess is that Trump tried to seize the CityWalk account

2145
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:50,120
to tweet from music and bloggers.

2146
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,480
That was my guess.

2147
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,120
Oh man, are we gonna call attention to it?

2148
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:54,960
And before you know it,

2149
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:57,680
Darlene Reese is calling for uprisings.

2150
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:01,920
I don't know, you might hopefully not.

2151
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:03,440
No, we're gonna use this for fun.

2152
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:04,920
So go follow at CoasterCuts.

2153
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:06,280
Let's see what happens to the numbers.

2154
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:08,840
Let's bump it up from nine.

2155
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:10,080
Let's go have some fun.

2156
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:11,640
Cause it was a tough run for this place.

2157
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:16,320
I should mention the first one of these opened in March 2009

2158
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:20,680
and in June 2009, Six Flags filed for bankruptcy.

2159
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:25,680
So this wasn't, hey, this was a hair raising experience

2160
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:28,320
for them in the wrong way.

2161
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:33,560
So let's give some positivity to this social media.

2162
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:34,600
Yeah.

2163
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:36,160
I think on the show, I think that's great.

2164
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:37,600
I think on the show we've called for us

2165
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:40,400
to be put in charge of Six Flags in general.

2166
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,880
And I think if that ever happens,

2167
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:45,120
project number one is putting these back

2168
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:47,080
in malls across America.

2169
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:49,480
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

2170
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:52,440
Well, yeah, malls are dying.

2171
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:54,400
You gotta get people in there

2172
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:57,120
and you gotta do experiences,

2173
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:58,680
which I think people will be dying for

2174
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:00,680
after being cooped up for so long.

2175
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,600
What didn't sound so fun in 2009,

2176
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,120
I think would be a blast in 20.

2177
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:08,120
I've like, we've just been stuck inside for so long.

2178
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:12,720
I would love to go have a rock the plank

2179
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:17,600
pirates rock birthday party with you guys.

2180
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:22,600
I'd gladly go pirate up all of our hair together.

2181
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:27,160
Yes, I would love, yes, to pirate up our hair together.

2182
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:30,840
Go see Doolittle and IMAX again.

2183
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,280
Can I read this tweet?

2184
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:38,240
Get it while it's hot, $15 buzz cuts.

2185
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:45,920
I would, it's hard to get your hair cut also, you know?

2186
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:47,360
I haven't done it in a while.

2187
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:50,440
Man, at this time they were just plentiful.

2188
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:54,600
$15 buzz cuts and it wasn't even a thing.

2189
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:57,000
It wasn't even a TV special to watch people

2190
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,080
get their hair cut.

2191
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:00,960
It was nothing back then.

2192
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:03,840
No longer a dreaded but necessary obligation,

2193
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:06,560
a blessed gift in our modern times.

2194
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:07,880
Yeah.

2195
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:08,720
Man, you know what?

2196
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:09,560
You know, there's that place,

2197
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:10,480
I think we mentioned it,

2198
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:13,680
that was open right before the pandemic, round one,

2199
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,600
that is open already in some other places

2200
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,800
with arcade games, it has a bowling alley

2201
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:19,040
and it has karaoke rooms.

2202
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:20,640
We were very excited about it.

2203
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:23,080
I think let's add haircuts to that too.

2204
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:26,240
Let's just get another thing in there

2205
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:29,880
and let's get, yeah, let's get a pirate plank birthday

2206
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:31,200
going for me.

2207
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:33,280
Maybe not this year, but maybe next year.

2208
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:37,360
Wow, Mike, I'm having such a great time.

2209
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:39,600
I've been limbo for an hour.

2210
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:42,640
Oh my gosh, I'm so tired, but it was so worth it.

2211
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:47,160
And I gotta say, your big kapow looks totally awesome.

2212
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:52,840
Wow, thanks, this is the best 40th birthday ever.

2213
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:57,120
I assume that's when we'll be able to have a party.

2214
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:00,240
Yeah, at least get it a karaoke room.

2215
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:01,080
Yeah.

2216
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:03,280
Oh no, Jason was just trying to get a blamma jamma

2217
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:04,400
and they cut him.

2218
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:08,480
Just like in his dominion in the 90s.

2219
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:11,320
They cut his belly, they cut Jason's belly again.

2220
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,200
His hairy belly, I believe as you referred to it

2221
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:18,200
on the episode. Yes, that's right.

2222
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:22,560
The octopus couldn't see and he cut Jason's hairy belly.

2223
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:25,120
Well, that's what happens when you have eight blades,

2224
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:27,000
one in each of your tentacles.

2225
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,480
You can't keep track of them all.

2226
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:30,200
Swinging them around.

2227
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:34,200
I'm realizing now a dreaded but necessary obligation

2228
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:37,000
is probably what my family called it

2229
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,840
if we accidentally went to Six Flags Great Adventure

2230
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:42,160
on like a muggy holiday weekend

2231
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:43,680
in the middle of the summer.

2232
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:52,960
Well, geez, you know, I better get back out there

2233
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:57,960
and make sure that my wife is not one bored mommy right now.

2234
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:03,120
I'll help her not be one not so bored mommy.

2235
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:04,520
And she's always a classy mommy.

2236
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:05,880
Let me be clear about that.

2237
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:10,800
On that note, use your phone.

2238
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:14,160
You can play the Vanga Boys when you put a bowl

2239
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:17,880
on your child's head and just cut around.

2240
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:24,040
And give him a picture of Mr. Six and a bow tie

2241
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,520
and tell him to pin it.

2242
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:27,520
Yeah.

2243
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,520
Go ahead, pin the bow tie.

2244
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,280
Yeah, well, we do what we can.

2245
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:35,880
We do virtual Six Flags roller coaster cuts

2246
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:38,640
and we try to make it fun.

2247
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:41,320
You survived podcast the ride.

2248
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:45,520
What a way to kick off the second gate for the year.

2249
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:50,800
I think all of 2021 on the second gate

2250
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,640
is gonna be a real, to keep consulting the list.

2251
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:57,480
I think, boy, this year is gonna be a real zoink,

2252
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:58,320
don't you think?

2253
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:02,080
A real, I agree, a real zoink.

2254
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,520
Real zoink.

2255
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:04,360
Yeah.

2256
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:05,720
Real blamma jamma hours.

2257
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:10,080
We're gonna, we have so many blamma jamas planned

2258
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:13,200
and every episode for the year is gonna be more fun

2259
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:15,920
than a little date with your classy mommy.

2260
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:26,040
All right, gang, we'll see you next time with more stuff.

2261
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:30,040
Our Venga bus is leaving, gotta go.

2262
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:31,080
Bye bye.

2263
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:31,920
Bye.
