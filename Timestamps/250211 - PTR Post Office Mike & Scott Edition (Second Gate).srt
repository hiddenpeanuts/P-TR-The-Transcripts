1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,960
Hey, you've got questions.

3
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,560
We've got answers.

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,400
Mike and Scott mail bag.

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,880
Let's go, go, go.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,880
On with the show.

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,280
Hey, great.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,320
All right, great.

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,840
Is that a new song for these?

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,080
Only if I can remember that later.

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,400
I mean, there's a recorded track of it,

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,520
so I could remember it.

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,560
Yeah, yeah.

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,520
I think riffing it every time, then it can evolve,

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,640
like jazz, you see.

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,680
I just wanted to start things on an exciting note, if we could.

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,240
Sure, and that was exciting.

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,840
Yeah, I think mission accomplished.

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,800
Thank you all for sending us a bunch of questions

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,880
directed at Mike and I, specifically, an opportunity

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,320
to do a different little slice of this three man operation.

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,440
And I noticed people kind of searching for themes

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,200
and going, well, what's up with Scott and Mike,

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,080
as opposed to Jason?

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,880
So I guess less in the way of Barbara Stanwyck questions

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,640
and more in the way of a parent question.

27
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,320
I think people put together, which almost I didn't,

28
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,480
like, oh, that's right.

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,360
It's the dads.

30
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,360
It's the Disney daddies.

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,600
Dads is good angle.

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,720
And I did notice a little handful of those

33
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,920
were worth acknowledging.

34
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,840
I don't know if I might have an answer that doesn't answer any

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,440
of them specifically, but I have some kid things to talk about.

36
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,920
Here's Gina Boliega.

37
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,040
As a first time parent to a one-year-old,

38
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,880
I just want all the parenthood content, LOL.

39
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,680
Amelia, same.

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,000
I've got a three-month-old.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,320
And in keeping with that, Ariel Vento.

42
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,600
Which theme park that you visited with your kids

43
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,520
has been the most friendly and fun for three years old

44
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,560
and under kiddos?

45
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,760
And while, obviously, we've both had a lot of great times

46
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,040
at Disneyland and Notts and Universal and the big ones,

47
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,520
in terms of specific to that age and great for little kids

48
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,800
and something I'd never heard of before,

49
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,600
I've been wanting to talk about and hype up

50
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,240
this really cute little thing in the Long Beach area

51
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,520
called El Dorado Frontier.

52
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,520
I've now been twice and never had a good opportunity

53
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,480
to talk about it on the show.

54
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,480
Basically, it's in one of these parks

55
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,520
where you have to pay just to go in or to park in there.

56
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,800
Big sprawling park in the Long Beach area.

57
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,000
But then you keep driving and driving and driving,

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,120
and you end up in this little sliver that's

59
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,880
this little train-based park that

60
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,400
is so adorable and thoughtfully designed.

61
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,200
I think it was, at one point, just a train and that's it.

62
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,440
And it was getting run down and was going to close.

63
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,280
And then some people bought it who

64
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,400
were actual Hollywood set designers, art decorators,

65
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,240
and who were big Disneyland nerds.

66
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,720
And they thought maybe with just a little bit of money and care

67
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,840
and love, we could give this thing a little bit more charm

68
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,240
than it had before.

69
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:17,240
So it's ended up as this great little J. Ward type.

70
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,400
It's kind of like a Dudley Do-Right type,

71
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,120
like jagged font, tilted letter sort of thing.

72
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,120
Kind of like this fractured fairy tale vibe

73
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,560
and cute cartoony colors.

74
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,120
But there's not a ton there.

75
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,840
It's a train, and it's panning for gold and a merry-go-round.

76
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,720
But all done surprisingly, thoughtfully cool.

77
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,480
And I've been twice in the Christmas season,

78
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,720
and this time around with my new son.

79
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,040
And everybody loved it.

80
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,760
We used it as our Santa photo.

81
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,640
They do Santa photos there.

82
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,960
A great place to meet Santa.

83
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,640
Santa's hanging around.

84
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,080
You wait around for constant, every five minute,

85
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,160
real foamy snow blasts, foamy fake snow blasts.

86
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,680
You've got to love that.

87
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,760
Fomier than a Disney or an Americana fake snow

88
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
is what you're saying.

89
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,320
Boy, you know, amazingly, I don't really

90
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,600
go to the Americana fake snows.

91
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,200
I don't know why I haven't.

92
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,720
I think the kids would love it.

93
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,680
So I can't really compare the foamiest.

94
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,880
Yes, the outdoor Glendale mall.

95
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,040
The very stylized Disney-esque Glendale outdoor mall,

96
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,840
home to a friend of the show, Buzz Buzz.

97
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,360
Yes.

98
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,400
Be cool in the comments.

99
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,640
But anyway, this thing was just, like, so delightful.

100
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,520
Really surprised me.

101
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,200
Just if you're in that area, if you're

102
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,280
like a parent in the South Bay or Orange County

103
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,400
or around there, really charming holiday time.

104
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,840
And it also has this little type of ride that the kids,

105
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,760
it's like a little, like a caboose kind of car

106
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,680
that kids have to pump themselves.

107
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,520
It's like a little simple track, and they have to do it.

108
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,920
So like when the hobos used to ride the rails,

109
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,240
essentially that car, I don't know the name of it.

110
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,400
Yeah, where like the two people in the silent films

111
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,480
would like, you know, manically chase the big train

112
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,440
and, you know, to try to catch up or climb a board

113
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,080
or, you know, or like they're the damsel in distress

114
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,880
that is on the train and they got to catch up real fast.

115
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,480
It's like that.

116
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,840
It's one of those for little kids.

117
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,440
There used to be a thing like this at Knott's Camp Snoopy.

118
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,720
It was called Huff and Puff and it closed recently

119
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,240
to make way for the new Camp Snoopy things,

120
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,360
which are delightful, but it's this great little thing,

121
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,520
like for a very little kid to be able

122
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,080
to actually control it themselves.

123
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,880
And it's a little bit easier than like a little car would be.

124
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,640
And if you don't have the strength

125
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,360
and you can't really muster your energy all the way

126
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,000
that we're on the track, a teenager will come

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,320
with a broom pole and just push you the whole way.

128
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,640
So anyways, El Dorado Frontier, just,

129
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,320
I've been wanting to just earnestly give a recommendation

130
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,720
of this cute thing for a long time.

131
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,960
So I'll use this data to do so.

132
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,680
Oh wait, and I forgot the real reason

133
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,920
I've been wanting to bring it up.

134
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,480
Great train ride, like which scared the hell out

135
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,960
of my three month olds, but besides that,

136
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,800
screeching the entire way all the way around the track

137
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,120
and it's a long track.

138
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,640
So that was a lot to get through,

139
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,640
but worth it because like cute, fun, well decorated,

140
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,520
but among the like knickknacks they have out there

141
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,200
decorating the train path, an old McDonald's apple pie tree.

142
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,040
Oh wow, really?

143
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,480
They found one of those somewhere.

144
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,320
So you can see an authentical thing from our childhood

145
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,120
mixed in with old West stuff.

146
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,960
It was nice to see that mildly creepy smiling face.

147
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,040
Mildly, yeah.

148
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,640
That's interesting because that would be a perfect place

149
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,640
because we want to buy old McDonaldland stuff like that,

150
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,920
but like nobody has a mansion here.

151
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,000
So if you were to decorate like some sort of a fun center,

152
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,920
theme park, whatever you call it,

153
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,000
that would be a good spot.

154
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,320
That's a great, and like current kids

155
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,880
don't know what that is.

156
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,760
They don't know from McDonaldland.

157
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,200
It's kind of sad to think about

158
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,200
that any kid past like 2008 just thinks of McDonald's

159
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,480
as oh, that boring place.

160
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,160
That place with the white walls and nothing cool to do.

161
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,560
So nice that there's these remnants of, oh, what we had.

162
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,880
Oh, when there were little tiny Disneyland's

163
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,560
at basically every McDonald's location.

164
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,600
Yeah, well, there should be an executive order

165
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,680
that says we're gonna start teaching

166
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,960
McDonaldland in schools.

167
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,320
That's what I think.

168
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,520
So kids really need to learn about this,

169
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,400
especially the old like Officer Big Mac

170
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,880
and some of the characters that weren't even that common

171
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,800
when we were growing up,

172
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,760
maybe they were represented in the play area,

173
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,600
but they weren't so much on the TV.

174
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,440
Yeah, yeah.

175
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,560
So it's time to teach kids about the true history

176
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,080
of our military industrial complex

177
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,800
of when we had firm authority figures

178
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,520
who not only believed in strong prisons,

179
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,320
but they themselves were the prisons.

180
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,160
Their mouth.

181
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,360
Go into my head.

182
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,200
Yeah.

183
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
You commit a crime, you stay there, I eat you.

184
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,760
You don't eat me, I eat you.

185
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,040
That was a great time to be alive.

186
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,880
It really was.

187
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,400
And all we can do is try to pass it to ours.

188
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,720
I have a question for the nation of America.

189
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
Oh, everybody?

190
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,080
Yeah, a question unrelated to what we were just talking about.

191
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,000
I've noticed in Burbank and around here,

192
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,040
there are a lot of sort of family fun center type things

193
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,600
like low, I guess Chuck E. Cheese

194
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,080
because they would have play areas, but discovery zones.

195
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,800
There are so many different seemingly independent run

196
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,560
children's play things, play areas.

197
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,800
I don't even know what you call them, fun centers, whatever.

198
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,880
Balls, you know, something to climb on, a slide.

199
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,360
Maybe a trampoline component.

200
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,800
Yes, I've become familiar with this thing, Billy Bees,

201
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,600
which is at the Anaheim Garden Walk,

202
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,120
which my son loves very much.

203
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,960
And is it chain?

204
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,520
There's one in Santa Clarita.

205
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,360
Yes, correct.

206
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,200
But then there's a place called Rockin' Kids in Burbank.

207
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,320
And then there's another coming soon area that's called,

208
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,800
let's say it's called Candyland coming across the way.

209
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,240
There is something called Candyland in Sherman Oaks.

210
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,640
Are you making up Candyland or?

211
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,480
Because there is a Candyland.

212
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,280
I wanna say maybe it's the same thing.

213
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,120
I don't know, because it's like this weird like bad,

214
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,920
a lesser Lisa Frank looking art on the wall

215
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,760
in the Burbank mall.

216
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,680
But there's so many.

217
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,840
There's one just around the corner

218
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,080
where we live by a bakery.

219
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,280
I can't tell if there have always been as many of these.

220
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,120
That's my question.

221
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,480
Or if we're only noticing because we're new parents,

222
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,960
or is this kind of like how they're jamming escape rooms

223
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,800
in everywhere?

224
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,240
Is it like a reasonable way to fill a bunch of retail space

225
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,960
that is there, like something's gotta go in there.

226
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,320
And you might as well just fill it with a bunch of stuff

227
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,160
for kids.

228
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,000
That's my theory.

229
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,640
It does seem like it's quietly come back.

230
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,520
Like we're always going, oh, remember Chuck E. Cheese?

231
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,640
Remember Discovery Zone?

232
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,640
And they are back just in this kind of odd haphazard.

233
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,040
Sometimes, and there's varying degrees of shadiness.

234
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,480
Some are incredibly well done.

235
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,760
Some are pretty chintzy.

236
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,720
I mean, we found ourselves in a ball pit with,

237
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,880
or not a ball pit, but one of those blaster zones

238
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,880
with cannons up above.

239
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,800
And then there's air jets shooting foam balls up.

240
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,920
And you're like, so I'm digging through foam balls

241
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,880
to throw at my oldest.

242
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,360
And then you'll just find a chip bag in there.

243
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,680
Like, oh no.

244
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,520
Uh-huh.

245
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,080
So that's unpleasant.

246
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,640
But yeah, they're around.

247
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,480
They're everywhere.

248
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,320
They're really around.

249
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,720
There were two others.

250
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,400
There's two others right by us.

251
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,800
And I wonder if this is happening across the country.

252
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,480
I suspect what you're saying is right

253
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,800
that this is a smart way to fill retail space

254
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,040
as more stores go away.

255
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,360
So we can just like, kids don't care.

256
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,200
I've talked about this before.

257
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,800
The budget of a place is not important to a child.

258
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,640
Absolutely.

259
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,520
No, not extreme shade being thrown at rockin' kids

260
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,880
in Burbank, but it's not exactly

261
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,200
they have some sort of cohesive thing

262
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,400
other than they bought a bunch of Fisher Price stuff,

263
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,440
bought some wooden playground equipment,

264
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,000
and then just have a bounce house

265
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,160
in the corner of this place.

266
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,240
I will say rockin' kids sounds particularly chintzy.

267
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,360
I don't even want to group Billy Bees in,

268
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,000
although Billy Bees is the one

269
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,440
where I found the chip bag and the foam balls.

270
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,080
So that's minus points for Billy Bees.

271
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,920
But Billy Bees does have like custom builds.

272
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,920
Like they have like plastic shaped big scary bee heads,

273
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,920
which is scary and unpleasant, yes,

274
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,560
but custom theming.

275
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,120
And they did pick a theme.

276
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,360
And the characters have names.

277
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,280
There's characters, they have names, and that's all.

278
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,120
Yes, that's true.

279
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,960
They've got a little universe going.

280
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,800
You gotta appreciate that.

281
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,760
We'll get into Billy Bees down the road, I imagine.

282
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,200
Rockin' kids is fun, but yes, for the adult,

283
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,160
the kind of sewer of these places perhaps doesn't hold up.

284
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,960
Yeah, because we're McDonaldland kids,

285
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,760
so we set the bar extremely high.

286
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,960
There was never a better amount of theming and mythology.

287
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,360
So yeah, you just put a minion

288
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,280
that you don't have the rights to up on the wall,

289
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,840
and then maybe a Hello Kitty,

290
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,640
and you're like, well, those don't go together.

291
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,480
No. What is this?

292
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,320
What's happening?

293
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,640
Right, now, my daughter, I've never seen her more fun

294
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,240
than Rockin' Kids.

295
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,480
I've never seen a child of two and a half,

296
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,760
basically, hurl her body with such reckless abandon

297
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,600
in a bounce house, over and over,

298
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,480
cackling like she lost her mind.

299
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,840
I'm trying to tell her, maybe don't do that,

300
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,240
because dad doesn't wanna go home

301
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,360
with you with like a dislocated shoulder.

302
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,680
The way in which she was doing it though

303
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,680
was so much more violent

304
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,280
than the five-year-old boys that were in there.

305
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,720
She was hurl, she would fold herself like an accordion,

306
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,800
and I'm just sitting there going, I think she'll be fine,

307
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,640
but that's making me uncomfortable.

308
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,760
All I can say, I hate to say it,

309
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,800
but when you're telling me that, and what I'm hearing is,

310
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,680
and you know, you wouldn't believe what my son did,

311
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,560
he had paper towel beds for his Ghostbusters.

312
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,120
Well. That's a fire hazard.

313
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,760
That could be a fire hazard.

314
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,680
Yeah, I'm not saying it's not in the family of concern,

315
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,080
but I think if you had a video,

316
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,960
you would be like, I don't know about that.

317
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,000
Okay. Curl, folding herself up.

318
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,920
The video would have to be, is this regular kid stuff,

319
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,280
or is this particular Carlson-based concern?

320
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,640
It's regular kid stuff, what she's doing,

321
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,160
but the way in which she's doing this on a bounce house

322
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,000
was a little aggressive.

323
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,560
And then I was legitimately concerned

324
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,760
because it has this weird like tall slide

325
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,400
that's attached to the bounce house,

326
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,080
and it's as tall as me, but it's not a controlled slide

327
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,120
that has like, you know, it's a foot wide,

328
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,280
two feet wide or whatever.

329
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,800
It's a big wide thing.

330
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,720
So however you slide.

331
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,800
You're talking Billy Bees,

332
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
you got some of the widest slides I've ever seen.

333
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,600
And it's not even like plastic,

334
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,760
it's just material with air in it.

335
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,560
Okay. So there's a lot of variables.

336
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,160
So when she sees other kids doing stuff,

337
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,000
she just wants to do it.

338
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,960
Doesn't matter if the kid's eight, 10, doesn't matter.

339
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,280
She's wanting to do it too.

340
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,120
Wow.

341
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,440
So she's trying to climb up to do the slide,

342
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,280
and I'm like, you are not doing this slide.

343
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,120
I don't know how your body's going to fly.

344
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,040
I see a six, seven year old girl go up there.

345
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,120
She tries to go down the slide.

346
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,760
She flips in one of the most violent ways.

347
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,200
She eats shit so hard.

348
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,880
I believe the wind gets knocked out of her

349
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,800
because she doesn't even,

350
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,000
she kind of just pops over the slide,

351
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,920
lands on this thing and just like a little cough

352
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,280
and then runs right to mom.

353
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,880
She wasn't crying, but you could tell she was shaking up.

354
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,800
So I'm like, I was right.

355
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,440
You are not going down this.

356
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,200
Luckily it was a little too steep for her to climb herself

357
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,040
because she's too little.

358
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,840
But I can't, for me, if you went there

359
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,600
and you showed me what's physically happening,

360
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,440
I might go, okay, I understand.

361
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,280
Yeah.

362
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,600
Boy, having listened to a lot of your mom's stories,

363
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,920
I really wonder.

364
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,280
I need to see some photographic evidence.

365
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,600
Here's what I think.

366
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,320
I am leaving out the things that made me uncomfortable

367
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,960
that I know in hindsight for sure were fine.

368
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,240
There were five other things I could tell you right now

369
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,720
that stressed me out that I know were fine.

370
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,080
I'm only saying the two-

371
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,080
You're telling me, oh wow,

372
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,120
but you're leaving out things

373
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,120
that are perfectly normal things.

374
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,920
Well, this is, you're censoring, your mom's censoring.

375
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,760
Yes.

376
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,800
Wow, you could easily provide the mom analog material.

377
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,360
Right, I have self-awareness.

378
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,000
There was just a regular kind of tube slide

379
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,240
that she was going down.

380
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,640
It's such an angle with her holding her hands up

381
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,460
that I was like,

382
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,000
you're gonna get your hands caught on something.

383
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,400
I know that was fine,

384
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,120
but it was stressing me out in the moment.

385
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,040
I think even rockin' kids thought of that.

386
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,640
I don't think they put things out

387
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,480
that your hands could get caught on.

388
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,760
I don't know if it was anything jagged or anything.

389
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,600
I'm just saying-

390
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,480
It's not like the knots, or not the knots,

391
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,400
the Six Flags flume ride that I went on

392
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,360
where there was just an open,

393
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,360
like two turning wheels that were super thick with grease

394
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,120
that I could have just stuck my hand into

395
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,400
before going down the ride.

396
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,240
Yeah, it was not that bad,

397
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,400
but again, that's what I'm saying.

398
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,800
There were things I know were fine,

399
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,280
but I'm like, this was just like,

400
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,520
I don't know if that's okay.

401
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,400
And then, of course, my daughter has stolen a lot of stuff

402
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,800
from Muffin, the Bluey character,

403
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,880
who is the most petulant,

404
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,240
including saying like,

405
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,600
uh, no, I don't want to,

406
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,360
which is something that Muffin says.

407
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,880
So I now hear Muffin coming out of her.

408
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,000
Bluey's a bad influence.

409
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,400
And then she is funny too.

410
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,200
I say, uh, we went to the Bounce House today,

411
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,160
and she goes, yeah, and daddy tried to pull me out.

412
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,800
I feel like something's happening here, Mike.

413
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,080
I could be wrong.

414
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,920
I'm not denying it.

415
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,760
Wow.

416
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,600
I'm not denying it.

417
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,760
Isn't that, like, isn't that odd to be,

418
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,080
we've heard tale after tale of overprotective mom woe

419
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,440
and look at you now.

420
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,800
Yeah, I said I was gonna be a helicopter parent,

421
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,640
and it's coming true.

422
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,320
Did you announce that if you knew it?

423
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,240
I mean, I've said it in private at the very least.

424
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,960
Okay, I don't know if you said it to our audio.

425
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,640
I wanted to make sure it's been said out loud.

426
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,960
I didn't know if you said that in the,

427
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,120
like, you were having a daughter episode.

428
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,960
Well, maybe.

429
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,920
She's here, excited,

430
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,480
and these helicopter blades are flying and flying.

431
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,920
May they ever spin.

432
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,760
Yeah.

433
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,080
Well, no, I, there's, yeah, I know it.

434
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,600
I'm aware of it, and I'm trying to check it,

435
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,360
but this particular thing felt very intense.

436
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,200
That's all. And it might be.

437
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,480
I'd have to look at, I'd have to check the footage.

438
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,640
Let me do another parent question for Marnie.

439
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,800
Sure.

440
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,520
Was there anything that you were surprised to find

441
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,920
that your kids didn't like about a particular theme park?

442
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,760
Something you assumed they'd love,

443
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,800
but they in fact hated or didn't give a shit about?

444
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,480
And how about vice versa,

445
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,560
something innocuous or second rate

446
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,200
that they unexpectedly adore?

447
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,040
And I picked that because I do have a question

448
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,760
for that more of the second part.

449
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,240
And this is kind of a general thing, I'd say.

450
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,960
My oldest is getting pretty accustomed to rides.

451
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,080
We just had a really productive universal trip

452
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,600
where we blasted through a bunch of things

453
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,320
that have been on the to-do list for a long time

454
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
that he used to be scared of.

455
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,960
Minion Mayhem happened.

456
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,080
Simpsons ride happened three times in a row.

457
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,880
So proud of him, like leaps and bounds

458
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,040
in terms of ride comfort.

459
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,120
And yet what he remains loving,

460
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,720
and I'm curious if other parents out there

461
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,280
have experienced this too,

462
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,000
like one of the biggest secret theme park attractions

463
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,120
that you never think about is just some parked vehicle

464
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,800
that you can climb in.

465
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,800
It is like the biggest, and Universal has like

466
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,080
Italian little scooters

467
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,680
and then other types of motorcycles.

468
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,360
Like they're just a big row of those.

469
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,760
An area that we think of as just like

470
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,120
somewhere that you pass through

471
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,560
to get from one thing to the other,

472
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,680
like the French Moulin Rouge area.

473
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,320
But my son could spend an hour there easily.

474
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,880
Like we don't even go to the bottom.

475
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,760
Escalators, that's a big old hassle.

476
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,200
We stay, we get on all of those little motorcycles.

477
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,280
We honk, we rev.

478
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,680
That's like all they, that's all they wanna do.

479
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,360
It's really, like if I was involved

480
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,040
in the planning of a theme park,

481
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,880
my first move at this point would be

482
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,560
a bunch of weird little vehicles that kids can climb on.

483
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,800
It might be more important,

484
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,200
at least to that age group, than actual rides.

485
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,040
Yes, I agree.

486
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,600
I mean, it doesn't even matter yet if it moves.

487
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,200
I mean, we were outside rocking kids

488
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,160
and there's just a horse that you put a quarter in

489
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,000
and it moves.

490
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,840
We didn't have to pay the quarter.

491
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,800
She just was thrilled to be on the horse.

492
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,880
Same thing at the Burbank Mall.

493
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,200
We never pay for it.

494
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,040
Doesn't matter.

495
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,360
Sorry that we're cheap skates.

496
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,480
Sorry we're not giving our well-earned quarters

497
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,840
over to these machines.

498
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,520
But yeah, he just cycles through.

499
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,520
Doesn't want them to move, specifically.

500
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,360
No movement.

501
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,280
Let me sit in a still spaceship.

502
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,480
That's what I want.

503
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,280
And that dovetails into another thing

504
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,320
I wanna talk about, and this is maybe a good story

505
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,640
about my oldest starting to become me.

506
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,640
We had a Knott's Day that was so delightful

507
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,520
and we're hitting all that aforementioned

508
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,480
newish camp snoopy stuff.

509
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,000
Made it onto Pig Pen's Mud Buggies.

510
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,040
That was a good leap forward.

511
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,640
That's a very bouncy ride and he was nervous about that.

512
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,000
But ended up doing it, wanted to do it immediately again.

513
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,720
The wanting to do a ride again instantly

514
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,160
has been a wonderful thing to witness.

515
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,720
And yes, he still has to deal with me, the dad,

516
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,120
who does not like cues, who does not.

517
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,240
I will say yes as long as that line

518
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,920
is not completely insane,

519
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,800
which it wasn't for all of these things.

520
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,640
I mean, I'd wait in whatever for him,

521
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
but I'd prefer it and not.

522
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,280
But anyways, the thing though, at some point I asked,

523
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,000
what's your favorite ride here?

524
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,560
And he said, Flower Train.

525
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,920
And I said, oh yeah, well the train.

526
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,240
We did the, we're gonna do that.

527
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,920
And he said, no, no, the other train, the Flower Train.

528
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,600
And I had to think and like,

529
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,000
oh, you're talking about a not actual ride.

530
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,480
You are talking about something in the ghost town.

531
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,160
There is just a still parked train

532
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,160
that he calls Flower Train,

533
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,160
because all of the carriages now are filled

534
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,760
with nice winter or spring flowers,

535
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,240
depending on when you're there.

536
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,440
And it's just a little train compartment

537
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,840
that you climb up in, doesn't do anything.

538
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,840
It's called Old Betsy.

539
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,200
And again, all he wants to do,

540
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,120
there is a train that moves and shows you stuff,

541
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,440
much less cool than the one.

542
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,600
I mean, understandably than the one

543
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,720
where you can get up in it,

544
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,000
you're piloting it yourself.

545
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,360
So blasted Old Betsy.

546
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,120
We're having a fight, like I'm not alone.

547
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,400
Like there's a line of kids trying

548
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,800
to just get on Old Betsy for a second.

549
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,640
This is huge.

550
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,240
Stationary ride vehicles.

551
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,920
Biggest thing I didn't realize till I was a parent.

552
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,200
Has a blast there.

553
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,160
Then this was on December 31st.

554
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,120
And I was, I kind of said a couple of times,

555
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,960
I think we're gonna,

556
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,240
this will be the last time that we go to nots,

557
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,640
because next year we're gonna have Universal.

558
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,200
Like we're trying to trade up the annual passes.

559
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,280
And, or change up, sorry.

560
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,720
And he was cool with that until we were leaving.

561
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,680
And then just burst into tears, sobbing.

562
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,800
Oh my God, what's going on?

563
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,640
What's up?

564
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,480
How can I help?

565
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,480
And he says, I would just miss Knott's Berry Farm so much.

566
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,800
And then we had to go back in.

567
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,560
We spent some more time on Flower Train.

568
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,200
I mean, it was really, I felt for him,

569
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,560
but I was also like, oh my God, he's me.

570
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,520
This is exactly me at the Orlando airport.

571
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,640
It's happening just due to even the vague mention

572
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,400
that we won't be doing nots this year.

573
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,080
And probably that plan is,

574
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,560
I think we're gonna have to do nots this year.

575
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,560
And then here's the part that really kicks it over into me.

576
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,160
And to answer somebody else's question,

577
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,200
Shannon asked about like PTR things that your kid's like,

578
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,960
here's one that then later that week,

579
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,360
he's like, I miss Knott's Berry Farm.

580
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,920
He's inconsolable about missing nots.

581
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,480
And I thought, oh, you know what you might like?

582
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,920
There's this song about Knott's Berry Farm.

583
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,640
And this is something, I don't know that this is like

584
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,160
landed especially hard with the audience,

585
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,880
but when we talked to Rachel Bloom a little while back,

586
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,320
I brought in a handful of odd old nots clips.

587
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,840
And there was this documentary from 1984

588
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,400
that was made in New Zealand

589
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,400
with this Knott's Berry Farm song at the end.

590
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,720
That's the most like emotive, beautiful thing I've ever heard

591
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,680
that also was like really like of the moment,

592
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,240
like excellent kind of like 70s power pop.

593
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,720
I mean, it's a little late for that,

594
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,560
but it's this song,

595
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,840
I don't know if you remember the song at all.

596
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,680
Vaguely, yeah.

597
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:25,320
It's like Shades of McCartney and 10CC and Emmett Rhodes.

598
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,160
It's like,

599
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,320
Knott's Berry Farm,

600
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,160
no mistakes, no regrets,

601
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,560
together we can make it all the way.

602
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,000
Like why this song be so emotional about Knott's?

603
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,760
And I was like, maybe this will help you out.

604
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,880
And now he's singing that song

605
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,600
when he needs a hit of Knott's, we play.

606
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,960
And what could be more of me

607
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,280
than like passing on to my son,

608
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,840
like clips, weird old clips recorded off TV

609
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,520
of theme parks from before I was born.

610
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,760
And those are songs that mean a lot to him.

611
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,000
Right.

612
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,120
It's just been a very nice,

613
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,760
just earnest experience watching him like truly

614
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,160
fall in love with these places

615
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,040
and with the song that he'll never encounter anyone

616
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,880
who knows it.

617
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,720
Right.

618
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,560
Yeah.

619
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,360
I would say my daughter really,

620
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,520
a lot of the stuff I was hoping she would like,

621
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,360
she likes,

622
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,600
but then it is always really funny

623
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,720
to see what she like takes to.

624
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,400
She loves the Pirates of the Caribbean song.

625
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,200
She'd been on the ride twice, I think, at this point.

626
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,040
She likes the song though,

627
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,920
cause it's dark on that ride.

628
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,400
I think she gets a little uncomfortable by it.

629
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,720
But then like we were leaving Universal,

630
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,560
like we popped into,

631
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,160
look, you go up there, you have a little pizza,

632
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,800
you go see the Grinch,

633
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,680
and then you leave.

634
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,240
That's what you do when you're a dad

635
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,520
taking your daughter somewhere.

636
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,040
It's a really good kind of two hour place.

637
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,600
And in the two hour version, no lower lot.

638
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,080
That takes too long.

639
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,920
We haven't even done it.

640
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,280
We haven't done a lower lot together, yeah.

641
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,480
Yeah, yeah.

642
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,480
But there's a new thing coming in at CityWalk.

643
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,320
There's a new store.

644
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,160
One of the rare things coming to CityWalk,

645
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,200
not the things going.

646
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,440
Not leaving, yeah.

647
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,640
But they're characters from South Korea

648
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,120
that I had never heard of called the Line Friends.

649
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,080
Oh, I don't know about this.

650
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,760
They're just cute little characters,

651
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,080
the Sanrio-ish or whatever.

652
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,160
And we're leaving and she was in the stroller for this.

653
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,480
And she all of a sudden sees these friends,

654
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,080
these Line friends on a wall,

655
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,440
a construction wall basically.

656
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,080
And they have five, six characters.

657
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,160
And she demands I stop.

658
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,480
She's like, but there's plenty of characters everywhere.

659
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,640
She's never really done this with like pictures on a wall.

660
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,120
She demands we stop.

661
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,320
And then she sits and demands that we take photos

662
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,600
of her and each Line friend.

663
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,440
Wow.

664
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,600
So I have a full photo shoot of her in the stroller.

665
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,280
These characters you do not know.

666
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,680
These characters we don't know.

667
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,920
She doesn't know them.

668
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,920
She is so elated in these photos.

669
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,200
She's just like exploding with delight.

670
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
And then we do all the photos

671
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,840
and then she just goes again, again,

672
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,600
which is a thing she says often.

673
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,640
I'm like more photos.

674
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,480
We took them.

675
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,300
We have to leave.

676
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,140
You have to go to bed.

677
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,320
It's already too late.

678
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,240
So I'm like, that's better.

679
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,640
I go, but remember we saw the Grinch

680
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,280
and he was dancing and it was all show.

681
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,120
She's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

682
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,960
But like these still characters on a wall

683
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,400
that she just glanced at.

684
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,520
And so it's bizarre seeing like weird stuff that resonates.

685
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,360
It's funny.

686
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,520
You were saying they're wanting to do a ride again

687
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,560
when she was 18 months.

688
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,560
She went on the mater junkyard jamboree

689
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,920
or whatever it's called.

690
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,160
And she, I didn't, I always thought she was going to cry

691
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,760
because she was scared on a ride,

692
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,280
but she cried because we couldn't go ride it immediately.

693
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,480
Again, we had to wait.

694
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,520
See, there's a tough one.

695
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,880
You can't, that's a different thing.

696
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,240
That's a long wait to get back in.

697
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,080
Not like those mud bogeys.

698
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,920
Yeah, 20 minutes.

699
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,740
Yeah.

700
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,580
20 is reasonable.

701
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,420
Depends what it is.

702
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,920
Yeah, it depends what time of day.

703
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,400
But that was something I was not,

704
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,640
we were like all set for her to cry on something

705
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,480
or seeing something.

706
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,720
But then she cried because we couldn't just stick on there

707
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,200
because she loved, she loves just getting whipped around,

708
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,920
which is something that I guess will be good

709
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,880
when we get to like bigger rides.

710
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,720
Sure.

711
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,560
Yeah.

712
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,440
But it's interesting.

713
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,280
It's fun.

714
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,560
Like having it all scrambled up, you know,

715
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,720
we were getting set in our theme park ways.

716
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,440
Here's the things that we do

717
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,200
and here's the things that we don't do.

718
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,080
And then you bring kids into the picture

719
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,000
and like suddenly this big area is completely weighted

720
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
and you gotta carve out a bunch of time for this.

721
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,840
Yes.

722
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,660
And it's fun.

723
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,560
And she loves Tiki Room too.

724
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,880
She likes the song or whatever,

725
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,560
and we've done it once or twice.

726
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,320
And then we were trying, it was just got very,

727
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,440
I think I said this on the show already,

728
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,480
it was very stressful day.

729
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,660
And she knew where we were in Disneyland,

730
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,240
like last time we were there.

731
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,760
Because she goes, Tiki Room?

732
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,160
She started pointing at it and I went, oh, she knows.

733
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,840
She knows where we are now.

734
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,120
Because before, I mean, my mom doesn't know where we are

735
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,920
when we're at Disneyland.

736
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,320
She like knows Disney World okay,

737
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,160
but hasn't been there in a while,

738
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,520
but she's like, well, where is it?

739
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,120
To the left of the hub, daddy.

740
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,960
Right.

741
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,640
So we were like right there and she saw it from afar

742
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,480
and she goes, Tiki Room?

743
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,300
Tiki Room?

744
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,140
Wow.

745
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:49,980
And I go, oh, wow.

746
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,800
You're doing a good job.

747
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,640
So she really, yeah.

748
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,480
Wow.

749
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,540
Wow, knows her way around, knows what Tiki Room is

750
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,580
and mainly likes an animatronic show

751
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:01,180
from close to 70 years ago.

752
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,460
Yes, yeah.

753
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,620
So me forcing her to learn the map every night before bed

754
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,820
is really paying off.

755
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,660
Running drills.

756
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,480
Yep.

757
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,500
You got anything?

758
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,300
I mean, I got a bunch loaded up, but.

759
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,520
Yeah, I can.

760
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,360
Oh, you know what?

761
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,060
You actually, here, this one dovetails into kids.

762
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,900
I'll answer it quickly.

763
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,980
This is from DRC.

764
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,200
We know Mike's love of Ninja Turtles,

765
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,420
but what were the key toys of Scott's childhood?

766
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,860
Oh, that's a good question.

767
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:28,880
I, what's nice is the key toys are the ones

768
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,580
that have stuck around and that have just been

769
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,700
in my childhood bedroom unmoved for a long time

770
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,780
just because I didn't have the heart to get rid of them,

771
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:40,340
but luckily now they are beloved toys to my son

772
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,940
and it's really great to see

773
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,920
and that helps me them be immediately accessible to me.

774
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,060
I mean, I love Ninja Turtles too.

775
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,700
I don't have a lot of them left,

776
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,900
but my favorites are also the Kinects Roller Coaster

777
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,980
was one.

778
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,140
Don't have that anymore,

779
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,260
but that was a really cherished Christmas.

780
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,940
If you remember Kinects, not Legos,

781
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,100
but those like the long pieces that you're there

782
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,940
and that was an incredible thing where you like

783
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,980
could actually build the chain and it worked

784
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,100
and it would take cars up and then like

785
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,860
do a big route with it,

786
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,540
but the ones that I'm so excited my son is using

787
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:15,660
the Batman Returns playset where you fold it out

788
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,100
and some of it is Wayne Manor and some of it is Batcave

789
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,100
and some of it is Penguin's Lair

790
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,820
and there's a part where you can put Bruce Wayne

791
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,140
into a chamber and then spin him around

792
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,140
and leave a Batman back there

793
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,100
so that he can seamlessly behind a door

794
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,620
turn from one to the other

795
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,780
and I still have a lot of Penguins

796
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:40,780
and their little like Penguin missile packs left as well.

797
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,900
Real animal Penguins.

798
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,300
Yeah, not just multiple villain Penguins.

799
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,340
Yes, I don't know if I even have an action figure

800
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,580
of Danny DeVito Penguin.

801
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,940
I have that weird Robin that people think is Marlon Wayans.

802
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,420
I have one of those still around.

803
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,860
Because he was gonna be Robin.

804
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,460
They made the toys in advance, that's that story

805
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,460
and then Robin did not end up in Returns

806
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,180
so they had to just like, all right,

807
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,020
well what if Robin was in Returns?

808
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,980
He might look a little something like this.

809
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,580
Yeah, that's the place that I think

810
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,300
I've sent you this before where they did four versions

811
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,340
of the exact same mold for the different movies.

812
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,580
Yeah, you told me that what in this version represents

813
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,260
the Penguin's lair is what?

814
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,060
It's also Mr. Freeze.

815
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,020
Yeah, something like that where they just really painted

816
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,260
it a different color and would use the same molds.

817
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,100
Oh, okay.

818
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,940
Used it for years and I think,

819
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,340
I forget maybe even a non-Batman thing used it

820
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,780
like late 90s which is always funny stuff.

821
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,900
Like I didn't realize that as a kid

822
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,500
that like they would reuse molds and vehicles.

823
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,780
Like you'll find like Ninja Turtle vehicles

824
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,980
but they're a different,

825
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,740
it's a totally different like property.

826
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,980
That's smart, I mean that makes sense to do.

827
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,460
The other one I really love, there is a game,

828
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,300
do you have this game?

829
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,220
There's a game called Crash Canyon.

830
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,420
It was a board game.

831
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,460
Oh, I know what you're talking about but I didn't have it.

832
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,780
Off-road type vehicles and when you rolled the die

833
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,980
you would fill the whole thing up with water

834
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,140
and then if you might land on a spot

835
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,780
that was not a spot that your car could stay on

836
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,460
so it would tumble into the water.

837
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,700
So it was very, it had splash zones.

838
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,220
It was like just a very like cool interactive,

839
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:18,380
there's a precarious bridge on it like Indiana Jones

840
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,620
and I love that he loves it and I always loved it

841
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,900
because in the days before you could just watch

842
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,820
theme park videos all the time,

843
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,900
it was like a little taste of,

844
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,180
oh this is the vibe of Big Thunder or of Indiana Jones

845
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:35,260
what with a wobbly bridge and what with fake rock molding.

846
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,380
I mean it's very like Radiator Springs before its time.

847
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,700
I've been loving seeing Crash Canyon around.

848
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,580
It's not a thing I hear about a ton.

849
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:47,420
Like you remember it but I've never caught a lot of

850
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,900
nostalgia for Crash Canyon out there.

851
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,180
I'm just, I'm so glad I got mine.

852
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,060
He's loving it.

853
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,420
That's cool.

854
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,940
Just you saying that I remember any board game

855
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,300
that was sort of three-dimensional,

856
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,060
even like the game of life,

857
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,620
you would put those little mountains that popped out of the.

858
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,380
Yes, hills and bridges.

859
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,220
Yeah, yeah.

860
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,700
I like that more because then the game is very dry.

861
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,660
The game is very adult oriented.

862
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,700
Yeah, I love the game but it's boring.

863
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,660
Yeah, but then the wheel extremely satisfying.

864
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:18,020
I felt the same way, just like placing the hills.

865
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,420
I found, it was like a,

866
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,420
it's almost like a model railroad situation

867
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,460
that only takes 10 seconds to assemble instead of a year.

868
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,340
Yes, yes.

869
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,220
So any game like that. Landscaping.

870
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,460
And then I loved Mouse Trap

871
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,380
but Mouse Trap never worked.

872
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,180
Never worked, more fun in theory.

873
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,860
But I would never do what it's supposed to do.

874
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,700
Yeah, totally.

875
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,700
I would be more likely to like,

876
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,100
well, let me just like take the individual traps

877
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,900
and make like one at a time work

878
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,460
because the entire Rube Goldberg is never gonna.

879
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,300
Right.

880
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,260
Run smoothly all the way through.

881
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,100
Right.

882
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,820
There's a half of this that's for you.

883
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,700
Oh.

884
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,780
Favorite, I think I might know that.

885
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,900
Oh, maybe I don't know the answer.

886
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,300
What's your favorite Ninja Turtle knockoff?

887
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,860
Barnyard Commandos, Cowboys of Mu Mesa,

888
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,700
Biker Mice from Mars.

889
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,660
Mu Mesa.

890
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,340
Mu Mesa, I think I've heard that before.

891
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,380
Okay.

892
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,340
For whatever reason,

893
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,140
because there were some Archie published comics also

894
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,980
in addition to the cartoon of Mu Mesa.

895
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,940
And Mu Mesa is by like a turtle guy as well.

896
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:19,900
And I have watched Mu Mesa recently

897
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,820
and I don't know that the show is really funny.

898
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,420
And I don't know if I've said this on the mic here

899
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,420
but the show is really funny

900
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,380
because it isn't even having that much fun

901
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,860
with them being cows and cowboys.

902
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,460
It's pretty much straight ahead.

903
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,020
It's like you're watching like a G-rated Deadwood

904
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,860
but they're cows.

905
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:40,740
It's just about like, you owe me $300.

906
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,580
Yeah.

907
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,420
It's not like that.

908
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,780
Then they don't say, that's a lot of moolah.

909
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,140
There's a little of that.

910
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,140
But then there's just like, there's clearly a brothel.

911
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,380
It's a cow brothel, but like they just drink sarsaparilla.

912
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,460
Like it's not, no one's drinking alcohol.

913
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,020
But there again, this is one of your,

914
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,940
you who claim to be the most puritanical

915
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,380
are imagining, how do you know it's a brothel?

916
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,580
What's the proof that it's a brothel?

917
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,820
Because she's dressed, the woman who runs it.

918
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,500
Miss Lily.

919
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,340
She's dressed like.

920
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,180
But she's dressed like the character.

921
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,180
If you've ever watched Deadwood, you know one-to-one.

922
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,460
She has like a speakeasy brothel.

923
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,660
It looks just like that.

924
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:18,140
There weren't speakeasies where people wore revealing clothes

925
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,380
that weren't brothels?

926
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,260
Perhaps in the old west, there was like one building.

927
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,100
I'm not even saying in the old west.

928
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,220
I'm saying in Moo Mesa.

929
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,940
Could there not be, are these cowboys

930
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,460
all just trying to get their udders wet?

931
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,340
Is that all it is?

932
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,860
And yes, I believe an udder is a cow's penis.

933
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,860
That is what I think.

934
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,380
Okay, well, as far as I know, that's what it is too.

935
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,660
But I guess what I'm saying is that

936
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:47,020
it's almost like one-to-one old west stories.

937
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,540
And it's not even like,

938
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,020
there's not even that much fantastical stuff happening.

939
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,900
They're just cows and they're having like normal like,

940
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,180
oh, the mayor's a little corrupt.

941
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,820
Oh, we exposed them.

942
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,060
And there's nothing like crazy turtle.

943
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,340
Showdown at noon.

944
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:04,380
Like the craziest thing I even found was just like

945
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,180
in the comic, there's a dinosaur.

946
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,940
And I was like, well, that's like the craziest thing

947
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,180
that's happened in a Moo Mesa story.

948
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,020
Then it's off.

949
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,220
How do you end up at dinosaur

950
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,380
without previously exhausting all of the cow fun

951
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,300
you can have?

952
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,820
Although is there a lot of cow fun you can have?

953
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:21,580
Cows are kind of a limited theme ultimately, aren't they?

954
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,340
They're a limited theme.

955
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:27,420
The origin of Moo Mesa is that a comet hit a Mesa

956
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,780
and then the cows around it became anthropomorphic.

957
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,860
So I think it's modern day,

958
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,100
but there's a very tall Mesa

959
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,500
where there's all these anthropomorphic cows

960
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,700
and other animals are just reliving our old West.

961
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,900
How do they know about that?

962
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,620
How do they know how to act and talk?

963
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,660
I don't know.

964
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,020
Do they do like Pat Butchram stuff?

965
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,460
Well, how do they know that?

966
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,300
I don't know.

967
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:57,020
We did also, did you say asteroid or comet or what was it?

968
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,140
Comet I think. Comet.

969
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:02,860
They also scatter a bunch of the old tapes their way.

970
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,220
Right, they were watching Green Acres episodes

971
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,180
and then episodes of Gunsmoke.

972
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,020
Yeah, yeah.

973
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,540
And then they figured, they were like,

974
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,380
well, let's live like this.

975
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,940
It taught them English, yeah.

976
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,300
But for whatever reason, I think a lot of stuff

977
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,700
comes down to character design for whatever reason.

978
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,340
When you're a kid, if it looks kind of cool,

979
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,180
that's what you need as opposed to actual quality.

980
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,020
Certainly, then you have the rest of your life

981
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,540
to pick apart all the plot holes.

982
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,220
Exactly, which I will continue to do.

983
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,620
Which is some of what we do here.

984
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,060
That being said, I do like Barnyard Commandos

985
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,860
and Biker Mice from Mars, don't worry.

986
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,340
Close seconds.

987
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,580
I have more of a traditional theme park question

988
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,420
if that would be okay.

989
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,820
Yeah, yeah, why not?

990
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,820
Hold on, my phone is blown up the question.

991
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,900
Matt Valdez asks, Disney reportedly has been surveying

992
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,540
guests about adding The Simpsons to Disney parks.

993
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,380
If that were to happen,

994
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,060
what would you want the land or rides to be?

995
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,260
Which park would you want it in?

996
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,660
This is an interesting question to me

997
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,380
as I really thought about it.

998
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,500
What do I want in the year 2025

999
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,020
with The Simpsons and a Disney park?

1000
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,180
Does it even fit?

1001
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,020
Yes.

1002
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:08,860
Do I want it there?

1003
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,580
It's not a giant priority to me,

1004
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,700
I have to say. It's not for me,

1005
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,700
neither me. This is probably properties

1006
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,060
I'd be more excited about.

1007
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,940
I agree, but I'm like, I guess I would take it

1008
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,180
over other stuff.

1009
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,020
Yes.

1010
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,260
It just doesn't feel so urgent to me to put it somewhere,

1011
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,580
nor do I feel it fits anywhere in,

1012
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:29,060
or at least the California parks thematically.

1013
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,540
But my answer would be,

1014
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,500
if they actually do Itchy and Scratchy land,

1015
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,700
that's the way to do it different.

1016
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,460
I think we have talked a little bit about that.

1017
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,300
Yeah.

1018
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,260
About a real parents island and all that stuff.

1019
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,340
But yeah, if there was a new ride

1020
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,100
that was like the full journey and that let you,

1021
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,620
because obviously you can't do the ride

1022
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,620
where the log is cut down the middle.

1023
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,460
You can't do some of the more dangerous things

1024
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,660
or Bart and Lisa like exploding off,

1025
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,380
jumping off the land mines.

1026
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,100
But you could do a simulator

1027
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,700
that takes you through all that stuff.

1028
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,100
And you could build, I mean,

1029
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,940
it'd be pretty exciting to arrive at a Disney park

1030
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:10,940
and see a big stone Itchy and Scratchy

1031
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,740
in a cliff wall.

1032
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,860
And if you did have to take,

1033
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,700
if there was a separate helicopter ride

1034
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,740
that was the way that you got there.

1035
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,700
That would be, yes, fantastic.

1036
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,780
But where does that go?

1037
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:24,940
Is it extra, let's well,

1038
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:28,460
since I guess Monsters Inc was not an important enough

1039
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:32,820
project to blow up the very important,

1040
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,340
vibrant Star Wars launch bay area.

1041
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,460
Maybe that would be a good place

1042
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,980
to finally get rid of our beloved,

1043
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,820
whatever the fuck is there

1044
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:48,300
and build a specific slice of Simpsons.

1045
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,140
Yeah.

1046
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,260
Hollywood Studios is the only place

1047
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:54,180
that is such a mishmash in parks

1048
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,460
that that would actually feel like

1049
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,420
you could do something there.

1050
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,380
Which you kind of, I don't,

1051
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,700
I think maybe theme parks,

1052
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,100
maybe Disney parks need their mishmash.

1053
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,740
Islands of Adventure is also a mishmash.

1054
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,020
I think all the theme park brands need

1055
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,060
what is their mishmash brand to be a thin excuse

1056
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,940
to throw this thing in, which would make it DCA here.

1057
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:15,940
But DCA space seems like more at a premium

1058
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,220
than Disneyland space.

1059
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,300
Like all of the most recent announcements were DCA.

1060
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,100
People still tripping over themselves

1061
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,940
trying to figure out where's Coco, where's Avatar.

1062
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,220
I don't, I can't pretend to guess on either of those.

1063
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,140
Yeah.

1064
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,900
Would we blow up some of Tomorrowland for,

1065
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,500
the current Tomorrowland for Simpsons stuff?

1066
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,740
I guess.

1067
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,820
Only if they were like,

1068
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:39,260
we truly don't have any other ideas.

1069
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,100
Yeah.

1070
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,580
Is there anything at Disneyland

1071
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,620
that you would get rid of?

1072
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,500
For the Simpsons?

1073
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,340
As much as I love the good Simpsons.

1074
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,380
Just get rid of the, I mean, if I had to,

1075
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,580
I don't really feel, I don't know.

1076
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,660
I like Disneyland.

1077
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,740
Maybe I'd say no.

1078
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,420
If you wanted to, I don't really see the shows

1079
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,300
over in the Fantasyland theater.

1080
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,020
If you wanted to jam a little bit of Simpsons in there,

1081
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,500
maybe there's kind of a relationship

1082
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,060
with Toontown that makes sense.

1083
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:03,900
Yeah.

1084
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,860
But I don't know.

1085
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,700
I think that's weird.

1086
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,820
I think it's a little weird.

1087
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:11,740
Because they start in 2025 and then, so at Disney space,

1088
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,420
2032, the new Simpsons experience.

1089
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,820
I think really why I want it,

1090
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,980
I think maybe now that I'm thinking about it,

1091
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,700
the reason this question called to me

1092
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,340
is that I wouldn't make the call to put the Simpsons

1093
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,460
in a theme park right now.

1094
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,300
It wouldn't either.

1095
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,260
It wouldn't be on my top 10 list.

1096
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,100
No.

1097
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:29,940
And again, it's hard.

1098
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,580
I don't think that the current Simpsons situation

1099
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,620
has been lacking.

1100
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:38,420
I think it's a great, that's the Simpsons in the park.

1101
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,820
I think it's great.

1102
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,380
I've gotten to, I took my son on the ride.

1103
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:46,420
He got to, he's really into the Trias of Horror

1104
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:50,740
where all of the characters blow up,

1105
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,260
the like nuisance side of the road,

1106
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,980
like the pet boys and the donut guy blow up really big.

1107
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,620
And then they need Paul Anko to help write a jingle

1108
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,180
and just don't look and all that.

1109
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,100
So he loves that episode and then I got to take him

1110
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,580
and there is the real lard lad.

1111
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,500
And he got to eat one of those donuts.

1112
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,620
And like, I don't know.

1113
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,020
I just don't know what you're not getting

1114
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,020
from the current one.

1115
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,340
But you wouldn't want to just rebuild the current one.

1116
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,180
Right.

1117
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,020
And that's going away.

1118
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,980
I mean, this question is because that's going to go away.

1119
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,740
But ultimately, yeah, it makes me sad.

1120
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,580
I don't know.

1121
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,420
I guess I shouldn't have picked this question

1122
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,260
because I guess it's a bummer

1123
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,820
now that I think about the answer.

1124
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,540
Here's what I think.

1125
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,220
I love the Simpsons.

1126
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,980
Like nothing could be more in my bone marrow

1127
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,660
than the Simpsons is what like taught us

1128
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,380
to have like more mature comedy taste.

1129
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,500
There's still things from those early seasons

1130
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,540
that make me like laugh till I can't breathe.

1131
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,460
However, we've had a lot of Simpsons.

1132
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,860
It's been a long time.

1133
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,020
It's been a long time.

1134
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,100
Wait, hold on a second.

1135
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,380
Are you saying that in this culture,

1136
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,980
we should let something die?

1137
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,820
Maybe.

1138
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,540
We shouldn't inject formaldehyde into its veins

1139
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,540
to keep it perfect as the same as it's always been?

1140
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,980
There used to be a thing

1141
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,940
where when things ran their creative course,

1142
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,980
they were finally set free.

1143
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,900
I want every cast member of the show to be in their 90s

1144
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,140
to be wheezing their lines, their lines of dialogue.

1145
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,580
I want to hear the pain from the elderly cast members,

1146
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,900
which they are at this point.

1147
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,700
It's just, it's crazy.

1148
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,540
Yeah.

1149
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,380
So.

1150
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,020
Well, at least they've kept the quality up.

1151
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:29,020
You know, well, okay.

1152
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:32,460
The only thing that intrigues me

1153
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,220
and I don't even have a good pitch for it.

1154
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,380
If it's full like Fox animation land

1155
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,500
and you get your family guy and your Bob's Burgers

1156
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,340
all in a little bit.

1157
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,500
I think it would have to be that.

1158
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,940
And that seems crazy that I would pick that.

1159
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,780
Right, because I don't like big.

1160
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,620
I like Bob's Burgers.

1161
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,580
I've never really been a family guy person.

1162
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,620
I'm not anti-family guy,

1163
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,340
but I think I would pick that because it's new.

1164
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,180
Yeah, I agree.

1165
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,140
Before I would pick.

1166
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:55,980
It's interesting.

1167
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,180
It's more interesting and just a quick idea of it.

1168
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,020
Yeah, yeah.

1169
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:00,840
For some reason.

1170
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,680
And all the new ones, of course.

1171
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,500
Universal basic guys.

1172
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,420
Well, of course, yes.

1173
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,260
I'm talking about that too.

1174
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,220
They'll always have a little room

1175
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,380
for a new thing like that.

1176
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,220
Yes.

1177
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,060
That everyone knows.

1178
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,020
The new generation of animation domination.

1179
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,540
Is it still on?

1180
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,380
I think.

1181
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,900
Who knows?

1182
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,060
There's no way to know.

1183
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:17,900
There's no way to know.

1184
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,780
No one has prime time television to be able to check.

1185
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,620
Right.

1186
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,940
There was a lot of activity on this one.

1187
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,460
So I feel like I have a duty to answer it.

1188
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,300
Yeah.

1189
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,060
Aaron Abolt.

1190
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:35,060
WTF does Scott eat?

1191
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,220
I feel like we know so much about

1192
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,140
Mike and Jason's eating habits.

1193
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,820
And we also know Scott sometimes finds their ways absurd.

1194
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,620
But if it's not too personal, can we get more details?

1195
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:48,300
This question has been burning a hole in my chest.

1196
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,300
Literally because I'm approaching 40

1197
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,660
and acid reflux is kicking my ass.

1198
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:53,820
Please help.

1199
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,180
Apologies, Aaron.

1200
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,100
Yeah.

1201
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,740
Well, my dry meter is going off because like,

1202
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:02,420
yeah, I don't, I do eat a little bit boring.

1203
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,740
I don't dislike what I eat.

1204
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:08,100
I'm like, I'm satisfied by my meals all the time,

1205
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,140
but I don't, it's true.

1206
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:13,540
I don't do the food indulgences that you and Jason do.

1207
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,380
Right.

1208
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,460
I think this makes me kind of lacking

1209
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,820
in character for the show.

1210
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,100
I think people find their way in,

1211
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,340
in terms of choosing who's my guy.

1212
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,180
Right.

1213
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:28,180
In your guy's love of sweets and taco bell and the like.

1214
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,260
But I think some of it is,

1215
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:33,020
I've been with Aaron for so long now

1216
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,900
and Aaron, Aaron like truly eats the same salad

1217
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,220
every single day.

1218
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,060
Yeah.

1219
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,260
And I think it's, some of it's just force of habit

1220
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,420
and some of it's health and some of it's like

1221
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:47,220
anti-inflammatory, like chasing that

1222
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,140
for the sake of her body.

1223
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:52,420
And I think she's rubbed off on me in the food taste

1224
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,260
where I'm like, yeah, I just don't eat like crazy

1225
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,100
stuff all the time.

1226
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,140
Like what did you eat today?

1227
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,540
We did make it out to lunch today.

1228
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,780
So it was a little bit different.

1229
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,500
But I, but at like a typical, it is, okay.

1230
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,220
None, no cereals for me.

1231
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,060
It's not cereals.

1232
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,900
That's like a big round of starch and stuff.

1233
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,100
I do eat a lot of like bread and carbs.

1234
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,380
I don't, I don't consider myself in like

1235
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,340
great health, great shape, but I will say

1236
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:22,060
I don't have the tummy troubles that y'all seem to have

1237
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,380
or the weird other bits of fallout from it.

1238
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,380
To be fair, mine is all stress related.

1239
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,220
Oh, okay.

1240
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,220
Anxiety.

1241
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:29,660
Yours is different.

1242
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,780
Yeah, guess your stomach started hurting

1243
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,620
after three fucking weeks of fire.

1244
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:34,860
Yeah.

1245
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,940
After seeing your daughter bend in a weird way

1246
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:37,780
at the fun playground.

1247
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:38,980
Well, that helped, that helped,

1248
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,740
but it wasn't the main cause.

1249
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,940
I think, I feel like I try to do like a lot of fats

1250
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,180
that are like natural and good for you.

1251
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:50,460
It's eggs and avocado on toast every day.

1252
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:55,460
It's then a lot of like, like protein and rice.

1253
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,580
That's what like it'll be.

1254
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:00,980
It'll be tofu on rice or it'll be poke.

1255
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:03,220
I guess a lot of fish is in there.

1256
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,380
Like turkey sandwiches happen a lot,

1257
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,060
but then, but like done with like,

1258
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,420
you know what I really try to avoid is like crazy sauces.

1259
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,220
I really like the Jersey Mike's method

1260
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,580
of like olive oil vinegar.

1261
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:18,180
You know, that feels like nice and natural and simple.

1262
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:21,060
Again, I'm maybe boring myself as I say this,

1263
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,940
but I want to answer this question

1264
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,100
and figure out what it is.

1265
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,380
I think like ultimately,

1266
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:28,860
I think you got to chase your indulgence, right?

1267
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,900
You got to, there's like the thing

1268
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,820
that you know you got to carve out.

1269
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:34,420
And for me, that is admittedly not dessert.

1270
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,860
I do not have the strongest sweet tooth.

1271
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,740
I eat plenty of dessert, but it's not a like must for me.

1272
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:43,180
But what is like, at least like the indulgence I know

1273
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,500
that I'd like to carve out is drinking.

1274
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,580
It's like, which isn't much at this point.

1275
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,180
It's like, I'd like a beer or a glass of wine

1276
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:54,220
or a cocktail most days, I would say.

1277
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:56,300
So I try, so knowing that and knowing myself

1278
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,540
and knowing that that's what I want,

1279
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:01,260
I think I try to keep the food sort of reasonable

1280
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:04,420
and boring so that that's not like extra calories

1281
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,820
on top of an already gigantic calorie day.

1282
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:08,660
Does that make sense?

1283
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,980
Is it interesting at all?

1284
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,140
Well, I don't want to put you on the spot about that.

1285
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,740
I don't want to put you in a position to say no.

1286
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,180
No, I wouldn't, I won't comment.

1287
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,180
I won't say no comment on it.

1288
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:21,100
But for the purposes of a haywalled episode

1289
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,860
about the hosts where they're getting asked questions.

1290
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,060
Why not get to know us?

1291
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,980
I think really the difference of the three,

1292
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:30,140
I believe maybe this is, maybe I'm patting myself

1293
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:30,980
on the back too much.

1294
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:34,140
I believe it's a Venn diagram and I am right in the middle

1295
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:38,140
because like, for instance, what I have had to eat today

1296
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:43,140
is some chocolate chip cookies.

1297
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:48,140
I have had a wild cherry like cream soda zero soda.

1298
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,420
See, that's another thing.

1299
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,940
And no, I don't mean to, well, look, in this case,

1300
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,140
I don't mean to shade.

1301
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:57,220
Throughout the City Walk saga, I meant a lot of shade

1302
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,780
because y'all learn nothing.

1303
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,260
But that is, for myself, I don't do sodas

1304
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,700
and I don't do like sugary milkshake coffee drinks.

1305
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:08,300
It's only coffee in the morning and tea in the afternoon.

1306
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,340
That's it.

1307
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:11,220
That's the lowest calorie you can do.

1308
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,460
And I'm really regular about that.

1309
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,740
I need to do that at the time that I do it

1310
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,100
or I will be off.

1311
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:19,620
So like very, very, like really routine oriented.

1312
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:24,620
But also today, I had a almost exclusively vegetable smoothie

1313
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:25,820
and a kale salad.

1314
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,940
So I feel like I'm in the middle.

1315
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,460
I take wild, so the reason Jason and I get along with her

1316
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:32,100
because we both like the same junk food,

1317
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,780
but I do think I also can,

1318
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:38,660
you'll find a real food item once in a while in there.

1319
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:39,980
But I mean, there's gonna be days

1320
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:43,580
when I indulge more than not.

1321
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:44,420
But I like-

1322
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:45,620
I'll say this, I think in the same run,

1323
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:46,940
and this might've been the points episode,

1324
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:49,900
which got into a lot of food stuff as well.

1325
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:53,380
You got into a big run about like using the Taco Bell app

1326
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,580
to calorie count.

1327
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,060
Yes, yes, very exciting.

1328
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:56,900
Mike, Mike.

1329
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:57,740
Yes, go ahead.

1330
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,700
You're an adult.

1331
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,660
You know Taco Bell's not good for you.

1332
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:04,060
You think you can Taco Bell your way to health?

1333
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,460
I put, well, health is a different story

1334
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,060
than just losing weight.

1335
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:08,900
Okay.

1336
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,540
You're losing weight though?

1337
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,620
100%, if you calorie count works for most people,

1338
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,420
whether that's the healthiest way to lose weight or not.

1339
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,260
Okay.

1340
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,260
A different debate, but absolutely,

1341
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,060
if we wanna get in, maybe this is too dry,

1342
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,940
but you can put in your height and weight

1343
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:25,460
and you can roughly calculate how many calories

1344
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,660
you should be eating a day.

1345
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,860
But isn't there any, and I'm no expert in this,

1346
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,620
isn't there also something to like calories

1347
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,860
that are helpful to your body?

1348
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:33,700
Again, health-

1349
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,540
That aren't like trash?

1350
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,660
Health and weight are two different things.

1351
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:37,500
Okay.

1352
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,340
So I'm just saying-

1353
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:40,460
You are only arguing for the weight thing.

1354
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:41,300
Right.

1355
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,140
So I'm just saying that-

1356
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,540
You do know that Taco Bell is dog shit for you, correct?

1357
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:46,540
Yeah, but like, yes, of course.

1358
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:49,580
But it's worse than like some like shitty

1359
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,940
store-bought chicken McNuggets or chicken nuggets.

1360
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:52,780
I don't know.

1361
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,180
It's both, they're both bad.

1362
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:55,300
That sounds bad too.

1363
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,140
Yeah.

1364
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,140
So, but no, no, I'm just talking about calorie counting

1365
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:58,980
if you're trying to lose weight.

1366
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,060
You know, fast food wise, I will,

1367
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:02,180
the one, if I let myself start to dip,

1368
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:05,580
I will like chicken tenders, chicken sandwiches,

1369
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:06,860
the like Chick-fil-A side of things,

1370
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,500
I will start going that way for sure.

1371
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,420
I have to like make that a wall that I don't start,

1372
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:14,340
you know, then that becomes that I do that all the time.

1373
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,180
Right.

1374
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,940
Yeah, no, so I'm not, health and weight is different

1375
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,180
because you can be really skinny, but unhealthy.

1376
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,020
That is, that is true.

1377
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:21,860
Yes.

1378
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:22,700
I've had periods of that.

1379
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:23,740
Yeah, when I was a teenager,

1380
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:25,300
I was just like weight fishly thin,

1381
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,700
but you could like, the breeze would knock me over.

1382
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,540
Right.

1383
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:29,700
That was not a good way to be.

1384
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:30,540
Yeah, no.

1385
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:34,420
I've like been in better shape with more weight for sure.

1386
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:35,540
But I would argue if you're having,

1387
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,100
if you're like doing that,

1388
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,340
you could still have Taco Bell once in a while

1389
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:43,220
and be like calculated about it and still have your fun.

1390
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:45,700
And we, as Jason, I said, still have your goo,

1391
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:48,700
which is really what you go to Taco Bell for is the goo.

1392
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:49,540
Well, it's what I was saying.

1393
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,180
I don't do a lot of goos, I think.

1394
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,020
Right, you're not a goo guy.

1395
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:52,860
The sauces are really where-

1396
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:55,260
Jason are big goo guys, we love goo.

1397
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,100
Yeah.

1398
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,020
All the different kinds of goo.

1399
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,540
I also think, and this is what I'm saying,

1400
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:00,460
like is where I have to just stay out of a lot of food

1401
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,660
things because I do think it makes you guys lovable to be.

1402
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:05,180
It makes you like, I'm not a good guest for dough boys

1403
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,380
in a way for like, because I don't like do a lot of that.

1404
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,220
Right.

1405
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:12,100
And I'm not trying to be like pretentious or like,

1406
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,780
and I don't even think I eat that great,

1407
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:16,620
but I just, I know what I do,

1408
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:19,020
and maybe now I'm going back to CityWalk stuff,

1409
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,740
if something makes me feel bad, I never do it again.

1410
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,100
And that is not, that's not you guys.

1411
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,900
It's clearly not Weiger.

1412
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,540
No, no, no, no.

1413
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:31,540
Which makes you more fun characters to hear

1414
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:32,740
the travails of.

1415
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,460
But then there's like, I will be,

1416
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,300
the problem is sometimes you're just so validated.

1417
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,500
Like I had wanted Chili's for months.

1418
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,980
I just, cause there's not a Chili's around here.

1419
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:43,300
And I went to Chili's with my friends a couple of weeks ago

1420
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,660
and that meal was fantastic.

1421
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,500
It was so delicious.

1422
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,980
Well, has Chili's turned a corner?

1423
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,260
Is that what we're catching?

1424
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,740
Is Chili's is the quality?

1425
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,900
It's been on an upswing for a while,

1426
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,420
but it's all still frozen food that they put in a microwave

1427
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:58,300
in the back for, but for whatever reason,

1428
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:01,500
their shitty frozen food really microwaves well,

1429
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,420
or at least the plate I got.

1430
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,260
So once.

1431
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,620
That's strange to, I mean, you enjoyed it

1432
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,780
and I can't take it away from you,

1433
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,180
but the idea of like, this is a,

1434
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,540
hey, my compliments to the chef.

1435
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,140
He really microwaved it well.

1436
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:12,980
Right.

1437
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:16,700
The microwave. Excellent chef's kiss, microwaving.

1438
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,900
Maybe they call it head microwaver

1439
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,780
and it's not even a chef.

1440
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:20,860
Maybe there's not qualification.

1441
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,660
Like they don't need that qualification

1442
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,940
to work in some of these chain restaurants.

1443
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:28,100
They just need to be a whiz at the microwave.

1444
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,500
They just know which setting.

1445
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,340
Gotta know your numbers.

1446
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,460
Which power level, right.

1447
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,060
To microwave the ribs at.

1448
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,020
They might even like not even like,

1449
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:37,220
let's get, let's get having to know math out of there.

1450
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,340
Just like make your own set of Chili's buttons.

1451
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:44,060
Just put ribs on this one, burger on this one.

1452
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,700
I hope they're not just microwaving the burger, but maybe.

1453
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:47,900
They might be.

1454
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,820
Some places might, you would be shocked probably

1455
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:51,340
on what some places do.

1456
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:53,580
I mean, we're five years away from a robot cooking

1457
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,980
all the chain restaurant meals anyway, I think.

1458
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:56,820
Five to 10 years.

1459
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:57,820
They're trying really hard.

1460
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:02,820
AI and robots just will shit out delicious Chili's ribs.

1461
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,260
No one will notice, sadly.

1462
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,780
AI will make the Chili's ribs and AI will produce

1463
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:10,620
the voices of Mr. Burns, Smithers, and Principal Skinner.

1464
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:14,060
I was just talking to a friend of the show, Nick Mundy,

1465
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:16,660
on the phone today and I said that very thing.

1466
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,820
I said, I wonder why it hasn't happened yet.

1467
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,020
Yeah, yeah.

1468
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,260
But maybe they had it there.

1469
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,020
But you know it is being worked on.

1470
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,020
I don't think there's, I think there's no question

1471
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,420
they are exploring this.

1472
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:27,580
These are some older.

1473
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,420
Yes.

1474
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:31,940
Can I stay on the name that you just said and say,

1475
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:34,220
because there's also questions I would put in the,

1476
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,340
well, this is a dad question too.

1477
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:38,340
And there's also kind of a show business question.

1478
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,380
Sure.

1479
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,660
Not like Ethel Merman, show business,

1480
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:42,620
a business of our show.

1481
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:43,660
Of course, yeah.

1482
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:46,140
Kevin De La Rosa, as a fellow girl dad,

1483
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:49,740
will Mike ever give us a Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique review?

1484
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,980
And I don't believe that you've been, from what I've heard,

1485
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,660
and she's maybe a little young for that,

1486
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:54,940
but I think we've talked about doing

1487
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,380
Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique with Nick Mundy,

1488
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:00,020
because he has been, because he is also a girl dad.

1489
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:00,860
We did.

1490
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:04,060
He has asked if he could do Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique.

1491
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:07,060
So that's a possibility of all the guests.

1492
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:09,380
Boy, you think you know a guy, huh?

1493
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:13,540
You think he's a tough guy, bully, mean man, bad man?

1494
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,820
Then he shows up, does Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique.

1495
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,380
Unbelievable.

1496
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:18,460
Yeah, I forgot about that too.

1497
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:21,060
I think he did it last year, which I was at,

1498
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,780
I went to visit him at Disneyland.

1499
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:27,700
Here's another, this is like an internal show thing,

1500
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,300
but why the hell not?

1501
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,340
Luis Miziara.

1502
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:34,340
Both of you guys have produced great music for the show.

1503
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:36,140
What software do you guys use?

1504
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:37,740
I'm assuming Logic Pro X.

1505
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:39,060
Are there any virtual instruments,

1506
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,740
including VSTs, plugins, or sample libraries

1507
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:42,580
that you prefer?

1508
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:45,980
Andrew Coth, the musician, seconds this.

1509
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:50,420
I'll show my cards and say that, clearly not,

1510
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,220
because I don't know what some of those words are.

1511
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,740
I don't really know what a VST is.

1512
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:56,420
I recently did, see now, I have contributed

1513
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:57,620
a lot of songs to the show,

1514
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:00,020
but it's usually like an existing karaoke track,

1515
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,020
not something built from the ground up,

1516
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:04,500
which does hurt the, you know,

1517
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:08,500
an eventual vinyl release of PTR music.

1518
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:14,180
I did send you guys that Beastie Boys-esque song

1519
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,860
from Mickey's Nutcracker,

1520
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:17,260
where I had the idea late at night,

1521
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:18,500
I'm like, how can I crank this out?

1522
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,660
Maybe I could, and that was just all,

1523
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:25,460
that I did like, I did like musical typing on GarageBand.

1524
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,860
I like found some GarageBand beat,

1525
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:31,020
just like kind of mixed it to seem more like that track.

1526
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:34,220
I like played a bad guitar, just using like,

1527
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:37,060
just pressing the keyboard FFFD,

1528
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:38,940
and somehow like threw some filters on it

1529
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,140
until it didn't sound like shit.

1530
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,700
So that was a rare from the ground up,

1531
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,300
but that was just like cruddy GarageBand,

1532
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,820
because I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

1533
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:47,420
Mike, the actual musician, who's done our theme songs,

1534
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,500
and then a bunch of other stuff,

1535
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,540
the McGruff stuff, and then other things here and there.

1536
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,820
The custom themes, when we do a theme,

1537
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,620
they're always so delightful.

1538
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,340
Hey, why not pat yourself on the back,

1539
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:59,700
since it was asked anyway,

1540
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,580
you wanna take us into your musical process.

1541
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:06,500
I am just, I do a lot of things, like I do like,

1542
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,460
when it comes to technical things,

1543
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:11,860
I don't really know what I'm doing,

1544
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:14,940
when it comes to like editing the actual show,

1545
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,540
editing music.

1546
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,500
I am using Logic, that is correct,

1547
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,300
or sometimes GarageBand, but generally Logic for Apple.

1548
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,340
And obviously I know kind of what I'm doing,

1549
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:27,220
but I'm like, when it comes to like mastering or mixing,

1550
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,300
I am still, I just, I should have somebody

1551
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,620
who's a professional do any of this.

1552
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,220
People like with, you know, it needs to,

1553
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:35,060
that's like a PhD level thing to truly understand.

1554
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:38,620
The McGruff songs that I made, they killed me.

1555
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:40,940
I was trying to listen to them in the car,

1556
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,100
to try to figure out like,

1557
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,220
cause stuff sounds different.

1558
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,740
Like when you're, what I understand is

1559
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:46,580
when you're trying to mix or master things,

1560
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:49,260
you're supposed to do it in a studio with big speakers.

1561
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:50,580
You're not supposed to do in your headphones,

1562
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,100
cause that's a different sound.

1563
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,740
You're supposed to like mix or master things.

1564
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:57,260
So they sound good coming out of two big speakers.

1565
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:58,100
I didn't have that.

1566
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,140
Like I didn't even have two big speakers.

1567
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:01,220
So I was doing it wrong.

1568
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:02,620
I was like mixing headphones and I was like, all right,

1569
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,540
well, what did I try to make in the car?

1570
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:06,620
And I'm like messing with the levels and you truly,

1571
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:07,940
you really can lose your mind

1572
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:08,900
when you don't know what you're doing,

1573
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,060
which I still do not know what I'm doing.

1574
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,500
So.

1575
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,060
But virtual instruments and stuff.

1576
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:15,900
That's a good question.

1577
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,660
Cause you've ended up producing some sounds

1578
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:21,340
that are like not like an instrument that you own.

1579
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,700
You've covered a lot of genres

1580
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,980
between all of these little custom themes.

1581
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,420
Well, I can play, I can play the guitar.

1582
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:30,780
I can play, I mean, I know chords on a piano,

1583
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,980
so I can play little stuff.

1584
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,980
Generally what I do is like if it's guitar,

1585
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:35,460
I'm just playing it.

1586
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:38,700
I didn't play the little fast Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,

1587
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,060
like on the downtown Disney.

1588
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:44,460
I cheated and used the keyboard for that.

1589
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:45,540
Cause you can control it.

1590
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:47,380
You can move, you can slide those notes around.

1591
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,220
Exactly.

1592
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:49,380
So anytime I'm doing the keyboard,

1593
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:50,700
I will like do a little fix.

1594
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,540
You do a little fix.

1595
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:53,060
Cause you can drag those notes

1596
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,940
to make them a little bit more in time.

1597
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:56,780
Sure.

1598
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:57,620
But like the McGruff,

1599
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:01,100
like I'm usually if it's a guitar and playing it,

1600
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:04,260
there's a pretty, I'm pretty proud of the guitar solo.

1601
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:07,860
If you haven't heard my McGruff song on the apps,

1602
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:08,940
the hookup app song.

1603
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,100
I have to remind myself.

1604
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:11,540
I have to admit, I don't offhand know

1605
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:12,940
that I wish I could compliment you

1606
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:14,020
on the specific guitar tone.

1607
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:16,460
That's the slow jammy McGruff song.

1608
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,460
I'm very proud of the baseline on that song.

1609
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,380
I'm very proud of the guitar solo on that.

1610
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:24,140
The baseline is just from the keyboard.

1611
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:26,020
So I kind of just made that up on the keyboard

1612
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:28,060
and then did a couple fixes on it.

1613
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,700
You know what I enjoyed was giving you

1614
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,700
a little musical note on the theme

1615
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,340
of the City Walk Orlando saga.

1616
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:35,180
Because I was like,

1617
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,580
it should be like elevated from the first one.

1618
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:40,620
Cause it's a song that we've used before.

1619
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:42,020
So they're their little plus ups

1620
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:44,100
that kind of like kick it into over to,

1621
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,380
which Zach himself did.

1622
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:46,900
Like you were already like producing it higher.

1623
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,220
I was like, there should be some little bat,

1624
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:51,180
quick dumb little guitar line,

1625
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:52,820
which I thought because I really like

1626
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,540
how my heart will go on,

1627
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:58,420
has exactly one guitar part only.

1628
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:02,300
And it's just the one thing it's like,

1629
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:05,340
this ridiculous song also has a guitar part,

1630
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,020
even though that's not the musical palette

1631
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:07,860
of the rest of it.

1632
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:08,940
I've always loved it.

1633
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:10,460
So thank you for taking that note.

1634
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:11,940
I felt like I got to contribute

1635
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:12,780
and you played it well.

1636
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:13,620
It's funny cause you just said that

1637
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:15,540
and I completely forgot that's in there.

1638
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:17,380
But I now remember what you're talking about.

1639
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:18,860
And a lot of the vocal stuff, Zach just,

1640
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:22,220
Zach is like, as far as just anything

1641
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,940
Zach's ever been involved in musically,

1642
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:26,460
whether the McGruff songs or that song,

1643
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:28,340
he does it in seven minutes.

1644
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,180
Wow.

1645
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,660
I mean, he's the only person I know

1646
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,940
who claims he does no inner monologue,

1647
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:36,660
who has no actual voice in his head of self doubt.

1648
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:37,500
Really?

1649
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:40,220
That's what he's saying.

1650
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:41,060
Yeah, that's right.

1651
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,100
And most people have some voice going like,

1652
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,460
don't do this man.

1653
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,900
So literally sometimes you like send,

1654
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,060
I go, hey, could you help me out with this?

1655
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:47,900
Yeah, blah, blah, blah.

1656
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:50,060
Okay, 10 minutes later it comes back

1657
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:50,900
and you're like, whoa, okay.

1658
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,060
Damn, well that's very musician, I think.

1659
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,100
To like just kind of go off instinct

1660
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,220
and yeah, cause he just like sent you the parts

1661
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:58,700
you didn't even like record with him, huh?

1662
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:01,100
Like, that's very classic.

1663
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,540
I'm surprised how much stuff I read about

1664
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:03,740
where like, oh, they didn't even,

1665
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:04,700
those guys never met.

1666
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,220
They just like sent parts around.

1667
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,660
I always think that's cool

1668
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:09,460
that we're at that point technologically.

1669
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:10,580
It's all, it's interesting

1670
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:12,260
cause like you hear even old songs

1671
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:15,020
where like Springsteen or whatever,

1672
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:18,020
they all have like parts hanging around for songs.

1673
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:20,940
They have just like pieces,

1674
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:23,620
like they have a bridge, they have a chorus

1675
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,460
and then they're just like plugging and playing things.

1676
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:27,300
Yeah.

1677
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,780
And that's obviously before they had things saved

1678
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:30,300
to like logic or whatever,

1679
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:32,140
but you'd have like little pieces of it.

1680
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,900
Some little idea that maybe doesn't pay off for 10 years.

1681
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:38,460
Yeah, so, and which I do have a bunch of things

1682
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:40,300
like that from decades.

1683
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:41,140
It's like us with the episodes.

1684
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,460
It's pretty much as cool as like,

1685
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:46,020
Bruce had this lick, sit around.

1686
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,940
It's like, you know, Joe Walsh just started playing

1687
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:53,500
let this lick and then it became Life in the Fast Lane.

1688
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,700
And that's like how we just like said the phrase

1689
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,300
Harbor Hoedown and then maybe someday

1690
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,260
do Harbor, actual Harbor Hoedown.

1691
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:01,180
Yeah, we are a lot like Joe Walsh.

1692
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:04,900
I have to, any amount of comparing yourselves to musicians

1693
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,860
I have to soften our coolness.

1694
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:09,540
You have to admit, it's funny what you're saying

1695
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,020
and I agree we should be self-deprecating

1696
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,020
but you are serious.

1697
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:13,860
It's true.

1698
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:15,620
I mean, yes, you could take everything I said

1699
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:17,340
and say it and not that voice.

1700
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:20,260
You're doing a lot of that too where you're like,

1701
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,780
actually what I'm saying, I believe.

1702
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:25,980
I'm not saying it's as important as Life in the Fast Lane

1703
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:27,380
is to American culture.

1704
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:30,940
We probably all have a lot of like wanting to,

1705
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:32,380
and I'm flattered, some of these questions,

1706
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:33,220
I don't know if we'll make it to all of them,

1707
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:35,220
but some are about like creative process

1708
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,300
and the stuff that we do.

1709
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,140
And there's always a part of me that wants to answer

1710
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:40,500
and then there's a part that feels like it's indulgent

1711
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:43,300
but the fact that we got the question,

1712
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:47,780
this also reminds me in terms of like comparing ourselves

1713
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:49,700
to other art forms, I saw this question.

1714
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:52,340
Michael Hillman, have any of you guys considered

1715
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:53,980
becoming stand-up comedians?

1716
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:56,580
You guys are all so funny and have great comedic timing

1717
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:59,060
and that's a nice thing to say but I do find stand-up

1718
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:01,300
to be like pretty different than, you know,

1719
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,860
probably like maybe both of us being interested in comedy

1720
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,980
in high school or whatever, maybe we thought stand-up

1721
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:08,140
but it's, you know, we went in pretty different.

1722
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:11,700
That's just not, that's a very specific mindset to be in

1723
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,500
but I bring that up less to say that and more to say,

1724
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,820
I guarantee, if we read this question and Jason was here,

1725
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:21,020
Jason would say, well, stand-ups are America's truth teller

1726
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:23,740
because he says it every time.

1727
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,180
If we talk about stand-up, that's one of those.

1728
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:27,020
Yes, yeah.

1729
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:29,940
Well, no, yeah, because it like pissed him off years ago

1730
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:32,340
that people were saying that in like early Trump era

1731
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:34,580
and now he says it every single time.

1732
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:36,620
Audience, be on the lookout for some of those always,

1733
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,860
Jason's, that's one and another one is

1734
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,180
Manchurian candidate activation.

1735
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:43,020
Yes, that is one.

1736
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:43,860
He said that.

1737
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:46,500
You could build the Jason AI right now.

1738
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,820
You could build Jason AI.

1739
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:50,780
It's even easier than Mr. Burns as long as you.

1740
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:54,660
And then how do you fire that AI up

1741
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:56,820
maybe with a Manchurian candidate activation.

1742
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:58,420
That's right.

1743
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:00,300
Is there anything, I think you might've been right about

1744
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:03,020
that we should make sure we do theme park oriented things

1745
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:06,380
as much as I am veering to,

1746
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:08,460
oh, wait, this is theme park, but it's also us.

1747
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:10,540
Unless you have one that you're excited about.

1748
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:11,820
You know what, I have like a quick one

1749
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:13,500
maybe for the end if you wanna do that.

1750
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,500
Maybe you do your theme park one.

1751
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,340
Unless it's the same one.

1752
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:17,980
Well, it's also, I mean, it's kind of yours.

1753
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:20,500
It's also about you, Matt.

1754
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,500
I recently went to Disneyland for the first time

1755
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,700
since 2019, meaning I finally got to ride

1756
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,820
Rise of the Resistance and Runaway Railway.

1757
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:30,300
And I have to say, I felt very sufficiently jostled.

1758
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:33,380
Runaway Railway even literally fucked up my hip

1759
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:36,940
lining up with Mike's wish to be fucked up by the rides.

1760
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:40,180
So how much more can he really want these rides

1761
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:43,100
to jerk us around to the point where he has to mention

1762
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,500
it every time either ride comes up?

1763
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,780
Also, I'm a decade younger than Mike,

1764
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:50,020
but maybe this just shows how youthful he is.

1765
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:53,940
Well, you got some compliments in the mix there.

1766
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:54,780
This is true.

1767
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:57,420
I have discovered as you've brought this up over the years

1768
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:00,940
that people do seem to have trouble wrapping their heads

1769
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:02,940
around your desire to be.

1770
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:04,780
And if I could say it the way that you say it,

1771
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:06,620
because it's not quite, I think so you get some Chicago

1772
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:09,060
out in that it's always like fucked up

1773
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:10,980
because I want to be fucked up.

1774
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,860
I want to be fucked up by these rides.

1775
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:17,180
Yeah, I do find this to be an odd opinion

1776
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:18,020
and I agree with it.

1777
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,340
I do sometimes go on these rides and I'm like,

1778
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:22,340
yeah, I'm fine with that level of, but it's,

1779
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:25,380
that's my taste and that's Matt's taste.

1780
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:26,220
I don't know.

1781
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:27,060
I don't know what question I'm posing

1782
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:28,820
besides his questions, I guess.

1783
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:32,540
Maybe I've, I don't guess I don't need to be fucked up

1784
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:34,580
on Mickey and Minnie's runaway railway.

1785
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:36,020
Let me be clear.

1786
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:39,140
I don't think, I mean, maybe I've suggested some plus up

1787
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:42,260
that would like move me around, jostle me more on that,

1788
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:45,700
but that's not my primary concern on that ride.

1789
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:48,860
I don't need to come out with a concussion

1790
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:51,460
when I'm in Daisy's dance class.

1791
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:53,580
That is though the most aggressive part of the ride

1792
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,340
because that's probably where the hip.

1793
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:56,180
It's shocking.

1794
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:58,220
Well, there's other, I think you get like blown around

1795
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:00,460
a little bit and you do kind of a whirlwind, you know.

1796
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:02,980
But like you really like jerk hard to the left and right

1797
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:04,900
and that could knock your hip out of place.

1798
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,500
I feel like when you're doing that.

1799
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:07,980
Yeah.

1800
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:10,940
So yeah, I don't know.

1801
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,940
Rise and Resist, I just, I like the feeling

1802
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:17,100
of being under duress on some of these rides.

1803
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:21,060
And so you're already a person who stresses your own body

1804
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:24,140
into like weird welts popping up.

1805
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:24,980
Right.

1806
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:27,580
And yet be in on top of that, you need to like,

1807
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:31,700
the ride needs to like bear down on you with stress.

1808
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:34,340
Well, I think maybe I've said this before on the show,

1809
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:35,460
forgive me if I have,

1810
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:39,460
but I think it comes back to like certain properties,

1811
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:42,180
certain movies, things I like.

1812
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:44,740
When you would play with the figures as kids,

1813
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,900
you like Star Wars figures, you'd have two figures

1814
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:49,340
and you'd go, you'd like kind of close your mouth.

1815
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:51,860
You kind of would almost play in a way

1816
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:54,180
that you would make yourself a little delirious

1817
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:55,100
or disoriented.

1818
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:58,700
Like I used to love either playing with figures

1819
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:01,220
or just pretending I was in a movie or TV show

1820
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:03,340
where like, oh my God, we got to get out of here.

1821
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:05,020
We're getting to the ship, we're getting to this

1822
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:06,420
and like hurl myself on the bed.

1823
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,340
Now I guess I'm a lot, this is where my daughter

1824
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:09,180
is becoming me as well.

1825
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:10,980
And what would your mom say when you did that?

1826
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:13,020
Well, she wouldn't see, she would be out of the room.

1827
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:14,180
And do it behind closed doors.

1828
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:16,500
Yeah, and I would like jump on the bed.

1829
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:19,540
I loved, I would get scared when like,

1830
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:23,140
I've said this before, like a base would become under siege,

1831
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:25,860
like, oh no, Shredder's in the sewer or something.

1832
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:28,420
We got to get out of here before like the first turtle movie,

1833
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:30,860
they get invaded by the Foot Clan.

1834
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:34,820
So I always like, I think there was a visceral thing

1835
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:37,140
that would accompany me liking Star Wars

1836
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:40,340
or other TV and movies I like.

1837
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:42,300
And Mickey and Minnie weren't necessarily

1838
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:45,500
one of these properties that I wanted to feel like,

1839
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:48,020
oh my God, we got to get out of here or we're going to die.

1840
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:49,220
But Star Wars is.

1841
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:51,860
But Star Wars is, Turtles is,

1842
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:55,420
Indiana Jones is, so I think specifically when I say

1843
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:57,740
I want it to fuck me up, I do mean like,

1844
01:06:57,740 --> 01:07:01,860
I'm missing that like action figure feeling,

1845
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:05,180
that playing, jumping around, getting jostled.

1846
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:08,100
It doesn't need to be like Indiana Jones or Transformers

1847
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,540
where I don't need to vibrate.

1848
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:13,540
So I guess I shouldn't always just say fucked up

1849
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:16,940
when I'm calling for something different.

1850
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:20,780
I should say though, I want to feel like some more

1851
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:22,380
kind of thrill on it.

1852
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:25,860
I want to feel, I love a feeling of thrill,

1853
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:27,780
like it's a little out of control.

1854
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:28,620
Sure.

1855
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:31,420
But does not the drop, the drop.

1856
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:33,020
I listened to the episode with Jess

1857
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:34,660
where she was saying exactly this.

1858
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:36,420
And she said, what about the drop?

1859
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:39,660
And you were like, yeah, it was the most deflated yeah.

1860
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,420
I'm not that, the drop is fine.

1861
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:42,420
I don't hate the drop.

1862
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:43,740
I enjoy going to drop.

1863
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:44,860
Drop doesn't do much for me.

1864
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:45,700
Wow.

1865
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,260
Because I do, Guardians is a drop, that's a drop.

1866
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:50,060
This is like four feet.

1867
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:52,540
But I think the surprise, I mean,

1868
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:54,420
you only get the surprise the first time.

1869
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:55,260
It's fun.

1870
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:56,740
But I still get a little rush.

1871
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:59,500
I forget that you got to go up on that elevator by the.

1872
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,580
It's not as big as the Hagrid's drop.

1873
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:04,940
It's not as big as Guardians, obviously, or Tower of Terror.

1874
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:07,300
But I think it's a move that you don't think

1875
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:09,220
this ride vehicle has in its arsenal.

1876
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:10,060
It is fun.

1877
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:12,060
It's very quick.

1878
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:14,580
It's just, if it was a longer, if it took longer,

1879
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:15,700
I'm not saying it's bad.

1880
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:19,500
I'm just saying that's not going to do it for me

1881
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,180
as far as giving me that thing.

1882
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:25,900
And I've said before, it could completely convince me

1883
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:28,740
of its great, it is great, right?

1884
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:31,180
But it could completely make me love it

1885
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:35,260
if it had more warm moments, Star Wars moments.

1886
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:36,580
Like that thing that never got built

1887
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,540
with the Yoda and Dagobah, then you take off.

1888
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:39,740
Stuff like that.

1889
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:42,780
Like things that give me a different feeling.

1890
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:43,860
I don't need just a thrill.

1891
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:44,940
I also need love.

1892
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:46,500
I need a feeling of love.

1893
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:49,700
Well, that makes this other question extremely related.

1894
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:53,100
Teddy K, hello to two of my three best boys.

1895
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:53,700
Thank you.

1896
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:57,980
I have an FMK for Mike with regards

1897
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:01,140
to qualities of a ride.

1898
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:02,980
So fwock, marry, kill.

1899
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:07,980
Seeing your friends, fwocking you up, intimacy.

1900
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:08,820
Wait, hold on.

1901
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:10,780
Wait, these are wildly.

1902
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:12,180
It's kind of confusing.

1903
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:14,660
Three qualities that you love and need in rides.

1904
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:17,300
Seeing your friends, fwocking you up, intimacy.

1905
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,140
But you gotta kill one, you gotta fwock one,

1906
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:19,980
you gotta marry one.

1907
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:22,940
Oh my God, this is a wild question.

1908
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:24,380
Who asked this?

1909
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:25,220
Teddy K.

1910
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:26,620
Teddy Maniac.

1911
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:31,500
Let's see, pure thrills I love.

1912
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,580
I mean, Velocicoaster I go on and on about.

1913
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:37,340
So I do love pure thrills.

1914
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:40,620
That means fwocking you up, I guess.

1915
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:45,420
But seeing my friends and intimacy.

1916
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:48,460
Intimacy, of course, the optimist prime moment

1917
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:50,060
is what that's referencing.

1918
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:52,820
All three of these take place, of course, in Transformers.

1919
01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:55,180
We get to see your friend Bumblebee.

1920
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:57,820
And those friends are primarily from the ride.

1921
01:09:57,820 --> 01:09:59,660
I never watched the cartoon as a kid.

1922
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:01,940
Didn't have many toys of Transformers.

1923
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:03,940
And then I've seen the first movie.

1924
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:06,660
So seeing your friends counts even if it's not friends

1925
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:07,980
from any other media.

1926
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:10,220
Yeah, they're my friends because of the ride.

1927
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:13,340
That's my favorite Transformers thing, is the ride.

1928
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:16,340
But then why can't the Rise of the Resistance characters

1929
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:17,180
be your friends?

1930
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:18,020
They're in a ride.

1931
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:18,860
They are, but they're not.

1932
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:21,380
It's Kylo Ren and you see Finn from a distance.

1933
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:23,700
And again, for whatever criticism I level

1934
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:27,340
against newer Star Wars, I like almost all the characters.

1935
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:30,100
But it's just not, I mean, you see them in the pre-shows

1936
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:31,060
and I like all that stuff.

1937
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,060
But they're kind of far away.

1938
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:35,580
I mean, all right, it's a monitor.

1939
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:37,580
I guess a monitor with Poe Dameron

1940
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:38,860
is not gonna do anything for you.

1941
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:40,060
It doesn't do as much for me.

1942
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:41,740
So Beck is your friend?

1943
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:42,980
Yeah, I love Beck.

1944
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:46,220
I've talked about Beck in my favorite, my...

1945
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:48,260
Just figuring out the rules.

1946
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:50,220
So Finn is not a friend

1947
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:52,220
because Finn's on a screen that's far away.

1948
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:55,380
Well, but he's like a head is on a stick far away

1949
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,220
because you see him in the big AT-AT room.

1950
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,900
But if he was closer, he'd be your friend?

1951
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:01,340
If there was a room where Finn was like closer

1952
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,220
and he was like, get in here and like the door closed

1953
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:04,860
and like Finn is kind of right on top of you

1954
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:07,100
like Optimus Prime was,

1955
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:09,700
and he gives you some sort of instruction or whatever.

1956
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:12,340
It's the being on top of that's required.

1957
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:14,220
Or underneath, they could be on the side

1958
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:16,380
as long as they're closer underneath you.

1959
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:17,660
That's actual, I'm just saying

1960
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:19,980
as long as there's something to the closeness.

1961
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:22,220
We all were dealing with six feet,

1962
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:24,260
the six feet rule during COVID.

1963
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:27,740
Is it also the six feet rule of friendship?

1964
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:30,500
If he's within six feet, is he your friend?

1965
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,100
Yeah, I think that's pretty good.

1966
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:34,580
I would love closer.

1967
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:36,860
Like when I go on Snow White at Disneyland,

1968
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:38,620
those dwarves are like two feet.

1969
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:41,980
I could really mess up that ride if I wanted to.

1970
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:43,020
Anybody could.

1971
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:44,500
If you have long enough arms,

1972
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:47,580
you really could just smack stuff, knock things over.

1973
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:48,620
You have so much power

1974
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:50,260
and everyone has so much respect for Disneyland

1975
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:51,860
that they don't ruin those dark rides.

1976
01:11:51,860 --> 01:11:53,940
It's kind of blows my mind

1977
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:56,220
that people don't just try to rip things off the wall

1978
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:57,060
when they're on those dark rides.

1979
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:58,740
That's true, yeah, yeah.

1980
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:02,460
So yeah, the closer the better when it comes to that stuff.

1981
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:03,300
It helps.

1982
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,580
It helps forge friendships if you're within six feet.

1983
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,020
Well, let's answer this question though,

1984
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:07,860
because this is tough.

1985
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:08,700
You gotta kill one.

1986
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,940
These are three qualities you love.

1987
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:12,100
These three qualities I love.

1988
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:14,460
I guess I gotta kill, oh, I hate to say it.

1989
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:16,620
I guess I gotta kill intimacy.

1990
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:21,620
And I got to marry my friends

1991
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:25,660
and I've got to F thrills, you know?

1992
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:27,060
You've gotta fuck fucking you up.

1993
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:29,180
I have to fuck fucking me up.

1994
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:32,580
Because that's still a part of it

1995
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:35,980
is getting to have your body experience something

1996
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:39,020
that it doesn't get to experience in regular life.

1997
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:41,020
So I think that's my answer.

1998
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,540
Wow, there you go.

1999
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:43,580
I'm glad you stuck to one.

2000
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:45,100
That's a very tough one, the teddy.

2001
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:45,940
I don't like it.

2002
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:48,700
It makes me uncomfortable to answer it.

2003
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:50,660
Do you want to?

2004
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:51,500
I got something, okay.

2005
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,740
So Michelle asks if you could replace one song

2006
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:57,140
on Cosmic Rewind, which one are you removing

2007
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:58,940
and what are you replacing it with?

2008
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:00,500
What are all six of them?

2009
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:01,340
Okay, so the question.

2010
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:02,700
On Cosmic Rewind, not the other one,

2011
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:04,180
not Mission Break again.

2012
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:07,660
Right, Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind in Epcot.

2013
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:09,620
There are what, six songs?

2014
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:11,900
Or September, everybody wants to rule the world

2015
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:15,140
one way or another, Konga, I Ran,

2016
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,940
By Flock of Seagulls, Disco Inferno.

2017
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:19,340
Oh, and the Eternal Dance?

2018
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:22,220
Or is that, that's all of them, I think?

2019
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:23,060
Eternal Dance.

2020
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:25,980
No, this AI shit is giving me the wrong, I think.

2021
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:28,060
Why do we, we used to have, you would search.

2022
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:28,900
They would just come to the top,

2023
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:30,100
like why is this AI crap on the top?

2024
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:30,940
Just you would search something

2025
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:32,700
and then you would get one set of results.

2026
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:35,460
Now you get two sets of results and one sucks.

2027
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:37,900
And that's the one, that's the one that's claimed

2028
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:40,780
that on Sea Hunt, they had used a ventriloquist dummy.

2029
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:43,220
That's what fucked you up with that?

2030
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:44,340
I think, cause the stupid.

2031
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:45,620
These AI searches.

2032
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:48,900
Bullshit, wait, okay, so it's I Ran, Disco Inferno, Konga,

2033
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,540
everybody wants to rule the world

2034
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:51,940
one way or another in September.

2035
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:52,780
Those are the songs.

2036
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:54,020
I haven't gotten to do it, I've only done it

2037
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:56,980
with one of these, I've only done it with Konga.

2038
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:00,900
As far as, I just find like Disco Inferno

2039
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:03,900
to be maybe the most like, maybe too obvious

2040
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:07,980
of a song or something or like a two wedding of a song.

2041
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:09,940
But then what do I replace it with that?

2042
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:11,380
Yeah.

2043
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:13,580
I mean, this can be a very indulgent answer, I think.

2044
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:16,260
Like I'm not gonna, we could try to think of

2045
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:19,380
what would appeal to everyone and what is like high energy.

2046
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:22,900
I think it has to just be us, yes.

2047
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:25,940
Well, I mean, my knee jerk is because I'm a yacht guy.

2048
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:28,100
So I don't know, is this song more energetic

2049
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:28,940
than Disco Inferno?

2050
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:31,060
Possibly not, but I just want a yacht coaster.

2051
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:34,660
So my temptation is to say Ride Like the Wind.

2052
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:35,900
That would be cool.

2053
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:36,940
I think it'd be good on a coaster.

2054
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:39,180
I think that would be also kind of a crowd pleaser

2055
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:40,460
actually, in addition to.

2056
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:42,740
I think that would fit in that lineup of songs.

2057
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:43,580
I think people would be,

2058
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:45,340
oh, I got it with Ride Like the Wind.

2059
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:46,180
Yeah.

2060
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:50,300
No, and that wouldn't be so out of place either,

2061
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:51,340
I feel like too.

2062
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:52,780
So I think you actually did a pretty good

2063
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,460
universal job of choosing.

2064
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:55,660
Yeah.

2065
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:57,460
Or what about, you know, like maybe a second place

2066
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:58,980
is like Saucudio.

2067
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:01,380
Saucudio would be pretty good.

2068
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:02,900
Yeah.

2069
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:03,820
That would be good.

2070
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:04,660
Yeah.

2071
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:07,220
Yeah, it would get fired up for Saucudio, I think.

2072
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:08,060
Right.

2073
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:10,700
I'm trying to think of something that like,

2074
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:15,460
I like, I am trying to break your heart by Wilco

2075
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:17,780
would be really interesting.

2076
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:20,820
Cause again, I want to feel like sad and strange,

2077
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:22,980
which is why I'm so like, I'm so like,

2078
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,820
next time we're in Florida, I am,

2079
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:28,580
my big goal is to get everybody wants to rule the world.

2080
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:31,700
Just cause I want to feel the moodiness.

2081
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:34,900
So I want to feel like strange, I want to like,

2082
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:36,980
that song, if you haven't heard it is very like,

2083
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:39,060
that's a very headphone song,

2084
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:41,700
where like a lot of instruments kind of come in and out,

2085
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,500
and there's like kind of unique one-off

2086
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:46,540
little things happening, this alarm clock at the start of it.

2087
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:50,700
I just want to like, kind of like zone out while I'm on this

2088
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:51,540
ride.

2089
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:52,380
It's like, I don't know,

2090
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:53,220
can you be able to zone out?

2091
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:54,060
No, I guess.

2092
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:55,900
And it's like, you'll miss some of the,

2093
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:59,100
you'll miss some of the subtle instrumentation of that song.

2094
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:00,940
But I'm trying to think of there's,

2095
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:02,620
there's another song by LCD sound system.

2096
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:06,580
I would like, called losing my edge that I really like

2097
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:08,860
from their first album or second album.

2098
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:10,900
Does it resonate with you for some reason?

2099
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,180
Yes, it's always has.

2100
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:14,340
It's like eight minutes long though.

2101
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:15,460
So they'd have to cut it.

2102
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:16,940
It'd be a big radio.

2103
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:20,300
But yes, it is a song about a guy who is losing his edge,

2104
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:22,740
who feels the kids are coming up from behind.

2105
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:27,140
And he's like saying all the stuff he's seen and done

2106
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:28,940
that he like to give himself credit.

2107
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:31,020
It's a funny song also, the credibility.

2108
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:32,580
He had at one point, he even says,

2109
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:34,140
James Murphy says in the song, he says like,

2110
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:38,540
I have all the good Beach Boys records, like he explains.

2111
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:41,860
So he's like kind of losing his mind to explain.

2112
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,980
And I'm like, this is, it's a very like,

2113
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:46,420
it's kind of the same groove for eight minutes,

2114
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:47,900
but it's a funny song.

2115
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:50,740
So like one of those, cause that's sort of very hip.

2116
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:53,100
It's a very hypnotic beat too.

2117
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:57,260
So I just like, I'm really want somebody to put songs

2118
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:58,900
on roller coasters now that are like,

2119
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:01,740
that really change the mood from just like high energy

2120
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:02,580
or something.

2121
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:04,060
That's becoming more intriguing to me.

2122
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:04,900
You're trying to get,

2123
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:06,700
you're trying to get a thinky roller coaster.

2124
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:07,540
A thinky, yeah.

2125
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:08,380
Maybe these aren't the right songs.

2126
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:10,260
So if it's not gonna, if it's not gonna fork you up

2127
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:12,740
and you want it to fork you up emotionally.

2128
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:14,060
I would love it to do that.

2129
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:14,900
Yeah.

2130
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:16,740
Like maybe like a, dude, was there a,

2131
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:19,740
there wasn't a Pink Floyd coaster at Hard Rock Park, right?

2132
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:21,100
Was Pink Floyd in there anywhere?

2133
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:21,940
I don't know.

2134
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:22,780
And I'm not a big Pink Floyd guy.

2135
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:25,180
I'm just trying to think of like something universally

2136
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:27,900
or like very popular that's kind of trippy or weird.

2137
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:30,460
I feel like Knights in White Sadden might be the most,

2138
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:35,140
like the headiest song, like pop song ever used in a.

2139
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:36,100
Probably.

2140
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:37,420
Yeah.

2141
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:39,660
But yeah, one of those, I would really,

2142
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:42,140
I would really do it, it would be indulgent

2143
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:44,140
and people would be confused.

2144
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:45,020
Yeah. Yeah.

2145
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:45,860
That would be.

2146
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:47,900
Yeah, but poorly attended ride.

2147
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:49,700
Poor, yeah, we'll close very soon.

2148
01:17:50,660 --> 01:17:52,420
But yeah, I am trying to break your heart, Wilco Coaster.

2149
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:55,380
I mean, there's high energy.

2150
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:57,220
LCD sound blaster.

2151
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:01,140
Well, Jason could get in on this

2152
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:02,980
because this is like some of the same popular

2153
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:04,780
during his New Pornographers era,

2154
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:05,900
which I also am a big fan of.

2155
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:08,020
From the 10 months where he paid attention to music

2156
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:11,100
until he got a fiance who pays attention

2157
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:12,500
to current pop music.

2158
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:13,780
If we could open it way back up.

2159
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:16,820
If we could add like an early to mid 2000s era

2160
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:21,820
Hard Rock Park, Strokes, like Spoon, College Rock,

2161
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:24,500
Hold Steady, all these bands.

2162
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:25,540
I think that would be,

2163
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:27,420
I think we could flush something out there.

2164
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:28,340
Yeah.

2165
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:29,980
We've been threatening to get John Minkowski

2166
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:33,500
on the show for years, but this is, this would be.

2167
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,820
We did get a question about that,

2168
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:38,020
about what Hard Rock Park and the, yeah.

2169
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:39,540
Well, that's a good, I mean, that's a good land.

2170
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:40,740
I think you could fit it all in there,

2171
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:42,780
but yeah, early 2000s land.

2172
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:43,620
Yes.

2173
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:46,260
You know, MTV2 land, you might think of it.

2174
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:47,100
Yeah.

2175
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:49,660
Wow, I got pretty fucked up on the Ted Leo coaster.

2176
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:50,500
Yeah.

2177
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:54,020
That was from Cody, credit to Cody on that question.

2178
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:55,580
Yeah, there would be, yeah.

2179
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:58,900
Who suggested the John Resnick slide in that area

2180
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,820
and the tunnel of Mike Love.

2181
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:01,900
Oh yeah, that would be perfect.

2182
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:04,260
Hey, sign me up, good vibrations.

2183
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:07,220
Maybe a quick one on the way out the door.

2184
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:08,940
Yeah, yeah, go for it.

2185
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:11,180
Robert Warner, will you make it to Pizza Rizzo

2186
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:13,300
before it shuts down in May?

2187
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:16,180
And I want to answer this because maybe it'll hold us

2188
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:17,980
to doing it because we've.

2189
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:19,820
All right, I'll let you say it.

2190
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:20,660
Yes.

2191
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:22,060
I think we gotta do it.

2192
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:23,180
We're gonna try.

2193
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:24,020
I think we're gonna try.

2194
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:26,740
It is a goal to try.

2195
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:28,860
It makes sense, you know, it's closing

2196
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:30,700
in the similar neck of the woods

2197
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:33,980
to when another big theme park development is opening.

2198
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:34,820
Uh-huh.

2199
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:37,780
Which is obviously much less of a priority

2200
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:39,340
than Pizza Rizzo.

2201
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:40,980
And I've recently declared all the things

2202
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:44,300
I hope stay open for us to get to Orlando,

2203
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:45,780
and I think maybe they're all gonna be open.

2204
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:48,300
They might all still be there.

2205
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,780
We will get to do before they go away, so.

2206
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:53,380
I figure if we just like, if we, you know,

2207
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:54,820
it's hard for me to just say it

2208
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:57,820
with a lot of, you know, assuredness,

2209
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:02,940
but we'd like to, we'd like to.

2210
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:03,780
Robert.

2211
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:05,700
Wouldn't that be, wouldn't that be good?

2212
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:07,500
At last, the Pizza Rizzo episode.

2213
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:09,820
Wouldn't that be good to do?

2214
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:11,700
Wouldn't that be their last day?

2215
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:13,660
Have you ever been to a last day of a ride?

2216
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:15,260
I'm sure I've asked this before, but.

2217
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:16,380
I don't think I have.

2218
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:18,020
We did Great Movie Ride last day.

2219
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:18,860
Just by happenstance.

2220
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:19,980
Wow, I forgot that.

2221
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:21,340
We were just, we had booked a trip,

2222
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:22,660
and then they announced it was the last day,

2223
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:26,620
so we got to go like 11 a.m., the day of the last,

2224
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:29,220
the last day of Great Movie Ride, and it was really fun.

2225
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:30,700
Everybody was really excited.

2226
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:32,620
Motion's gotta be high for that, yeah.

2227
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:34,820
I watched videos of the last ride,

2228
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:36,820
and it's kinda interesting to like,

2229
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:38,340
drift off the feeling of that.

2230
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:40,460
It's an interesting vibe, and I assume Muppets

2231
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:43,580
would be even stronger, and an even more interesting vibe

2232
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:46,780
at Pizza Rizzo and at the actual Muppets 3D.

2233
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:47,620
Yeah, yeah.

2234
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:49,060
So, I don't know, we'll see.

2235
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:51,820
Okay, hope to be there at Pizza Rizzo

2236
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:53,380
while there is still a Pizza Rizzo.

2237
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:54,220
Yeah.

2238
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:57,620
I think with that, you survived podcast The Ride.

2239
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:00,220
Scott and Mike runnin' the post office.

2240
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:01,340

2241

Hey, and why not?

2246
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:10,980
I'm also gonna throw in,

2247
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:12,980
because this will encourage me to finish this thing.

2248
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:15,500
James McKinnon, can we get a session

2249
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:18,740
of the previously teased infinite playlist feature,

2250
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:20,660
hoping for some banger AOR,

2251
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:25,180
or GRP passport jazz type wrecks from Scott,

2252
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,980
and I don't know, Olivia Rodriguez,

2253
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:30,660
or something equally hip from Mike.

2254
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:32,740
Well, that's one thing Mike can tell you

2255
01:21:32,740 --> 01:21:36,340
with certainty, is that it's Rodrigo.

2256
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:38,500
And as for me, this did encourage,

2257
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,700
basically, I have to finish it,

2258
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:42,820
but by the time you're hearing this click in the show notes,

2259
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:45,500
if you think you align with my music taste,

2260
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,900
like the aforementioned Ride Like the Wind,

2261
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:52,900
I put together a playlist called Yacht by Ski-Yacht.

2262
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:54,700
I'm still shaping,

2263
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:56,460
I wanna keep it a reasonable amount of tracks,

2264
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:58,620
like 11 to 13, something like that,

2265
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:03,620
but of lesser known non-hit yacht rock songs

2266
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,340
that I think prove why I love the genre,

2267
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:08,500
and why I think there's a lot of emotion,

2268
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:11,300
and feel, and why it's resonated with me.

2269
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:12,300
As Weezer would say,

2270
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:14,820
I put a lot of my heart songs on here.

2271
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:16,380
They're all very important to me.

2272
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:17,460
It's still in progress,

2273
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:20,820
but James, if you wanna hear it, or anybody else,

2274
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:24,100
I mean, look, I got Mark Jordan on there.

2275
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,540
I got Pages on there.

2276
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,900
I got Larson Featon Band.

2277
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:29,740
Is Homie and Jarvis gonna stay?

2278
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:31,540
I gotta decide.

2279
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:32,980
These are the things that'll be weighing on me

2280
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:34,740
before you end up hearing this episode,

2281
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:37,940
but if you wanna hear the kinda bullshit I like.

2282
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:39,380
If I remember, I'll make a playlist too.

2283
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:41,540
I love making playlists.

2284
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:44,380
What do you think's on there?

2285
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:45,620
God, it depends what mood it is.

2286
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:46,580
I mean, I could, at this point,

2287
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:49,860
make an old Hillbilly Nonsense playlist too,

2288
01:22:49,860 --> 01:22:52,260
like with Hawk Shaw Hawkins.

2289
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:53,620
I believe that's the gentleman

2290
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:56,460
who does the song Rattlesnake and Daddy,

2291
01:22:56,460 --> 01:23:00,420
so I could do an old Hillbilly Nonsense playlist.

2292
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:01,620
It's really a pick your poison.

2293
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:03,740
Do you want the host,

2294
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:06,700
do you want the host who knows some songs from right now

2295
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:08,860
because of who he's engaged to?

2296
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:11,260
Or do you want the host who mainly likes music

2297
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:12,620
from before he was born,

2298
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:14,540
but he's perfectly comfortable with that?

2299
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:18,380
I've been fake-and-pilled for so long,

2300
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:20,020
I have no desire to fight it.

2301
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:22,260
Or do you want the host who likes a lot

2302
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:24,940
of Hillbilly Nonsense songs from 100 years ago?

2303
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:26,300
Right, if it's an older, yeah.

2304
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:27,940
There's a lot of different things.

2305
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:32,420
Yeah, I saw somebody tweet that like,

2306
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:34,540
because I mentioned MJ Lenderman recently,

2307
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:37,620
and somebody has drawn the parallel of like,

2308
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:40,420
all the Wilco dads have switched to MJ Lenderman.

2309
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:41,700
Oh, I see.

2310
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:44,380
And then somebody was like, yeah, I thought,

2311
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:46,700
well, I think he sounds more like the drive-by truckers

2312
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:47,540
or pavement.

2313
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:49,340
And I was like, mm-hmm, he does do that too.

2314
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:50,180
This is what I'm saying.

2315
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:51,620
I think we don't have to be so sweaty

2316
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:54,500
in liking what the kids like

2317
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:57,380
because they make new music for us.

2318
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:58,220
No, they do, I listen to all of it.

2319
01:23:58,220 --> 01:24:01,300
If you're fake-and-pilled, you move to Benny Sings

2320
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:04,060
or a myriad of other, Young Gun Silver Fox

2321
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:05,940
or a bunch of things of that nature.

2322
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:07,420
There's new music for us.

2323
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:10,180
When that guy came up, something you said was like,

2324
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:13,020
and he's, I think, 23 years old.

2325
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:15,300
You were excited by his age.

2326
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,580
You don't have to care about what age the person is.

2327
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:18,580
This is my persona.

2328
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:20,060
This is my persona on the show.

2329
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:21,220
You meet me in real life.

2330
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:23,620
I'm just like, MJ Lenderman is cool, man.

2331
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:24,460
I'm gonna go there.

2332
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:25,280
My dad likes him.

2333
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:26,120
My sister likes him.

2334
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:27,100
We're gonna go see the show.

2335
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,740
I'm so much cooler in real life.

2336
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:32,020
On the show, this is all this character I play.

2337
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:33,460
You know what I'm saying?

2338
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:36,820
But then that tone you went into felt so natural, so cool,

2339
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:38,700
not like a character or a choice at all.

2340
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:40,300
No, that was my real self.

2341
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:43,580
Yeah, real Mike's like, no, I'm not even like that.

2342
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:46,260
Honestly, I don't even remember how old he is.

2343
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:48,060
Is he 25 in six months?

2344
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:49,220
Is he 25 in one month?

2345
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:50,060
I don't even know.

2346
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:51,540
That's not what, it's about the music to me.

2347
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:54,160
You ever listen to the band Mannequin Pussy?

2348
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:55,660
I do.

2349
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:56,780
It's rock and roll.

2350
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:57,980
It's all the same to me, man.

2351
01:24:57,980 --> 01:24:58,820
It's rock and roll.

2352
01:24:58,820 --> 01:25:00,340
I'm comfortable saying pussy.

2353
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:01,180
I'll say it all day.

2354
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:03,140
I say pussy off the show all the time.

2355
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:03,980
I love it, man.

2356
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:06,380
I'll go fuck some pussy, dude.

2357
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:07,580
I mean, I don't say that as much.

2358
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:10,180
I just say it like if it's a name of a band I like,

2359
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:12,860
but I still am comfortable saying it, no problem.

2360
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:16,020
I don't know why it got higher there.

2361
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:16,860
Keep going.

2362
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:17,700
Ah, ah, ah.

2363
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:19,980
I don't know, I like band Mannequin Pussy.
