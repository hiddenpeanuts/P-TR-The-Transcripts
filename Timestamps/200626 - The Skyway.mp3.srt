1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,280
Warning, the following podcast contains discussion of an old, slow moving bucket that lazily carries

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,920
you through the air.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,240
We love it!

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,520
It's the Skyway on podcast The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,760
Welcome to podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast that is 100% wheelchair accessible.

8
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,280
I'm Scott Gardener, joined by Mike Carlson.

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,960
Hey, I am here and that is good news, yes.

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,440
I think we're the only one.

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,440
I believe we're the only one.

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,840
Jason Sheridan is here as well.

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,720
Yes, I am here too.

15
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,000
It's important to be considerate so everyone can enjoy the show.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,400
Yes, indeed, indeed.

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,400
And I wish others were more considerate as well.

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:15,040
Folks, today we're talking about the Skyway, which basic primers, these were the gondolas

19
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,120
that took you back and forth between Fantasyland and Tomorrowland in the Magic Kingdom and

20
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,640
Disney World, originally in Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland as well, from the 50s through the

21
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:34,440
mid 90s, where among the things, the factors that made them go away was the handicap accessibility.

22
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,840
But that's, you know, that's the main stuff.

23
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,360
And I'm excited to talk about the Skyway because this is like, this is some pretty classic

24
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
Disneyland stuff.

25
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,040
I feel like when I talk to my mom, this was a very important thing to her.

26
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,640
I think if you were an original decade Disneyland person, you really love the Skyway.

27
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,240
Yeah, I think, yeah, you when you think of the classic pictures of Disney or the classic

28
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,960
videos that Skyway, I guess it's probably looms large in my brain of the archived footage

29
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,120
because it's gone now.

30
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,880
So it always like I always look at it.

31
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,480
But I do think like that's such a huge part of what they call the kinetic energy, the

32
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,640
movement that you would see when you go into Disney.

33
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,640
Yeah, and such a great like in that first run of like attraction posters, like a really

34
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,800
good one.

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,480
Oh, yes, absolutely.

36
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,520
Yeah, the the posters that you see under the train tracks entering Disneyland.

37
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,480
Yeah, yeah.

38
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,560
Very classic one.

39
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,800
You know, yeah, you bring up a good point right away, Mike.

40
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:42,040
And yeah, how much the Skyway really hits you in early footage of Disneyland.

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,280
I'll say right away, let me look up the name of this on YouTube.

42
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,120
There's a really great film short.

43
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,080
I don't know what you'd call it called People in Places Disneyland USA.

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,400
And it's a lot of really beautiful film footage in color of Disneyland in 1956.

45
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,360
It shows you what the park was like then.

46
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,800
And I mean, the whole thing is great.

47
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,040
It's really beautiful and beautifully shot.

48
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,520
But, you know, they film from the Skyway as well.

49
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:16,120
And it shows you how it was a great way to see Disneyland from above to see it was another

50
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,400
way to see storybook land.

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,440
It was a way you could see that the old teacups, the original version of the teacups, where

52
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,160
you know, with like all the big spirals, like you really get a sense of the kinetic energy

53
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,440
of the spirals of the original Med Tea Party, maybe the best from up in the Skyway.

54
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,960
Yeah, it's all of that stuff.

55
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,360
Seeing it now, like in the footage when you see like because they I feel like they've

56
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,440
had footage of it shot from the Skyway, like you can sort of see the vantage point of the

57
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,440
Skyway.

58
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,160
That stuff is all exciting.

59
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:54,640
I also, of course, feel a sense of dread because of how scared I was.

60
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,640
Oh, good.

61
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,640
Oh, yes.

62
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,640
This is your area.

63
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,960
You don't like precarious dangling, I suppose.

64
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,960
You know what?

65
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,720
That's we have not branded exactly what it is about rides that I don't like, but precarious

66
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:16,440
dangling or precarious feeling, a precarious vibe, even though it maybe isn't, it's very

67
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,760
safe, but it's precarious.

68
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
It feels precarious.

69
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,040
It's, you know, it's legs dangling off of a roller coaster.

70
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't love that.

71
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,320
It is Skyway, which is slow and I guess Skyliner, which is, of course, the new version of this

72
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,160
at Disney World.

73
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,320
It is a slow moving thing.

74
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,520
Wires don't help because it feels that does feel precarious.

75
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,920
And it's I know there's nothing under me.

76
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,800
There's something about that that sort of gives me anxiety.

77
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,080
I don't know. I think it's just some sort of inherent thing in my brain.

78
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,280
I don't think there was a traumatic incident or anything.

79
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,280
You really feel the movement on those wires.

80
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,920
Like if you hit a weird little bump or a sway, you really feel it.

81
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,840
It feels natural and it feels like it shouldn't be happening.

82
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,600
Like any little jerk kind of freaks you out.

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,280
Yes, that is right.

84
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:17,320
So when I saw we're talking about Skyway and this is still one that I haven't overcome.

85
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,480
I've overcome better, like crazier roller coasters.

86
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,280
I've overcome haunt.

87
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,760
I love haunts now.

88
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,480
I never did. But the Skyway type ride still has not been conquered by my brain.

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,400
And now, of course, compare that to me, who, as we've established in the past,

90
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,520
I am much like a goat want to be as high up as possible.

91
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,160
So I felt always would jump at the chance to do the Skyway or like, hey,

92
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,360
I know it's faster to walk, but we could take the Skyway to get to that part of the park.

93
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,200
You have friendly skies.

94
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
I do. Do you guys?

95
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,080
That's one of those weird little dumb pleasures that, you know,

96
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,520
barely has any impact.

97
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,760
But I always feel it.

98
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,320
The feeling of, yes, why walk when we could take that, even though taking the other transport,

99
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,160
because that's what else is like that the train train gets you to another part of the park

100
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,560
without having to walk, even though it could end up taking you vastly longer, depending.

101
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,960
It still feels like this dumb little cheat barely.

102
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,680
Like I figured out a better way, a more efficient way.

103
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,920
Well, I have so much affection for the Skyway.

104
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,280
And it's funny because what we usually so much we usually have affection for is like

105
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,000
theming and stuff. This besides the stations, which were very nice looking,

106
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,400
I think this ride could not be any less themed.

107
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,960
Like it's just giant gray girders and buckets.

108
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,680
Vehicles that were so quick, people just started calling up.

109
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,920
Yeah, those buckets.

110
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,680
Yes, never specifically referred to by Disney as the sky buckets.

111
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,880
But again, if you ask parents, a lot of parents might knee jerk, call it the sky buckets.

112
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,080
That definitely was the terminology for sure.

113
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:16,160
And I think there is like arguments to be made of like, OK, well, maybe put theming

114
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,320
like theming could take a back seat if it's really fun.

115
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,440
Like the Skyway is really fun.

116
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,640
Like the same, I think we were Mike and I were talking a while back of like, all right,

117
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,880
just sell baby Yoda shit in Galaxy's Edge.

118
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,320
Who cares? Everyone loves this little guy.

119
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,520
Just fill it. Yeah, do it.

120
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,400
Yeah, yeah, I know, because we we love immersive stuff.

121
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,320
And it's I'd like to think that the listener understands our level.

122
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:50,120
Why would we make fun of Kingda Ka at Six Flags having ads for a hair gel on the side?

123
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,600
But we would love just copious baby Yoda merchandising in Galaxy's Edge

124
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
and love these unthemed buckets.

125
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,760
I don't know. I mean, I'd like to think that the spectrum is clear.

126
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,000
But if we need to break it down further, let us know.

127
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,200
Yeah, I it's look, life is a contradiction.

128
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,680
That's what I always say.

129
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,760
So there's going to be some of it.

130
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,000
I mean, look at this.

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,240
I don't want to talk too much about the Skyliner.

132
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,040
There's enough there for its own thing.

133
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,160
But look at the contradiction with the Skyliner.

134
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:27,320
We're like, OK, they put they they put the the the pillars,

135
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,240
a lot of stuff backstage or on access roads.

136
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,360
And it goes by some of the very expensive hotels.

137
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,440
And it does not stop at them.

138
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,120
Like, if anything, it makes the views worse from those places.

139
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,880
But overall, a net positive.

140
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,040
Yes, sure. Sure.

141
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,960
Now, you know, you bring up a good point and we should break this down.

142
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,440
The Skyway is not the Skyliner.

143
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,600
The Skyway, as I said, was something from the from Disneyland

144
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,760
through the 50s through 90s.

145
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,840
And it's been gone for a long time.

146
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,400
The Skyliner is the new thing.

147
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,440
Disney World that takes you around Epcot and MGM Studios and some some of the campus.

148
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,200
The Skyway is also not the Starway.

149
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,120
The Starway is the big set of escalators

150
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,720
that took you from the top part of Universal Studios Hollywood down to the bottom part.

151
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,200
And if you want to hear more about those escalators,

152
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,800
we did an episode about it at Patreon.com slash by guess right.

153
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,760
So Skyway, not the Starway, Skyway, not the Skyliner and Skyway,

154
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,840
also not Ford's Magic Skyway,

155
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,760
which is a ride that did not take place in the sky at all.

156
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,040
That was something from the 1964 World's Fair.

157
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,560
And it is where you drove 60s Ford's through the time of the dinosaurs.

158
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,320
What I'm kind of saving, like I've never really dug deep on Ford's Magic Skyway.

159
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,640
And that's like neither I would like to.

160
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,200
As I say all that out loud, I'm like, why have we not gotten to that one?

161
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,200
Yeah, I was going to say it's also not the Minneapolis Skyway,

162
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,800
which is a series of elevated bridges.

163
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,720
Oh, which is that's what that's called.

164
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,560
Yeah. And that which is also the replacements have a song called Skyway,

165
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,600
which is what's yeah, which is a great song.

166
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,120
It's a nice it's like a sweet little song.

167
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,840
So it's not that jeez.

168
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,880
And it's also not I don't want to go overboard here,

169
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,200
but I was looking up all of the rides that have been built by the company

170
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,000
that built this thing, Skyway, with the company called Von Roll.

171
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,560
And they there's a list on Wikipedia of the other rides that they've built.

172
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,280
And most of them are called Skyride.

173
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,160
One is called Bayside Skyride.

174
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,920
One is there's Skybuckets.

175
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,200
That one's official Skyfory Skyway,

176
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,880
different Skyway at Six Flags Great Adventure, Skylift, Aeronaut Skyride.

177
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,840
It's it's a pretty dense network of the same five words to weave.

178
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,200
But no sky no skyfall.

179
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,400
I do. Is there a ride called Skyfall?

180
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,960
Well, it's a movie, of course.

181
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,680
They I think they'd like to minimize the thought of falling from these contraptions.

182
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,680
There. There's a type of it looks like somewhere called

183
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,160
Fun Time in Australia has Skyfall.

184
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
That's like it's a drop tower.

185
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,200
OK. Yeah, that makes more sense because that you do want to fall.

186
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,160
Right. That's fun.

187
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,520
Falling is fun in that instance.

188
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,600
In that instance, folks, if you got a drop tower and it's not falling,

189
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,760
something's wrong.

190
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,120
A fallout, a fallout like Mission Impossible Fallout.

191
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,920
That's a good fallout to watch, but less good, I guess, to experience.

192
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,400
If you were Ethan Hunt.

193
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,080
James Bond Sky Falls, Ethan Hunt falls out. Right.

194
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
They're both falling in different ways.

195
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,520
I think there's I think there's also a skyfall in Dollywood.

196
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,280
Is there is it called Skyway?

197
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,960
I'm sorry, it's called Drop Line.

198
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,760
I really need to I need to do that.

199
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,240
I can't just click on click bait headlines during the show.

200
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,560
I need to vet this info.

201
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,600
You got to have a talk, you know, or you're going to run into a situation

202
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,760
where you're you get like Camp Snoopy and Planet Snoopy mixed up.

203
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,800
And oh, yeah, I mean, we're still sorting that out.

204
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,680
And we're sure is the difference.

205
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,640
A indecipherable.

206
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,440
What?

207
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,440
It's pretty much depend on what the sign budget was for that any given year.

208
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
Sure.

209
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,800
Could we do a whole could we do a whole a separate spin off podcast

210
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,760
about sky based entertainment called Sky Guys?

211
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,960
I think the answer is yes.

212
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,160
Yeah, yeah, guys.

213
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,040
You went to college with one of the sky guys, right?

214
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,080
That is yes, that is true.

215
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,440
Yes, the sky guys.

216
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,680
Sky guys are not the try guys.

217
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,160
No, they're not. They're different.

218
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,240
They're they're us.

219
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,880
We are the sky guys.

220
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,560
We are the sky guys.

221
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,080
We're not the bumper car boys who we hate and whose podcast is not wheelchair

222
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,320
accessible. That's correct.

223
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,440
We are the sky guys and also the podcast, the ride good boys

224
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,880
and the podcast, the ride guys who are good boys.

225
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,800
That well, maybe was there was we've talked about the rumors

226
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:31,360
that a third Tokyo Disney gate would be Tokyo Disney Sky, correct?

227
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,640
Yes. I'm in love with that name.

228
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,880
I know. I read.

229
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,600
So if I'm saying, oh, we don't hear what about Skyway?

230
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,160
I was just going to say I didn't realize that Disney had seen it

231
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,480
because Disneyland has land in it.

232
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,040
That. Oh, yeah.

233
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,880
It took me a few months or a few years to figure that out.

234
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,880
And I was like, oh, that's perfect.

235
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,800
And then I heard Disney Sky and I was like, oh, shit.

236
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,440
Really good. It's like a Mario level.

237
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,960
Where else can Mario go? There's sky levels.

238
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,160
And so that so the third gate

239
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,640
pockets are at the third gate could be in the sky, much in the Tokyo tradition.

240
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,000
Oh, yeah, that's great.

241
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,120
The third gate is the sky where we're the sky guys,

242
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,840
where the sky guys rise.

243
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,160
That's who we are.

244
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,480
That's who we are now.

245
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,480
Look out for rise of the sky, guys.

246
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,880
I mean, we should do

247
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,920
for the magic skyway, by the way.

248
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,920
Yeah.

249
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,320
But you know, you know what,

250
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,160
Mike, in terms of personal associations with the situation,

251
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,520
your your association is being scared.

252
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:42,320
My association is being scared also, but not because of the skyway itself.

253
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,960
I think the heights nature of it and the dams and the skyway itself

254
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,440
is the most important thing.

255
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,520
The skyway itself, I think the heights nature of it

256
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,720
and the dangly nature didn't bother me for some reason.

257
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,560
But I I viewed it as a good way

258
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:03,040
to see the abominable snowman and get a sense of the Matterhorn

259
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,720
before I was willing to go on the Matterhorn.

260
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,080
And I'm sure with this and some other things that we'll talk about,

261
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,120
there'll be some things we mentioned also in the Matterhorn episode.

262
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,160
So apologies for repeating material.

263
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,120
I didn't go back and relisten. I'm sorry.

264
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,600
But I you know, because if you weren't aware,

265
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,360
not in the Magic Kingdom or Tokyo Disneyland, which don't have the Matterhorn,

266
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,040
this ride went straight through the middle of the Matterhorn,

267
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,480
which used to have these two big holes in it for the skyway to pass through.

268
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,080
And it took you right past the abominable snowman.

269
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,520
So I was so excited to get to see the robot without having to do the

270
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,320
what I now know is the most terrifying roller coaster ever built.

271
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,320
That makes a lot of sense.

272
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,840
I'm trying to think how old was

273
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,120
that was like on your yearly trip when you were younger.

274
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,520
Yeah. And this well, the skyway was gone by 94 when I was like nine years old.

275
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,880
So and I when did I start?

276
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,760
I might have done the Matterhorn finally when I was like 10 or 11.

277
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,960
I'm trying to think of where I would have been at.

278
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,960
I think I would have been comfortable on the Matterhorn around 10,

279
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,000
but I may have still refused the skyway.

280
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I don't know. I'll never know.

281
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,280
I I was trying to think of the like precarious dangling.

282
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,440
I was trying to think of a good way to synopsize

283
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,800
this little mini theme park syndrome I'm talking about.

284
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,920
And I think the phrase I came up with is scaredy cat samples.

285
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,520
It's a way like I got to sample the Matterhorn by passing through it

286
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
on the skyway.

287
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,640
Similarly, the people mover gives you a scaredy cat sample

288
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,640
of Space Mountain without having to go on Space Mountain for sure.

289
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,520
Oh, so there should be some like

290
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,160
Pope Mobile for you to drive around in during horror nights.

291
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,320
Oh, yes. Yes.

292
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,880
Being blockaded, knowing I can.

293
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,280
They're not going to get that close to you.

294
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,880
Yeah, there's, you know, going to be space.

295
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,040
You probably can't get in any like tight interactions with any scare actors.

296
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,280
Yeah, they can bang on the windows, maybe.

297
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,640
But, you know, how bad is that really?

298
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,960
And you can maybe even have like, you know,

299
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,760
those gloves when you're handling handling like nuclear rods.

300
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,040
You could like put your hands through there

301
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,440
and you could shoot people away.

302
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,200
Oh, yeah, sure.

303
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,400
You know, to make sure they keep their distance.

304
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,400
So you don't get scared as much as you would going through the regular maze.

305
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,040
I mean, this might be how we all have to experience theme parks.

306
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,920
Or life for the yes for the rest of time. Yes.

307
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,400
Horror nights are no horror nights.

308
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,640
We each have a little like mech suit,

309
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,840
like Pope Mobile that we get into that we have to get into

310
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,600
if we leave the house or apartment.

311
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:50,400
So each every theme park has the capacity for 25 people.

312
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,840
Yes. Slash slash their their mech warrior suit.

313
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,320
Oh, yeah, we all need the aliens suit, which is slash the avatar suit.

314
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,880
It's kind of the same thing.

315
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,080
I are there any other scaredy cat samples?

316
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,760
I mean, I guess sort of I used I used to feel this way, too, but like, well,

317
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,040
at least I get to see on the people mover, I can see the lobby of Star Tours

318
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,840
because I wasn't willing to go on Star Tours yet in Florida.

319
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,560
Yeah, the people mover.

320
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,160
Did you say Space Mountain already?

321
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,320
Yeah, I mean, that was one of them. Yeah.

322
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,520
Oh, because that one gets you right.

323
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,960
Don't you go between the lift hills?

324
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,640
That gets you right in there.

325
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,440
I've got one.

326
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,560
The train at Disneyland goes through the grand finale of Splash Mountain.

327
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,160
That's right. Oh, that was my biggest one.

328
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,000
No, it's for me to get.

329
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,520
That was the only way that I saw it for so long.

330
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,720
Yeah. Yeah.

331
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,160
Like this, just in general, like rides going through other rides.

332
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,080
Whenever it happens, it doesn't matter what the ride.

333
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,720
It rules. Oh, yeah.

334
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,720
It's the best. So good.

335
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,240
I don't know why it's the best thing, but it just happens to be.

336
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,000
If we break it down, like, what is it about that that makes it so good?

337
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,320
I don't know that you just get like another angle on a ride you like or.

338
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,640
Maybe it's like it's like good storytelling

339
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,080
where they weave together plots that you didn't expect to be weave together.

340
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,080
It's like the end of a Seinfeld where it all comes together.

341
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,680
It lets you know these rides aren't like separate little bastions.

342
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,400
They all they all connect. This is part of one greater whole.

343
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,640
Yeah, I guess that might be what it is.

344
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,360
I guess the same reason Marvel makes so much money with. Yeah. Yeah.

345
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,600
Yeah, it's like people are like, yeah, these two movies are connected.

346
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,960
The people mover is part of Space Mountain.

347
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,800
And it's also I guess it's like a good

348
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:51,680
piece of like hype for another ride you're going to go on during the day.

349
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,320
Like if you're going to Disney for the first time or you don't get to go that often,

350
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,200
you're going on the, you know, people mover and you're seeing Space Mountain

351
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,960
and you're like, oh, man, what's that?

352
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,080
I got to figure out what that is and we got to go on it.

353
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,480
You know, we've never talked about on the show.

354
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,920
Amazingly, it was the the Tiny Toons video, how I spent my summer vacation

355
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:18,560
where that where Plucky is in a vacation like struggle to get to.

356
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,680
What is the theme park called in it?

357
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,400
Do we know? Am I the only one of the three of us?

358
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,240
No, I know exactly what you're talking about, and I can't.

359
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,240
I know what you're talking about, but I don't know it well.

360
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,920
It was it was like a pretty epic tiny.

361
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,800
It was like a Tiny Toons mini movie, essentially.

362
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,160
I want to say my guess is Happy World Land.

363
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,000
I think that's what it is.

364
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,960
And it's it's it's the same structure as vacation, where it's this very frustrating trip.

365
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,640
But where he slogs through a terrible time with his friends, family.

366
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,920
And at the end of it, I'm going to get to a theme park and all of this struggle

367
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,480
will be worth it.

368
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,880
But in this case, instead of it being closed, he gets on a monorail,

369
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,560
which I think is is like a set of teeth.

370
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,320
And it takes him around to see everything in the park.

371
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,960
He gets to ride a ride like, and there's that and there's that.

372
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,200
And it's a joke bag of all these crazy, seemingly kind of violent rides.

373
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
And then they get off it.

374
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,440
And he's like, wow, a preview of everything I get to do.

375
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,360
And then they tell him, yep, well, that was a lot of fun.

376
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,920
We're just we're going to head back now.

377
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,320
And he doesn't get to go on any of the rides.

378
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,360
And they just went to go on the Toothmobile.

379
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,680
And that's it.

380
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,760
But it captured that.

381
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,040
Yeah, how frustrating is that?

382
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,080
But it really captures a little little syndrome of theme park visiting,

383
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,000
like anything like that.

384
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,800
You know, you know, it's like that is getting to enter Epcot via the monorail.

385
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,480
And it kind of takes you around a bunch of Epcot

386
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,240
and gives you a preview of what you're going to get when you actually land.

387
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,600
Well, there's definitely a bang for the buck, I think,

388
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,920
like like a perceived of like, wow, look, you get you get this and that.

389
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,440
But I think the other thing, too, is if you need like a little

390
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,400
like space mountain fix and it's an hour, 90 minute wait,

391
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,280
we just do a little people mover.

392
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,600
You at least get a little taste.

393
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,480
You know what I mean?

394
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,680
You get the theming, even if you if you're not willing to devote

395
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,720
three hours to get the thrill, you get the theming in five minutes.

396
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,360
And by the way, that ride is called the Tooth Fairy Fairy,

397
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,120
being like the vehicle fairy.

398
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,920
That's very good.

399
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Had that entire episode in Happy World Land are very good.

400
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,880
Yes, I'm looking at the opening for Tiny Tunes here,

401
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,880
and I'm seeing, of course, that the great Frank Marshall produces.

402
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,280
Oh, yes. Tiny Tunes.

403
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,360
So I just want to shout him out.

404
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,360
Friend of the show, Frank Marshall.

405
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,640
I mean, yeah, why not?

406
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,960
You know, we're more likely to get him someday.

407
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,320
If we now we I did, I think, in a second gate episode talk about

408
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,440
I think he knows stuff about the Twilight Zone deaths, but

409
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,280
that's probably a deterrent to getting him.

410
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,480
But maybe he won't hear that or this.

411
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,920
Maybe he won't.

412
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,040
But I assume he will, because I assume he listens to as a friend of the show.

413
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,000
Yeah, he listens to me.

414
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,600
Seed does not subscribe to the Patreon, though, just regular subscriber.

415
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,120
Unless he uses a student.

416
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,320
We don't know who there could be all kinds of people just using fake names.

417
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,560
Yeah, that's a good point.

418
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,120
Maybe his assistant signed up for the Patreon and he listens to

419
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,080
the Patreon through the assistance log in an email.

420
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,480
Yeah, you got to be careful when you're as prominent as Frank Marshall.

421
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,920
Yes, anything is possible.

422
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,880
Can I say something about

423
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,040
bringing Disneyland vibes home with you?

424
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,880
That I mean, for sure, this is a thing that I, you know,

425
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,240
I remember my mom talking about forever ago, like, what if you could have a view?

426
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,240
What if you like in your kitchen, if your little breakfast nook

427
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,000
was a Skyway or a people mover?

428
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,880
But for the purposes of this episode, the Skyway, what a dream.

429
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,520
That dream, of course, lived by Richard Kraft,

430
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,120
who we do. We did the show at his gallery.

431
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,360
That's from Disneyland.

432
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,360
And I didn't realize that at that gallery and auction,

433
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,200
there was a sale of a Skyway bucket

434
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,640
that was the highest price ever recorded for a Disneyland ride vehicle.

435
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,560
Wow, really? Yeah.

436
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:13,040
That was like the top moneymaker for the auction or just for a ride vehicle.

437
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,240
I oh, I don't know that. I don't know.

438
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,200
It did sell for more than the D that sold to also a friend of the show,

439
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,120
David Copperfield.

440
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,160
He subscribes to the Patreon,

441
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,280
but he uses his real name.

442
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,880
Well, you want to do actually maybe a little mini

443
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,160
souvenir smackdown, the ultimate souvenir smackdown for the highest price.

444
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,960
You guys want to guess what the Skyway bucket went for?

445
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,800
Let me Skyway bucket sold for

446
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,520
the highest price ever of all time for a Disneyland ride.

447
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,560
Three hundred thousand dollars.

448
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,320
Listen.

449
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,440
I'm going to say that might be too high and say fifty thousand.

450
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,920
The correct answer is six hundred twenty one.

451
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,760
Oh, my God. Dollars.

452
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,160
I was under. Oh, my God.

453
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,400
Yep. Yeah.

454
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,160
Which, you know, that has to be somebody,

455
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,800
you know, probably closer to my parents age.

456
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,360
The first clue being that they have money and the second clue.

457
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,800
And they're like, of course, like, like to have that you own a Skyway.

458
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,640
But I don't know. I think it was a latter day sky Skyway.

459
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,760
I don't think it was a fifties one.

460
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,560
I think it was a post 65 when they they made a different shape.

461
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,720
But yeah, six hundred. Six hundred thousand dollars.

462
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,080
They yeah, it was a four seater.

463
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,440
Do we get a picture of that?

464
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,800
Isn't there a or was that a people mover car?

465
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,240
I was looking. I don't.

466
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,240
I I don't think we did in that unless somebody else has it.

467
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,480
OK, we must have gotten in the people mover car.

468
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:55,040
Yeah. But yeah, we are obviously far too young to ever see the circular buckets,

469
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,200
which also had uncomfortable looking metal chair things.

470
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,440
And you would face a direction compared to the post 65 ones,

471
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,640
which were a lot more lightweight plastic.

472
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,120
And they could expand.

473
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,160
They made it lighter.

474
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:17,480
And then they were able to expand the seating to four riders.

475
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,400
And you sit two facing front, two facing back.

476
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,800
Oh, oh, wait. So you were just on a bench originally.

477
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:29,760
You were on these weird like theater seats, kind of like fold down theater seats.

478
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,800
And there wasn't a back there like back of the bucket was sort of the back.

479
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,320
Yeah, I was reading about this and I thought about it like if you were to

480
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,400
actually go on all the rides opening day of Disneyland,

481
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,560
like how uncomfortable would they all be?

482
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,040
Yeah, because that especially like what you're describing

483
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:56,000
the original seating arrangement, it seems like it would be really cramped

484
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,600
and unpleasant.

485
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,720
But, you know, you weren't used to being on cool rides in a cool place.

486
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,120
So you didn't notice it was so bad.

487
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,520
I just saw a shark tank pitch.

488
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,120
There was kind of a weird product that was about, you know, like a cloth

489
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,360
to put on a swing so your baby doesn't burn him or herself

490
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,480
on the metal of a span.

491
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,880
I forgot about that sensation of being on a hot swing

492
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,920
and how much that would hurt on a playground.

493
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,320
I bet a lot of Disneyland was like a very hot swing all the time.

494
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,840
Oh, yeah. Oh, the other thing,

495
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,960
the original Skyway buckets had a pole in the middle.

496
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,040
Wow. Just a big old.

497
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,480
Like a party bus.

498
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,160
Yeah, I guess.

499
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,760
I that kind of I don't think. Right. Right.

500
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,240
Well, I don't think you're anybody stripping on it.

501
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,480
Those poles and party buses are load bearing.

502
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,480
So you have to be very careful.

503
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,680
Very careful script uses.

504
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:01,160
I yeah, I was credit to Bob Gerr,

505
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,600
who designed the new ones and and got them to be a little more comfy.

506
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,440
But yeah, that like brutal nature of the old rides.

507
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,240
I mean, Bob Gerr seems so cool.

508
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,400
I mean, it's a listener.

509
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,760
We've talked about him before, and you can see him in the Imagineering

510
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,920
documentary, and he was part of the early utopia especially.

511
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,880
But like for how crazy high tech everything is in the parks now,

512
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,720
it does seem like so much of original Disneyland was, you know, like, well,

513
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,680
it's called Bob.

514
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,400
Like something breaks down and like, I got old Bob out here

515
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,600
and he comes out with a toolbox and bangs it back into shape.

516
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,040
He's like the handyman in your building.

517
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,720
And like a handyman and so many of those early guys

518
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,520
kind of self taught how to do all this stuff.

519
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,360
Oh, yeah, right. Yes.

520
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,320
In the documentary, in the measuring story, I forget about what ride.

521
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,320
But he says, I'm a car guy, not a not a bot guy, not a robot guy.

522
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,080
I forget what that was about.

523
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,160
But yeah, he does.

524
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,480
Fair known of these people knew how to do anything.

525
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,800
Figure out trigonometry, I think, was his task for in the matter.

526
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,560
The big thing in the matter.

527
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,640
Oh, that's what it was.

528
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,880
Yeah. He designed as one of the major steel roller coasters in history,

529
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,720
despite his initial reaction while asked him being, no, I can't do that.

530
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:21,120
But now I say they don't know anything, but all these people all across the board

531
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,160
didn't know anything.

532
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,520
Figure it out and pioneered a whole industry like cracked codes

533
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,240
that everybody's still basing all their decisions on decades later.

534
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,680
Yeah. Yeah.

535
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,040
My favorite is

536
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:40,160
like an imagineering panel, and they'll have Tony Baxter and Bob Gurr.

537
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,400
And Tony Baxter is, you know, talking about like imagination and story

538
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,320
and how it places you in the story.

539
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,480
And you're the character, you're the protagonist.

540
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,360
And then Bob Gurr and you ask him about the ride and he goes,

541
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,360
yeah, we wanted to make a fast, fun ride and we did it.

542
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:04,080
Like I made the ride and I spun it around and it didn't work at first,

543
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,160
but then it worked.

544
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,040
And I guess it's fun.

545
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,640
The total contrast is very fun and amusing.

546
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,920
And honestly, they're both viable like philosophies with a ride.

547
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,680
Like you need both of those brains to do creative work.

548
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,160
Yeah. God bless those people.

549
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,440
I also last night ended up on a video where

550
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,360
I think the video is called two hipsters try to interview Tommy Lee Jones.

551
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,320
And it's like two press junket guys are coming in

552
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,880
and asking all these highfalutin questions about character work.

553
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,040
And is Tommy Lee Jones's answer is just like, no, what are you talking about?

554
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,160
I play a character, I say the lines and I go home.

555
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,440
But would you ever want to like live as one of your characters for a day?

556
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,480
No, they're false. I want to be myself.

557
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,040
Yeah, I kind of like that that brutalism.

558
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,520
Not not everyone should be that way, but it's it's refreshing sometimes.

559
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:02,040
It is. Yeah. And it's interesting philosophies and everyone's process is different.

560
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,760
It's like the Lawrence Olivier line,

561
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,360
like Dustin Hoffman in Marathon Man had to show up really haggard looking and stuff

562
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,520
and it's seen. So he stayed up all night.

563
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,280
And Lawrence Olivier said, Dusty, have you tried acting?

564
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,280
I got him.

565
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,280
There's a there's a story.

566
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,880
I think it was Don Rickles told a story about he was working on some movie

567
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,000
with two actors, and I don't remember what the actors who they were.

568
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,160
And one of them was definitely like process and character and like

569
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,680
really laboring over it.

570
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,160
And the other one was like, just say the lines and let's go have a drink.

571
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,600
Just say the lines and let's go have a drink.

572
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,920
Like that's the like, who cares?

573
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,720
Let's get this over with.

574
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,920
And I love hearing like philosophical bullshit about people's work.

575
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,120
And I tend to think like that, too.

576
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,640
But, you know, ultimately, you can probably simplify and be like,

577
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,160
just say it with a voice that's loud and I'm going to say it said louder, faster, angrier.

578
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,880
Yeah. Ultimately, I do think a lot of that

579
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,400
process is to, you know, because the actual amount of time anyone spends

580
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:22,360
acting, unless you're in a play which runs for hours, the actual

581
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,720
process of like acting in front of TV or even doing like what we do,

582
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,720
doing the podcast isn't that long in the span of a week.

583
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,560
So you do have to fill the hours and convince your brain you're working like,

584
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,240
well, this this is good.

585
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,000
This is contributing to the 30 minutes when I do that.

586
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,880
But maybe you don't feel like you have to fill that time and make up that work

587
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,480
if you're 70 years old, an Oscar winner already mad.

588
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,960
Yeah. Maybe you stick to the ships in the bottle you love so much.

589
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,600
We like our we like our our process people and we like our cranks, too.

590
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,240
Yes. Cranks and process people.

591
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,760
Good balance favor of both of those.

592
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,560
Yeah. Yeah.

593
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,680
Skyway stuff.

594
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,600
Oh, yes. Jason, yes.

595
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,000
Well, Scott, I had some questions for you because I'm assuming

596
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,000
you rode the Disneyland Skyway more than Disney World.

597
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,480
Like I have thoughts and stuff a lot on the Disney World one.

598
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,720
But I wanted to ask, like, it feels like the skyway going through the Matterhorn

599
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:34,280
was one of those things that like, oh, this is probably grandfathered

600
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,720
in because the walls look very close to these buckets.

601
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,640
Oh, yeah, sure.

602
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,040
Um, yeah, I guess it was.

603
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,600
Yeah, it did feel very close.

604
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,360
Yeah, you definitely felt like you could reach out and touch that that rock,

605
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,160
although you shouldn't.

606
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,480
And, you know, there's there's problems with reaching out of the skyway,

607
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,120
which we'll get to, I imagine.

608
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,720
Yeah, even though the skyway opened first and it was open for a year

609
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,320
and then they closed it to build the Matterhorn, which is bizarre.

610
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,840
Yeah, so crazy.

611
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,520
They opened it and then like 18 months later, they're like, all right,

612
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,080
put it on the shelf almost immediately.

613
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,720
And then, yeah, and then they built the Matterhorn where the main support pillars

614
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:22,240
were for the sky like so that I guess the matter is like in the dead center

615
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,800
of the where the skyway track used to be.

616
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,120
Yeah. Well, there is a big beam on the old holiday hill

617
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,920
where everyone would go to neck the dirt grass mound.

618
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,400
Yeah, Disney really should bring back some sort of a dirt grass mound

619
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,280
so we can all neck so we can do we can do more necking at Disneyland.

620
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,960
Skyway seems like it'd be good for necking, you know?

621
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,560
Yeah, because yeah, yeah, I mean, people will be able to see it, though.

622
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,720
It's not as good as like Haunted Mansion. That's true.

623
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,160
It was you can do it is just that like, you know,

624
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,600
people are going to look up and see people necking.

625
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,480
It was gone by the time I was doing any necking.

626
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,160
I might my neck career had not began in 1994.

627
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,480
Um, now the opposite happened, of course.

628
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,280
And then I know we've talked about this and I don't remember what episode, but

629
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,880
in one of the I want to say before any of the any of the TGIF shows proper

630
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,120
got to Disneyland or Disney World and most of them went to Disney World.

631
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,800
It's actually rare to see a show at Disneyland.

632
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,920
Blossom went to Disneyland.

633
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,200
Oh, I think I talked about it on Great Moments with Mr.

634
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,760
Lincoln because one of the characters talks to Lincoln,

635
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,120
who I think sounds like a Brooklyn guy or something.

636
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,040
I don't know. Am I making that up?

637
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:44,040
Or is he just like, no, maybe he's still Lincoln, but just like, I'm bolted to the floor.

638
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,600
I don't remember it exactly.

639
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,760
Yeah, yeah, I'm not sure.

640
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:55,120
But anyway, the the opposite occurs where Blossom and Six are in a Skyway car

641
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,160
and they look down and see Blossom's boyfriend

642
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,720
wait, not not necking, but hugging another woman.

643
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,600
And they get mad and they throw ice

644
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,800
at the boyfriend, but then it turns out to be a sister, I believe.

645
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800
I think that's the story.

646
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,160
Cousin, I think. Oh, cousin. OK.

647
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,520
But again, I'm sure I said this before.

648
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,960
Sorry. Anyway, keep going.

649
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:29,280
I it's just so weird that they were willing to show that.

650
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,320
And then in the scene that they say,

651
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,360
like, you remember when we used to get up up here and throw ice at people.

652
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,760
So why would Disney agree to let them film a show or they encourage

653
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,440
throwing ice at people?

654
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,440
Yeah, that's yeah, that is weird.

655
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,920
Really off brand and off brand to let Lincoln talk.

656
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,600
And they might even call him the sky buckets.

657
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,120
I know they get some like facts wrong in that show.

658
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:56,080
There's definitely some like off brand stuff going on in that episode.

659
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,560
Really weird. It is refreshing because that's back when, you know, you

660
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,320
everything wasn't micromanaged quite as much.

661
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,640
So stuff would sneak through like that.

662
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,960
That doesn't happen in the modern family, like shoots at Disneyland era.

663
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,440
Right. They are big old instruction manuals before they can write a script.

664
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,720
You. Right.

665
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,360
The episode is about being safe on a ride and how good the ride is.

666
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,160
I assume. I assume I haven't seen these episodes.

667
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,200
But I don't know, is there well, so the

668
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,560
seeing the going through the Matterhorn and seeing the snowman in the middle,

669
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,320
that was that was sort of like a good middle beat of your

670
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,040
Skyway passage, no matter which way you were going.

671
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,480
Did you do you guys feel like the Disney World version was lacking at all

672
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,720
because there was not such a landmark in the middle?

673
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:51,560
Well, I'm going to I'm going to go out and say no, because for much of the time

674
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,600
of the Skyways life in Florida, you had

675
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,040
you had a lot of interesting stuff.

676
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,120
You didn't have a big like kind of set piece moment of going through a mountain,

677
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,160
but you got some amazing view of the twenty thousand leagues lagoon.

678
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,400
And yeah, I that that that looks incredible.

679
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,080
There's a lot of Disney World ride through on the Skyway

680
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,240
on YouTube.

681
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:25,360
And I think it is because it is one of the few rides that you can

682
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,360
you could in the late 90s pick up your brick of a camcorder

683
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,800
and get the whole ride and get some good footage.

684
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,640
And it's pretty clear because it's very sunny.

685
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:42,280
So like, but it's I mean, it's as good as standard deaf consumer video could be.

686
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,640
So it's also a little foggy, a little dreamlike.

687
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:51,440
But the big the big get for me was finding a 96 video

688
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:56,640
where you can hear like the people mover narration from the Skyway.

689
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,600
And then you go behind the Castle cake.

690
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,120
And yeah, this might have been the height of culture.

691
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,720
This might have been the high point.

692
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,680
The Castle cake in the Skyway, the Casper, right in the Skyway,

693
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,360
looking at the Castle cake, looking at twenty thousand leagues,

694
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,680
seeing the incomplete view of the Castle cake from behind.

695
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,280
See, yes. Now, they they should have followed the Steve Jobs

696
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,080
adage about like you've got to finish the back of the drawer, too.

697
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,120
You got to make the back, the very back of the drawer look good, too.

698
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:32,640
Especially if, you know, thousands of people are going to pass by the back of the drawer.

699
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,240
Yeah. But I found a lot.

700
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,800
I mean, clearly a lot of people took picture of like

701
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,720
of the Castle cake on the Skyway.

702
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,560
And yeah, I just loved it.

703
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,680
I have a very me story about it.

704
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,640
Oh, do you tell? Go ahead. Go ahead.

705
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,560
Yeah, I don't think I've told this on the show once.

706
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:58,240
So I think this would have been like ninety nine, like summer

707
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,600
ninety nine, like months before it closed.

708
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:06,480
When I would go down with my family, I mean, I would go pretty hard,

709
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,000
like sun up, sun down.

710
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,160
And eventually there would be a day where you would just hit a wall.

711
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,720
And we were in Fantasyland pretty early in the day.

712
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,440
And we were going to take the Skyway to Tomorrowland.

713
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,520
And I I had just started drinking occasionally iced coffee.

714
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,560
And I was like, I am I am not going to make it through this.

715
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,640
I need a little boost.

716
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,480
And so got out of the line and ran to the restaurant

717
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,160
right next to it to get an iced coffee.

718
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,440
But that took way too long.

719
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,000
So then I had to get back in line and weave through the line

720
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,320
with with a tiny cup of iced coffee.

721
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,040
And you have to think it's nineteen ninety nine.

722
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,360
So theme park iced coffee is probably mostly corn syrup.

723
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:01,840
And they did not think about lids and straws apparently back then.

724
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,840
So I am trying to find my family and guzzle this coffee

725
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,240
before I get on the Skyway, because it doesn't have a lid.

726
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,360
And they were I got there just in time.

727
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,320
It was like the the the Mark Twain Sunday

728
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,480
decades before decades later.

729
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,280
I relived the experience trying to get a Sunday before the Golden Horseshoe closed.

730
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:32,560
And I did it and I was probably just vibrating for hours after that.

731
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,200
Well, that's your idea. That's another one of your Ethan Hunt moments.

732
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,120
Yes, that's right.

733
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:44,360
He's a pursuit of treats and slow moving rides.

734
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,440
They should counteract each other, but you find a way to make them work.

735
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,720
That's right. I turned the Skyway into a thrill ride.

736
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,440
You were trying like when you were trying to finish

737
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,760
a whole birthday sheet cake and get on living with the land in 10 minutes flat.

738
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,600
Yeah, no one wanted any I offered.

739
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,000
Running through up,

740
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,960
got eating a sheet cake to get on living with the land before close

741
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,360
and one handed too, because I got to hold the sheet cake with the other hand.

742
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,680
So, yeah, of course.

743
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,920
But you did it. You made it.

744
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,560
I did it. Yeah.

745
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,440
I was about to I was about to home the Mission Impossible theme

746
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,520
and it was about to come out as the James Bond theme.

747
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,360
No, no, we went through this.

748
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,360
I know. I know. I can feel I'm confused.

749
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,320
Skyfall fallout.

750
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,560
You know, to mix up the metaphors more, I mean, I find all of this

751
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,360
to be like Indiana Jones barely escaping, but, you know,

752
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,400
reached through to grab his hat.

753
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,560
For sure. Yeah.

754
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,280
You know what Florida did have?

755
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,760
This is the real set piece was the turnabout station.

756
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,200
Hmm. Do tell.

757
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,280
Oh, well, much like the Skyliner has a point

758
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,520
where there is a station you do not get off at,

759
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:03,040
it is just purely mechanical for the path to curve.

760
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:07,600
So you can watch in the videos you had to.

761
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:12,000
There was a certain point where it's not it wasn't a straight line to Tomorrowland.

762
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,240
It had to curve slightly at one point.

763
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,160
So they had to readjust the cable.

764
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,120
So so you were when you were a child, you were excited about the turnabout station.

765
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,240
Well, it was just sort of like, well, look at this weird thing.

766
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,200
Look, look how strange there's a cast member waving at you.

767
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,160
Anyway, you can't get off here. Don't try to get up.

768
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,800
Oh, they would position a person.

769
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,640
There would usually be a person there.

770
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,760
Yeah. Keeping an eye on stuff.

771
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,440
I know what you mean, because it's so functional and unfriendly,

772
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,800
but they make it friendly with a little Wal-Mart greeter person.

773
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,640
I guess I would have felt the same way.

774
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,360
This is so like coldly mechanical to be in a theme park ride.

775
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,640
Yeah. I don't I I really have

776
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,880
very few memories of the Disney World one, the other than just like I see pictures

777
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,760
and I'm reminded of it because I think I went on it once when I was very little.

778
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,280
Maybe my first trip and then never again.

779
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,640
I think I went on it once.

780
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,880
And even when I was older and we went, I did not want to go on it.

781
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,520
So I have I have my memories of it

782
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,440
and from Disney World are just like one picture of me in it.

783
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,360
And I think I look a little distressed.

784
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,840
I'll ask my mom if she can find this picture.

785
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,320
Oh, you got it. Yes.

786
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,360
As much as your childhood content as we can get.

787
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,080
I hope it's as good. Yeah, I hope it's as good as I'm building it up.

788
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:43,360
There's also a possibility I went on one version of this at Six Flags Great America.

789
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,040
Yes. Hmm.

790
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,840
Well, let me see if that's in my chart.

791
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,640
I think it might be.

792
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,280
We OK.

793
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,800
We know California is great.

794
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,600
America is a different thing.

795
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,720
It might be closed, whatever you're talking about.

796
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,720
I think whatever I'm talking about is closed.

797
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,640
But so, yeah, so there's got to be something like that.

798
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,080
I always liked I always liked seeing it.

799
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,800
But I think it even stressed me out walking under it

800
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,480
because I was like, they're going to they're going to drop.

801
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,760
These are going to drop people like it's going to fall because look at that.

802
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,720
It's so thin. The cord is so thin.

803
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,160
The cable is thin.

804
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,160
It does. Yeah, it does feel weird.

805
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,800
It still is odd looking at it in anything like this.

806
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,600
The mechanics shouldn't make sense.

807
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:33,040
But obviously, there are not constant accidents on on Skyways,

808
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:38,760
on these Von Roll attractions or on on on ski resort chairlifts.

809
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,880
Well, this is once in a while, but mostly not.

810
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,600
This was one that Disney was the trend setter on,

811
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,360
because once they put this in Disneyland following that,

812
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:53,240
then they they've installed like hundreds of these in amusement parks

813
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,000
throughout the country.

814
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,680
And some of them, a lot of them gone, a lot of them gone because of,

815
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,320
you know, at the time, it was a very affordable way to get the the

816
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,000
oh, look, they have this at Disneyland and we have it, too.

817
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,520
But there's a lot of concerns about safety,

818
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:14,080
although not too many incidents at Disney.

819
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,080
That said, these the other thing is these things can get a little expensive to operate.

820
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,880
Yeah. I mean, just in my count of just the company

821
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,200
Von Roll that built the Disney one,

822
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,760
only that company alone, they there's they have built

823
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,200
30 that have since closed.

824
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,680
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

825
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,480
And there's a list.

826
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,080
I was reading a list of ones that they have.

827
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,480
They're still open. And that looks like I don't want to count again.

828
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,520
But, you know, maybe like 12 to 14.

829
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,880
So I'd so two thirds of these that were ever open

830
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,560
across the world are now closed. Wow.

831
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:55,080
The one that I think of in this not it's a little different, obviously.

832
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,320
It's much more shaped like a ski lift kind of thing is

833
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,720
Santa Cruz, the Santa Cruz boardwalk still has

834
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,320
a cable thing, but it's much more like a bench with a lap bar

835
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,000
that goes on down the boardwalk that looks like this.

836
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,880
Santa Cruz boardwalk, which I've been told multiple times.

837
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,000
There's stuff worth talking about. There's dark rides there.

838
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,040
I don't remember the details now, but we got to hit that at some point.

839
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,600
Yeah, I want to go there.

840
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,680
It's it's just it's it's that distance where it's like,

841
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,480
ah, a pain in the ass to get to in California.

842
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:33,360
Little bit anything over like any further than Vegas feels like a big commitment.

843
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,520
Yes. Yes. Yeah.

844
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:40,560
I was going to say, I do think probably I think in the Skyliner type,

845
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,760
the enclosed gondola, I think is very in vogue right now.

846
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,160
I think that's sort of the new version of this.

847
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,400
And I think that like Disney was looking at ways with Disney World

848
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,840
to increase mobility and do it not with some expensive thing.

849
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,200
And I think that it seems like

850
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:05,080
that's the enclosed version of this now is maybe going to be something

851
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,760
that other places look at. Universal, I think there's a rumor that

852
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,520
they were talking about a version of this for Orlando.

853
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,560
Jason, am I correct?

854
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,400
Well, yeah, I heard that rumor.

855
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,320
Some sort of unconventional

856
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,240
or like forward thinking transit system.

857
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:25,080
I think the only thing with something like this, like you hear them called

858
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:29,120
like urban gondolas, is to get from like the main universal campus

859
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,080
to the epic universe plot of land.

860
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:37,000
You would have to send it over I for sure.

861
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,600
So a little complicated once you start getting into crossing highways.

862
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,040
Oh, yeah. And is the city really going to be fine with them

863
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,120
like sending a gondola everywhere?

864
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,920
Yeah, I mean, they got all sorts of transits

865
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,720
because they're building these high speed rails, this Virgin rails in

866
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,960
Florida, where like, oh, there's going to be a stop

867
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,960
in front of the convention center, so effectively by Epic Universe.

868
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:07,120
And then there's talk about a stop at Disney World somewhere

869
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,400
and the airport.

870
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,640
So we'll see what happens in Orlando.

871
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:16,360
That's one thing with these is that, I mean, the Skyway, like the people

872
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,080
mover, is one of those in the monorail is one of those waltz attempts at,

873
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,200
you know, displaying a potentially

874
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:29,800
future forward thinking way of transporting, especially in a in a city.

875
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,640
It's like a it was like a backdoor pilot for efficient

876
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,120
travel in the actual world.

877
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:42,520
Yeah. The sort of an ulterior motive he had is trying to improve movement.

878
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:47,960
The city plan and the transportation planning,

879
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:53,160
because I was looking at that that really nice Tashin Disneyland book.

880
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,040
Yeah. To see if they said anything about the Skyway.

881
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:00,280
And there was this one little this this place that I'd never heard of

882
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,280
that they name check. They basically say that

883
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,640
the Skyway came out of all its fascination with ski lifts.

884
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,000
And he was interested in ski lifts because he was associated

885
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,200
with a place called the Sugar Bowl Ski Resort in Lake Tahoe.

886
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,120
Have you guys ever heard of this in Disney lore?

887
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,960
No, I feel like it comes up in relation to like Mineral King.

888
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:28,400
Yes, which I've never actually sat down and figured out what all that is about.

889
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,360
And his association with I don't know.

890
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,040
I know these phrases and a Squaw Valley and some Olympics thing.

891
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,400
And I don't really know the deal with any of that.

892
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,480
I just I know I've heard Mineral.

893
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,560
I know the Mineral King.

894
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:47,080
I mean, essentially a very nice ski resort, but also there'd be country bears.

895
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,560
There'd be shows.

896
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,880
So that's another one for our docket that that and Ford's Magic Skyway.

897
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,880
It sounds like heaven on earth.

898
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,760
My God. So, yes, secluded resort where you hang out with them.

899
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,680
Was this somewhere and was this in our fandom somewhere on a Facebook group

900
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,920
or something, but I didn't realize that

901
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,920
there was like a little mini country bear show at Fort Wilderness

902
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,200
in Disney World. Does this sound familiar to you, Mike?

903
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,720
That doesn't sound familiar.

904
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,120
I don't I didn't see that, at least on our face.

905
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,640
I'm not always checking our Facebook page, but sometimes.

906
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,160
But I don't think that's where that was.

907
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,480
Was that in like defunct land world or something?

908
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,440
I got I don't know.

909
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,440
Yeah, I think there was some mini country.

910
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,400
Oh, no, wait, I'm sorry.

911
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,040
It was a show with either the buffalo or the moose.

912
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:41,080
It was like there was one of those characters in the hotel.

913
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,520
They would do. Yeah, yeah.

914
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,880
I again, don't let me.

915
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,040
It was these things before I talk about them.

916
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,240
OK. Uh huh.

917
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,040
Melvin the Moose, it was the resort.

918
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,160
It was for breakfast. It was like a breakfast show.

919
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,600
Breakfast show like character was a character breakfast.

920
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,800
But I think he was also just on the wall there.

921
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,680
Yeah, here's a picture of it. Oh, it's a great photo

922
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,880
that makes it look like it's from 1960.

923
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,280
But of course, it was not.

924
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,880
But here I'm sending that to you guys now.

925
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:18,400
Oh, this is Wilderness Lodge or the maybe that's what I mean.

926
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,760
Fort Wilderness. This is Fort Wilderness.

927
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,880
Oh, OK. Oh, yeah, I do see that.

928
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,800
I mean, it's interesting.

929
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:28,760
Those early like lodging places all kind of had their own

930
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,200
little cultural stuff.

931
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:34,160
The Polynesians has hung along the longest.

932
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,920
But like contemporary used to have like Broadway cabaret ship.

933
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:43,000
Like people would fly down and do like shows and stuff.

934
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,040
It's like a dinner theater kind of thing.

935
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,600
And Helen Reddy,

936
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,200
yeah, like Tommy Toon doing a show up there.

937
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,680
And just all the chickens soaking in heavy cream you could want.

938
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,320
Gel gelatin gelatin laced goose.

939
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,880
Yes. Domestic wine that tastes like just awful.

940
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,320
It tastes like paint thinner gelatin goose.

941
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,520
Lemon wine.

942
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,000
70s food.

943
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,360
That's a whole episode, too.

944
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:22,800
We should just like look at a lot of menus from Disney places and like 71.

945
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,600
That's not a bad episode in general.

946
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,280
Yeah. Gel gelatin everywhere.

947
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,680
Yeah. I don't know why.

948
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,680
Next to like cottage cheese.

949
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,600
Do you feel like 70s?

950
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,640
Yeah. He's at a Jello and cottage cheese everywhere.

951
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,240
Yes. Cottage cheese for sure.

952
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:40,640
We we had a cottage cheese in the house, like I think all the time as a child.

953
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,680
I almost bought it.

954
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:47,200
Really? Well, I almost bought the like the yogurt version where the other

955
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:52,200
like a few weeks ago where you dump the like fruit, the fruit goo

956
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,800
into it, you know. Oh, interesting.

957
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,400
We would have we would definitely my mom would make us cottage cheese and yogurt.

958
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,760
Oh, that was what we would have.

959
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,280
It's funny you say that because obviously that and I haven't said that phrase out

960
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,680
loud in 20 years, but that is what yeah.

961
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,160
She would just give us a bowl of cottage cheese and yogurt.

962
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,080
You know, I double dairy.

963
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,880
That does remind me I was not a peanut butter and jelly kid,

964
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,600
but at my house, we liked cream cheese and jelly sandwiches.

965
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,760
Yes. Which is not.

966
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,680
I mean, that was just fast track to be in a chubby child.

967
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:32,960
I'll tell you what, a lot less nutrients than peanut butter.

968
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,080
A real fast.

969
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,000
Nothing helpful for you in that.

970
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,080
Nothing. A real fast pass, a fast pass to chubbiness.

971
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,520
Fast pass to be in a chubby child.

972
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,960
Isn't that looking back how?

973
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,640
Because I don't think you were genetically so.

974
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,080
Well, I don't know. I don't know what you were like at three or four.

975
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,520
But like and you're not now.

976
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:55,680
And so that you so when you were, it was because of your parents.

977
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:01,120
So if you were getting made fun of at school, it's like not you're doing in the least.

978
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:05,200
Yes. Well, I was a kid who was like, I'm not really big on fruit,

979
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,120
but I love potato chips, like just a recipe for disaster.

980
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,200
I mean, that's been me during the quarantine.

981
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,360
Well, that's true.

982
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:18,960
Yeah. But I mean, I've I've I like I've trimmed all of that down.

983
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,640
It's like, look, if you still want to go hog on cookies and ice cream, which I do,

984
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,160
I cut back all the other stuff.

985
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,120
I drink soda like so little.

986
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,440
Like that was a big one.

987
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:35,840
I I stopped drinking soda one summer in high school and I dropped like ten pounds immediately.

988
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,360
Yeah, I would have I mean, I like this would be a lunch.

989
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,920
I would have a liver sausage sandwich,

990
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,640
a package of Lay's potato chips,

991
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,600
like a carton of like two percent milk.

992
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:56,160
That was like kind of gross because like pieces of the carton

993
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,280
would have fallen off a little bit into the milk.

994
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:02,120
So you'd have to use a straw, like hopefully not get pieces of the carton.

995
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,840
And then two Swiss cake rolls like a package of two Swiss cake rolls.

996
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,040
Yeah. Swiss cake.

997
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:12,320
I mean, that was dessert after your healthy lunch of white bread sandwiches and chips.

998
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,360
White bread, liver sausage, chips,

999
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,800
disgusting milk and then a chocolate dessert.

1000
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:26,880
We I imagine I think all of us, every child between,

1001
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,680
you know, probably before.

1002
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:33,720
Let's let's go. But every child between like nineteen seventy two and two

1003
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,720
thousand three, I think just reeked.

1004
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:40,880
Is there just the gaseous, shittiest, like every element,

1005
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,320
every auditorium or cafeteria must have just been like,

1006
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:51,120
there was a kid who sat next to me and I think third grade

1007
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,200
and he smelled like baloney all day.

1008
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,560
And I don't know if that was just because he would have his lunch.

1009
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,680
That was, I think, baloney every day.

1010
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,440
But I was like, it's just the baloney smell so strong.

1011
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,600
And I would eat baloney, too.

1012
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,360
That would be in the rotation as well.

1013
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:11,600
A baloney sandwich, a liver sausage sandwich, peanut butter.

1014
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,040
And then once in a while, a turkey sandwich.

1015
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,720
But this kid was baloney smell 24 7.

1016
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,120
Towards the end of high school, I think everyone started carrying bottled

1017
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:26,440
water more or would get like opt for the bottle of water at lunch instead of milk.

1018
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,960
And I just remember going like, well,

1019
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,880
a lot more homework and getting into college is depressing.

1020
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:38,160
But I think I was dehydrated from K to 10th grade.

1021
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:43,160
I think I would just end the day totally logy and dehydrated

1022
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:47,480
from not having besides a sip of water at water fountains.

1023
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:53,800
Yes. And the water fountains were all gross as shit, like just like lukewarm.

1024
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:58,120
And like you smelled the metal when you were getting up close to take a drink.

1025
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,960
And like, yeah, you would barely have any of it.

1026
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,840
You might have a little after gym. Yeah.

1027
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,080
But you weren't having like a glass of water.

1028
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,560
You were just probably having like a lunch, a lunch milk.

1029
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,320
And that was it.

1030
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:15,080
The years you just described, Jason, this is a breakthrough because all those years

1031
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:20,040
I feel the same way. And I had just a beet red face all of that time.

1032
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,040
So much so that I thought I genuinely had the condition rosacea,

1033
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,320
which I don't have today.

1034
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,720
And I think it might be because I drink water. Yes.

1035
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:35,080
Water is gross for the older generation, I think, still a section of it.

1036
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,920
It's funny. I know this is correct.

1037
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,840
I know I'm doing the right thing, but having a very young baby right now,

1038
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,880
I'm like, you don't give them water.

1039
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,840
So does it seem right?

1040
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,080
It's like they need water, right?

1041
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,000
But I mean, I know that's not how babies work.

1042
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,080
It's just weird. Yeah. Yeah.

1043
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,440
You know, it's all it's funny how like this isn't like 300 years

1044
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,000
we're talking like 300 years ago.

1045
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,600
It was what? Ten, 20.

1046
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,520
And I know not long ago at all.

1047
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,560
Well, it just goes to show that stuff can be, you know, stuff

1048
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,760
that you think is true now can be overturned very quickly,

1049
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,480
which is why I'm not vaccinating this child whatsoever.

1050
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,960
Well, I don't know.

1051
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,920
I don't know. This is a time to go around bragging about.

1052
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,800
Well, we've watched everyone freak out about the sham disease

1053
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:24,760
that's locked us, prisoned us in our homes for so long.

1054
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,600
Why would I vaccinate this boy?

1055
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:31,040
Huh? Well, we're going to do an episode where we explore that on the Patreon.

1056
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,640
And we'll get to that later.

1057
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:37,480
Well, the sky the sky boys also get into blue skying

1058
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,800
a better world where we have more freedoms.

1059
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,320
The sky sky sky trails.

1060
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,240
Did you say sky boy?

1061
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,680
Did you say sky boys?

1062
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,520
Oh, wait, what are we talking about? Sky guys?

1063
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,880
Guys. Yeah. Yeah.

1064
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,720
That's your son is the sky boy.

1065
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,720
Hey, look at the sky boy over there.

1066
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,960
That's how he gets to Neverland.

1067
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,840
No, no, no. He cannot fly.

1068
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,440
You have that.

1069
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,320
I will teach him the song.

1070
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,520
You cannot fly. You cannot fly. You cannot fly.

1071
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,000
No pan.

1072
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,960
OK, wait, but let's go back into the sky.

1073
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:18,720
Let's go in the sky into a ski lift, a ski lift at the Sugar Bowl ski resort

1074
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,080
in Lake Tahoe.

1075
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:24,680
There's one of the strangest avenues of Walt's dry fact I've ever heard,

1076
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,320
but it's I found it to be such a strange rabbit hole.

1077
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:32,000
So Walt's in the 30s took a trip to Yosemite.

1078
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,520
There was a guy who is a ski instructor who is just a world class,

1079
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:40,600
like one of the great skiers in the world, apparently named Hannes Schroll.

1080
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,840
And he was not only a major skier, he was a major yodeler.

1081
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:49,040
And he would do his jumps while yodeling,

1082
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,760
just so you'd be doing you'd be doing your ski thing.

1083
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,120
And then you just hear this yodel booming across the mountain.

1084
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:58,000
And it's this guy. He's kind of crazy, sort of a kook,

1085
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,320
you know, an Austrian guy and proud of it and, you know,

1086
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:06,160
just kind of like spirited weird guy who, you know, helped since, you know,

1087
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,080
helped to walk, get more interested in skiing.

1088
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,560
And they met, really got along, stayed in contact.

1089
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:16,400
And then this guy wanted to build a ski resort, started building a ski resort

1090
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,240
in Lake Tahoe. And as he did so,

1091
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:25,160
Austria got annexed by Hitler and all his money got locked up.

1092
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,280
So he didn't have the money he needed to finish his resort.

1093
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:32,720
He reached out to people he knew with a lot of money, such as Walt Bisney,

1094
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,520
who paid him the vast fortune of twenty five hundred dollars,

1095
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:41,920
which apparently went a long way in the 30s and helped this guy

1096
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,680
finish this resort.

1097
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:47,600
So indebted was this person to Walt

1098
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:51,880
that he renamed what used to be one of the two mountains

1099
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,280
that were part of this property.

1100
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,200
It was called Hemlock Peak, and he renamed it Mount Disney.

1101
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:01,040
Well, I had no idea about this in Lake Tahoe.

1102
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,160
In our state, there is a Mount Disney.

1103
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,720
Wow. I didn't know either.

1104
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,160
Yeah, never heard any of this.

1105
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,640
Clearly now something we have to do before the podcast is over is go ski Mount

1106
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,280
Disney. Yeah, really?

1107
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:19,080
But so one of the strange things about it was some of the Walt funds

1108
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:24,960
went to building a chairlift, which was the open in 1939

1109
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:30,080
and was the first chairlift installed in California was up and down Mount Disney.

1110
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:33,000
And when Walt went to check it out, he was so fascinated by it

1111
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,920
and the mechanics of it and was like, we should have something like this in the parks.

1112
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,920
Wow. That's interesting.

1113
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,920
Yeah, all a weird, interesting run in with this guy.

1114
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,040
But it it doesn't quite stop there because there's one there's one more little thing

1115
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,680
right around this time because of his interaction with Hannes.

1116
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:53,560
Walt is Walt loves skiing and he starts to make a cartoon about skiing,

1117
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:57,160
a cartoon starring Goofy, the art of skiing,

1118
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:01,440
which was the first of the goofy instructional cartoons.

1119
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:06,640
And he thought a cool thing for this might be to have a bunch of yodeling

1120
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,440
strung through the short.

1121
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:11,880
So he contacted Hannes and said, would you like to do some yodeling?

1122
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,880
It just is kind of the score for this thing.

1123
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:17,560
And he did. And if you listen, if you watch that that short, which is on Disney Plus,

1124
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:22,240
it's this this guy, the guy who built this chairlift and established Mount Disney.

1125
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,000
And not only that, while he was in the V.O.

1126
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:30,080
booth, because this guy did all these crazy yells and yodels while he skied,

1127
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,040
he said, you want to try some other stuff?

1128
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,160
And he did. And he made the sound.

1129
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,960
Yahoo, the goofy holler.

1130
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:43,640
It was the goofy holler was not done by the voice of Goofy Pinto

1131
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:47,480
Colvin was done by this this yodeler skier guy. Wow.

1132
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,120
And that sound is in all of the goofy cartoons.

1133
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,680
And now it's like something you expect out of Goofy.

1134
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,240
But it was done by this guy and it was done for zero dollars.

1135
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,800
Walt tricked him. Oh, Walt.

1136
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:05,720
Yeah. The like the iconic goofy sound was done for free.

1137
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:09,400
Wow. Yes, that's anytime Goofy gets hurt.

1138
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,040
You want to hear that yell?

1139
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:16,200
Yes. And now in the current voice, Bill Farmer learned how to do it.

1140
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,800
He like that's like part of the repertoire and he can demonstrate how to do it.

1141
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:23,760
And he talks in interviews about how it was this guy who who cracked it.

1142
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,400
Wow. Yeah, interesting.

1143
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,480
All of that, all of Walt's like interests, it all spreads out

1144
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,360
through the whole history of the company.

1145
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,240
Like he loves like nothing is random.

1146
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,000
They all like fine.

1147
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,680
He found a way to incorporate all of his interests somewhere. Right.

1148
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:42,840
Although, when people would probably just white knuckling it,

1149
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:47,360
when Walt would go on vacation, they're like, oh, God, what's he going to come back with now?

1150
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:51,800
What's what sort of whirly bird gizmo is he going to be like?

1151
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,960
Build me one of these five stories tall.

1152
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,160
Yeah, that is true.

1153
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:00,200
I think that is in that what he was about the Matterhorn or something

1154
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,240
where he was like, build me one of these boys.

1155
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,000
The Matterhorn, the petrified tree will buy that.

1156
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,560
He was just like, buy it, send it to Disneyland.

1157
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,680
Just anywhere he would go.

1158
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,840
Yeah. Yeah.

1159
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,520
What would be the biggest problem to figure out?

1160
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,880
I mean, if I guess if he, you know, anything dangerous,

1161
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,880
if he saw like sword swallowers or something.

1162
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:26,040
Yeah. Figure out how to figure out how to inject swords into the guest's mouths.

1163
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,920
Yeah. Or like he went to the Grand Canyon and was like,

1164
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:31,600
dig a big hole in Disneyland to get rid of it all.

1165
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,760
I want a big hole. I want a big hole.

1166
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:38,240
Yeah, it's probably less dangerous, more just frustrating stuff.

1167
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,360
Like I want the streets of New Orleans in this park.

1168
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,120
And it's like, oh, man.

1169
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,800
Like, what? All right.

1170
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,240
Just make them little fine.

1171
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,160
Yeah, make them smaller.

1172
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:53,640
But he said they had to be like full size and they have to be the exact same size

1173
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:54,880
as the streets he went.

1174
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,080
Yeah, but just build it this way.

1175
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,280
And maybe he won't notice.

1176
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,280
He'll forget about it.

1177
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:04,400
We have to build northern lights here and they can't be done with lamps.

1178
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:10,360
Walt says we need to harness real sky power.

1179
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:13,440
Disneyland needs its own sun.

1180
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,720
We don't even know what he means by that.

1181
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:19,920
He wants his own functioning sun and he wants that.

1182
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,120
He wants to control the tides somehow.

1183
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:26,840
Does it have to block the regular sun or can it work in conjunction with it?

1184
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:32,240
No, he wants he wants he wants two sons, the real one and a fake one.

1185
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:38,440
Does it go opposite the regular sun?

1186
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:43,080
He didn't say he didn't say he just said he just said he wanted one and left.

1187
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,960
I'm afraid we're going to start doing it and then it'll be the opposite of what he wants.

1188
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,120
And he asked if I was wanting to join a union.

1189
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,400
And I said, of course, no.

1190
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,440
And then he left good. And then he left.

1191
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,200
He just walked out.

1192
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,920
And I don't even know anything about mechanics.

1193
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,680
I'm his paperboy.

1194
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:02,320
I got to build a I got to build an artificial heat source in the sky.

1195
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,520
He did, though, that paperboy.

1196
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:10,680
And that paperboy's name was Bob Gurr.

1197
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,160
That's right. And you overlook that.

1198
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:19,320
Disneyland's second son for the first four months of operation,

1199
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:23,320
which which crashed to the ground and crushed the original castle

1200
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,640
that the variable from scratch. Right.

1201
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:28,400
Yeah, that's a little that little known fact about it.

1202
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:33,640
Don't believe any of those weird Facebook posts you see about the

1203
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,800
grandchildren of the people who were crushed.

1204
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,640
They're all liars and truthers.

1205
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,280
Yeah, I'd never have no one died.

1206
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,720
What are they talking about? Yeah, that's yeah.

1207
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,000
Don't Facebook is a cesspool.

1208
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:48,920
Obviously, yes.

1209
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:51,560
For that reason and that reason alone, Disneyland rumors.

1210
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,800
I don't know anything else about anything else.

1211
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,480
I don't know what's going on.

1212
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,520
But I know the Disneyland rumors and memes are out of control.

1213
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,280
Except our Facebook group, which is nice and good.

1214
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,520
And you should it is and go join it.

1215
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:07,600
And they'll save me a plug for the end of the show.

1216
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,040
Speaking of

1217
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:14,400
danger at Disneyland,

1218
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:19,040
the this attraction ultimately closed in 1994.

1219
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,760
And it's a little muddy why it did,

1220
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:27,200
because and I you'll definitely listen to people who say,

1221
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,440
well, somebody fell out of the thing into a tree.

1222
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,720
And so they had to close it.

1223
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:35,080
You will maybe even hear people say somebody fell out of it and died.

1224
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,120
And thus they had to close it.

1225
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:40,200
And I imagine we all looked into this a little bit.

1226
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:44,160
Yeah. And found what hopefully is the the truth behind it,

1227
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,680
which is certainly that nobody died.

1228
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,960
OK, well, someone did die.

1229
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,640
What? No, not at all.

1230
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,800
I'm sorry. Well, not the what is in 94.

1231
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,080
Nobody died. Not 94.

1232
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,720
No, not 94. It was far more boring.

1233
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,200
No, I'd explain.

1234
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:06,200
No, sorry. The reason they closed it, it seemed like it seemed like money stuff.

1235
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,680
It seemed like they got on a trend, especially,

1236
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,160
well, I guess more in Florida, where when a new thing would open,

1237
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,440
they would close an old thing.

1238
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,600
Yeah, which in this case, in Disneyland,

1239
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:23,040
it seemed to be an Indiana Jones adventure

1240
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,800
based closure. And it's not like it was one to one.

1241
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:30,120
It's not like all the Skyway employees went over to Indiana Jones.

1242
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,920
It's just kind of, well, if we're going to increase cost over here,

1243
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,240
we have to cut costs somewhere else.

1244
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,960
Right. They were talking about maybe even like changing it

1245
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,640
and increasing the amount of people that could be on one car.

1246
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:42,840
Oh, really? Like sick.

1247
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:45,000
They were going to see if they could do six.

1248
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,400
Well, but I think ultimately they just were like,

1249
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:51,640
low hourly capacity and expensive to run.

1250
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,040
Mm hmm. OK. Factors. Sure.

1251
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:58,280
And it does. I mean, like the incident you're talking about,

1252
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,360
somebody slipped out of it.

1253
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:03,320
And some people like they think it was on purpose.

1254
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:08,880
Well, if maybe the the the falling wasn't on purpose,

1255
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,560
unless he was just like fishing for a lawsuit or something.

1256
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:16,760
But when the when the lawsuit happened, it seemed like an accident.

1257
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:20,160
It seemed like maybe he leaned against the door and fell out of the door.

1258
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:24,960
But what counteracts that is that the handle on the outside is such

1259
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:29,280
that you'd have to reach around and grab it and unlock it

1260
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,800
and fiddle with it before it to open at all.

1261
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,080
Like you could not open it from the inside.

1262
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:38,440
And then I think there was actually video from a guest of him

1263
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,040
fiddling with the handle, too.

1264
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:44,200
So for sure, he reached outside and did it to himself.

1265
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:49,200
Right. So I would assume like all these factors maybe add up to like,

1266
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,720
you know, maybe the ride isn't like so secure.

1267
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,280
Yeah. Like and in addition to what its low capacity and money and blah, blah, blah.

1268
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:01,520
They're like, yeah, maybe not worth it.

1269
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,320
Not worth it. I found a good little quote, though.

1270
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,840
I was just talking about Austria.

1271
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:12,480
And here's a quote from a German tourist, Burget Klein.

1272
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,200
I forget what article I found this in, but maybe in the L.A.

1273
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,840
Times about about the accident.

1274
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,640
And just somebody ran him at Disneyland.

1275
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:22,280
They were talking to like, are you upset about this this accident?

1276
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,160
Does it make you worried about going on any of these rides?

1277
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:28,160
And she said, well, while the man's fall was unfortunate,

1278
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:32,600
well, actually, sorry, the article says while the man's fall was unfortunate,

1279
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,560
it would not have dampened her frolicking.

1280
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:38,280
Nothing too terrible can happen on such a wonderful day, said Klein,

1281
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:41,360
slurping on a strawberry ice cream in the parking lot.

1282
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,600
Delightful. I imagine she skipped away.

1283
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,960
Gladden leads it later, Hosen.

1284
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,520
Nothing can dampen my fro.

1285
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,040
What was it? Dampen my frolicking?

1286
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:56,360
Yeah, I can't honestly say this was her quote.

1287
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:59,560
I wish it was like nothing could dampen my frolicking.

1288
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,760
Jason, if you could say that from now on.

1289
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:06,320
Oh, nothing will dampen my frolicking.

1290
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:09,760
Yeah. If that could just be sort of in your repertoire of phrases.

1291
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,080
Yeah, got it. We'll do.

1292
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,800
All right. Great lodged in there.

1293
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,720
Surprised us with it when we at least expect.

1294
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:20,200
What what I came across for the closure,

1295
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:26,840
it seems like, you know, a lot of people talk about the ADA issues.

1296
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:30,160
But because it was so old, it was grandfathered in.

1297
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:34,240
So that was like not the front at the front of their minds.

1298
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:37,080
The other excuse was stress fractures

1299
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:44,040
inside the Matterhorn supports and metal fatigue at various spots.

1300
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,960
Well, people kind of sounds like bullshit.

1301
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:51,040
Well, but also, though, I've read that the Matterhorn is kind of falling apart.

1302
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:54,160
I mean, there was a piece not long ago that just fell down.

1303
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,480
Yes. On the track.

1304
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:59,480
So from what I've read and understand,

1305
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:02,120
and you know, it's probably from some message board,

1306
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,520
Mice Town dot net.

1307
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,720
I don't remember which one it is

1308
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:14,000
that I think the Matterhorn will have to be torn down within the next like 25 years.

1309
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:15,800
Like it's decaying.

1310
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:18,400
So they'll have to rebuild it or put something else there.

1311
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,800
Oh, my God. So I don't know.

1312
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:24,360
I don't know if this is 100 percent true, but it does seem like the building

1313
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,400
might be falling apart anyway, so there might be some truth to that as well.

1314
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,800
Oh, this is that's pretty crazy.

1315
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:34,240
Do you think it's do you think they can take it down in an implosion

1316
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:38,200
kind of way? Because I love implosions when they blow up,

1317
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,240
you know, Vegas casinos to build new ones.

1318
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:45,160
But maybe it's not maybe it's built in such too weird of a way to do that.

1319
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:49,240
I wonder. Yeah, I don't know if that's the way to do it.

1320
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,280
I feel like stuff is pretty close to it

1321
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:56,960
that you might not want to chance something flying and hitting something else,

1322
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:00,040
but maybe a tiny implosion.

1323
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:00,840
I don't know. I don't know.

1324
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,640
I don't know if there's a size you have to have for an implosion.

1325
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:08,240
But it would be I also think like with buildings sometimes,

1326
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:12,000
I don't know, like a building is,

1327
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:17,600
you know, structured in a certain way and maybe like a symmetrical way

1328
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,320
that leads to a very organized implosion.

1329
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,160
Oh, that's a good point.

1330
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:25,480
Yes, because all the floors are identical and there's probably a center

1331
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:31,960
and elevator banks and the matterhorns very like chaotic and fake natural.

1332
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:37,520
So I could be wrong, but I feel like we're not going to get a crazy matterhorn

1333
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:40,360
implosion in the next 25 years.

1334
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:44,920
I think it'll have to be like taken apart in a much slower manner,

1335
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,000
though that would be fun.

1336
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,480
It would be fun if they sort of made

1337
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:54,000
like a phantasmag show or one of the firework performances

1338
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:57,000
culminate in the matterhorn blowing up.

1339
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,560
Yeah, yes, yes.

1340
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:03,120
An AP event to go watch the matterhorn blow up.

1341
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:04,880
Oh, and here. Oh, oh.

1342
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:08,400
And like the like this like the sword in the stone,

1343
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:11,640
you have a bunch of kids go up to like a TNT box.

1344
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:16,000
And like maybe they don't like it doesn't push down for every kid,

1345
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:21,480
but then one special kid pushes down on the TNT box and it blows up the matterhorn.

1346
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,200
Oh, yes, yes.

1347
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:28,040
Like the knots, those knots TNT boxes over at their their.

1348
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:29,600
I can't think of the name of it.

1349
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,280
The rapids ride, the river rapids.

1350
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,320
Yeah, Calico River, Calico River Rapids.

1351
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:37,160
And if they I don't want to endanger anybody,

1352
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:40,680
but if they could do one last Tinkerbell flight

1353
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:45,600
from there within like five minutes of the blow up.

1354
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,520
So it's so it seems like Tinkerbell escaping.

1355
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,280
Oh, it should be like Mission Impossible.

1356
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:54,800
The first one when Ethan is puts the gum on the helicopter

1357
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:58,360
and blows it up and he like shoots off of the helicopter

1358
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:01,760
from the explosion and lands on the train. Yeah.

1359
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,400
It should be like something like that.

1360
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:08,080
Yeah. And I almost don't, you know, look, I as I've established,

1361
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,720
I'm not the biggest Peter Pan fan, so I don't even know if I want to give

1362
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,880
such a cool moment to Tinkerbell.

1363
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,080
I kind of want this to be Mickey Mouse.

1364
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:17,240
I want to be the man himself.

1365
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,520
Red light, green light.

1366
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:26,080
So OK, so Mickey is going to fly on a wire now.

1367
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:27,880
Does he have a jetpack?

1368
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,880
Does he have like a jetpack or something?

1369
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,840
Because you have to Tinkerbell can fly, so that's why she flies.

1370
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:37,640
Space Mickey, Space Man Mickey, the silver suit with the fishbowl.

1371
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,760
Yes, yes. Bring that back. Absolutely.

1372
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,440
OK, that's good.

1373
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,560
I mean, I guess he could.

1374
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,720
You know what? I guess he also he could still be space.

1375
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:49,000
Mickey, I guess he could just scale the Matterhorn.

1376
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:53,040
And then the wire is him flying away as it blows up.

1377
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:56,560
Yeah, it's just Mickey is just becoming Dr. Oppenheimer.

1378
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,280
I've become death destroyer of worlds.

1379
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,760
Just watching it from a distance.

1380
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,800
I built this. I can destroy it.

1381
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:10,200
I like create life. I take it away.

1382
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:14,040
I would be I'm a little concerned because I watched a document,

1383
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:18,560
a short documentary on YouTube recently about one of the last standing

1384
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:23,680
casinos invade like old, old casinos that they blew up maybe three years ago.

1385
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:29,720
And it had multiple towers and the older tower they found asbestos in.

1386
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,480
And they're like, OK, we can't blow that one up tonight.

1387
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:36,320
We ought to just do the one and then we'll do that one another time.

1388
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:41,120
Unfortunately, the tower they did blew up hit the asbestos tower

1389
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,240
and released asbestos into the air.

1390
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:46,760
Oh, no. Do you know what show Tellus was?

1391
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:50,160
Oh, God, I forget. Let me I'll try and find it.

1392
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:53,680
Oh, man. That's I think we've talked about this.

1393
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:57,320
Can we do an episode about Vegas implosions?

1394
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,680
This has been an obsession of mine for so long.

1395
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:03,400
And the fact that they as I'm sure I've said before, one of the great

1396
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:09,280
Jason, you said the peak of culture was seeing the castle cake from the skyway.

1397
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:14,120
Yeah. And well, right around the same time was when the Treasure Island

1398
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:18,840
pilot pirates blew up whatever hotel was on.

1399
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:23,280
What is the now the Bellagio spot, which was I we discovered also

1400
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:27,640
in a made for TV movie starring Steve Wynn or where he acts.

1401
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:31,760
I and then another one of these implosions is in Mars attacks.

1402
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,960
I mean, like when they use the implosions in other things

1403
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:38,560
and the news would do a full like two hours on it,

1404
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,640
just the greatest television ever.

1405
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:47,320
Emmys every year should still be given to 90s Vegas implosion coverage.

1406
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:52,320
Yeah, I mean, I have not actually had that as much of an active thought,

1407
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,240
but I know exactly what you're saying.

1408
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:57,400
But I haven't like it wasn't in the forefront of my mind.

1409
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,280
But as you're saying that, yes, I do have a lot of affection

1410
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,440
for all this, these implosions.

1411
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:02,120
It's so great.

1412
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:06,240
And we're obviously also terrified by buildings exploding.

1413
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:09,200
I mean, what could be scarier than that sort of do it on purpose

1414
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,880
to wrangle it ourselves and have no one get hurt

1415
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:15,920
except for when asbestos was released into the Vegas area.

1416
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,320
It was the Riviera.

1417
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,480
It was the Riviera a few years ago.

1418
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,680
Wait, what? This wasn't in the 90s.

1419
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:26,880
This is the recent blow up of the Riviera.

1420
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:28,720
That was just there.

1421
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:31,400
I was I was in that not long ago.

1422
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,480
I think it was 2016, 20.

1423
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,520
This was uploaded in like 2060.

1424
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,640
It's a local news like documentary.

1425
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,800
Wow. Oh, my God.

1426
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,720
That's so stupid.

1427
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:46,480
I was I was sure this was these were heathens

1428
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:52,760
who didn't know better in 83, not did just happened.

1429
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,520
I didn't I didn't know when I went to Vegas.

1430
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,160
I was like, what is that white building?

1431
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:00,640
And I'm like, the Tropicana is still standing like the like that.

1432
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,680
I feel like is one of the handful of ones left.

1433
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:07,400
And there's a Tropicana in Atlantic City, but a totally different

1434
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,120
like logo and aesthetics.

1435
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:13,240
So I they might be owned by the same people, but you never know.

1436
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,120
Feels feels very old.

1437
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:19,080
Yeah, that you feel the 60s in that building. Yeah.

1438
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:22,720
Wow. OK, well, that's a feature one.

1439
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:24,560
I'd love to do that. Were we on some other point?

1440
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,040
We're talking about taking it down.

1441
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:28,480
Oh, wait, sorry, Jason, somebody not to dwell on it,

1442
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,600
but somebody died in the in Disney World.

1443
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:34,800
Yeah. So I mean, the Disney World closure happened in 99,

1444
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,760
like five years after Disneyland.

1445
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:40,920
And it seemed like a pretty similar sort of,

1446
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,520
you know, we're building new stuff.

1447
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,240
So we're going to close old stuff.

1448
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:51,040
And there was it was like a cast member either fell or was knocked off

1449
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,760
the like loading area

1450
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,800
in Fantasyland, I believe.

1451
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,960
So that did happen.

1452
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:07,720
But otherwise, these operated for decades, seemingly without incident.

1453
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:12,120
It seemed like it was a workplace

1454
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:16,240
death in Florida, but it was really just kind of like the

1455
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:21,200
in a string of stuff being torn down at the Magic Kingdom in Florida

1456
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:24,520
between Mr. Toads and 20,000 Leeds and the Skyway.

1457
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:30,040
And most of it just cost cutting, like less concerns about safety,

1458
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,600
more concerns about cost cutting.

1459
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,680
And they're like, well, we're closing this,

1460
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:38,120
but we're going to open something real soon, something new.

1461
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:43,800
And Yesterland noted that, however, no new attraction

1462
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:48,680
came to the Magic Kingdom Park until May 23rd, 2001,

1463
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:53,040
when the Magic Carpets of Aladdin opened in Adventureland,

1464
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,400
which is such a fuck you.

1465
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:00,640
Can you can we how can we describe the Magic Carpets?

1466
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:06,280
Well, it's like it's like Dumbo, but Magic Carpets like worst Dumbo.

1467
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:07,880
Yeah. Yeah.

1468
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:12,960
Just like tossed in there, barely themed in a bad way of barely themes,

1469
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,240
not like the Skyway.

1470
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:20,800
Or Dumbo, I mean, Dumbo is like, like, I guess, well, Dumbo is

1471
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:24,040
a little bit a little bit of design work there.

1472
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,480
Yeah. Yeah.

1473
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:29,720
And we went on Dumbo not long ago, and I was like, I'm going to fall out of this.

1474
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,480
I am sliding to the side.

1475
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:34,920
I am going to fall out.

1476
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,480
Oh, yeah, you do lean. Yeah.

1477
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:40,000
And if you go all the way down, it feels like you could just tumble real easy.

1478
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:42,120
And especially if you're an adult man.

1479
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:47,120
Like I'm all my center of gravity is a little higher here.

1480
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:50,720
Yeah, we just feel like an SUV tipping over.

1481
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,800
Yeah, right. I'm like an SUV.

1482
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:56,160
I can tip over at any moment. I'm so tall.

1483
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:04,480
I yeah. Well, in terms of in terms of accidents, which were, you know,

1484
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,160
there were there weren't a lot until the 90s.

1485
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:11,800
It was more just high jinx, much like Blossom.

1486
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:15,040
I think there was a lot of spitting.

1487
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:18,760
I think I said in the Matterhorn episode, my my now father-in-law,

1488
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:22,360
when he was younger, threw a smoke bomb into the Matterhorn,

1489
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,720
which is a thing that would put him in jail for years for terrorism.

1490
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,200
Yes. He'd be on the list.

1491
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:31,800
In this case, he just did it without incident and was really, really satisfied

1492
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:35,400
with himself, but then got to the station and there was just a very stern

1493
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,680
security guard waiting for him, knew exactly who it was.

1494
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:44,640
In the book More Mouse Tales by David Koenig, I saw a story about

1495
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:52,680
what was that? I think a guy I think I think a kid spit down from the Matterhorn

1496
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:55,960
or, you know, just from the skyway somewhere,

1497
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:00,920
landed on a pretty like buff guy who then just ran to the station

1498
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:04,440
and just waited right there for the kid to show up.

1499
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:08,760
And as soon as he walked out, like just went in to beat him up.

1500
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,560
Security had to break it up.

1501
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:14,800
Luckily, this kid did not get not get brutalized.

1502
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:21,160
Gosh, it's so funny because like, I was so scared to do anything like that

1503
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:24,840
in real life, let alone in like the happiest place on Earth.

1504
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:25,880
I couldn't even imagine.

1505
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,440
Yeah, yes, truly.

1506
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:31,160
An extra level of fear I would have of like,

1507
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:34,080
and then the people at the park theme park will be mad at me.

1508
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:39,240
Yeah, because you can't end up on some list that doesn't let you come into Disney.

1509
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:43,720
No, it felt like you were in like heaven and God was watching you

1510
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,920
if you were in Disneyland, like you're right here.

1511
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,760
How is he? Mickey will see me.

1512
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:54,040
My God, Mickey, I make life, I can take it away.

1513
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,280
You just have to go to Disney Confession.

1514
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:01,760
Oh, yeah, which I guess is this podcast.

1515
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:06,160
We're doing here.

1516
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,920
I'm confessing our sins.

1517
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:11,680
One of the one of the more notable rabble

1518
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:19,160
rousers in Skyway history was future president Barack Obama.

1519
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:20,920
And we talked about this before.

1520
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,120
I feel like we have.

1521
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:26,440
But does this ring a bell, the the Obama Skyway incident?

1522
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:28,880
No, no, have we not?

1523
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:31,200
Oh, my God, I don't think so.

1524
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:36,080
So he did some event in Anaheim a couple of years ago,

1525
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:41,600
and he said he's been here before because he went to Disneyland in the 80s

1526
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:46,920
when he was attending Occidental College in Eagle Rock, California.

1527
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:53,360
So which so what the story was that he

1528
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:55,560
I mean, it was I think was just that he smoked.

1529
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:57,640
He just smoked on the skyway.

1530
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,960
That was possible.

1531
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:05,200
And, you know, what you just described, Mike, your fear story did not come true.

1532
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:08,480
He just like got back to the station, much like my father in law.

1533
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,800
There was a guy waiting for him, said, Sir, come with me.

1534
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,640
He and his group were escorted straight out of the park.

1535
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:16,920
But they did on the way out say, come back any time you want.

1536
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:20,440
Oh, I do. Yes. OK. Yeah.

1537
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,280
Yeah, this does seem familiar.

1538
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:25,240
I forget if we if we've talked about it before.

1539
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:28,840
But one thing that I like a lot about this

1540
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:32,640
is that he declares, you know,

1541
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:37,320
and I guess what is sort of like a attempt and a posture to be cool,

1542
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:40,160
but one that works on me because of what he's talking about.

1543
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:45,400
He's he's make sure to say he was not in Disneyland for rides or kid stuff.

1544
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,160
He was there to see cool in the game.

1545
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:51,080
Which I think that's very cool.

1546
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:55,240
And I started thinking about this like, I wonder, could you place the exact

1547
01:26:56,240 --> 01:27:00,040
date that this was when he saw cool in the gang?

1548
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,200
And I attempted to do this.

1549
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:05,200
He went to Occidental from 79 to 81.

1550
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,880
And I looked up cool.

1551
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:10,920
Cooling the gang played Disneyland a number of times in that era.

1552
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,720
But it was mostly grad nights.

1553
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:15,400
And to go to grad night, you have to be a high schooler.

1554
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:18,760
And if Obama was in college, the only way he would have gotten into that

1555
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,880
is if he was dating a high schooler.

1556
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:26,120
So I became concerned that Obama was dating a high schooler at the time.

1557
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:29,080
Luckily, he overturned this theory.

1558
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,280
I don't want to put that out there.

1559
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:33,160
I'm not accusing him of that because I found out about another event

1560
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:35,280
called Saturday Nights in the Park.

1561
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:39,440
There was a thing called Saturday Night Pop on June 6th, 1981,

1562
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:42,800
with performances from Cool in the Gang and one of my favorite bands

1563
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:45,160
of that era, Shallowmore.

1564
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:48,760
We talk a lot about if you could time travel and go to Disneyland

1565
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:51,600
at a particular time, this is my version of that.

1566
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:56,320
I want to go to June 6th, 1981, go to Disneyland, see Cool in the Gang

1567
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:59,400
and Shallowmore, smoke a cigarette with Barack Obama

1568
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,240
and get kicked out of the park.

1569
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:02,800
Yeah. Wow.

1570
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:06,840
I don't know. I mean, they probably had no smoking signs at the Skyway stations.

1571
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,640
But in the 1980s, especially the early 80s,

1572
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:13,840
you were still smoking at offices, cars, restaurants.

1573
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:17,200
Everyone was smoking everywhere, you know, doesn't seem that.

1574
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,960
Yeah, it is.

1575
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,520
It could be for I don't know how much of a troublemaker he's trying to be.

1576
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,320
Now, he doesn't clarify what he was smoking.

1577
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:24,400
I mean, maybe he does.

1578
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:25,360
He might. He might.

1579
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:28,160
I think there might be a laugh from the audience and he's like cigarettes.

1580
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,200
Talking about cigarettes.

1581
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,000
So I don't think it was a joint.

1582
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:39,040
But anyway, still, as cool as all that is,

1583
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:42,920
you know, it still was him breaking a rule.

1584
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:46,560
It was showing that he was like a little bit of a of an anarchist

1585
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:48,000
at the time.

1586
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,120
And I don't know, I'm a little offended by this incident.

1587
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:53,520
And you know what? I'm going to start referring to it as Obamagate.

1588
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:57,000
Oh, you know what?

1589
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,840
You're right. I don't like him breaking the rules at Disneyland.

1590
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:04,160
So I will also use that phrase that I've never heard before

1591
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,360
to refer to this incident.

1592
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:07,400
Yeah, yeah.

1593
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,960
And I think we should tweet about it, get the word out.

1594
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,240
And not all because it was bad.

1595
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:14,280
I just I want to spread the word about Shalimar,

1596
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,320
because I think Shalimar is cool.

1597
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:19,600
So in order to do that, I'm going to start tweeting a lot about

1598
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,680
hashtag Obamagate.

1599
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:23,480
I think that's good.

1600
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:24,080
I don't know.

1601
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,080
Encourage the listeners also to do that.

1602
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:27,520
Yeah, yeah.

1603
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:30,720
So instead of our regular plugs, don't don't I mean, go to Twitter,

1604
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:34,240
but then just, you know, whatever you want to tweet, but also hashtag Obamagate.

1605
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:36,720
Yeah, I support that.

1606
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:39,080
Great. We got a good plan going forward.

1607
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:41,360
Yeah, great plan.

1608
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:44,200
Um, anyways,

1609
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:46,720
what else we got? Any any further thoughts about?

1610
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:50,760
You know, I this is a very simple, simplistic thought that I have.

1611
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:53,600
And it's really the last thing I'll say about this.

1612
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,320
The Skyway, that's the last thought I had about the Skyway is that

1613
01:29:56,720 --> 01:30:02,080
there is something there's a fun game that I always, especially as a kid, would play.

1614
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:05,120
And we've talked maybe a little bit about it with like the Snow White Ride

1615
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:11,080
is being excited about which color car you're going to get or which color bucket.

1616
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:15,760
There would be a that would be a big deal when you were a kid,

1617
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:18,960
because you'd sort of it was I guess it was like a little bit like gambling

1618
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:22,200
or like you would be like, I'm betting on red. Come on, red.

1619
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:27,200
And then if you got it, it was like it was an extra big celebration.

1620
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,120
And then you would get to go on the ride in the same way on Snow White,

1621
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:33,640
where you're like, come on, dopey car. Come on. I want the dopey that.

1622
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,760
I would always want dopey. That's what I wanted.

1623
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:43,560
But there was something fun about wishing for a color car or bucket

1624
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:48,880
that is I don't I don't even know why it's so fun, but it was especially as a kid.

1625
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:53,880
It was. And to Jason's point earlier, while there is not an immersive theme

1626
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:59,200
to the cars themselves, those bright, vibrant candy colors

1627
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:00,880
were sort of plenty.

1628
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:06,280
And for for that reason, to the anticipation of which one am I going to get?

1629
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:08,880
I'm trying to think what what I would have wanted.

1630
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,920
Did you guys have color preferences?

1631
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:13,600
Oh, blue would be number one with a bullet.

1632
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:16,720
You know, always blue.

1633
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:20,800
I was always a purple kid, but I know did they have a purple bucket?

1634
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:24,120
I don't know. I'm not sure that they did.

1635
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,800
I didn't see that. I didn't see that in any of the photos.

1636
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:32,440
There's one hanging above the entrance at a store at Disney Springs.

1637
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:35,440
I think that's blue.

1638
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:38,920
Um, colors. Yeah, that's a good call.

1639
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:43,200
I think, yeah, I think if I'm waiting for the skyway, I want I want that candy up a red.

1640
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,240
That was such a such a bold, bright red.

1641
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:48,480
And I think that felt the same way about Octopia cars.

1642
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:51,880
Fair. Yeah, I got that.

1643
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:55,240
But it's I mean, I guess I mean, the Skyliner, we were still like, oh, it's cool.

1644
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:58,000
I want this like because they have characters on those two,

1645
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:01,640
which even though like the characters kind of block you from seeing things,

1646
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,320
you're still hoping you get like the character you like.

1647
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:08,560
Like, there's maybe I think I may be adjusted to what I really want

1648
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:12,240
is characters I like in the car in front of me because I get to look at them

1649
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:13,760
for the whole. Sure. Good point.

1650
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:15,760
That's a good point. More important. Yeah.

1651
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:19,520
You get to look at Rocket Raccoon at Timothy Green.

1652
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:25,160
It's a Jeff Goldblum star of the Val.

1653
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,680
Artemis found his friend Dumpy Chumper's

1654
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:32,120
with his name. It's not his name.

1655
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,400
Dumpy Chumper is Dumpy Chumper.

1656
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,960
I'm not that far off.

1657
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:40,760
Yeah, I exaggerated for the sake of humor. OK.

1658
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,960
But I sent you guys the name of Josh and Artemis.

1659
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:46,000
What is the name of? Yeah, we have to find it.

1660
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,640
God, it's it's it's close.

1661
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:54,240
I want you to play Dumpy Chumper's and some TV show, please.

1662
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:57,680
Write a show about Dumpy Chumper's.

1663
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:01,520
I think he should be like a boy detective.

1664
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:03,760
Oh, yeah, that'd be great.

1665
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:05,920
OK, so here I'm on IMDb.

1666
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:09,720
Josh Gad plays Mulch Digums.

1667
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:14,160
I really was not that far off.

1668
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:17,280
I like I like Dumpy Chumper's better, much more pleasant name.

1669
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:20,640
I like Dumpy Chumper. Yeah, I like Dumpy Chumper's a lot better.

1670
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:25,720
Demand that before this is released, the character's name is changed

1671
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:30,520
to Dumpy Chumper's on Twitter and demand it hashtag Obamagate.

1672
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:34,160
This is part of Obamagate now.

1673
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:35,080
We're looping it.

1674
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:37,160
I mean, it's nebulous what Obamagate is.

1675
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:40,680
So there's plenty of room in the tent. Put it in there.

1676
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,520
The law. Oh, you know, I have another one more thought.

1677
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:50,600
I am I'm a little sad that they got rid of the Skyway station at Disneyland.

1678
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:53,520
Oh, this is good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1679
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:58,000
Because it was it stayed there for a long time, even though the ride closed in 94.

1680
01:33:58,160 --> 01:33:59,880
It was just a little like Swiss chalet.

1681
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:02,240
There was nothing for decades. Right.

1682
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:04,200
And it was still like it was tucked back.

1683
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:06,480
You could see it if you were on your way to Casey Jr.

1684
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:10,960
And I liked it there because I didn't even realize it was still there

1685
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:13,600
for the first so many years I was going to Disneyland.

1686
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:16,960
And then when I realized it was there, it kind of felt like a little hidden

1687
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:20,560
secret, a little bit of Disneyland history and lore.

1688
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,040
And then when they finally like remove the rest of it,

1689
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:25,680
I kind of felt like that was a bummer.

1690
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:27,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1691
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:28,200
A little sad.

1692
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:31,640
And you know, what was weird is that they

1693
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:38,720
when they sort of did the implosion of the area that became Galaxy's Edge,

1694
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:42,960
they didn't take the Skyway building down at first.

1695
01:34:43,120 --> 01:34:46,240
And that point of view that we would always go get from the Mickey

1696
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:48,880
and Friends bargain garage,

1697
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:52,000
I think from there, if you looked really closely,

1698
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,680
you could see right on the border, like sudden because all that space was cleared.

1699
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:00,360
Now you could see from the parking garage to the Skyway building.

1700
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:04,120
And it it sat there just as a little

1701
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:07,840
microscopic little shack for a long time

1702
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:14,080
until they filed a permit to destroy it on where they have the date in front of me,

1703
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:16,480
a date that will live in me.

1704
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:23,120
May 11th, 2016, we also the worst thing to happen in the year 2016.

1705
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:25,800
Yeah, yeah, it was a dark year.

1706
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:28,000
I don't know. I couldn't remember why.

1707
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,360
But I mean, that seems that rings a bell.

1708
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:35,960
Cost them $67,000 just to blow that up.

1709
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:38,720
And once again, I don't think it was a cool implosion.

1710
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:40,360
No Mickey stunts, no nothing.

1711
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:43,040
No. And yeah, those the stations were real.

1712
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:45,320
The Fantasyland stations were really beautiful.

1713
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:49,920
And the Tomorrowland ones were like kind of fit in the aesthetic perfectly.

1714
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,920
Just these kind of blocky metal cubes almost.

1715
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,480
Which all of which are sort of nothing now.

1716
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:58,960
If you go to Disneyland, you know, there's kind of those.

1717
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:02,640
I mean, really, what's there now are the the secret

1718
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:07,520
better Tomorrowland bathrooms than the sort of overcrowded,

1719
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:09,840
stressful ones over by Space Mountain.

1720
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:12,560
But if you have to go there, it's just kind of these high walls

1721
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,720
because it's where the Skyway used to be.

1722
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:16,240
And now it's sort of nothing.

1723
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:17,840
Well, yeah.

1724
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:21,160
So in Japan, there was a pretty good plus up

1725
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:25,800
where the Fantasyland station turned into Pooh's Honey Hunt.

1726
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:28,080
Yeah, that's true.

1727
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:29,920
That's a good trade.

1728
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:34,240
The and the Tomorrowland station became a candy store.

1729
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:36,720
All right. I like that.

1730
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:40,960
Tomorrowland Skyway, notable Tokyo Skyway, notable

1731
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:44,640
for kind of being more enclosed with plexiglass.

1732
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:49,080
Because they have much more chaotic seasons over there.

1733
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:54,160
So, yeah, it was a rainstorm or whatever.

1734
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:59,000
Yeah, more like the Skyliner, like the eventual Skyliner.

1735
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:03,520
Right. And how nice that there is the Skyliner now, the keys of this tradition

1736
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:05,800
and maybe does it in a safer and

1737
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:10,360
but to go back to the beginning, more wheelchair accessible way.

1738
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:11,720
I think we actually missed that during this.

1739
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:15,040
I think you could only do the Skyway via stairs.

1740
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:18,880
So there was really no way for handicapped guests to access it.

1741
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:22,080
But the Skyliner all takes off from the ground and lifts up.

1742
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:23,400
So it's not a problem with those.

1743
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:25,240
So everybody can enjoy it.

1744
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:27,920
And this is a pretty big, spacious

1745
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:30,400
handicapped cars in the in the Skyliner.

1746
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,840
You saw a lot of those take off just in the couple of days we were using it.

1747
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:36,520
Yeah, it is fun to see like an old thing come back

1748
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:39,480
and it's a better version of it and it's a cooler thing.

1749
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:42,920
And now it's like being used in less of just a ride capacity

1750
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:45,080
and more of a practical capacity.

1751
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:49,480
So, yeah, it's like I'm trying to think of like it's like as if they were to

1752
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:51,840
like build a better version of the rocket rods.

1753
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:54,240
But it was for transporting you to hotels.

1754
01:37:56,320 --> 01:38:01,520
I mean, the the rocket rods are so we're so weird and clunky and problematic.

1755
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:05,320
And now I know I feel like it's something like Garcetti with green light.

1756
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:08,680
We're doing public transit, but it's rocket.

1757
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:12,000
It's Elon or Elon Musk would be saying we're building.

1758
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:13,920
The tunnels. Yes.

1759
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:16,040
Actually, he kind of did invent the rocket rods.

1760
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:20,320
Yes. He's like, well, the tunnels are I've invented these things,

1761
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:23,320
rods and they are rockets.

1762
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:26,680
And we should open up the economy immediately

1763
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:30,720
and build these rocket rods underneath Los Angeles.

1764
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:35,800
And he'd start building them and then tweet three years later.

1765
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:37,440
Rocket rods are overrated.

1766
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:39,800
Our stock price should go down, probably.

1767
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,040
Hello. Well, yes.

1768
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:46,840
I lost fifty thousand dollars.

1769
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:49,680
From everyone, but him loses money. Yeah.

1770
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:55,080
Honestly, I think we should tweet at Elon to see if he will

1771
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:57,760
bring the rocket rods back.

1772
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:01,920
I think we present them like blueprints, present them like we invented this

1773
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:03,160
and see if we can trick him.

1774
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:06,720
You know what? If if we can get a rocket rod on an episode of

1775
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:10,640
Rick and Morty, I think the chances of Elon seeing it will go sky high.

1776
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:13,720
So I think that might be the best way we can do it.

1777
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:18,200
OK, so we'll slip that in there.

1778
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:19,480
Let that in. Somebody get it.

1779
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:21,640
Just somebody get a job animating there.

1780
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:23,160
Oh, OK. The design.

1781
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:24,600
Jason, that's you.

1782
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:28,000
Oh, I love animation and software.

1783
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:32,480
I had one closing thing, which was,

1784
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:37,040
you know, that obviously these these all closed a long time ago.

1785
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:42,560
And you always hear when they're closing attractions,

1786
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:46,120
you know, every attraction is someone's favorite, you know.

1787
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:51,080
But you always hear them say, like the Walt quote about like,

1788
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:53,560
you know, Disneyland will never be finished.

1789
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:56,440
It'll always be changing and update that that sort of thing.

1790
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:01,040
When they were closing this,

1791
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:04,640
I think the spokesman was a little more harsh.

1792
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:08,520
There is in the L.A. Times in 1994,

1793
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:11,280
they quoted a spokesman named Scott Swan.

1794
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:15,000
And he said, you know, demand for the ride has fallen.

1795
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,760
And then he said, quote, it's an evolving change.

1796
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:23,800
You look at one attraction and say, it's time has come.

1797
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:29,320
So I don't know why that's maybe laugh so much.

1798
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:33,920
It just seemed like the inverse of the optimism of the Walt Disney quote.

1799
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:38,440
And then just this guy who's like, you're on the chopping block, buddy.

1800
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:40,680
You're out of here.

1801
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:42,840
It's like he had to put a horse down or something. Yeah.

1802
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:48,440
Like, yes, the attractions are open and then there is attractions hospice.

1803
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:50,840
Yeah. Yeah.

1804
01:40:50,840 --> 01:40:52,360
Yeah, that would not fly.

1805
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:55,680
Robert Iger would have his ass if he said that. Yeah.

1806
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:59,280
Really? I mean, that quote is so grim that it sort of sounds like

1807
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:02,160
God makey. Yes, it does.

1808
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:07,000
Well, sometimes, sometimes in the cycle of a ride,

1809
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:10,040
you got to take it into the field and shoot it in the head.

1810
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:12,440
I'm tired of these people.

1811
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:15,160
I'm tired of being wrapped up in their problems.

1812
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:20,440
Just pointing ominously at the skyway.

1813
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:23,080
Your time has come.

1814
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:26,600
I have said so. I have spoken.

1815
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:35,240
When you need to put a riot out of its misery, I use the gun.

1816
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:39,040
But of course, Dr.

1817
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:44,480
Manhattan Mickey implies the existence of a Rorschach Donald.

1818
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:48,600
So he's really going to be the truth.

1819
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:50,280
Get the truth out there.

1820
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:52,480
Yeah, I am sure.

1821
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:55,960
I think if I do, you think there is already a fan art of Rorschach Donald?

1822
01:41:56,400 --> 01:42:00,120
I feel like we'll give it a look while we're at it.

1823
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:04,320
Yeah, Rorschach Donald Duck.

1824
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:05,480
Let's see here.

1825
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:09,520
And if so, how big of a seat did they get them?

1826
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,520
Depends on where the source of the fan art.

1827
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:16,720
If it's on DeviantArt, then the seat is huge.

1828
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:18,080
The seat is huge.

1829
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:20,200
The inkblot is not on his face.

1830
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:23,480
His face is normally inkblot is on his seat.

1831
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:24,840
All right. All right.

1832
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:30,840
I have it's not fan art, but it is a Pinterest picture of Donald in a party hat.

1833
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:34,440
And it said all the whores and politicians will look up and shout, save us.

1834
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:36,840
And I'll look down and whisper no. Oh, my God.

1835
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,840
So there is pretty close.

1836
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:41,440
Whoa, whoa. Pretty close.

1837
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:44,720
Here, I'll send it. I'll send it to you.

1838
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:48,000
You know, we attempt our bad versions of these character voices.

1839
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:50,120
I don't think anyone does a lot of Donald.

1840
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:53,320
Does anyone want to be so brave as to attempt?

1841
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:56,320
I can do the noise, but I really can't talk like him.

1842
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:57,800
Like I can go.

1843
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:00,680
But I can't.

1844
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:02,600
Here, let's just all audition it really fast.

1845
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:04,720
Now that it's now that it's in front of us here.

1846
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,840
But since you just did that, go.

1847
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:09,440
OK, with all that, I have to bring it up again.

1848
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:11,680
This is going to be interesting.

1849
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:17,040
I can. Whoa, it's impossible to do it.

1850
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:18,920
I'm not sure I can either.

1851
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:20,880
It's like, really, I can't even.

1852
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:23,160
Like it doesn't work.

1853
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:24,040
My mouth doesn't work.

1854
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:24,640
What I'm trying to do.

1855
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:26,960
All right, you try. Don't don't die over there.

1856
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,960
You try it. Let me gear up again.

1857
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:31,040
We're not with you. We can't give you a time.

1858
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:33,200
No, no, I don't want to choke on my tongue here.

1859
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:36,840
No, it's like it's like Jason Stitch.

1860
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:40,240
Yeah, yeah, it's like hard to talk.

1861
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,800
No, that's like a gremlin.

1862
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:44,920
I'll go with it, though.

1863
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:46,440
Oh, the horrors.

1864
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:49,360
Oh, the horrors.

1865
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:53,240
Politicians, all the horrors and politicians

1866
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:57,280
will look up and shout, save us and all look down and whisper no.

1867
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:01,400
It's F.

1868
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:02,280
All right.

1869
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:04,320
We have a quick talk.

1870
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:06,680
It doesn't work at all.

1871
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:07,680
It's just gibberish.

1872
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:11,720
I'm trying to get it in that because that's how he talks with that noise.

1873
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:13,720
Yeah, you're putting a lot of mustard on it.

1874
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:15,360
We're getting so much mustard.

1875
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:16,840
We're not getting the words.

1876
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:18,360
What are you doing?

1877
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:20,040
You're not getting the words.

1878
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:21,320
Now, I just sound like an alien.

1879
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:24,880
I sound like the alien in Independence Day talking to Brent Spiner

1880
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:26,280
telepathically.

1881
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:28,360
Call the horrors a baby.

1882
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,440
I can't do it. It's impossible.

1883
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:33,040
Can't do it. I can't do it.

1884
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:37,320
The this episode is going to come out and it's going to be listed as 11 hours long.

1885
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:40,880
And the listener will be horrified to discover the last nine are blank

1886
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:43,440
because we all suffocated.

1887
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:44,600
Recordings kept going.

1888
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:46,800
Choked out our own spit.

1889
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,080
Jason, are you brave enough?

1890
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,560
Yeah, I'll try.

1891
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:52,080
All the horrors are back.

1892
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:53,680
No, it's too.

1893
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:55,280
It's Stitch.

1894
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:00,200
It's getting too DeVito.

1895
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:02,040
It's getting too Penguin.

1896
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:09,280
I'm worried about you doing this, actually.

1897
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:10,640
I'm worried about Jason.

1898
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:12,120
Because there's no line.

1899
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:16,440
Like when I've done impressions in the past, I latch on to a few words

1900
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:18,440
or a sentence or even goofy.

1901
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:22,360
You can go, like, there's no like Donald like.

1902
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:24,520
Day.

1903
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:27,800
Oh, the horrors and politicians.

1904
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:31,560
It starts to for me, it starts to get too high and then you just slide

1905
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:32,520
right into stitch.

1906
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:34,720
My plan is to go.

1907
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:37,120
I think you got to just pick it and stick with it.

1908
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:38,920
Yeah, I'm going to try. Hold on.

1909
01:45:38,920 --> 01:45:40,800
Let me try to do it.

1910
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:44,400
I'm I'm like there's phlegm shooting up.

1911
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,520
This is not it's look, it's not that important.

1912
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:48,360
Not the best time to spray.

1913
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:59,840
Are you saying the words in your mind?

1914
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:01,600
Are you are you hearing the words?

1915
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,600
Because this is just not you're not.

1916
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:06,680
You I think you pick the gurgles or you don't get the words.

1917
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:09,240
I will say this. I you guys are not.

1918
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:12,680
I am talking and I'm recording remotely also on a zoom.

1919
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:17,400
And I am a little bit far from the computer, so we will see once we go back

1920
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:21,080
on the zoom, because I do think you could hear a little enunciation

1921
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:22,440
on the zoom if you're listening.

1922
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:24,480
So we will see when we go back and hear this.

1923
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:27,600
If you could make out any single word in that sentence.

1924
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:29,440
Yeah, yeah.

1925
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:33,600
I think in that in this case, just so we don't die and I'll hear

1926
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:36,120
I'm going to I'm going to try to do it because mine was murdering me less,

1927
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:38,800
but was much worse than what you were doing, Mike.

1928
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:41,960
So let me in my terrible voice like.

1929
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:46,360
You you survive, but gets a ride.

1930
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:49,480
This is not what it's this voice.

1931
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:51,920
You survive, but has the right for.

1932
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:54,200
Well, it's my guess.

1933
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:58,200
I go to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

1934
01:46:58,360 --> 01:47:01,600
Hashtag Obama gate.

1935
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:05,400
Who is that character?

1936
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:08,520
I'm not sure what does that sound like?

1937
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:11,800
One of the guys who works at M.I.B.

1938
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:14,120
headquarters. Oh, yeah.

1939
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:15,720
One of the aliens. Yeah.

1940
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:18,960
Yeah. Actually, it sounds a little bit like on The Simpsons

1941
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:22,600
when there's the film festival and George C.

1942
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:25,960
Scott is in a remake of Hans Mollmann's movie.

1943
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:28,880
Oh, my groin. Oh, my groin.

1944
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:33,880
So I guess in that this is this is Donald Duck saying,

1945
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:36,640
if you want more bonus content,

1946
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:40,960
this three bonus episodes of the Patreon dot com slash podcast

1947
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:42,520
arrive. We're.

1948
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:46,800
It's like Baby Herman, too.

1949
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:49,920
Awful, awful ending.

1950
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:52,040
And I'm having a great time.

1951
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:54,520
The worst thing I had fun.

1952
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:56,360
It's good. It's not.

1953
01:47:56,360 --> 01:47:59,160
Maybe it's not awful to listen to, but I feel bad about myself.

1954
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:02,920
I'm coughing. Oh, no, no, no, no.

1955
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:05,840
And let's be clear, it's because we've been

1956
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:08,760
fucking with our own throats and it's not because of Covid 19.

1957
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:10,680
Everybody's safe for the moment.

1958
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:13,640
You stay safe as well. Listen, yes.

1959
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:15,440
Any other thoughts?

1960
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:20,320
Uh, no, my brain is just I'm I'm really you know what?

1961
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:23,560
Honestly, I'm waiting to get off this so I can try it privately.

1962
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:25,800
Try the voice privately. Great.

1963
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:28,360
OK, well, yeah, I mean, look, feel free to add an addendum

1964
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:29,440
if you get it better.

1965
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:33,240
But for now, let's all get a glass of water, clear our throats, clear our minds.

1966
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:37,440
Thanks for listening to podcast the ride and we'll see you on the third gate

1967
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:39,760

01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:42,440
