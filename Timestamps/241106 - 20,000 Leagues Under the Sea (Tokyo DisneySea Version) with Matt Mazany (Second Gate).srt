00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,260
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate where today we will attempt to go 20,000 tangents

2
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,260
below the topic.

3
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,260
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me Skipper, first mate Jason Sheridan.

4
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,260
I like that.

5
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,540
I'm Skipper and first mate?

6
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,420
I know those are actually, as I said it, those are two different positions on the ship.

7
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,760
Well, it must have worked very hard to earn two simultaneous positions.

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,740
Or somebody died at sea and you have to do two jobs now.

9
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,860
Oh, well that sounds like a downgrade.

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,060
Although you know Scott isn't here, he's not died.

11
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,060
He's, they were doing this Scott free of course.

12
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,060
He is lost at sea.

13
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,420
Scott could potentially be on our podcast submarine.

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,660
He is maybe the Skipper or first mate, so you're going to have to take his job today

15
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,660
too.

16
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:12,260
His, yeah, his submersible is still stuck deep underwater, has not been saved by Atlantean

17
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,260
magic yet.

18
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,260
No, it hasn't.

19
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,940
So I'm still doing just one job.

20
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,900
I'm just like the engineer or something, but you're going to have to be two jobs today.

21
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,460
You're Gilligan and Skipper today.

22
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,460
Oh, shit.

23
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,460
You're both.

24
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,860
Self in the head with a hat.

25
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,740
If you screw up, you can, he's actually doing it.

26
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,740
We are not recording video here.

27
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,740
I was just testing.

28
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,740
I was just testing.

29
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,740
You braced for impact too.

30
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,980
Like you were going to get hit with a lead pipe.

31
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,980
Yeah.

32
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,980
Like, oh, you're like grimace.

33
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,580
Like, was it really something?

34
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,580
Let's bring our guest in.

35
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,140
You know him.

36
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,100
He's a, he's been on podcast ride.

37
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,740
I don't want to say he's, a friend of his has been on podcast the ride recently.

38
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:55,140
A friend who is a monstrous type friend, um, but it's not him for sure.

39
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,380
His, he, he's friends with the Minotaur is what I'm saying, but he, that's not him.

40
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,380
That's just a buddy of his.

41
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,100
So that's the closest he's been to being on podcast to ride lately.

42
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,100
Right.

43
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,060
But he himself, uh, has been on a number of times.

44
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,060
Yes.

45
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,940
He himself has been, I'm just saying when like the, that's the last time I think when

46
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,020
I see the Minotaur, I think of him because of how good their friendship is.

47
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,020
Oh, okay.

48
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,020
Yeah.

49
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,660
So that's the only reason I brought that up instead of just mentioning one of the times

50
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,460
he was on the show with the episode about the, uh, Ronto raps.

51
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,220
Of course we did, uh, um, but Matt Mazzani is back.

52
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,220
He's here.

53
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,980
He is not with his friend today though.

54
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,980
I don't think.

55
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,180
No, no, I don't think, I don't think he's going to show up.

56
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,380
He's, he's more of a professional acquaintance like with, when you, when you're friends with

57
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,580
the Minotaur, it's always a little bit business.

58
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,580
You know what I mean?

59
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,740
Like, like you could be friends, but it's, it's like, you know, you're always trying

60
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,700
to do Minotaur-y things, get people lost in mazes, things like that.

61
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,340
Well, that's, and you net, he always wants a ride.

62
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,340
He hates driving.

63
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,340
Oh yeah.

64
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,500
But then you're like, I gotta pick him up at the maze.

65
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,540
Oh, it's gonna take so much time.

66
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,340
We're going to miss Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.

67
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,700
Ironically, parking at the maze, so easy to find, so convenient.

68
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,700
Oh, sure.

69
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,700
But, but getting to the maze is-

70
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,700
Getting to his unit in the maze is-

71
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,700
Yeah.

72
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,700
It's like one of those condo situations.

73
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,100
And it's like, he's like maze, uh, one 24 and a half.

74
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,660
And then like the, the three quarter ones, it's confusing.

75
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,660
I can't.

76
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,660
Yeah.

77
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,620
He's a real user.

78
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,620
This Minotaur.

79
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,620
I think he's a great guy.

80
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,620
I don't know if-

81
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,620
Are you sure?

82
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,620
I don't know if you want to start running him down.

83
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,620
And then he starts coming back.

84
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,140
He just sounds aggressive and he sounds like a real pain in the ass and he sounds like

85
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,020
somebody you wouldn't want to associate with.

86
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,020
That's all.

87
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,500
I want to know if Mike's about to start calling people users regularly.

88
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,220
I don't think I've ever heard it.

89
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,340
I don't think, I'm hoping he starts going on about fake friends soon.

90
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,340
Fake ass friends.

91
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,900
Oh, the haters are out too for Mike Carlson.

92
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,060
Well, the Minotaur tried to be my fake ass friend by the end of the episode, but he wasn't.

93
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,380
He was just trying to be like, buddy, up to me at that point.

94
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,140
I think he thought he, he probably went too far.

95
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,780
He felt he went too far.

96
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,740
And then he was trying to be my fake ass friends.

97
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:01,140
I don't, I don't want to say you're talking a big game cause the Minotaur is not here,

98
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,140
but you know-

99
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,140
Well, whatever.

100
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,140
Yeah.

101
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,140
Would you say that, would you say that to the Minotaur's face?

102
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,180
Cause that actually kind of makes you a fake ass friend if you wouldn't say it to his face.

103
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,900
Well, look, when you're in times of struggle, you will say things to get out of that struggle.

104
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,460
So I feel like I was in the right.

105
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,940
You'll delete a deals Twitter and then bring it back.

106
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,940
That's what I said.

107
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,940
For spite.

108
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,340
I brought up that whole, I brought up contract law on that episode.

109
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,340
If we remember.

110
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,340
That's right.

111
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,340
Sure.

112
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,100
I often cite contract law on podcast the ride.

113
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,860
But here, look, we're not here to talk about the mythical beast, the great beast itself.

114
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,860
Great guy.

115
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,860
We're here to talk.

116
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,860
Who's that?

117
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,580
It seems like a bit of a user.

118
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,420
That's a good soft insult by the like, you know, you heard about that guy, he's a bit

119
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,420
of a user.

120
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,420
Yeah.

121
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,420
A bit of a user.

122
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,300
We can all write down a piece of paper, a person we know who's a user.

123
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,780
I'm not saying we all have the same person, but I'm saying we all, somebody comes to your

124
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,180
mind when you think of user-

125
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,740
Scott, Scott, right?

126
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,740
Scott Geerner?

127
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,740
Scott Geerner.

128
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,740
Yeah, yeah.

129
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,740
He's no user.

130
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,620
Well, we all wrote it down and flipped it over at the same time.

131
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,940
I wrote my own name down.

132
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,460
I didn't understand the prompt.

133
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,620
Well, you know what you got to do now?

134
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,780
Hit yourself in the head with your own head.

135
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,940
Don't do it.

136
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,940
You could just do it, Jason.

137
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,580
You could just do it on the mic and pretend.

138
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,140
No, because you would go on a whole tangent that I didn't hit myself.

139
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,140
You could do it like this.

140
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,300
You could just take your hand, put it near the mic and hit like this or something.

141
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,300
Okay.

142
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,740
Because you could like foley it.

143
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,060
Foley or like sound effects.

144
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,060
Yeah.

145
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,060
No, people like the authenticity.

146
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,100
That's why they tune in to podcasts for the authenticity.

147
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,460
But he looks like he's in such pain before he does it.

148
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,820
I did actually whack my ear kind of bad that time.

149
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,820
Yeah, no, it makes me like worried about him if he keeps hitting himself in the head.

150
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,580
That's a beautiful hat, by the way, the Grand Californian hat.

151
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,700
Is that is that an old hat?

152
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,700
Is that a newish hat?

153
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,700
It's about a year old.

154
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,700
I got it.

155
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,460
My dad and brother came out to visit and I got it when they were out.

156
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,460
And that's the hat that he will use to concuss himself on today's episode.

157
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,980
Well, it's a solid hat.

158
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,980
That's why I thought it might have been like a retro.

159
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,060
It's got like a retro nice earth tone.

160
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,060
It's a spa hat.

161
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,060
Can you tilt that down for me?

162
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,060
It's the hotel.

163
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,060
It's the hotel and spa.

164
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,060
Hotel and spa.

165
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,060
I think it's just in the logo.

166
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,060
It's just the name.

167
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,660
It's in the spa, which it's very expensive, but I do want to do that one of these days

168
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,700
is the three of us go down to the Grand Californian Hotel at Disneyland and do spa stuff.

169
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,980
I'm a spa guy now.

170
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,300
I love spas now.

171
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,260
Yes, I do it once every three years, but when I do it, I love it.

172
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,260
You get the robe.

173
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,300
You sit there with a bunch of strangers while you wait for something to happen, like a massage,

174
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,300
not something weird.

175
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,300
It's not like an orgy.

176
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,300
I don't know why I said it like that.

177
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,300
You know what I'm saying?

178
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,300
There's like a comments room.

179
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,940
If you want something to happen, Michael, you just got to make it happen.

180
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,220
I'm just saying you wait for whatever service.

181
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,220
Excuse me?

182
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,220
What was the service?

183
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,420
Well, you pick one color handkerchief, put it in your banter pocket.

184
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:50,460
You sit naked with a robe on, you sit with a bunch of strangers, and you wait for something

185
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,460
to happen.

186
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,020
Generally, a service that you've paid for in advance.

187
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,580
At the legal spa.

188
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,580
Right.

189
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,140
And everything I said is how you would describe it.

190
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,060
Nothing I said there is too weird.

191
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,060
Sure.

192
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,060
Yeah.

193
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,180
People would understand that.

194
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,100
But you're twirling your mustache as you're saying it, which people don't get on the audio,

195
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,100
so it is a little.

196
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,100
Yes.

197
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,100
And I'm not going to do it.

198
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,100
Well, I'm miming it.

199
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,100
And unlike Jason, I'm going to mime here.

200
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,100
You can hear it.

201
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,100
Ew.

202
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,420
It's an ASMR mustache twirl.

203
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,500
That's right.

204
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,220
So if anybody in the audience likes that.

205
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,500
Anyway, we will do spa stuff eventually on this show.

206
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
Sure.

207
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,220
A very wet episode that'll be.

208
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,020
Well, we're not going to record it in the spa, I don't think.

209
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,020
Why not?

210
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,980
I feel like that might be.

211
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,980
They might not like that.

212
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,980
This is the protest for authenticity.

213
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,980
You'd record in a spa, right?

214
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,980
Yeah, I would consider it.

215
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,980
Oh, bull.

216
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,980
You didn't want to record at CityWalk.

217
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,980
You thought we would get arrested.

218
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:53,700
Well, look, that was before all the vloggers and Instagrammers had like just buckets of

219
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,860
equipment nowadays at theme parks.

220
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,860
So I thought it would look unusual.

221
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,460
But he flipped out when we suggested it like years ago.

222
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,460
Well, hold on.

223
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,460
That was texting.

224
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,900
I feel like you're reading a lot into that.

225
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,900
Did you use all caps or an exclamation point?

226
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,900
No.

227
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,900
Is that counterpoint?

228
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,900
You're wrong.

229
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,900
Yes, it is.

230
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,900
That's one of the famous.

231
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,900
I don't think there was any punctuation.

232
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,900
Counterpoint, you are wrong.

233
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,900
It was the very early days of the podcast.

234
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,620
You were feistier back then, I think.

235
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,820
Oh, I was feistier.

236
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,260
So now you're ready to go tape a microphone to your chest and get a massage.

237
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,260
Sure.

238
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,260
Yeah.

239
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,260
Well, I don't want.

240
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,940
I just don't want any, you know, fire.

241
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:39,420
Our guest today made a short film, which we'll talk about at the end of this episode.

242
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,420
Yeah, sure.

243
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,420
Fire does come into play.

244
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,420
What a good segue.

245
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,180
I would not want anything like that going on.

246
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,980
No, we are anti-fire on this show, if that's what you're saying.

247
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,340
We don't want fires to happen.

248
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,340
Yeah, fire bad.

249
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,140
A bunch of Frankensteins in that way.

250
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,140
Right.

251
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,140
Nobody likes fire.

252
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,500
There's a roaring fire and there's chestnuts nearby.

253
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Just like at the Grand California.

254
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
Is there a fireplace at the Grand?

255
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
There is a fireplace.

256
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
I've never been to the Grand California.

257
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
You've got to walk through.

258
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,100
You've got to do yourself a favorite walk through.

259
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,580
You can get a drink at the bar, drink in the big lobby.

260
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,580
Okay.

261
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,060
Yeah, it's funny because I love the show.

262
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,060
I've been listening to the show for many years.

263
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,060
I enjoy it.

264
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,060
Thank you.

265
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,540
And I'm a theme park fan, but I don't, the hotels are something I've just never touched

266
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,540
and never got into.

267
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,820
I don't know how to engage in them without the, because I can't stay at the Grand California

268
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,820
now.

269
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,820
Here's the thing.

270
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,820
What is it, like $900 a day or something?

271
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,820
Here's the thing.

272
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,820
Well, yes, don't do that.

273
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,980
It's too much, too expensive now.

274
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:42,300
If Scott were here, he would say, look, we got a topic to talk about, but Scott is not

275
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,300
here.

276
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,300
Yeah.

277
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,300
Why don't we talk a little hotel?

278
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,300
I'll talk some hotel, I guess.

279
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,300
Do you want to get a little naughty?

280
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,300
20,000 tangents under the sink.

281
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,060
Do you want to get a little naughty?

282
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,380
I think we could get a little naughty.

283
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,660
And what is Nemo's ship, but a very fancy hotel for sailors?

284
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,060
You know, they call Nemo's ship the Naughty List.

285
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,660
That's the ship that we're driving today.

286
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,340
You should hit him on the head with your hat, actually, for that one.

287
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,420
Unfortunately, my arms are far too short to accomplish that.

288
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,820
We are driving the Naughty List today.

289
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,860
That's what we're doing.

290
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,860
Not the Naughty List.

291
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:19,800
Not Santa's Naughty List, the Naughty List, a naughty little ship that Captain Nemo pilots

292
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
under the sea.

293
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,880
No, wait, we're in a separate submersible from the Naughty List itself.

294
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,280
No, I'm talking about podcasts as an entity, we're in the Naughty List.

295
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,400
This is a very Naughty List vibe.

296
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,240
I do like the Naughty List vibe here.

297
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,240
This room, we're alone, we're away from the oceans, no laws, Captain Nemo can run around

298
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
and do what he wants.

299
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
We can talk hotels.

300
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,040
Yeah, it's cold as shit, you know?

301
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,040
It's cold.

302
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
It's a little damp for some reason.

303
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,040
Why is it damp?

304
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
I walked in here as damp, Carl.

305
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:55,520
Well, because I have a humidifier going for my dry sinuses.

306
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,760
See, he loves fire.

307
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,560
He's always tempting electrical devices by it.

308
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,560
Yes, that's true.

309
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,480
The only reason I wanted a quick talk hotel is maybe not quick, is I just did around a

310
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,480
hotel hanging out.

311
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,560
I just went alone, by the way, in the middle of the afternoon.

312
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:18,160
I checked out the new Pixar Pier Hotel, I checked out Grand Californian, you sit, you

313
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
have a little drink.

314
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,840
I went to Disneyland Hotel and there's something called the Broken Spell Lounge.

315
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,000
It's the same exact lounge that the steakhouse had.

316
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,800
It's got darker carpet, though.

317
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
Oh, that's fun.

318
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,680
Disneyland is so expensive and they continue to turn the heat up on everybody who wants

319
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,600
to go, but if you're down in Anaheim, here's what I think you should do if you want to

320
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,520
do a day, an afternoon or a night.

321
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,960
There's a little trick, a parking trick that I have recently been hip to on some Instagram.

322
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,280
You go to the Garden Walk, which is the mall, the Anaheim Garden Walk, which is right by

323
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
there.

324
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,280
It's where they have the bubblegum shrimp and they have a restaurant called Huckleberry's,

325
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,960
which looks like the Knott's Berry Farm logo.

326
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,800
And you go there, you can go to the Starbucks or the Huckleberry's.

327
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,520
There's a phone number that you text your receipt to and then you've gotten a parking

328
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,400
pass from parking at the Garden Walk.

329
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:19,560
You text that and your receipt to this number, a strange number, and then in a couple hours

330
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,400
they will say, validated, and the parking will be $18 for the whole day, which is much

331
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,160
better than the $35 you'd use at Disneyland or whatever.

332
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
Yeah.

333
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,400
So you go down, you do that, maybe you wander the Garden Walk, which is one of the strangest

334
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
places I've ever gone.

335
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,020
It's a very odd outdoor mall with a bunch of strange things, magicians you've never

336
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,140
heard of have their own place there.

337
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,340
And look, I don't want to say we're going to do a lot of content on this area, but we're

338
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,260
going to do a lot of content on this area eventually.

339
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:55,620
You were sending pictures and I was like, wow, the Garden Walk has gotten even weirder.

340
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,620
Yes.

341
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,620
Yes.

342
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,620
I think that's correct.

343
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,420
But it's a very, it's like 10 minute walk, eight minute walk, so you get to park for

344
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,420
under 20 bucks.

345
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,420
And if you want to do the whole day there, you can.

346
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,540
You just want to wander the hotels, wander the Grand Californian.

347
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,540
There's a couple of different places.

348
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,980
You can go get a drink outside by the pool.

349
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,140
You can go get a drink.

350
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,180
There's a little indoor spot there too, and there's a couple of restaurants.

351
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,540
So talk to me like, just because I'm a very, like a very neophyte when it comes to the

352
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,540
Disney hotels.

353
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,580
You go to Garden Walk.

354
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,820
What are the hotels that you go to?

355
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,780
You go to Grand California.

356
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,780
I've heard of that one.

357
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,780
Never been.

358
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,780
Well, okay.

359
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,780
So there's three Disney hotels.

360
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,780
There's Grand Californian.

361
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,780
There's Disneyland Hotel.

362
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:39,580
There are place hotels, that's what it's called, which used to be called Paradise Pier Hotel.

363
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,380
Yes, and a number of names before that.

364
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,700
Yeah, so there's three Disney-owned hotels.

365
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,220
Now there are plenty of other hotels to enjoy in Anaheim as well, on Harbor Boulevard and

366
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:53,500
other places, and I recommend going to those, but I'm just giving you the core.

367
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,940
If you want to do three Disney hotels, you go to Trader Sam's right by the Disneyland

368
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:02,580
Hotel, and you can make a full nice afternoon of just kind of going and hanging out, doing

369
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,660
some work there.

370
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,660
I might do that.

371
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,660
I might do that.

372
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,940
I got some time coming up in a week or two, and I usually fill it with like, I go to the

373
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,940
art museum.

374
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,940
I go to the Hammer.

375
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,940
I go to LACMA.

376
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,940
I go to all these other places, but it sounds like this is a better way to spend an afternoon

377
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,820
than trying to enrich myself.

378
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,820
A hundred percent.

379
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,820
I'm being completely sincere.

380
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,740
Take a computer, go park for 18 bucks, and then wander the grounds.

381
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,820
The music's playing.

382
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,660
You're still getting some of the vibes.

383
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,380
It's like somebody's doing drugs in another room, and the smoke is coming in, and you're

384
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,460
still getting the smoke of the actual theme parks.

385
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,940
You're still getting the theming.

386
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,660
You're still getting a lot of it, and you will be happier.

387
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:47,140
It will make you happier to be there and working and wandering around, and you can still sniff

388
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,140
the magic.

389
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:52,220
You can still sniff a little magic while you're down there.

390
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,100
While you sniff some magic while you're waiting for a service at the spa.

391
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,580
I get what you're saying, pal.

392
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,820
Well, depending on what you ordered.

393
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,140
That's right.

394
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,300
What hotel would you recommend?

395
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,140
What's the big hotel experience that I should do that you find the best?

396
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:11,940
I think the outdoor restaurant at the Grand California is really great, drink and food-wise.

397
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,500
There's a bar there, and you can just sit at the bar.

398
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,140
It's only a few years old.

399
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,780
The current iteration is only a few years old.

400
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:25,900
Now, you can get the full menu at the quick service restaurant, but you don't get less

401
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,860
of the vibe, you know.

402
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,860
Got it.

403
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,860
Okay.

404
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,020
This sounds good.

405
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,020
This is good.

406
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,020
I think this is a good tangent.

407
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,020
I think I'm going to go do this.

408
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,020
Yeah.

409
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,380
It's honestly so much fun.

410
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,660
I haven't done it in a while because I have a child, and there's responsibilities now.

411
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,660
But you know what?

412
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:46,820
I didn't have to watch her that day, so dad got to get a little work done down in Anaheim.

413
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,820
Daddy's day out.

414
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,580
It was daddy's day out.

415
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,260
Daddy's had a real daddy's weekend.

416
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,980
He went to a concert alone yesterday.

417
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,580
I'm really stepping out again for the first time in a few years.

418
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,580
What concert did you see?

419
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,060
LCD Sound System.

420
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,060
How is that?

421
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,060
How was that?

422
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,060
Fantastic.

423
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,060
Are you a big fan?

424
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,060
Yeah.

425
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,060
I don't know if I like them or not.

426
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,060
I listen to them.

427
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,060
I do listen to them.

428
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,060
Okay.

429
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,060
But I don't know if I like them.

430
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,060
You seem skeptical.

431
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,060
I am skeptical.

432
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,060
It feels good to be naughty on this and talk LCD Sound System.

433
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,060
I do feel naughty.

434
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,060
Let's talk a little LCD Sound System.

435
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,900
What do you feel about it?

436
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,540
It's one where it's like I heard the singles for years.

437
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:26,620
I think I only ever really listened to one album because someone burned it for me.

438
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,620
The Dancers of Clean one?

439
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,620
Is that the one?

440
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,180
The one with all your friends.

441
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,180
Okay.

442
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,180
All my friends.

443
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,180
All my friends.

444
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,180
Yeah.

445
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,180
So that's how much I know.

446
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,180
It's like all my friends.

447
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,580
All my friends are at the Grand California.

448
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,580
That one?

449
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,580
That one?

450
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,580
Yeah.

451
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,580
I don't know.

452
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,900
I feel like, I think of LCD Sound System as like I learned about this band when I moved

453
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,380
to Los Angeles and it was around my Los Angeles friends.

454
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,380
Yeah.

455
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,380
Six, seven.

456
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,380
Yeah.

457
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:57,340
I think of this very much as like young 20s just moved to LA.

458
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,100
I remember they did a big hoopla about breaking up.

459
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,100
Yeah.

460
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,100
That's right.

461
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,100
They did a fake breakup in a Madison Square Garden Residency.

462
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,220
And then they got packed together and have sold tickets thanks to the help of American

463
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,220
Express.

464
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,220
Oh, sick.

465
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,220
Sick.

466
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,220
That's a good credit card.

467
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,220
It's a great card.

468
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,220
Yeah.

469
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,220
Great card.

470
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,220
Is the card good?

471
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,220
Yeah.

472
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,220
Do you like American Express?

473
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,460
I only have ever had one American Express.

474
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:28,260
It's funny you say that because coming up soon on Podcasts to Ride Club 3, I am going

475
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,100
to be doing an episode on credit card.

476
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,220
Jason and I will be doing a credit card point episode.

477
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,220
Oh boy.

478
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,220
The people demanded it.

479
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:40,420
The people voted on six topics and by far there's no narrow win or anything in this

480
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,420
election.

481
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,420
That's right.

482
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,740
It was credit card points by like 10 percentage points and that's out of six choices.

483
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,180
It's crazy actually in hindsight how smooth that election went by the way.

484
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,180
That's crazy.

485
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,180
Oh really?

486
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,100
I thought it'd be kind of a little nutty, but it was just like chill and everybody liked

487
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,100
the results and it was good.

488
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,100
We knew by the afternoon election day before the polls even closed.

489
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,100
Yeah.

490
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,900
And then the loser came out and was like, wow, I lost a fair fight.

491
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,140
This is really fun.

492
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,140
And it was chill.

493
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,140
That's kind of nice.

494
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:14,100
The lines were longer for ice cream at the end of the night because everyone's like,

495
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,180
well, I think we earned this.

496
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,660
We're recording this Monday, November 4th.

497
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,160
Just to time stamp it.

498
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,140
You do kind of have to time stamp it.

499
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,140
You know that's the joke.

500
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,560
But I do think you have to say we have no idea.

501
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,560
We don't.

502
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
By the way, I do love all these tangents.

503
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,520
I'm imagining Scott right now with his little steam coming out of his damn ears listening

504
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,520
to this.

505
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,520
He's popping his AirPods out right now.

506
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,520
Yeah.

507
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,520
They're fried.

508
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,360
They're fried using recording equipment in a hotel spa.

509
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,360
That's right.

510
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,560
But no, LCD, I think especially if you go live, it's not a fish situation where I don't

511
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,360
think it translates to the record, but like live really.

512
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,360
I think the difference from somebody who might think they're OK to somebody who really likes

513
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,800
them is like dance music where there's a lot of repetition, but that's kind of the point.

514
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,760
You want to just be vibing on the groove for nine minutes.

515
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,000
If you like to vibe on a groove for nine minutes straight, that's more maybe your band.

516
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The same groove will be just repeating for like three minutes with little changes, percussion

517
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,880
changes, synth changes.

518
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,000
And that's especially if you go and you have, if dad has a couple drinks and he's alone

519
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,400
and just vibing on the floor like a cool older man, like on the on the standing.

520
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,040
I thought you meant like you've like fell down and somebody did fall down.

521
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,320
Oh, no. I got to the concert and I immediately saw there was an EMT there in the back with

522
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,360
a like a board or whatever we call it, the stretcher or whatever.

523
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,040
Yeah. And I go, oh, God, what dad is going to need this by the end of the night?

524
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,280
No, man. And it was that I was a young lady.

525
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,560
Oh, no. I was like immediately.

526
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,320
I was like, oh, God, somebody hit the deck and then they ran over.

527
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,960
I think she was probably died.

528
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,960
They're all dehydrated from what the drugs they're doing.

529
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,640
Oh, I went to go see the new pornographers that the will turn one time and everyone was

530
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,480
lining up outside because you get to the will turn a little early.

531
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,880
You can just stand on the floor area.

532
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,600
So everyone was getting there early.

533
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,720
So and this like teenager was just walking up, joined the line and just like face planted

534
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,800
like on the concrete and just stood up, just covered in blood.

535
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Oh, no. And it didn't.

536
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,480
They didn't like stumble or I don't know what was going on with them.

537
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,720
But it was just very shocking to see.

538
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,480
Well, it's like we know this from like professional wrestling fandom.

539
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,480
You get the right spot up in the head like that head.

540
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,320
Blood will just come out super thin.

541
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,440
Yeah. Looks good. Good color on that kid.

542
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,680
Yep. Made a few bucks that day, I'm sure.

543
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,200
Yeah. That's the angle's green.

544
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,920
You know what I mean? Sold the angle for sure.

545
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,360
That's right. But yeah, anyway.

546
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,200
Look, this naughty list will take us on tangents.

547
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,000
We're not even thinking about right now or today's episode.

548
00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:00,400
But we are ostensibly here to talk about 20,000 leagues under the sea at Tokyo,

549
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,720
Disney or Tokyo, Disney, sea specific baby, which is half day trip.

550
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,520
You get all the Tokyo, Disney, sea you need.

551
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,360
No, I'm sure I'm on your side.

552
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,360
I do like the more I think about it, I would do I would do a day and a half.

553
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,880
I'd do two days at Tokyo, Disney, sea, I think I've grown there.

554
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,440
Disneyland. I think I said this before.

555
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,120
I almost would skip Disneyland and in Tokyo, skip it.

556
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,640
Yes, it's not offensive to do that.

557
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,240
Although I would say now I'd probably have to go

558
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,200
because I couldn't skip the Beauty and the Beast ride.

559
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,280
I'd have to see that thing.

560
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,640
That's true. There's a couple of things.

561
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,240
And like the Monsters Inc ride is really good.

562
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,400
But Beauty and the Beast is I didn't love that Monsters Inc ride.

563
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,880
Loved Honey Hunt.

564
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,480
Well, yes, didn't.

565
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,800
I like that a lot better than monster.

566
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,160
But I do like the Monsters Inc.

567
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,640
Yeah, I didn't.

568
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,800
I didn't. I didn't.

569
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,320
I don't remember it. I went on it.

570
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,640
Now hold a flag. You shine a flashlight on things.

571
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,000
You like shine a light on the monsters.

572
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,960
I know it's fun.

573
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,120
Again, it's not in the League of Poo or anything.

574
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,960
No, Poo is great.

575
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,640
Yeah, Poo is amazing.

576
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,440
And then Beauty and the Beast looks amazing.

577
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,640
And then they're going to have like a brand new Space Mountain in a year or two.

578
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,080
What are they doing to the Space Mountain?

579
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,840
They demolished it.

580
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,920
Like not a refurbish.

581
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,360
No, they're building it from the ground.

582
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,520
That's crazy.

583
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,000
They set it on fire and the whole thing burned up.

584
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,840
Oh, boy. They're building a new one.

585
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,680
Yeah, that's cool.

586
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,560
I mean, well, maybe I do.

587
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,080
I got to go back to Disneyland.

588
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,360
Oh, yeah. So I was just like, especially if you go in a year or two,

589
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,800
it's like you got to go at least at least a half day at Tokyo Disney.

590
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,520
Yeah, like a day and a half to Tokyo.

591
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,200
You have to do two full days, which you shouldn't.

592
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,360
You should do three or four.

593
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,640
We've established on this show.

594
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,440
Yep. If you're doing to your half day at Disneyland,

595
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,480
Tokyo, Disney and then half day,

596
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,280
Disney and then the full day at Disney.

597
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,440
Yeah, because you got to do a full day at Universal Osaka.

598
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,120
That was a big surprise for me. It's far.

599
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,600
It's it's a different trip.

600
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,840
But if you if you I know you want to get to Japan, you're talking about it.

601
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,200
You want to do it at some point if it happened.

602
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,600
No. Yeah.

603
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,960
But if you don't don't skip Universal, Universal is a great choice.

604
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,480
Because they still have Jaws.

605
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,520
The Jaws are so fun.

606
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,120
My friend Jaws again.

607
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,240
Jason's friend Jaws.

608
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,200
The Amity boat tours with the grenade launcher, you know.

609
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,320
It's so good. And that was so that's why.

610
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,080
And that's why I went because I wanted to do it.

611
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,360
I heard about it.

612
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,160
The even the it's because the Jungle Cruise ish where somebody's like talking.

613
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,240
But even like the guy speaking Japanese, I got all the jokes

614
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,240
because it's just the rhythm of jokes.

615
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,600
It was just and like he shoots the thing and that blows up the gas.

616
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,360
He actually shoots the gas gas with the grenade launcher and it blows up.

617
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,440
And he like does this like take to the audience.

618
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,640
He's like, oh, sorry.

619
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,720
Basically, it's like it's so funny.

620
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,120
It made me laugh so hard.

621
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,960
I didn't do I know I'm mad at myself.

622
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I keep floating.

623
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,720
I'm like, we celebrate Christmas.

624
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,480
Disney to like the family.

625
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,480
And I think everybody's looking at me like, no, we're not doing that.

626
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,720
I'm like, it would be fun.

627
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,160
I still think it holds.

628
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,640
I think it's cheaper to take a trip to Tokyo and go to Disney

629
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,120
and Disneyland than it would be to do two days at the Grand Californian.

630
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,480
Oh, yeah. 100 percent.

631
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,160
It would be. Yeah.

632
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,360
So maybe we all go to Christmas at Tokyo.

633
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,240
Well, you get the cave seat pockets.

634
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,440
Oh, that's a tradition.

635
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,720
Yes. In Japan.

636
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,120
Yeah. Yeah.

637
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,520
So, yes, this is this.

638
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,680
I feel like this ride is a little bit even overlooked in the

639
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,000
when you're hearing about how great Tokyo Disney is.

640
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,840
Yeah, because it is really a sleeper.

641
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,240
Awesome ride is that sleeper.

642
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,040
But you know what I'm saying?

643
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,840
It's like if you go down the list, like Journey to the Center of the Earth,

644
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,600
Sinbad, which is just my favorite is my favorite ride in both parks.

645
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,040
It's my favorite Disney ride.

646
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,600
And I that doesn't make that.

647
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,800
I wouldn't argue with that at all.

648
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,960
Yeah. That is so how much I love it.

649
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,400
That is how much our hearts swelled.

650
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,160
And it's everybody who does it. Yeah.

651
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,280
Also, we haven't had anybody who we were like, oh, go on Sinbad.

652
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,680
They were like, that sucks.

653
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,880
Everybody kind of comes back like teary eyed.

654
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,080
I mean, like that plucky little Sinbad, I mean, so nice.

655
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,120
I I'm really freaking out if I if I told this story on the on the Bronto

656
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,720
rap episode, but I tell you about my Sinbad thing with where I did it three times

657
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,400
for the Sinbad ride today.

658
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,200
I don't know. Well, real quick, there's a dark ride

659
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,640
that's kind of small worldish in Tokyo, Disney, DisneySea.

660
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,560
And I didn't know anything about it before we went on.

661
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,840
It's got an original Alan Menken song, which I think is like

662
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,880
the second best song Alan Menken's ever written.

663
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,560
It's incredible. Part of their part of your world. Yeah. Yeah.

664
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,840
Anyway, go ahead.

665
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,120
So so I did the ride because I heard about it.

666
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
I loved it. Just a great ride.

667
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,560
And then I and I but the other thing that's great is even in Tokyo,

668
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,640
it is you see short line.

669
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,560
I just went right to the back of the line. So short went right in.

670
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,760
Do it again. And one of the one of the women, one of the employees,

671
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,720
they're, you know, Japanese.

672
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,080
And she goes, she looks at me, she goes like going again.

673
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,480
And I go, yeah. And she goes, wait, wait.

674
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,320
And as my boat's going, she goes, wait, wait.

675
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
I see her in the back there.

676
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,760
And I go, oh, what was that?

677
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,200
I do the whole right again.

678
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,320
And I come around to go exit.

679
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,360
And she comes up and she goes, no, no, stay, stay on the boat, stay on the boat.

680
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,160
And then she hands me this little pamphlet.

681
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,880
Now, I've been traveling in Japan solo.

682
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,400
I did. I did like a week and I was exhausted, jet lagged.

683
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,440
And like I was, you know, like you don't get to share a lot of stuff with people.

684
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,280
You know, traveling solo, so you chat with strangers.

685
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,720
But, you know, you're in Japan.

686
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,800
I don't speak Japanese.

687
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,760
And so I, you know, I started to have all these Cuban connection moments.

688
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,360
And she goes, wait, wait, stay on the boat.

689
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,160
She hands me this this this pamphlet.

690
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,320
And it's the it's the Sinbad song translated to English.

691
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,840
And she goes, so you can sing along.

692
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,760
And my eyes started watering up and I was like, oh my God.

693
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,560
And it was like, great.

694
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,240
And I sat there with my little thing and I sung along with the song.

695
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,880
And wow, it was that Sinbad is the best.

696
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,440
I'm serious. I got like a little chills.

697
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,040
Yeah, that's how much that's the Disney thing.

698
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,920
Right. That's what you want.

699
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,080
It's a great version.

700
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,120
Alan Menken performs it.

701
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,480
There's a YouTube from the D23 at Tokyo they had a couple of years ago.

702
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,080
And he performs it in English.

703
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,360
And there's just people in the audience just like weeping.

704
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,080
It's impossible not to.

705
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,480
Yeah, possible not to.

706
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,280
It was it's crazy.

707
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,000
It's crazy what just that song does.

708
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,760
The ride itself is amazing or great.

709
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,520
But that song is what takes it to this next level.

710
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,160
Yeah. But yeah.

711
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,760
So so you can lose that like 20,000 leagues is so amazing.

712
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
Yes. When you talk about

713
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,120
there's so much good stuff there.

714
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,240
But yeah, this ride, this ride would be like a top three ride

715
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,800
in another domestic park, probably.

716
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,760
Yeah. Like it's that good.

717
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,520
Well, you know what?

718
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,720
It fits for me in terms of like like if I do a Disneyland trip

719
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,680
and this is like a California guy, I've got to go.

720
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,680
I get to go to Disneyland more than other people do. Right.

721
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,360
Like if you're if you go once, you got to do Space Mountain.

722
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,800
You got to do Pirates. You got to do Haunted Mansion.

723
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,960
Like those are probably the big three.

724
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,200
If you're in the main park.

725
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,080
Yeah. The main part.

726
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,000
And I like throw Indiana Jones in there because I love it.

727
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,960
Indiana Jones.

728
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,960
I think if you're like Johnny never, never went to Disney,

729
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,800
I think those are the three you got to kind of do to say you've done Disney.

730
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,960
And but then I I think that like if I do a Disneyland day, I do have like

731
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,960
I got to do either Pirates or Haunted Mansion.

732
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,400
That's kind of on the list.

733
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,520
Maybe not both, but I got to do one of those.

734
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,600
And then I got to do like Big Thunder because I like it.

735
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,760
And I'll do Rise of the Resistance now because that's great.

736
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,640
But I always have to do at least one dark ride.

737
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,440
Like it's usually Mr. Toad or Peter Pan.

738
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,320
Yeah. Or one of those things.

739
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,160
And I think that 20,000 Leagues at Tokyo Disney is like kind of like

740
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,680
it's a must do dark ride.

741
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,160
It's just kind of like it's a break from everything else.

742
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,600
It's low key.

743
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,640
It's got mood for days.

744
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,600
It is like, you know, yeah, it's it's so vibey.

745
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,000
It's so vibey.

746
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:30,040
Watching the a few videos of before this, the sets are incredible.

747
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,800
Yeah, like and the the area itself, I mean, so much kinetic energy

748
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:41,240
with the boat going through the mountain and the Nautilus is parked there

749
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,080
and all these walkways like it's amazing.

750
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:51,160
Like I don't if I went to you to see see tomorrow, I'm like, oh, I want to see

751
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,720
the classic Disney seat.

752
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:01,880
Like there's this new Fantasy Springs area with Tangled and Frozen and Peter Pan rides.

753
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,080
And I'm like, it's kind of a pain in the ass to get into, as with any new theme

754
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:12,280
park product nowadays, it's a pain in the ass for the first three to six to 12 months.

755
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,840
Yeah. And I'm like, I think I'm more excited to go to the best theme park in the world.

756
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,720
Like, I still haven't experienced that.

757
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,640
Yeah. Before I get to all the new rides at it, you know, I think when I was there,

758
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:31,360
they just opened the new version of Soarin and that was just like a four hour line.

759
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,320
I'm like, I don't know.

760
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,360
I've got Soarin, huh?

761
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,200
I'm sure this new Soarin is great for this stuff.

762
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,720
But their new line, the new line, the new queue is better.

763
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,840
I'm sure. Oh, at land or at sea.

764
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,600
At sea. OK. Or wherever it is.

765
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,800
Yeah, it's at sea. Yeah.

766
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,440
But like Toy Story, Midway Mania, I would take a picture with Big Woody

767
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,840
head that you enter it through. Yeah, we didn't do that.

768
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,400
But I don't need to do that.

769
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,200
I've done that in multiple parks at this point.

770
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,560
Yeah. But you need to see Harrison High Tower's statues of bosomy women.

771
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,480
Well, of course. In the queue of the Tower of Terror.

772
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,840
Tower of Terror is also really good.

773
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,400
That's Disney Sea and that's a real, that's the one I wouldn't pass up on.

774
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,680
That's an original story.

775
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,680
Like, I would have to see that.

776
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,280
There's also a magic trick on that one that I truly don't understand.

777
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,800
Like, I see, I think I know what you're talking about.

778
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,480
It's the idol. Yeah.

779
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,280
Pre-show. And it's a thing that like when I was like watching it

780
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,360
and this thing disappears and I'm like, I was like,

781
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,840
there's no misdirection. You're looking right at it.

782
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,240
There's lights shining and stuff like that.

783
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,880
But it's you don't feel it drop or go anywhere.

784
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,000
It's just right. That's great.

785
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,120
Somebody online, I think, slowed it down.

786
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,000
And I think it really what it is is just it shoots down so fast.

787
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,360
Yeah. And it's kind of in the dark and there's like a little flash.

788
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,640
Yeah. It's all timed out perfectly.

789
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,560
But I'll say this about the twenty thousand leagues,

790
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,480
the entrance and the entrance area.

791
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,120
When I was there's another this is another my my my Disney stories.

792
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,360
When I was like when I did that, see, is like when I walked in,

793
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,800
you know, they don't have the castle, they have the volcano.

794
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,600
When you walk in, it's kind of a big thing.

795
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,640
And it is like a great entrance.

796
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,960
You walk through, you're like, wow.

797
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,400
And I was like, wow.

798
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,280
And there's like a Japanese woman left.

799
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,480
And she's like her eyes were open.

800
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,480
She's like, wow. And I'm like, and I looked at her and I go,

801
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,800
we made eye contact. I was like, it's good.

802
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,600
And she looks at me, she goes, it's good.

803
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,920
We like high fived and we ran all these moments with strangers.

804
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,960
I had was so great to there.

805
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,040
That's a really we have.

806
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,200
I think we were getting on this ride toward the end of our trip.

807
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,240
And I think a cast member was like, what's your favorite ride here?

808
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,280
And I think we said Sinbad.

809
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,440
And she was like, that's my favorite, too.

810
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,440
Oh, like you do get little like moments like that.

811
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,440
Yeah. It's pure, pure feelings of what I mean.

812
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,680
Do you guys I mean, you guys have been more recently than I have.

813
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,320
Do you feel like the cast members at Disneyland in California?

814
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,080
Do they still have that kind of like warm?

815
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,240
They're really excited to be there.

816
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,840
That that extra kind of I kind of think that the cast members are part of like

817
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,680
the Disney charm to me.

818
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,760
I think they're above and beyond.

819
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,840
Well, here's what I'll say.

820
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,600
I like a couple of years ago when I get in that kind of love at Six Flags.

821
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,520
Let's just say that.

822
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,640
No, the different kind of love flags.

823
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,720
You can not even spot love, you know, not even a transactional thing.

824
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,800
Yeah, you'll get vape love.

825
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,280
You can see a lot of people making out in the lines, but that's not love.

826
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,120
Well, it could be love.

827
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,720
It could be love.

828
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,760
They don't lead to love.

829
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,080
Do you see the version of love? Yeah.

830
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,880
Well, teenage love is a version of love.

831
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,960
Teenage love is a they're very they're very much in love.

832
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,920
They just don't know. They don't know they're not yet.

833
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,680
That makes it so pure.

834
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,840
That's what makes it so pure.

835
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,640
A couple of years ago, when they would do Guardians of the Galaxy,

836
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,040
the the tower, the Halloween overlay,

837
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,520
Mitch, God, Monsters After Dark, I can't remember anything.

838
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,040
Monsters After Dark, they would do

839
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,000
like a bit where the clothes were tattered on the employees.

840
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,840
And the first year or two, they would have employees do a bit.

841
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,040
We're like, oh, my God, you got to get out of here or whatever.

842
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,360
Or like somebody pretended he was like a monster inside the skin costume,

843
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,000
basically, where it's like, oh, hello, baby.

844
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,240
I'm just a regular human or something.

845
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,680
They were doing all these fun bits.

846
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,040
And then I did it this year and I was like, yes, seatbelts.

847
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,920
Where's the seat like tug on the yellow strap?

848
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,560
So I do feel like maybe I haven't seen a lot of fun.

849
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,920
Theatrical employees lately. Yeah.

850
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,880
And on one hand, I'm like, I miss seeing more like a goofy person

851
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,800
at the Haunted Mansion trying to scare little kids. Yeah.

852
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,040
But then you're also like, are they making enough money to really

853
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,600
have to put in the energy? Yeah, that's the thing is, I do feel

854
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,520
I don't want to be like, this isn't up to my standards.

855
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:35,160
But that is incumbent on Disney to pay them enough that I like that job.

856
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,640
And because obviously, it's like the type of job that if you're

857
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,840
in your 20s and you like Disney and you got paid decent,

858
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,200
what a great job that must be. Yeah.

859
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,080
Yeah, I think the rise of resistance still has the yes.

860
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,280
Those guys do a good job being scary resistance or empire people.

861
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,360
Oh, my God. I can't even think of that.

862
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,000
Well, there's the resistance and the first order, the first order.

863
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,760
Of course, the first order is a lot different than the original.

864
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,880
Yeah. You remember when Luke was like, we've got to fight the first order.

865
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,040
I forgot about that.

866
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,600
Star Wars four, which is a lot different.

867
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,240
Yes. And and that change paid off big time.

868
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,000
I was so mad at my dad that he showed me Star Wars four first when I was a kid.

869
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,120
Why would he show me Star Wars?

870
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,480
You should have waited until the other one.

871
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,560
Yeah. Like, I don't know what my dad was thinking when he showed me Star Wars.

872
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,640
Very foolish.

873
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,360
Yeah. So so this one, or did I cut you off in another story?

874
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,560
No, no, I was I was I was I was just to say, like, when you see the volcano

875
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,560
and, you know, like in Disneyland, you could go inside the cat.

876
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,400
You see the cats, you go inside, but it's not that impressive.

877
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,320
But when you go inside the volcano

878
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,160
and you see the Nemo land, the 20,000 Leaves of the Sea land, mysterious island.

879
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,600
Yes. Yes.

880
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,080
It's crazy. It's such a great reveal.

881
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,360
And there must be some forced perspective

882
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,200
because it feels so much bigger than it should be.

883
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,920
Would you like to turn a corner and you're just like, what?

884
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,480
And you're looking down into this thing.

885
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,080
And there is potato churros there.

886
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,960
Oh, yeah. I didn't try them.

887
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,240
With a line of ketchup inside the churro.

888
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,800
Oh, Jason, what do you think?

889
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,080
I like that. Like the sound of that.

890
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,640
Pre let me ask you this, though, with other things

891
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,160
where you would use like a pump ketchup after the after you got your food.

892
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,520
Would you do you like being able to distribute the amount of ketchup or

893
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,320
like would you take a hot dog where they gave you a little ketchup?

894
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,760
Or would you try to do your own?

895
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,840
Well, I would, because I'll tell you what those pumps are impossible

896
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,480
to make a straight line with.

897
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,200
If you're making a puddle of ketchup for French fries,

898
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,600
that's one thing.

899
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,920
But inevitably, you try to get the pump going.

900
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,320
And like the first spot you hit is going to have a glob of ketchup

901
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,440
before you get a line.

902
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,760
But this question can be for everyone.

903
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,520
Would it be offensive, though, if they were to put ketchup on everything,

904
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,240
not just on like a churro or some specialty item?

905
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,040
If you were to go to Disney and they were to put the ketchup on,

906
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,760
would you try to go, well, give me extra so I could dip?

907
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,000
Or would you be fine with it?

908
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,320
Whatever they decided.

909
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,880
I think I'd be fine with it.

910
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,560
I mean, I've always liked ketchup.

911
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,200
I was always a big ketchup kid.

912
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,360
But I mean, are you like a dipper?

913
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,680
Do you like a ton of ketchup?

914
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,120
Would you like be upset that you weren't getting like a ton?

915
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,320
Like, oh, I see what you're saying.

916
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,200
Yeah, sorry.

917
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,360
No, I don't think so. OK.

918
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,720
I hear what you're saying.

919
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,960
It's so funny that we would order like we would order

920
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,560
the loaded fries with like sauce and stuff on it.

921
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,640
And we would take it as it comes.

922
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,240
I go, this is how it is.

923
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,360
But if you're saying it's a little different with ketchup,

924
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,360
it is a little different.

925
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,160
We expect to like customize our ketchup.

926
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,800
I'm shocked he said that because my first reaction was like

927
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,960
like a little side of ketchup, just in case I need to use it up a little bit.

928
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,960
Well, this is a local thing.

929
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,800
But if you guys have been to Walt's, right?

930
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,040
The pinball bar here. Yeah.

931
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:45,080
They do a hot dog there and they do an incredible ketchup job.

932
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,200
They'll pre ketchup the thing.

933
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,000
And oh, interesting.

934
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,120
It's a little swizzle.

935
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,800
And it's a talk about straight line.

936
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,520
It's like a perfect swizzle.

937
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,160
The lines are all the same size.

938
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,080
No globiness. It's just like it's incredible.

939
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,800
And I love that hot dog for getting my ketchup like that.

940
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,960
It's interesting. All right.

941
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,600
Well, I'll try that.

942
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,720
But yeah, I I did just go to award wieners.

943
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,320
My phone died at award wieners.

944
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,040
I got on my computer and I texted Lindsey.

945
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,080
My phone died.

946
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,880
I'm on my on my computer at award wieners.

947
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,640
You have a picture of the text.

948
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,240
But I got Jason's favorite film strip fries.

949
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,240
I do like those fries.

950
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,200
And they're like they're not like film strip fry.

951
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,040
What is a film?

952
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,880
It's like a little moon or something.

953
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,720
It looks like a moon or like fry.

954
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,320
But the fries are a different shape.

955
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,520
Kind of. Yeah.

956
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,880
They're almost like crisps or something.

957
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,000
Kind of like a potato wedge.

958
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,600
Oh, like a little half moon.

959
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,720
Kind of. Yeah.

960
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,040
And they're like they're good freezer fries.

961
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,080
That's almost what I.

962
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,160
But I'm like, oh, Jason's kind of like, look,

963
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,040
have I given him some some of the business for saying

964
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,320
he likes film strip fries from award wieners? Sure.

965
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,880
But I was eating them and I went, well,

966
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,840
there is something to these film strip fries.

967
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,760
I have to give it to them.

968
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,600
They're good.

969
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,640
I have to limit them.

970
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,960
Fries are one of the things that I am like,

971
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,000
they say salad or fries.

972
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,840
I just force myself to do salad nowadays.

973
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,600
Force, yeah.

974
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,720
I'll just go crazy.

975
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,080
You grab your own arm and start squeezing it.

976
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,160
Go and say salad, say salad, say salad.

977
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,240
Well, I sometimes like I work.

978
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,200
I go to Jamie and say, do you want one of us get fries?

979
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,680
One of us get salad and we share like.

980
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,480
And then you eat all the fries, she eats all the salad.

981
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,480
I know how that I know.

982
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,160
I know that game goes well.

983
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,920
But also, like, I really only want like four or five fries.

984
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,240
Like, I don't want a lot of fries.

985
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,640
Usually too greasy.

986
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,840
Make me too bloated on that.

987
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,960
I can't get on board with that.

988
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,960
I want a ton of fries.

989
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,840
I'm finally doctors of water is kind of trying to get my diet and water

990
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,120
and like up the fruits and vegetables and like cut back on sugar,

991
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,000
because that's like my one vice.

992
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,240
Getting your diet or that's like asking Sampson to cut his hair.

993
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,000
That's your power, Jason.

994
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,680
And right after we bought all those bags of day after Halloween.

995
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,720
Oh, I think we have like four or five, four or five.

996
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,520
Does that mean eight? Huh?

997
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,640
Does that mean eight? No, it was four.

998
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,640
It was buy one, get one free on some of the bags.

999
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,400
And we bought four bags.

1000
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,680
And then the next day I was like, I don't want those Reese's bats.

1001
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,120
So it sounds like it's more than four.

1002
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,120
No, I think it's five.

1003
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,000
Oh, it's five. OK, OK. Yeah.

1004
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,320
And what were they?

1005
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:29,080
Um, I think it was a bag of fun sized Kit Kats.

1006
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:35,280
OK, maybe two bags of like, you know, sugar skull Reese's,

1007
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,600
which I was disappointed because they're tiny.

1008
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:42,280
Yeah, they're shaped like Calaveras day Azucar, the Mexican day,

1009
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,040
the dead sugar skulls.

1010
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,320
Are they like the size of like a little the little gold foil cups?

1011
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,880
They're like the size of like if you get a like candy cane

1012
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,360
or a teddy bear shaped one at Christmas.

1013
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,600
So thick, but small. Yes. OK.

1014
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:03,240
And then a bag of bats, which I was a bag of bats of Reese's bats.

1015
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,760
So you have three bags of Reese's.

1016
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,080
I think so. Yeah.

1017
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,920
Dude, I lost track.

1018
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,440
No, I've lost track. I'm trying to think.

1019
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,640
I know what candy we had. Yeah.

1020
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,040
We had one bag of Reese's.

1021
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,960
And they were like some pumpkin shape, I think, whatever,

1022
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,400
which always when they're different shapes,

1023
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,040
they're almost better than a regular cup.

1024
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,360
They are for sure better.

1025
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,560
For some reason, I think it's the distribution of peanut butter

1026
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,600
and chocolate or whatever.

1027
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,920
Yes. You try that if you're at a gas station, the caramel cup,

1028
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,480
the caramel Reese's cup. I haven't tried that.

1029
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,640
I haven't tried that. It's a it's a crazy variant.

1030
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,040
It's nuts. Yeah, OK.

1031
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,600
Caramel and Reese's just like you don't think they go together.

1032
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,320
But of course it does. It's all sugar.

1033
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,880
Of course it goes together.

1034
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,360
But I do. I do agree. I love shapes.

1035
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,120
I do love the shapes. Did you say all of them?

1036
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,360
Was there a missing one?

1037
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,000
That's four. Right.

1038
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,440
Or did you say I there's three Reese's and then there's one.

1039
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,520
I think the Reese's sugar skulls who buy one get one free

1040
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,320
and then just a markdown bag of Kit Kats.

1041
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,280
So Kit Kats, bats and two bags of sugar skulls.

1042
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,360
That's four. So that's four. Yeah.

1043
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,280
OK. Yeah.

1044
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,800
Well, if you go home and you find an extra one, we'll tweet a picture.

1045
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,760
OK. To show everyone. Yes.

1046
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,480
So that's the thing that's wild.

1047
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,680
You've said that before. You only want four fries.

1048
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,480
I want the five guys where the bag is spilling over with fries.

1049
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,840
Well, I kind of either want four.

1050
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,440
I want them overflowing in a dirty paper bag.

1051
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,880
I love the the CEO of five guys is like it's like a psychological trick.

1052
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,880
What they do, you know what I'm talking about?

1053
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,120
Oh, yeah, where they overload the fries in the cup.

1054
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,160
And then there's a bunch in the bag.

1055
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,720
So you're like, oh, my God, look what I got away with.

1056
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,000
Like, look at the extra I got.

1057
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,760
And it's a trick they do to make you feel you've gotten more.

1058
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,520
And it works every time, right?

1059
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,360
Even though it's one simple trick

1060
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,200
to keep me coming back to five guys, guess what?

1061
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,240
It worked. Even though it's 19, tricks wouldn't fool people.

1062
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,440
The price of those burgers, even though it's like $19 to go to five.

1063
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,960
I know. Mysterious Island is the name of this place.

1064
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:03,400
And I Volcania Lagoon is the name of the water.

1065
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,400
Well, that's great.

1066
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,720
That's great. In between, like in the volcano.

1067
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,560
So, yeah, we were talking about like you see a volcano in the distance.

1068
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,920
And yes, you assume it's just a facade or something.

1069
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,800
And then, you know, you can go inside the volcano, essentially.

1070
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,280
And it's a pretty expansive space.

1071
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,200
There's a bunch of water there.

1072
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,320
There's a bunch of different things.

1073
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,320
And then there's like three different exits.

1074
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,920
So you can go into different parts of Disney Sea from there.

1075
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,040
Yeah, it's a hub. It's a little mini hub. Right.

1076
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,160
And I actually did not put you guys in the spot,

1077
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,240
but I did watch this kind of interest.

1078
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,800
I watched the 1954 20,000 Leagues before this episode.

1079
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,840
Oh, yeah. Have you guys watched that recently?

1080
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,520
I think we watched it when we did the original 20,000 Leagues

1081
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,840
episode six years ago. OK.

1082
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,720
But I haven't seen it. James Mason.

1083
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,720
Yeah. Yeah.

1084
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,800
That's what it sounds like to me.

1085
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,240
Yeah. Objectively not Indian.

1086
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,080
Like he was often portrayed as. Yes.

1087
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,840
But he's but that the the mysterious island,

1088
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,920
it is like a lot like the movie,

1089
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,040
because I watched a ride through after I watched the movie.

1090
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:09,040
And it is like they they really recreated it in a really cool way.

1091
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,920
Like, you know, if you're a fan of that movie and I don't know

1092
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,480
kind of why you would. I don't know if I love that movie.

1093
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,520
I don't know if I.

1094
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,400
There's things about it that are cool, but I don't know that I loved it.

1095
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,200
Yeah, like, but there's plenty like the sets and stuff.

1096
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,200
Yeah, the sets are amazing.

1097
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,960
The underwater sets are great. I like that song.

1098
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,560
Sure. You can't remember it now, but I know there's that.

1099
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,800
It's about like he's kissing a shark and sailor song. Yeah.

1100
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,280
Yeah. Yeah. Kirk Douglas is kind of insane in that movie. Yes.

1101
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,360
He kisses a seal.

1102
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,880
Everybody kiss or the seal kisses everybody. Right.

1103
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,000
Which is all pretty cool.

1104
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,920
That's one of those things. Yeah, that's awesome.

1105
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,360
You can't act with you can't.

1106
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,600
We're too woke for having seal actors now, dude.

1107
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,720
Like you used to be CGI seals and CGI seal kisses.

1108
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,120
Yeah, no, there was like one.

1109
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,400
There was one take where Kirk Douglas was getting a kiss from the seal

1110
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,800
and the seal like nipped at him and it looked kind of dangerous.

1111
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,080
And then he was like, whoa, and kind of got back into it.

1112
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,000
But like that made that like, yeah, that's if you're drunk and hang out.

1113
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,040
That's the danger. Yeah. You know, magic magic.

1114
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,560
They should have real seal kisses at Disney.

1115
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,960
The behind the scenes of one of the older Bond movies

1116
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,200
where like Roger Moore and his stunt double are running across alligator heads.

1117
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,120
Yes. Yeah, there was a stunt double doing that.

1118
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,600
Yeah, I but there is behind the scene footage

1119
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,120
where like one of the gators almost kissing.

1120
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,360
Oh, yeah. Oh, it's insane. Yeah.

1121
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,480
That must be like an act that people used to do in alligator farms.

1122
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,800
Like you could run across alligators. Oh, I'm sure.

1123
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,280
Because that's like not something that I think that somebody can create

1124
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,960
whole cloth and be like, oh, well, what if he just ran across alligators?

1125
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,120
Like like like a fucking cartoon? No.

1126
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,040
Like that has to be like a thing that like, oh, I used to see this act

1127
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,160
where they did alligator running or whatever. They look like rocks, right?

1128
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,600
Yeah, I don't think so.

1129
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,800
Oh, they look like rocks. Let's just do it.

1130
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,040
Things were better back then.

1131
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,120
I was when I go.

1132
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,920
It's one of those things that I get why you don't do it.

1133
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,240
But there is a movie.

1134
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,960
Whenever I do a movie podcast, I will always try to get people

1135
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,640
to do a thing called Kung Fu Kids 2. Have you ever watched this movie?

1136
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,880
No, it's on YouTube and a very low res thing.

1137
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,480
But I watch it like every year now because I just love it.

1138
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,320
I used to watch it as a kid.

1139
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,360
I had a VHS of it and just ran it through.

1140
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,120
But it's it's a it's like a Hong Kong

1141
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:25,880
Kung Fu movie starring children with the children doing their own stunts.

1142
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,440
And it is unbelievable. Like it's they're so good.

1143
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,600
Yeah, very, very good.

1144
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,080
But there's like a like a 10 year old and they're doing the thing

1145
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:37,120
where they they slide him across the table and he's like busting through glass

1146
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,240
and he gets thrown off.

1147
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,000
And and then like, well, and the other stunt performers

1148
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
take worse bumps than they do.

1149
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,480
It's it's great, man. It's a great movie.

1150
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,080
But it's one of those things they go like, of course,

1151
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,400
I would never want to have kids done that or do that's awful.

1152
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,720
It's bad. You can't do it. It's dangerous. It's terrible.

1153
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,160
But I'm so glad this is here.

1154
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,240
I'm so glad we have this.

1155
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,880
Well, the kids, they were OK.

1156
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,600
Maybe they were they didn't get hurt.

1157
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,600
I mean, they got hurt. I'm sure they got hurt.

1158
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,040
I'm sure they got live. Yeah.

1159
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,120
Of course, they got hurt.

1160
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:08,040
This isn't three ninjas where they like cut away at the last moment.

1161
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:12,200
Yes. And I think three ninjas was a remake of Kung Fu kids.

1162
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,600
Oh, really? Because it's it's three kids.

1163
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,880
It's three kids and they live with their grandfather.

1164
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,040
Their grandfather trained them.

1165
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,760
And I only watched Kung Fu kids who I've never seen Kung Fu kids one.

1166
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,040
But we only had the VHS of Kung Fu kids to Kung Fu kids.

1167
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,000
Yeah. Wow.

1168
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,400
The grandpa and the grandma have a fight on soda cans.

1169
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,640
They put soda cans on the ground and they have to balance on top of soda cans.

1170
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,760
And the first one to touch the ground loses the duel. Really?

1171
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,920
And they fight over the custody of the kids.

1172
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,520
This sounds good. It's a good movie, dude.

1173
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,360
All right. All right. I'll watch it. I'll watch it.

1174
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,080
Yeah. Kung Fu kids. Wow. Yeah. Two, two.

1175
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:49,240
All right. So that's nineteen thousand nine hundred ninety three tangents.

1176
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,400
We're close to already getting. Yeah, we're in. Yeah.

1177
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,520
Pretty good. Pretty good.

1178
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,960
Well, I should bring up like a big element of this ride

1179
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,880
where, you know, Disney has done so many water dark rides,

1180
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,840
multiple submarine rides that are always a pain in the ass to operate.

1181
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:13,240
And this one they solved by just making a dark ride,

1182
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:18,840
albeit a suspended dark ride, and just putting water and bubbles in the windows.

1183
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,280
And it works.

1184
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,480
It reminds me of the like, I think, now debunked

1185
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:29,360
story of like NASA spent all this money developing a pain pen

1186
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,680
that can write in space. Cosmonauts just use a pencil.

1187
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,560
Yeah, like it's like, oh, they lapped us so easily on this one.

1188
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,560
It's like, no, you don't build a water ride.

1189
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,720
You you build the magic trick.

1190
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,360
Yeah, it works so good.

1191
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,520
I mean, even if you're I'm sure you're watching the ride through videos

1192
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,400
and it looks good, like you just forget.

1193
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,480
But even you're in the middle thing,

1194
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,440
because also like what you're not getting from a ride through videos,

1195
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,920
the sound is amazing.

1196
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,280
Like the bubbles like all surround you.

1197
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,080
Everybody has different ports to look out of.

1198
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,480
And unlike what's that?

1199
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,120
I guess it's Nemo and friends now, the one in the that used to be

1200
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,960
the the orange submarines that are in next to Matterhorn.

1201
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,880
What's that? Yeah.

1202
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,680
Finding what is the official name?

1203
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,960
I just always call it the Finding Nemo subs.

1204
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,080
Oh, yeah. I don't know what the official name is.

1205
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,320
It used to be called. Why don't I? Why can't I pull that?

1206
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,720
Oh, it's I think it's the submarine.

1207
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,120
The original name was Submarine Voyage.

1208
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:26,480
So now I think the new name is Submarine Voyage with Nemo and friends.

1209
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,560
Well, the but those that ride, I went there maybe five or six years ago.

1210
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,000
I remember I had good memories of it.

1211
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,160
But I went one time at Disneyland trip when I was a kid.

1212
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:39,400
And I remember the scary dragon thing, the underwater crazy eyes.

1213
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,640
The sea serpent is like like scared me.

1214
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,800
But it like sticks in my craw.

1215
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,320
But I loved it.

1216
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,480
So I'm like, oh, I'm going to go like it was like twenty eighteen.

1217
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,680
I'm going to go on the right.

1218
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,640
And I am a big fella.

1219
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,960
But I had a crunch and crunched down and I couldn't even see out the port.

1220
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,200
And I was claustrophobic.

1221
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,840
It was a horrible experience.

1222
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,800
I yeah, James Claude claustrophobic.

1223
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,200
And I'm just not navigating that mobility wise these days.

1224
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,160
So I'm like, but the twenty thousand leagues at Disney see.

1225
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,320
Yes. It's like a little claustrophobic, a little tiny.

1226
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,640
But you just walk in.

1227
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,360
It's just a normal little contraption.

1228
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,160
You walk in.

1229
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,040
Yeah. It's a little box and it feels great because there's a lot of room between the seats

1230
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,840
because I think every seat, there's a seat on the left on the port and the starboard side.

1231
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,720
Yeah. Pardon me.

1232
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,040
And then there's aft and rear.

1233
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:31,720
I only know these from crossword puzzles, not from being salty at all.

1234
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,840
Oh, OK.

1235
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:37,680
But but but but you could fit two people on a seat per window.

1236
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,160
So it's only six people in this big box and it feels spacious.

1237
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,560
It's tall enough when you're sitting down.

1238
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:46,760
It's like it's and the windows are huge because they're not worried about actual water coming in.

1239
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,720
So it is a comfortable ride.

1240
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,920
It's sweet. And you get to toggle the searchlights.

1241
00:49:52,920 --> 00:50:00,800
Yes. Spotlight, which to me, I'm like, there's all this stuff about interaction and gamification.

1242
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,520
And I'm like, kind of want to just do that spotlight.

1243
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,760
Yeah. Well, I mean, that's here's the big trick on it, too, is because it is like talk about dark.

1244
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,120
It is actually a dark ride.

1245
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,480
Yes. You don't see everything that's in that set.

1246
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,560
And you can really kind of only see what your flashlight's hitting.

1247
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:21,160
And so you are shining that flashlight around, trying to find the stuff that you want to see,

1248
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,080
because once you take it off the octopus, like you can hardly see the octopus.

1249
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,080
And that creates like a sense of like underwater adventure.

1250
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,480
It's fun. It's it's and it's just a light.

1251
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:36,720
Yes. And it's just so much like you can do the limitations any time you go on the actual subs

1252
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,000
in Disneyland or Disney when it was open at Disney World.

1253
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:45,200
Like you can't see very much on those because like they like just just a tiny little window.

1254
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,600
Like this is like the best of both worlds to make you feel like, oh, my gosh, we're in this little

1255
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,240
vehicle that is like really doing something.

1256
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:56,000
But the window is big enough and you can actually see cool stuff.

1257
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:00,520
And you get a sense of the scope and scale because that's what you don't get on like Nemo.

1258
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:05,200
It's like you look looking even though you're looking into like show scenes and water.

1259
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:09,080
Yeah. Everything looks like you're looking at a tiny little like elf village or something,

1260
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,760
a little like Keebler elf village.

1261
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,640
Everything feels so small to me on that on the Nemo subs.

1262
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:21,400
Yeah. This is just the scope and scale of it is so impressive and is what they were going for when

1263
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,840
they built those old subs.

1264
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:26,840
Yeah. And like I said, it's just it's just it's just one simple trick.

1265
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:30,000
Just bubbles in the window and the sound effects.

1266
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,640
And you're and you're because I'm a big underwater head.

1267
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,920
I love being under. Yes.

1268
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,320
I found that out about myself.

1269
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:41,680
If I if I if there's like a thing and I can scuba dive, I will scuba or I will like snorkel.

1270
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,440
I will snorkel for like three hours without putting taking my butt out of the water.

1271
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,040
Right. See, I just like being up high.

1272
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:53,720
So suspended rides where the arm is above you and there's stuff underneath you immediately

1273
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,960
appealing to me. You could go on this ride.

1274
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,520
I get my water fix. You get your suspension fix.

1275
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,280
Yeah. It's a good ride.

1276
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,200
It's underrated. It's a good ride.

1277
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,280
It's underrated. I do think it's a dizzy sea is like so many top ticket items that this

1278
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,040
thing is lost in shuffle and big sets.

1279
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:15,520
A lot of creatures, some nasty little freaks that help you out at the end.

1280
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,560
They're nice. They're not.

1281
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,480
They're not freaks. They're not bad.

1282
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,880
No, I don't know what the freaks are from.

1283
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:21,960
I'm trying to figure that out.

1284
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,280
I think they're original.

1285
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,720
I think they're I think it's supposed to be Atlantis.

1286
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,840
Yes, it's supposed to be Atlantis.

1287
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,480
They're little freaks from Atlantis.

1288
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:33,840
Yeah, Atlantis freaks will like kind of like undersea alien type character.

1289
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:38,520
They're not aliens, but yeah, they're like magical little sprites or something like kind of.

1290
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,480
And they save you as Nemo and crew are debating.

1291
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,240
Like, have we tried all the tricks?

1292
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:47,120
Are we letting this volunteer crew eat shit or are we letting them die?

1293
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:51,600
I went back and kind of zoomed through our original 20,000 Leagues episode and Scott had not

1294
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,400
been on the ride yet, but he watched a video.

1295
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:59,280
I insisted on not watching it and I like plugged my ears when people were giving details.

1296
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:03,080
Yeah, but he said that it reminded him of ET and yeah, it does.

1297
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:09,680
Like some of the like colors and the the sets and or whatever the show scenes like I can see that.

1298
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,600
And then there's little aliens kind of at the end.

1299
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,520
Well, this this is where I'm going to be because I just don't I didn't see those little freaks

1300
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,440
during the Disney movie rewatch.

1301
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,720
I was like I was kind of expecting.

1302
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,240
Yeah, I don't think they're in the movie.

1303
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,360
No, he talks about going to Atlantis and he talks about like he's got like a magical

1304
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,320
like Iron Man, Ark Hart or whatever.

1305
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,360
Yeah, that runs the ship.

1306
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,920
It's like a magic MacGuffin of an engine.

1307
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,080
But he does he doesn't he doesn't we don't see the little freaks in the movie,

1308
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,200
which have been fun to see them.

1309
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,120
Yeah, I'm sure they'd have been like Disney animated and been real cool.

1310
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,920
But but these I this this is where I'm going to be tough but fair on 20,000 Leagues.

1311
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,800
I think that once you get the giant squid,

1312
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:52,240
well, it is the high point of that ride and you don't need the little freak section.

1313
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,480
Here's but that's I think that's a dark ride thing.

1314
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,160
The pacing on dark rides are a little funny.

1315
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,600
Like the big thing is always in the middle and then there's like a slow ramp out.

1316
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,840
Yeah, I felt this.

1317
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,040
Sorry. What are you saying?

1318
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,320
Oh, I was just going to say for if anyone wants to once to watch video,

1319
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:15,040
but follow the narration, the channel LMG Vids has a subtitled video.

1320
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,960
Yeah, with the English translation of what Nemo and crew is saying.

1321
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,320
Yeah, so so you go through all these different show scenes

1322
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,280
and then the climax action wise is the big squid.

1323
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,600
Yeah, and I felt the same way the first time we went on it.

1324
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,680
I felt like, OK, here it is.

1325
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,280
And you're going to end with a big like, oh, my God, we're about to get fucked up.

1326
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,400
Yeah, because the ride doesn't fuck you up.

1327
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,560
No, it keeps you very gentle.

1328
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:44,400
And it's because I was wondering if like we're going to get hit with a tentacle or something.

1329
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,640
And like we don't really shake us.

1330
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,480
I don't even think you have seatbelts on the ride.

1331
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,640
No, these little like leather booth kind of things are like little chairs,

1332
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,160
like a bench, I guess, which is nice and casual.

1333
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,240
A blush bench. It's soft. It's comfortable.

1334
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,800
It's a plush soft bench. Sounds pretty good.

1335
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,520
Huh? Yeah.

1336
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,160
So I but I was like, OK, here we go.

1337
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,640
We're going to get a little we're going to get a big jolt or something.

1338
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,480
And it's not it's nothing crazy at all.

1339
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:16,880
And then it ends with these little magic Atlantis freaks.

1340
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,360
And it sounded like I was about to choke up from tears.

1341
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,600
And that's not why my voice said that.

1342
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,480
It was Sinbad I was going to choke up and not these little freaks.

1343
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:29,600
When you see that giant and he's playing the little violin, it's so good.

1344
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,960
It is. Yeah, it is really good.

1345
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,800
That giant is so good.

1346
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,040
I would tear up at the giant almost every ride.

1347
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,480
Yes. After that first ride, we did it like three more times.

1348
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,920
And the giant room is a part of the song that happens on the Sinbad ride

1349
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,000
where I start to tear like I would tear up again.

1350
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,560
Yeah. Yeah.

1351
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,600
But so the end of the 20,000 leagues, there's just this like you're kind of

1352
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:55,280
all of a sudden like spotting a couple of these little Atlantis aliens freaks.

1353
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,960
And they're like in the first you see them in the distance and they're poking out.

1354
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,040
And then they get closer and closer and then they save you.

1355
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,280
Yes. And at first, I agreed.

1356
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,480
I felt like, well, that was it.

1357
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,960
We need to end with a big drop.

1358
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,080
We need to end with something.

1359
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,640
The place blows up and we like shoot out something.

1360
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,400
We shoot out a whale's blowhole from blue sky off the top of my head.

1361
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,480
Sure. We got to do something like that.

1362
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,560
But then the second time and then was like watching it on YouTube.

1363
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,640
I really like that.

1364
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,560
It's different that it ends on kind of a sweet, nice thing.

1365
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:32,080
Yeah, because it does defy the expectations of a regular ride.

1366
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,120
And I've said this before on the show.

1367
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:36,880
I like moments of empathy, intimacy.

1368
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:42,160
I like little beats in rides that are not just all action.

1369
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,080
I could see three PO says we've just joined the rebel alliance

1370
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,800
in the middle of star tours because it feels totally different.

1371
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,520
So I think I've come in, especially in my older age,

1372
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:55,600
I've come to appreciate a ride ending this way.

1373
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:00,000
That is not just a conventional conventional like fireworks display.

1374
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,440
I like that.

1375
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,640
Like, who are these characters?

1376
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,080
Oh my God, are they friend or foe?

1377
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,080
Ah, they are friend.

1378
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,040
They're saving us.

1379
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,240
They've say like there's an I feel like there's a nice thing about it now.

1380
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:15,120
And I think that anyone who goes on it now can think about it.

1381
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,600
We don't need to end in a big explosion.

1382
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,280
A ride can defy your expectations.

1383
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,320
Yeah, I like rides have like an epilogue because I think about the

1384
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,600
I think like the even like the Little Mermaid Dark Ride or whatever has the

1385
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,280
you have the Ursula's there.

1386
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,080
That's a whole.

1387
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,480
And then I know this whole thing, but then it's like it's a lot.

1388
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,800
The ending is like Ursula's in the middle, like the only scary part.

1389
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,840
And then it's all soft.

1390
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,040
It's like the kiss the girl song.

1391
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,920
And then it's like she's in the distance.

1392
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,120
She's dying in the distance.

1393
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:43,760
Ursula is.

1394
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,480
Yes, that's right.

1395
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,200
In like shadow.

1396
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,960
The shadow in the distance is like she's been stabbed in the chest.

1397
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:54,400
Very much a and the kids were rescued by, oh, let's say Mo.

1398
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:57,440
Yes.

1399
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:04,720
And so that that one almost feels like and this is a discussion for a future episode of

1400
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:11,040
that almost feels like the modern Walt Disney Company not wanting to scare people anymore.

1401
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,160
Yeah.

1402
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,200
And that's again, we're going to have there'll be a future episode

1403
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,800
where we talk more about that because I do think like.

1404
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,400
About scares in particular.

1405
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,200
Scares or just sort of more intense things, because I think that in the recent years

1406
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:30,560
they've wanted to reduce stuff that will make kids go a little like.

1407
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,680
And I so like I think that's what happened with the Ursula thing.

1408
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,160
Yeah.

1409
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,280
I think because I mean, you're not going to have her, I guess, get stabbed,

1410
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,880
but there should be like a climax if you're trying to just retell the story,

1411
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,080
which is what that ride is.

1412
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,520
Yeah, yeah, you could have you could just have her threatening the the.

1413
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:45,840
Sure.

1414
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,600
The boat and then like a boat cuts her off.

1415
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,120
Just know you don't even see what happens.

1416
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,760
But it's just like, you know, at least her threatening the boat.

1417
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,080
But that is a scary scene in the movie.

1418
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:54,640
Yes.

1419
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,360
Which is cool.

1420
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,600
Like it would be a cool way like there would be a cool way to recreate it on the ride somehow.

1421
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,880
I think, you know, because I was talking about the sea serpent in that thing.

1422
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,880
That's like for my childhood memories of going to Disneyland, I was probably like

1423
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,400
eight or nine, you know, from Alaska.

1424
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,920
So a trip to Disneyland was like this is like the one time we're going to do it, kids.

1425
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,880
Like it wasn't like it wasn't like I know you guys were from

1426
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,080
places you could drive to Disneyland, so you guys could do it every couple of years or.

1427
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,200
Or a quick flight.

1428
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:19,840
Oh, yeah.

1429
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,280
But like Alaska is like it's no it was no small thing for us to get down there.

1430
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:28,640
So but that's literally one of the few things I remember is that sea serpent and his crazy eyes

1431
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,920
and that scared me.

1432
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:30,160
Yeah.

1433
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,840
But that's the thing I remember.

1434
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,560
So you do need I think you need scary things on these rides.

1435
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:39,920
And then that sea serpent was sold at a dirty abandoned sports authority in Sherman Oaks.

1436
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,840
And I saw it and like my hackles went up.

1437
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,800
I didn't have like a little like I had a physical reaction when I saw the thing.

1438
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,640
And I was like, it's not so scary.

1439
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,320
But then I imagined its eyes twirling.

1440
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:54,240
I was like, yeah, but I wish they would almost like I know it's kind of the end of the ride

1441
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,920
is a surprise that you see these little creatures, but I also wish they would like

1442
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,520
market them a little more like I want to see them out there a little.

1443
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,440
Have them hidden in the land.

1444
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,320
Because you do get some of the Tokyo Disney specific characters in plush and toys.

1445
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,240
And maybe I maybe I just haven't seen it.

1446
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:15,120
If somebody knows if they do make these little Atlantis freaks, let me know in a toy.

1447
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:18,320
Well, the fact that we're calling them freaks is like they should have a name.

1448
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,640
They should be a little more branded than just letting us.

1449
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,840
Yeah, I guess that's true.

1450
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,400
That's like a vacuum of power that they're giving us.

1451
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,160
Well, not knowing if they're friend or foe is like Nemo himself.

1452
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:33,280
I feel like a lot of those stories, be it 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea or

1453
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:37,280
Leave Extraordinary Gentlemen, no one knows where they stand with Nemo.

1454
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,240
This is what I want to get into.

1455
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,840
I want to get into this Nemo character.

1456
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:46,160
I was watching this movie and I'm saying to myself, and this is why like 20,000 Leagues

1457
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:52,320
isn't as big as like Wizard of Oz or like these big, big stories that people really like.

1458
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:55,840
Or even something that's old enough to say now like Indiana Jones.

1459
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,360
We all understand Indiana Jones.

1460
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:04,160
He's like this dopey but heroic guy who's in over his head, but he somehow makes it

1461
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,840
through through his grit and his courage and maybe being a little stupid.

1462
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:12,560
But something about this character is very compelling and he will be compelling for

1463
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:13,360
a hundred years.

1464
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,160
Nemo, I don't get.

1465
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,440
I was watching the James Mason one and the whole thing with Nemo,

1466
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,040
it has the trappings of a good character.

1467
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,800
He's this outsider.

1468
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,880
He goes to the sea to have his own rules.

1469
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,280
And he's going to do things his way.

1470
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:35,520
He's kind of like an anti-capitalist, anti-colonist because he came from like,

1471
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,200
as a mining slave was his like origin story.

1472
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,360
He was like a slave in a mine and they killed his wife and kid and he escaped and then got

1473
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:48,080
this big ship and now he's going to like take down all these British ships and it's like,

1474
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:48,880
this is all cool.

1475
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:55,600
But there's not been a 20,000 Leagues that's made gangbusters since the 54 one.

1476
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,560
Yeah. I mean, I feel like the main things I know about Nemo,

1477
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:06,320
mostly from Alan Moore in the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen comics,

1478
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,960
has an autolist hates the British.

1479
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:16,560
Like, and that I think obviously gets likely stripped away in the way a lot of those Disney

1480
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:23,840
live action movies, certainly the old ones, like when they would have to simplify it for like,

1481
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,000
you know, a family audience, an American audience,

1482
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,480
like some of the weird stuff for the more meaner stuff gets taken out.

1483
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:38,560
Are you, are you saying though that Captain Nemo is so hard to read, it's hard to like,

1484
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,400
get like dig into him in a way.

1485
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,960
It's hard to either root for him.

1486
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,520
It's hard to like, it's hard to know what to feel.

1487
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,440
Yeah. He's like, is he a baby face or is he heel?

1488
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,000
Right. Wrestling terminology.

1489
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:50,560
Yes.

1490
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,600
You want to know.

1491
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,720
I think he's a tweener.

1492
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:53,600
He's your classic tweener.

1493
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,800
Classic tweener.

1494
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:55,280
Yeah.

1495
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:59,280
Because like in the second League of Extraordinary Gentlemen book,

1496
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:05,840
when they fight the aliens from the War of the Worlds,

1497
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:12,400
Nemo at the end gets so pissed because they kill the aliens using germ warfare.

1498
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,280
And Nemo's like, what do you mean you have this?

1499
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,280
I'm not, I've got to be a part of this.

1500
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,040
And he like sails away.

1501
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:19,440
Yeah.

1502
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,400
And then I think later books his daughter kind of takes over.

1503
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,360
Yeah. He's like a good pirate.

1504
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:29,680
Like again, in the 18th century, 19th century, I'm really bad at that.

1505
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,760
But it's like, I never, when you say centuries, I never get the numbers right.

1506
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,200
I always jump back into one.

1507
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,760
I'm not going to get into my own insecurities about saying what century it is.

1508
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,680
But yeah, like I want to, like I think Nemo has a lot.

1509
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,120
I'm just surprised there hasn't been,

1510
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:46,240
I guess League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is the most common recent one.

1511
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,120
But even that was, the 90s did Alan Moore write that?

1512
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:55,360
I think early 2000s, that kind of bad Sean Connery's retirement movie.

1513
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,560
The movie I have not seen.

1514
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:02,080
With Tom Sawyer is like a secret agent.

1515
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:02,720
Yeah.

1516
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,160
Like there are some, they take some big swings on like,

1517
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:10,240
ah, Dorian Gray uses his anti-aging powers.

1518
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:15,600
And I was like, no, I think this is one where he was right to turn down the rights money

1519
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,280
or give it to Kevin O'Neal.

1520
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,840
Then there's the, the, the, the safari guy, Alan.

1521
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,840
Alan Quartermaine.

1522
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:22,400
Quartermaine.

1523
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,840
Yeah. We love Alan Quartermaine.

1524
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,400
There was a David Fincher attempt, right?

1525
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,960
At 20,000 leagues, maybe for Disney a couple of years ago, 10 years ago, 15 years ago.

1526
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:31,920
And then it fell apart.

1527
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,480
Maybe Brad Pitt talking about being in it.

1528
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,480
I don't know who he was, but who he was going to be.

1529
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,600
I mean, I think he was going to be the guy playing the turtle,

1530
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,720
the turtle guitar kissing a seal.

1531
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,480
That'd be a great role for Brad Pitt.

1532
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,320
David Fincher would have wanted to use a real seal.

1533
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,800
And they would have had to do 200 takes.

1534
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:49,360
So good.

1535
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:49,760
Oh, man.

1536
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:50,400
That's how he does it.

1537
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,560
That he would have gone through so many seals.

1538
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,120
That right.

1539
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:53,680
That's true.

1540
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:56,800
Well, and he had to keep this, put the seal in its place.

1541
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:00,000
He would, when they switched to digital, he'd be screaming out,

1542
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,920
delete those last 10 takes.

1543
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,840
It's a power play.

1544
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:04,400
Yeah, of course.

1545
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,400
So I don't know.

1546
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,520
Maybe somebody will make Nemo popular one day.

1547
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,800
Because I would, all this just to come around to say is like,

1548
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,840
boy, would this ride do great in Disneyland.

1549
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,360
Oh, well, sure.

1550
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:21,520
Or even, like, how come this is not cross state side?

1551
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,760
Other than Nemo's not that popular.

1552
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:24,720
Nemo's not that popular.

1553
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:29,680
I do wonder if, because like, the ride system is not,

1554
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,640
I don't think, quite the same.

1555
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:35,760
There was an idea to do Little Mermaid with something

1556
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,200
that was kind of hanging from the ceiling

1557
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,720
to make you feel like you were underwater.

1558
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,880
And that they went with the thing that is the thing now,

1559
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,760
clamshell on the ground, like Haunted Mansion, basically.

1560
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,720
When he said it like that, it's so unromantic.

1561
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:49,200
Yeah.

1562
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,400
Well, what else is it?

1563
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,680
It's a clam shell on the ground.

1564
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:52,560
It's an omnimover.

1565
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:55,200
I guess omnimover sounds more romantic.

1566
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,320
But, you know, you can watch the ride through

1567
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,800
of the hypothetical cool version online.

1568
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,360
It was on a DVD like 20 years ago or something,

1569
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:06,640
but it's online and it would kind of bob you through the ride.

1570
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,600
And that's Tony Baxter's big thing is he was like,

1571
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,680
that would have been better because that's actually

1572
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,800
the transformative experience of going under the water.

1573
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:15,280
Right.

1574
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:19,440
That's actually giving you some extra feeling of specialness.

1575
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,640
Like bobbing around.

1576
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:21,280
Bobbing around.

1577
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,240
You don't want to bob around.

1578
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,000
But it's not quite the same thing here.

1579
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,760
But I am surprised that they haven't used it

1580
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,720
for something else.

1581
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:32,720
I'm surprised they haven't figured out another ride,

1582
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:36,240
stateside, to do something like this.

1583
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,480
Underwater would be, I guess, helpful.

1584
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,720
But you could do like a space ride or something.

1585
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:41,920
You could do space.

1586
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,000
It'd be an interesting way to do like,

1587
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,640
I'm trying to think of like going through

1588
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:47,680
like an abandoned space station,

1589
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,760
but that's like too horror themed or something.

1590
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,400
Well, yeah.

1591
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,800
I mean, unless it's like they're cute aliens,

1592
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,240
unless it's like Stitch is up there.

1593
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,440
Or Mars Nines Moms is up there.

1594
01:06:58,960 --> 01:06:59,760
There's not enough good.

1595
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,560
I'm trying to think of another undersea property.

1596
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,000
Treasure Planet is up there.

1597
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,440
Oh, we could do Treasure Planet.

1598
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,520
Atlantis the Lost Empire.

1599
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,020
Yeah.

1600
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,000
Yeah.

1601
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:09,960
Yeah.

1602
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:12,180
I also like, I think it's fine to just do like,

1603
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:14,580
as far as kids know, 20,000 Leagues on the Sea

1604
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:15,540
is just like Thunder Mountain.

1605
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:17,060
Thunder Mountain, I mean, I know.

1606
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:17,700
Well, that's another long-

1607
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,300
I know they're not making anything without IP.

1608
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,580
Yeah, that's a long thing, yeah.

1609
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,860
But yes, they're not going to do like a new like space time.

1610
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:27,220
You could go to the Gungan Kingdom.

1611
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:27,860
Yes, of course.

1612
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:28,980
With Jar Jar Binks.

1613
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:30,420
Yes, I would love to do that.

1614
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:31,460
Bosnaz, yeah.

1615
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:32,420
So yeah, I guess, I mean,

1616
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:34,900
I guess there hasn't been an obvious choice

1617
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:38,340
to use this ride system or technology.

1618
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:40,900
But yeah, it's so cool.

1619
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,860
And I don't know, there's really no, I don't know.

1620
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:45,540
There's no Pixar, like, because Pixar's,

1621
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:47,780
the new stuff is like what's going to happen.

1622
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,020
Like Coco is going to be a boat ride

1623
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:51,300
in California Adventure.

1624
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,380
I mean, that's the obvious thing is you've got to

1625
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:56,740
just replace the submarine Nemo thing with this.

1626
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,740
Well, yeah, but that's not, probably not a room.

1627
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:01,540
Yeah, but it's got to be a big showroom, this thing.

1628
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:02,500
Well, I don't know.

1629
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:03,060
It's-

1630
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:04,100
I think it's somewhat big.

1631
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:04,740
I don't know.

1632
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:06,340
Look, do you want me to break out the Google Maps?

1633
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:06,820
Because I will.

1634
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:08,100
Oh, boy.

1635
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,220
If you overhead Google Maps.

1636
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:10,820
But it might be still hard because it's so,

1637
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:13,700
the mysterious island is so big,

1638
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:15,780
I might not be able to know where the actual showroom is.

1639
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:16,900
And it's like halfway underground,

1640
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:17,700
like it's under the side of the volcano.

1641
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:17,860
You know what?

1642
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:18,820
Here, talk amongst yourselves.

1643
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:19,940
I'm going to look at the Google Maps.

1644
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:22,100
Let me ask you this.

1645
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:25,380
You're a seasoned vet of parks.

1646
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:27,460
How well do you know geography of the park?

1647
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:29,460
Like in terms of, when I, I'll say this,

1648
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:32,180
in my experience, when I go to Disneyland or any Disney,

1649
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:36,580
I don't know where I am or what the layout is in my head.

1650
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,020
Like, I can't understand.

1651
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:39,620
Like, I just walk and I know that,

1652
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:42,100
like, oh, if we're at Haunted Mansion,

1653
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:43,620
that means we're near Pirates.

1654
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:44,820
That means we're near Big Thunder.

1655
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:47,460
Like, I can kind of do the, the point to point,

1656
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:48,420
but I couldn't like,

1657
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:51,220
if you asked me to draw a map of Disneyland right now,

1658
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:52,420
it would be so crazy.

1659
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:54,100
Jason, here's him, Jason.

1660
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:57,060
I think I know more than most,

1661
01:08:57,060 --> 01:09:01,620
but also I tried to not ruin the magic for myself.

1662
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:04,420
Like, I still, like when you're on the parking lot tram

1663
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:05,540
and you're, you're going,

1664
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:06,900
and someone goes that show,

1665
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,420
that's the Haunted Mansion show building.

1666
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:09,860
I went, no, it's not.

1667
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,860
No, that's a mansion in New Orleans.

1668
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:16,020
Quite like I, I don't, I don't know.

1669
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:18,580
I, you know, I think I can tell more

1670
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:20,980
when they're doing big projects.

1671
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:23,860
And you can see through clearings,

1672
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:26,180
you can see through construction sites.

1673
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:31,300
So I think I can navigate the park pretty well in my sleep.

1674
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,340
Think I could find it.

1675
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:35,300
Cause I mean, it, I mean, it's very famously the hub.

1676
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:38,820
And then the left is the, the frontier land.

1677
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:40,580
And then adventure land.

1678
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:42,740
And then right is tomorrow land.

1679
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:44,900
Yeah. I, so I get that sense of it,

1680
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:47,140
but once I'm there, like I, I don't know where the,

1681
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:48,660
I mean, that's part of their job, I guess.

1682
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:50,260
I don't know what the show buildings look like.

1683
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:52,340
I don't know how, like how far it extends out,

1684
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:53,540
like the geography of it.

1685
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:54,820
Like just an overhead map.

1686
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:56,020
But like, if I looked at this Google map

1687
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:56,660
that you're pulling up.

1688
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:02,020
He has been very into Google maps and satellite maps lately.

1689
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:04,980
Because it is fun to like, if you,

1690
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:07,220
if you block out a chunk of like, oh,

1691
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:11,220
this new project takes up X number of acres.

1692
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:13,940
That's the number of acres they have to play with.

1693
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:14,100
Yeah.

1694
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:15,300
When they say they're going to do a new ride

1695
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,060
and they don't tell you where,

1696
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:18,740
it's fun to look around the map

1697
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:20,900
and see where there's space available.

1698
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:21,220
Yeah.

1699
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:22,900
And plug in, you go, okay, this ride seems like

1700
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:24,900
it's going to be this big, this new land.

1701
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,420
Like, whereas the big thing right now

1702
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:28,820
is where Avatar is going to go in California Adventure.

1703
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:30,740
And people are saying,

1704
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:32,500
I wasn't believing them for a while

1705
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,260
that it was going to replace Hollywood Land

1706
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:35,300
in California Adventure.

1707
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:35,860
Yeah.

1708
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:37,540
And then I started looking at the map and I go,

1709
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:40,100
man, if they're really just going to use what they've got,

1710
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:42,100
it's got to go in Hollywood Land.

1711
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:43,220
It's where there's space.

1712
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:44,500
It's where there's the most space.

1713
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:44,820
Yeah.

1714
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:47,220
And you can cut into the esplanade.

1715
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:48,260
You can trim some of that.

1716
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:49,780
I've heard rumors all their name.

1717
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:50,420
You know what I'm thinking about?

1718
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,020
I've heard some rumors, I don't even want to,

1719
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:54,180
I don't even want to give any oxygen to them

1720
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:55,380
that maybe that won't happen.

1721
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:55,860
Who knows?

1722
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:57,140
We'll see.

1723
01:10:57,140 --> 01:10:58,820
But it's fun to expect.

1724
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:02,820
I can't tell what's a show building on an overhead

1725
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:05,140
from this mysterious island and volcano.

1726
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:07,700
Because is this in Journey to the Center of the Earth

1727
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:10,420
share, like, show billing?

1728
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:11,620
Like, is it?

1729
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:14,900
I don't know because I don't know if they go both,

1730
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:18,820
go down at the same time like the Avatar situation in Florida.

1731
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:21,380
Yeah, when you, when you are in the,

1732
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:23,540
was it Volcano Lagoon?

1733
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:25,140
Volcanic, Volcania Lagoon?

1734
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:27,220
Volcania, Volcania Lagoon.

1735
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:28,820
Volcania, Volcania Lagoon.

1736
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:30,500
Volcania Lagoon.

1737
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,060
You can see a piece of the Journey to the Center of the Earth

1738
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:35,700
car going through like a break in it.

1739
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:36,580
So you see a little bit of it.

1740
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:37,620
It's like test track.

1741
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:39,220
Yeah, they're very close in that way.

1742
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:42,740
But it is like, Nemo is like under the volcano.

1743
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:45,220
So you can't really tell what the, because it's all,

1744
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:45,860
it's got to be all underground.

1745
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:50,420
I want to unplug, but it's like, that's 20,000 leaks here.

1746
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:52,820
And that's Journey over here.

1747
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:55,380
So I'm guessing that Journey show building is kind of

1748
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:57,700
under the actual peak of the volcano.

1749
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:58,020
Yeah.

1750
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:59,620
That's more where that ride is.

1751
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,540
And then it goes all the way around here.

1752
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:04,100
And then 20,000 leaks is like this, I guess.

1753
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:05,780
Because it's completely hidden.

1754
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:11,700
It's interesting because Tokyo Disney Sea is like on Tokyo Bay.

1755
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:12,580
It's on the bay.

1756
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:14,580
And they do have earthquakes in Japan.

1757
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,140
They sure do.

1758
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:18,500
So like, I don't, I don't know that I would build

1759
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:20,580
things on top of each other.

1760
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:24,340
I don't know that I would put my magical stuff like stacked up.

1761
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,420
I think there's something, and this is me.

1762
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:27,860
I am not a geologist.

1763
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:31,860
But I do think there's certain like bays

1764
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:33,940
that are very protected from earthquakes.

1765
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:39,540
In terms of, in terms of like the wave, the snobbing efforts,

1766
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:41,620
like the wave would go past the bay

1767
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:43,300
and then like around the corner kind of.

1768
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:45,540
If it's like built out like a big island.

1769
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:47,620
I think Tokyo Bay is a very protected bay.

1770
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:50,900
Tomorrow, Tokyo paper, it's going to say,

1771
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:52,820
Matt Mazzani says Tokyo Bay is safe.

1772
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:53,220
Yeah.

1773
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:54,420
No threat at all.

1774
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:56,660
Dig, baby, dig.

1775
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:59,780
I'm going to be stuck on that water topi ride

1776
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:01,540
and a little auto thing just flying around.

1777
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:03,220
Then all of a sudden the waves are going to just take me

1778
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:05,620
and I would be just like floating through Tokyo on the water topi.

1779
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:12,100
American geologist, Matt Mazzani on Podcast Arrived says SCZ.

1780
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:13,860
As I was saying that, I realized like,

1781
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:18,580
wait, I follow a bunch of like food YouTube channels

1782
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:21,380
based in Japan and they're always like,

1783
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:23,140
we went to this quiet little cafe.

1784
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:26,260
You went to the ninth floor of a common office building

1785
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:29,220
that opened directly into a cafe.

1786
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:31,540
And I was like, oh, okay, I guess there is a culture

1787
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:34,500
of building things on top of each other in Japan.

1788
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:37,380
I don't think they're on top of each other.

1789
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:39,620
Maybe just that last stretch is to some degree.

1790
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:41,380
But once you think about the bay, I was saying,

1791
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:42,340
oh, it's probably underground,

1792
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:44,340
but how could you make something underground if you're on a bay?

1793
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:46,260
You're going to get into the ocean.

1794
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:48,500
Then Nemo becomes real and that's no fun.

1795
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,300
That's a good question.

1796
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,180
Maybe, I mean, this place is so special and magical.

1797
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:53,700
Maybe there is some like trickery.

1798
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:56,660
I'm not even like, yeah, they built on top of it or.

1799
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:59,380
Yeah, or like the first part of the car ride

1800
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:01,060
is like very far out or something like that.

1801
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:04,100
It's, I mean, I think ultimately like think about Nemo is like,

1802
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:07,300
I think the biggest piece about it is that it's

1803
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:11,620
in Disney Sea, it does give you a sense of adventure

1804
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:13,540
because you have to go down into the lagoon.

1805
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:17,300
And I remember being kind of a trek and it's all that is like part of the ride in a way

1806
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:20,260
you get your potato churro and you're walking down there.

1807
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:23,140
And then you then you go on this thing and the ride is great.

1808
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:25,780
Then you exit off into a totally different part of the park.

1809
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:29,460
It does feel like a bit of an adventure in a way that not a lot of Disney stuff

1810
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:31,540
like has that same thing.

1811
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:34,420
I think maybe Haunted Mansion to me feels a little interesting

1812
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:36,740
because you go to the New Orleans Square,

1813
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:40,580
you go in and you kind of come out a different way in a certain way.

1814
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:41,240
Right.

1815
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:46,420
The ride is part of your journey through the park, which is a cool thing.

1816
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:52,100
Yes, I think that it's not because Tower of Terror in Florida

1817
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:54,580
obviously has the cooler room.

1818
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:57,060
That's the fifth, fourth dimension room.

1819
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:57,860
Fifth dimension.

1820
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:59,220
Fifth dimension, whatever.

1821
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:02,260
When the elevator car lurches forward, some people always say,

1822
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:05,700
okay, well, the reason that tower is so good is because that extra room

1823
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:08,820
because that an elevator is doing something you've never seen it do before.

1824
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:10,500
There's a lot of truth to that.

1825
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:14,020
That's why the California Adventure Version, which didn't have that,

1826
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:17,060
is less successful, was less popular.

1827
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:24,180
But the placement of that ride in California, I feel like also really hurt it

1828
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:27,780
because when it was Tower of Terror, even though it's still a fun, good ride,

1829
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,300
there was just something about it kind of being in this sort of boring

1830
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:35,620
Hollywood land area, which we would just never go and do it.

1831
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:40,340
And in hindsight, I'm like, oh, even a B-plus Tower of Terror

1832
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:44,260
is worth going on more than I did go on it.

1833
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:47,940
But in Florida, it's at the end of this long street.

1834
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:49,460
It's set back.

1835
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:51,380
You kind of walk up to get to it.

1836
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:55,220
There is something that makes the tower there more special

1837
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:59,220
just because of the way you get to it, the way you have to walk up

1838
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,980
and the way it's presented in the park.

1839
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:06,660
And Guardians, I think I like it better than Tower.

1840
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:10,500
And it doesn't need that because that's not the vibe of it.

1841
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:14,100
Even though it would be cool if it was in a big, crazy Marvel city,

1842
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:17,140
which I guess if it's Avatar, that's not going to be the case

1843
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:19,940
because we always thought they were going to build out a fun Marvel,

1844
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:24,020
New York or California high-rise around it.

1845
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:26,900
You build the Baxter Building next to the Guardians Tower.

1846
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:30,340
That always made sense to me, but maybe it's Avatar, who knows, whatever.

1847
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:32,980
But I do think that what you're saying is right.

1848
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:36,900
And just the idea that you have to walk far to a volcano

1849
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:41,060
and then there's different levels to the volcano when you're inside.

1850
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:44,660
And then it's tucked in over here.

1851
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:48,580
And it gives your brain a sense of, oh, I went on this little journey

1852
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:51,860
and now I'm going to get to do this thing that's just a little secret.

1853
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:56,180
It's like a little secret I get to do, even though it's one of the rides in the park.

1854
01:16:57,140 --> 01:16:58,180
Very expensive.

1855
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:00,500
There's not good, clear signage.

1856
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:04,340
It's not like this way to the ride or anything.

1857
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:06,180
It does feel like you're kind of discovering things.

1858
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:07,540
There are ride signs.

1859
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:12,260
But I do feel like I wandered into it.

1860
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:16,900
I do feel like I was walking and I go, there's a line down there.

1861
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:17,460
Is that a thing?

1862
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:19,380
And then you kind of go down.

1863
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:20,500
Yeah, that is fun.

1864
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:24,420
I think Cars Land does a great job.

1865
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:29,460
I mean, the walking into Cars Land, walking past all the shops, down to Radiator Springs,

1866
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:30,260
like all that stuff.

1867
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:32,420
By the way, do people still like doing ride talk on this show?

1868
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:35,140
Should we be talking about a TV special from the 70s right now?

1869
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:38,180
If you want to get me started, we could.

1870
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:40,820
We like to talk about rides sometimes.

1871
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:43,220
Yeah, this deep ride theory.

1872
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:44,980
Is that what people are still into here anymore?

1873
01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:45,480
Sure.

1874
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:50,820
They like deep ride theory somewhat, but what they like more, credit card points.

1875
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:52,020
Credit card points are good.

1876
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:52,820
Hearing points.

1877
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:55,060
And I will say this on the show right now.

1878
01:17:55,060 --> 01:18:01,540
I would like to make the Club 3 not just about credit card points, but all points in general.

1879
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:04,580
App points, reward points.

1880
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:07,940
Scott is falling out of his chair, wherever he is right now.

1881
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:12,740
His brain is hurting so bad, it's pressing on his skull.

1882
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:15,540
As if Marmaduke himself jumped on his lap.

1883
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:18,340
He's got so much on his plate.

1884
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:19,860
He can't handle a big old dog.

1885
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:21,940
We told him not to get that big old dog.

1886
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:27,060
Jason also just declared off Mike, Marmaduke month on the main feed.

1887
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:31,540
Marmaduke May next year.

1888
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:35,140
Reviewing all the Marmadukes and also all the Clifford movies.

1889
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:37,380
Yeah, all the adaptations.

1890
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:38,260
I don't know why we're doing.

1891
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:40,260
Oh, is Clifford having something to do with Marmaduke?

1892
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:40,980
Yeah, he's big.

1893
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:44,020
But Clifford is a giant.

1894
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:46,340
Marmaduke's just a regular sized big dog.

1895
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:51,700
Well, you're distinguishing between massive and big dog.

1896
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:52,820
Yes, I am.

1897
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:53,540
So I'm just saying.

1898
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:56,660
So this is May is big dog month, not Marmaduke month.

1899
01:18:56,660 --> 01:18:57,700
Well, I don't know.

1900
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:58,660
You can have Balto.

1901
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:00,420
I'm just blue skying.

1902
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:02,100
Yeah, Balto's on the table.

1903
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:05,540
No bad answers when you're blue skying.

1904
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:08,340
Marmaduke month also includes other big dogs.

1905
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:09,460
Other large dogs.

1906
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:11,140
And that's May Tobin's big dog.

1907
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:12,180
Oh, he's so big.

1908
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:14,100
But he's a regular sized German Shepherd.

1909
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:15,380
I know, but he's a handful.

1910
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:16,740
Or German Shepherd.

1911
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:17,620
No, no, he's a what?

1912
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:18,580
He's a great date.

1913
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:19,460
Or no, he's a-

1914
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:20,660
No, that's Marmaduke.

1915
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:22,980
He's a St. Bernard.

1916
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:24,660
He's a St. Bernard.

1917
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:25,620
Come on, guys.

1918
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:27,380
Act like you know your dog breeds.

1919
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:31,380
Marmaduke, well, we'll have to brush up before Marmaduke May happens.

1920
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:35,380
We both, we're studying before the night before the test is.

1921
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:40,420
Listen, on a cosmic scale, Clifford is as big as Beethoven.

1922
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:41,300
You know what I mean?

1923
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:42,900
No, I don't know what you mean.

1924
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:46,900
If you think about in terms of planets and universes on a cosmic scale,

1925
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:48,180
they're very close in size.

1926
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:48,900
Yes, that's true.

1927
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:53,060
A lot of things on a cosmic scale are all sort of relative in size.

1928
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:53,560
Yeah.

1929
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:56,820
I mean, us and like a skyscraper in some ways-

1930
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:57,860
Very close in size.

1931
01:19:57,860 --> 01:19:58,340
Close in size.

1932
01:19:58,340 --> 01:19:59,220
On a cosmic scale.

1933
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:01,060
I mean, you're right.

1934
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:03,940
What you said is correct, so I can't really dispute any further.

1935
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:06,420
This is the type of talk you want on Marmaduke May.

1936
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:07,940
Marmaduke May.

1937
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:09,540
Opening up a fourth gate for this.

1938
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:11,780
It's a dog door.

1939
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:16,660
But the dogs are big, so it's really just a regular door.

1940
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:17,140
It's a gate.

1941
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:18,260
It's a gate for Clifford.

1942
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:19,140
The doggy door.

1943
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:23,220
Will Big Dog Month have a talk of Big Dog T-shirts?

1944
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:25,060
Oh, of course.

1945
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:25,700
I jumped the gun.

1946
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:26,660
I got so excited.

1947
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:30,740
I forgot I have to buy Jason a Big Johnson T-shirt for Christmas this year.

1948
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:36,500
Big Dog is not as bawdy as the Big Johnson brand of shirts.

1949
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:37,140
Yeah.

1950
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:38,420
Write them hard, leave them wet.

1951
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:40,580
That whole thing.

1952
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:44,180
I'll get Jason a pack of three of some of those.

1953
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:47,700
Man, I should keep a mouth shut.

1954
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:50,900
But we should plug ears.

1955
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:56,340
Jason, we should make some Big Jason T-shirts.

1956
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:59,700
Like some Big Jason, like some puns and stuff in there.

1957
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:04,020
And he's having some half moon fries or whatever the film is.

1958
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:04,980
Film strip fries.

1959
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:10,740
Well, it's film strip, half moon.

1960
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:11,620
I'm showing my butt.

1961
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:16,660
And I'll say something like strip him down, crunch him up.

1962
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:19,140
Show your butt.

1963
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:19,620
Big Jason T's.

1964
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:22,020
Big Jason T's is a good idea.

1965
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:24,740
You could have that one for free, fellas.

1966
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:27,460
We'll give you some shirts.

1967
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:32,260
You're going to be mad when Jason's in charge of the empire

1968
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:37,060
and he's making like $10 million a year from selling things on like the boardwalk.

1969
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:39,860
I'll be Winklevoss looking at all these Big Jason T's.

1970
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:44,260
There is going to be like a way too long Netflix documentary.

1971
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:47,060
Like the Von Tutsch doc.

1972
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:48,420
If you were going to create Big Jason T's,

1973
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:50,580
you would have created Big Jason T's is what you'd tell me.

1974
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:54,500
All based on Jason's stories.

1975
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:59,300
So it would be like, oh, my Airbnb bed is wet.

1976
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:02,420
And then he'd be like, he's like soaked.

1977
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:05,380
But it's really just about him finding a wet bed.

1978
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:09,700
It's not anything dirty, but it could be interpreted in some ways.

1979
01:22:10,660 --> 01:22:12,500
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1980
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:16,100
And it's certainly a call to anyone who wants to just draw these for free.

1981
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:20,100
Right now to make us some Big Jason shirts.

1982
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:22,180
Body or not?

1983
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:23,300
It doesn't have to be body.

1984
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:26,660
No, I like t-shirts a little body.

1985
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:27,060
All right.

1986
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:27,780
All right.

1987
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:30,420
Just at least one body one for one.

1988
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:30,660
Sure.

1989
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:30,980
Sure.

1990
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:31,540
Yeah.

1991
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:31,940
Okay.

1992
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:32,660
Well, there's a lot.

1993
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:37,700
Look, we just set out a pretty aggressive 2025 schedule here

1994
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:43,540
with Marmaduke May and a new line of t-shirts coming soon on Podcast The Ride.

1995
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:45,460
So it's very exciting.

1996
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:48,820
Universal is building a new theme bar.

1997
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:51,460
But we've got Big Jason tees over a year.

1998
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:53,140
Easier to get into.

1999
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:59,220
Marissa Strickland, Jason Sheridan and I did improv under the name Leisure Suit Jason once.

2000
01:22:59,220 --> 01:22:59,700
Oh.

2001
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:01,140
Leisure Suit Larry.

2002
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:03,140
So he's certainly been in this avenue.

2003
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:06,820
His character has certainly pivoted to being a little pervert.

2004
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:08,900
Yeah, I would say a little pervert.

2005
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,580
I'd say an impish lech.

2006
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:12,500
An impish lech, okay.

2007
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:14,740
Yeah, that's a little more class to him.

2008
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:18,340
You don't need to go full Myrtle Beach on the Big Jason shirt.

2009
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:18,820
That's right.

2010
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:27,220
He could be looking over his glasses at a lady in a bikini and she's putting too much

2011
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:30,020
sauce on the fries and it's like different.

2012
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:31,780
Then I'm like, oh, I have to run.

2013
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:36,580
I have the early dinner reservation at the fish house.

2014
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:39,940
I mean, these are all just, anything I'm about to pitch probably could appeal.

2015
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:42,740
You could pitch it to Archie for a Jughead story.

2016
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:48,340
There's like a lady in a bikini and she's putting mustard on her hot dog and she's

2017
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:53,140
squirting it so much that it's getting off the hot dog or something and Jason's diving

2018
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:57,140
with a little cup to try to save the ketchup from hitting the sand.

2019
01:23:57,140 --> 01:23:59,220
Oh, like a dipping sauce cup.

2020
01:23:59,220 --> 01:23:59,940
Yes.

2021
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:02,180
Because I've got a hot dog waiting for mustard.

2022
01:24:02,180 --> 01:24:04,180
Or you could have a different hot dog also catching.

2023
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:05,540
Catching with another hot dog.

2024
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:06,580
Right, that's pretty good.

2025
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:07,380
Oh, yeah.

2026
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:07,700
Okay.

2027
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:14,340
So you get a little bawdiness, but he's, Big Jason is not worried about the lady.

2028
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:17,220
He's more worried about the mustard or ketchup.

2029
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:19,380
Yeah, no ketchup left behind.

2030
01:24:19,940 --> 01:24:20,260
Right.

2031
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:20,900
Something like that.

2032
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:23,620
You know, like it's not body, but it's like makes you feel uneasy.

2033
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:27,140
By the way, the shirts are also very patriotic.

2034
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:32,020
These are, it's a lot of flags.

2035
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:32,980
There's a lot of salutes.

2036
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:37,300
Well, I, you know, people think it's patriotic, but it's really tricolor printing.

2037
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:41,460
It's a lot cheaper and a lot more affordable than full spectrum printing.

2038
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:43,380
Full spectrum colors.

2039
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:47,540
Is there, there has to be like a Big Johnson shirt that's extremely patriotic.

2040
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:50,740
That's like my boner as at half mast or something.

2041
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:56,580
Like there has to be some combination of these ideas or my boner is at full mast.

2042
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:57,300
There has to be like.

2043
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:59,220
Flying the flag today.

2044
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:04,660
And like some like patriotic pervert wears it on 4th of July.

2045
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:07,860
Yeah, there, there, there has to be some like Big Johnson shirt where he like.

2046
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:11,620
On the day that Osama bin Laden got shot or something like that amongst yourself.

2047
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:12,500
I mean, I'll take a look here.

2048
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:13,780
Yeah.

2049
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:15,940
There's a shirt that says love it or leave it.

2050
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:17,460
And he's pointing out his boner.

2051
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:18,020
That's right.

2052
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:18,340
Yeah.

2053
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:20,820
Like American flag board shorts.

2054
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:21,780
Yeah, that's great.

2055
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:22,580
That's great.

2056
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:27,860
There's a big John Cena announcing the Osama bin Laden off to a permanent end.

2057
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:31,140
There's a big Johnson shirt that just says, I stand with Texas.

2058
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:36,580
And he's got, he's just like the guy's on there with a lady in a bathing suit.

2059
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:40,500
I mean, I was misremembering big Johnson.

2060
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,740
Big Johnson is a little bit of a Jason share.

2061
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:44,420
Like a Jason Sheridan type.

2062
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:47,380
He is like, shh, we're going to get sued.

2063
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:48,980
No, when we start our own.

2064
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:50,260
Big Jason's are totally different.

2065
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:51,780
Big Jason's are totally different.

2066
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:55,060
I'm sure the owner of big Johnson is a reasonable man who understands.

2067
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:56,820
Who understands.

2068
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:57,940
You don't know if he's a man.

2069
01:25:58,820 --> 01:25:59,700
That's true.

2070
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:00,420
You know what?

2071
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:01,140
I do know.

2072
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:04,340
Let me assume on this one.

2073
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:05,380
I would been a rent check.

2074
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:07,140
I rent check that he's a man.

2075
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:07,620
Oh man.

2076
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:09,140
Well, big Johnson used to be so wholesome.

2077
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:12,100
He used to just be about the politics.

2078
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,780
These big Johnson shirts.

2079
01:26:13,780 --> 01:26:18,420
It was about, it was about being just horny, regular misogyny.

2080
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:21,380
This is what Joe Brandon has done to this country.

2081
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:22,680
Who?

2082
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:24,900
The president, Joe Brandon.

2083
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:26,180
Oh, I forgot about that guy.

2084
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:28,020
Yeah, you forgot about let's go Brandon.

2085
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:29,780
Oh, Joe Brandon.

2086
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:32,660
The president, technically, as we record this.

2087
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:33,540
Technically, he is the president.

2088
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:36,340
After he's fighting kids, he's calling people garbage.

2089
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:37,780
And then whatever he's doing.

2090
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:40,900
He said Trump needed, guys like Trump, you need to bite him in the ass.

2091
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:43,220
Or no, you want to smack him in the ass.

2092
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:43,860
Yeah, yeah.

2093
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:45,460
Did he spank or smack him in the ass?

2094
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:45,940
Yeah, whatever.

2095
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:46,340
I don't know.

2096
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:46,900
He spacks.

2097
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:48,260
I don't, I don't, I'm not mad at him for fighting the baby.

2098
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:49,700
I don't know what's going to happen, you guys.

2099
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:50,900
I don't know what's going to happen.

2100
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:51,780
That's what I'm going to say.

2101
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:52,580
It's fine to like.

2102
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:53,700
48 hours, 24 hours.

2103
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:57,060
I understand wanting to nibble like, like the air that there.

2104
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:57,620
I get that.

2105
01:26:57,620 --> 01:26:58,020
I do.

2106
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:02,260
Still photo belies that the video, everyone was laughing and having fun.

2107
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:03,060
That's right.

2108
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:03,540
That's right.

2109
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:06,980
They also like Photoshop, his eyebrows like tilted down.

2110
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:10,660
So he looked angry and, you know, like he was trying to eat the baby.

2111
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:11,460
Come on, guys.

2112
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:12,020
Come on, guys.

2113
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:12,580
Sure.

2114
01:27:12,580 --> 01:27:13,460
But you know what?

2115
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:16,580
By the time everybody's listening to this, nobody even remembers that.

2116
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:18,180
No, it's all lost.

2117
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:22,500
Everybody remembers how smooth the election went and how easy the.

2118
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:28,020
Monday, November 4th, 5, 13 PM is the timestamp for this moment right now.

2119
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:32,180
All SNL cast members practicing different set songs at the piano.

2120
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:35,140
We don't know.

2121
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:36,340
There's a lot of uncertainty.

2122
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:38,100
Yes.

2123
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:41,940
So let's, okay, let me look through some notes here because there,

2124
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:48,100
there was an actual English translation of the ride because the narration is in Japanese.

2125
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:51,620
And it's not like it's an, it's amazing or anything,

2126
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:52,900
but it's interesting Nemo.

2127
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:57,060
Nemo is talking to the crew and he says volunteer crew.

2128
01:27:57,060 --> 01:28:00,180
So that's the idea of the ride is that you're all volunteers.

2129
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:02,580
You're not actually sailors or whatever.

2130
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:03,080
Yeah.

2131
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:04,900
He says, this is Captain Nemo.

2132
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:08,740
Welcome to the magnificent underwater world in this mysterious ocean.

2133
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:12,020
There may be highly developed intelligent beings.

2134
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:14,180
Your mission is to solve that mystery.

2135
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:18,820
So it's translation, but that's a lot of pressure for volunteers.

2136
01:28:18,820 --> 01:28:21,060
So there is, it does feel like, because I, this didn't,

2137
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:24,180
this wasn't conveyed to me just by going on the ride is that he,

2138
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:25,540
he knows they're out there.

2139
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:29,700
He's looking, Nemo is looking for these little guys, these little aliens.

2140
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:34,980
Well, that does help our, that does help our, our case in terms of like,

2141
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:37,860
why after the Kraken or after the squid, do you see these guys?

2142
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:40,740
It was like, oh, that's what we, we got past the squid to get those guys.

2143
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:41,780
That's the goal.

2144
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:42,260
Okay.

2145
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:42,740
Yeah.

2146
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:43,220
Yes.

2147
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:44,260
And I've said this before.

2148
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:49,140
I would, I want rides, do a ride where like you make me cry the whole time.

2149
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:49,460
Yeah.

2150
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:50,900
You know, I want to

2151
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:55,380
feel something and you're a man in his forties, you know,

2152
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:58,980
there's a lot of pent up stuff in there and you need songs.

2153
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:00,820
You need LCD sound system songs.

2154
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:02,900
You need movies.

2155
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:07,780
You need things, you need Sinbad, a wholesome Sinbad ride to make you

2156
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:11,060
as a, you know, get it out because we need to get it out.

2157
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:12,420
We don't always get it out.

2158
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:12,980
Yeah.

2159
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:15,460
You know, and these things get it out for us.

2160
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:19,620
I watched, I watched Interstellar yesterday and that scene where he like leaves his kid

2161
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:24,180
and he's like, he's crying as he's driving away and she's like, oh, they're all zooming in.

2162
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:24,660
Oh man.

2163
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:25,300
It still gets me.

2164
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:27,220
The, the, that Hans, that's good.

2165
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:27,940
You need that shit.

2166
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:29,300
You need the shit to make it all cry.

2167
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:30,020
Isn't it weird?

2168
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:30,900
I've thought about this recently.

2169
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:36,020
Isn't it weird that that are, we've developed as humans to the point where we almost need

2170
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:39,620
like a McCann, we need somebody to take it and take it from us.

2171
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:40,980
They take it out of us.

2172
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:41,380
Yeah.

2173
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:45,220
It's not just like, cause you use so much stuff happens during the day that you just

2174
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:46,500
don't process.

2175
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:47,060
Yeah.

2176
01:29:47,060 --> 01:29:50,580
There's so much awful shit happening in the world that you just like zoom by.

2177
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:53,220
Sometimes you go, I cannot process what I just saw on Twitter.

2178
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:56,580
Like I cannot process some horrible thing I just saw on Twitter.

2179
01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:57,780
So it just goes in there.

2180
01:29:57,780 --> 01:29:59,140
It just goes in there.

2181
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:01,780
And then you're watching karate kids too.

2182
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:03,380
Karate boys too.

2183
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:07,380
And something sweet too.

2184
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:12,180
And you, maybe there's a sweet moment and you like start crying and it is sweet, but

2185
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:15,700
you know, it's a movie and really what you're crying about is you saw something horrible

2186
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:19,780
a week ago or you felt so sad a week ago and you never processed it.

2187
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:21,060
Well, it's a weird thing.

2188
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:23,540
This, this body we have, this mind we have.

2189
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:27,460
Once again, on a cosmic level, we are in uncharted territories as humans.

2190
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:30,020
We're supposed to like die at age 32 or whatever.

2191
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:30,660
Like sure.

2192
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:34,260
So like our, like that we're operating now in our, in our age, we're like,

2193
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:35,540
well, we got to figure some stuff out.

2194
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:38,580
We didn't, we didn't have our biology is like, we didn't have plans for these kinds

2195
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:38,980
of emotions.

2196
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:43,700
So we got to get things like Sinbad that to make us cry, to make our heads work right.

2197
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:45,300
Well, that, that's it.

2198
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:47,780
We desperately need these rides guys.

2199
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:50,260
That's a joke that goes around squittering down there.

2200
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:53,940
Then it was just like, we all know too much about each other.

2201
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:54,180
Yeah.

2202
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:54,980
That's true too.

2203
01:30:54,980 --> 01:31:01,380
Like, you know, I get mad at how someone chews gum or like, how do you eat?

2204
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:03,700
You eat fish and chips with your hands?

2205
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:04,660
Americans?

2206
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:09,460
Like that was a real thing I saw a few days ago and I got stupid or just from reading.

2207
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:09,860
Oh man.

2208
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:11,060
You didn't cry about that though.

2209
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:12,980
No, I didn't.

2210
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:19,700
I cried about all the people like going like, no, you must be in Mayfield, England.

2211
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:22,260
If you're using your hands, you have to use a four.

2212
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:25,620
And I'm like, the fuck's eating fish and chips with a fucking nut?

2213
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:30,100
Like Jason is consistently on different parts of the internet than me.

2214
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:32,420
I always will say that.

2215
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:32,980
I'm like, I don't know.

2216
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:36,020
I'm fairly ill online, but he's yeah.

2217
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:37,380
He, he, I didn't see any of this.

2218
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:38,420
Fish and chips, Twitter, man.

2219
01:31:38,420 --> 01:31:43,780
That's a whole nother thing.

2220
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:44,500
I'm not in there.

2221
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:45,620
It's not in my algorithm.

2222
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:48,820
Everybody asks like, oh, why are we, why, how are you still on Twitter and all this

2223
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:49,060
stuff?

2224
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:53,060
And I'm like, yeah, but fish and chips hasn't, hasn't gotten the threads.

2225
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:54,340
Fish and chips, Twitter hasn't.

2226
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:54,980
That's a big day.

2227
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:59,060
I'm on the like, uh, uh, what was it?

2228
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:04,180
I saw people go and like, oh, Chapparone is going to be so mad at Bow and Yang for

2229
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:05,700
doing that moodang bit.

2230
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:07,620
And it's like, they know each other.

2231
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:09,860
They're like on record as being friends.

2232
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:11,940
I know every word in that sentence.

2233
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:12,740
I know I'm sad.

2234
01:32:12,740 --> 01:32:18,660
I know that every word, uh, is there a big Johnson shirt that says fish and chicks?

2235
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:20,500
Fish and chicks.

2236
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:20,900
Yeah.

2237
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:21,860
What do we think?

2238
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:25,620
Oh, and if not, that's a big, that would be a big sexy.

2239
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:26,180
Yes.

2240
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:26,820
Oh, nice.

2241
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:29,140
I think it is.

2242
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:31,140
I think big Johnson does have fishing shirts.

2243
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:35,220
So I think he's fishing and it's like, uh, it's going to be a union Jack flag in an

2244
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:36,660
American flag that's bigger.

2245
01:32:36,660 --> 01:32:38,500
And then it's going to be like fish and chips.

2246
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:40,900
I'll take with extra malt vinegar or something like that.

2247
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:42,820
Do you like malt vinegar on your fish and chips?

2248
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:44,420
Um, I added a little.

2249
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:45,540
I'm a tartar sauce.

2250
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:47,300
I'm a cocktail and tartar sauce.

2251
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:50,900
I like cocktail, but I'm a big malt vinegar head when I, when I do all that stuff.

2252
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:52,260
I do love it.

2253
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:55,780
There's no big Johnson shirt, but somebody has started their own shirt line called fish

2254
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:56,500
and chicks.

2255
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:57,700
Oh, free plug for them.

2256
01:32:57,700 --> 01:32:58,200
Wow.

2257
01:32:58,580 --> 01:33:01,380
Hopefully they don't have a weird Trump assassination.

2258
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:03,380
My mom, my mom is a great fisherman.

2259
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:04,660
She's a fantastic angler.

2260
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:06,820
Yeah, she, she caught a lot of King salmon.

2261
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:09,940
Uh, her and her friend used to like literally before work, they'd have, they'd have work

2262
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:13,620
at like eight in the morning and they'd be at the river at five in the morning, catching

2263
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:14,660
salmon downtown.

2264
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:16,740
And then they would like pack them up and then go to work.

2265
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:17,860
It was crazy.

2266
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:22,180
She got really obsessed with it for a while, probably at my age and I'm not as cool as

2267
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:23,220
my mom at my age.

2268
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:24,980
So, um,

2269
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:28,820
Well, talking about different types of the internet, a thing that I had been thinking

2270
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:37,060
about, um, lately, Matt, have you encountered the phrase, the rot economy, exit trans rot

2271
01:33:37,060 --> 01:33:37,620
economy?

2272
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:43,620
No, I have not about basically just everything is getting shittier and shittier and doesn't

2273
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:45,540
work and more expensive.

2274
01:33:45,540 --> 01:33:50,740
And sometimes I feel that way about theme park, uh, uh, theme park rides or theme park

2275
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:53,540
stuff, especially domestic Disney parks.

2276
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:58,100
I'm like, this just keeps getting more and more expensive and everyone keeps posting

2277
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:04,900
photos of like themed lights that are broken or the giant half a billion dollar ride is

2278
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:06,500
down for half the day.

2279
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:07,060
Yeah.

2280
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:12,820
And I was thinking about that for 20,000 leaks because I'm like, this is such a cool ride

2281
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:15,540
and I bet it runs like clockwork.

2282
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:16,420
Yeah.

2283
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:18,260
Everything seems so simple.

2284
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:19,540
Yeah.

2285
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:25,620
I mean, I mean that you even compared to like Disneyland and I've only been to animal kingdom

2286
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:30,020
and Disney world, but like Disney, see when you walk in, even like Disney, Disney, Tokyo,

2287
01:34:30,020 --> 01:34:33,380
Disneyland, you just know they're in another league in terms of the care they put in that

2288
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:33,620
park.

2289
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:34,580
It's, it's not.

2290
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:36,580
And I say about Disney, see, it's like, oh, it's like Disneyland.

2291
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:40,660
If they had more money, like you could just feel it in every way, shape, and form.

2292
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:45,300
But I do, I mean, I do have this thing where my brother was like, he goes, I think I come

2293
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:46,660
out to LA, we should go to Disneyland.

2294
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:48,100
I'm kind of like, I don't know, man.

2295
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:51,300
I don't know if like that would be worth your while at this point.

2296
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:53,620
Cause it's a $500 fast pass.

2297
01:34:53,620 --> 01:34:54,180
Is that true?

2298
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:55,620
That exists.

2299
01:34:55,620 --> 01:34:56,020
Yeah.

2300
01:34:56,020 --> 01:34:56,900
That's like a full.

2301
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:57,700
You don't have to do it.

2302
01:34:57,700 --> 01:34:58,900
Like you don't have to.

2303
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:01,460
It's like a full day, like.

2304
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:02,100
Front of the line.

2305
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,860
Front of the line for everything.

2306
01:35:03,860 --> 01:35:08,500
But from the line in quotes, like how many people have bought individual lightning blades

2307
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:10,980
or how many people bought the day pass?

2308
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:11,220
Yeah.

2309
01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:15,140
And it becomes like a money proposition.

2310
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:19,940
I think when I did my first time ever in my life was like 2019, I bought a Disney pass

2311
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:21,460
and I think it was $900.

2312
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:24,740
And I was like, this makes sense.

2313
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:25,620
I'm going to go.

2314
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:29,220
And I think I went maybe, maybe 10, 12 times.

2315
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:30,580
Like I had a great year.

2316
01:35:30,580 --> 01:35:31,060
It was fun.

2317
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:31,860
And I was like, great.

2318
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:33,140
It was worth it to me.

2319
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:33,940
Free parking.

2320
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:34,420
Free parking.

2321
01:35:34,420 --> 01:35:35,060
At that level.

2322
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:35,380
Yep.

2323
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:36,260
Exactly.

2324
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:39,060
And, and, and I had a great time with it.

2325
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:40,820
And I've been kept on wanting to get, oh, I need to get another fast.

2326
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:45,300
But what's the, what if I want to get a pass right now, what does it cost?

2327
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:49,140
Not the same level of pass.

2328
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:49,620
Yeah.

2329
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:54,180
What's the pass that I, that we have that we just went up or I have,

2330
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:57,060
it was like 400 bucks, 450.

2331
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:58,340
I have the worst pass.

2332
01:35:58,340 --> 01:35:58,820
Okay.

2333
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:02,020
Now the second, second to worst pass.

2334
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:02,340
Okay.

2335
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:03,380
And then just went up a hundred bucks.

2336
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:06,260
So I think you can get it for like 500 or 550.

2337
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:08,500
And those are with like blackout dates and not a lot of them.

2338
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:08,980
Yeah.

2339
01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:13,060
And not big, but you can have that $18 parking if you text that strange number

2340
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:15,140
and I'll give you the number.

2341
01:36:16,740 --> 01:36:18,740
I'll tech, I'll share a contact with you.

2342
01:36:18,740 --> 01:36:19,300
Oh man.

2343
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:21,780
Strange city walk garden.

2344
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:22,180
Excuse me.

2345
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:23,140
Garden walk number.

2346
01:36:23,140 --> 01:36:27,380
You're going to wake up with your bit of bathtub full of ice with that number, dude.

2347
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:27,540
Yeah.

2348
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:30,340
But with the, I have saved $12 from parking.

2349
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:30,580
Yeah.

2350
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:31,700
That's a good point.

2351
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:34,260
I get the $12 on the counter there.

2352
01:36:34,260 --> 01:36:34,500
Yeah.

2353
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:39,140
Well, I mean, if, if, if those deals are so important to you and you're willing to go

2354
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:43,060
through them, even if you're, even if you're a little bit afraid of a giant horned gentleman

2355
01:36:43,060 --> 01:36:46,660
who's trying to get you to really connect and not be so connected to deals like that.

2356
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:48,740
A giant horned gentleman, like a big Jason.

2357
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:50,660
That's right.

2358
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:52,180
No, no, not a, not a horny gentleman.

2359
01:36:52,180 --> 01:36:52,660
Oh, okay.

2360
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:54,180
Not a big horny gentleman.

2361
01:36:54,180 --> 01:36:54,420
Okay.

2362
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:57,940
That actually there, we're, we're trying to, they're not little, like not pervert.

2363
01:36:57,940 --> 01:36:59,460
It was like a big horny gentleman.

2364
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:00,180
I like that.

2365
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:02,900
Like that feels like, that feels like, that feels like stately.

2366
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:03,860
Yeah.

2367
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:06,180
Like a Bustopher Jones and cats.

2368
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:13,140
I always have fancied myself more as a skimbles shanks, the railway cat, but I'll take it.

2369
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:13,940
Skimbles shanksy.

2370
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:19,140
I'm so, I'm, I'm, I'm here to air my grievances and we're on, uh, uh, tangent

2371
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:21,780
19,800, Scott free.

2372
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:25,540
I'm so mad at the James Corden casting and cats.

2373
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:26,820
I love cats.

2374
01:37:26,820 --> 01:37:27,860
I love cats.

2375
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:30,580
And then his take on it was like crazy.

2376
01:37:30,580 --> 01:37:31,940
It's in the fucking text.

2377
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:34,340
He goes in the song.

2378
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:35,540
He goes, I'm Bustopher Jones.

2379
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:36,260
I'm not skin and bones.

2380
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:37,620
In fact, I'm incredibly fat.

2381
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:39,940
And he's like very proud to be a fat cat.

2382
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:42,420
And then like later, James Corden does this improv.

2383
01:37:42,420 --> 01:37:44,340
He's like, Oh, don't make fun of my weight.

2384
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:46,020
I'm so sensitive about my weight.

2385
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:48,500
It's like, no, you were literally singing about your

2386
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:52,900
The whole song is about how Bustopher Jones gets to eat so much garbage that

2387
01:37:52,900 --> 01:37:57,860
he's a big cat, which is a point of virtue in the cat world.

2388
01:37:58,420 --> 01:38:02,820
And James Corden doesn't understand the character and the script that he read.

2389
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:04,500
He is lousy in that movie.

2390
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:05,140
Wow.

2391
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:06,340
Uh, Jason, what do you feel?

2392
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:07,860
I've never seen cats, the play.

2393
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:08,980
I've heard the songs.

2394
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:14,340
Well, uh, me and my lady friend saw it, um, like opening month on animals.

2395
01:38:14,420 --> 01:38:20,340
And, uh, uh, yeah, it was, uh, uh, certainly it's a trip.

2396
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:22,900
Sounds like he's punting on answering this.

2397
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:23,700
Oh, it's not.

2398
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:24,900
I mean, it's not good.

2399
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:29,460
I have the nipples and the hands and I, yeah, I don't.

2400
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:33,620
Do you feel like you have a good, like, does everybody embody the action?

2401
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:36,580
You knew the characters of the cast before seeing the movie.

2402
01:38:37,140 --> 01:38:39,380
There's a lot of great, like Jen Rodson is great.

2403
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:39,860
She's great.

2404
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:43,540
And, um, so my whole story, let's get into it guys.

2405
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:44,100
Scott's not here.

2406
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:44,740
I can get into this.

2407
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:45,140
Right.

2408
01:38:45,140 --> 01:38:48,500
My whole story with cats is like, I was in, I was writing for the WWE is in

2409
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:49,060
Connecticut.

2410
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:52,020
I would go to New York all the time just for fun on the weekend.

2411
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:52,420
Right.

2412
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:55,860
And I would just do a lotteries for Broadway shows, try to go see a show.

2413
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:57,380
And I would get, I got cats.

2414
01:38:57,380 --> 01:38:58,660
I'm like, oh, well, I'll go see cats.

2415
01:38:58,660 --> 01:38:59,300
I'll go see cats.

2416
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:03,460
And I saw it and I went to work on Monday and I was like, oh, I saw cats this

2417
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:03,780
weekend.

2418
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:04,260
How was that?

2419
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:05,780
I'm like, ah, man, it was stupid.

2420
01:39:05,780 --> 01:39:06,740
That's a dumb show.

2421
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:10,260
It's just like a bunch of cats come out, they're singing their names and I'm

2422
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:11,060
telling them about it.

2423
01:39:11,780 --> 01:39:15,620
I'm talking about it at the table and then one of my friends goes, Hey, you

2424
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:18,980
know, you've been talking about cats for about 35 minutes.

2425
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:20,740
Do you think maybe you like the show?

2426
01:39:21,380 --> 01:39:23,300
And I go, ah, maybe I do.

2427
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:27,460
And then I listened to the, the soundtrack at home and then I would go

2428
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:30,500
into New York and I would just do the lottery and I saw cats four more times

2429
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:30,900
in New York.

2430
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:31,460
Wow.

2431
01:39:31,460 --> 01:39:32,580
I loved it.

2432
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:33,940
At that point, I love the show.

2433
01:39:33,940 --> 01:39:37,540
I'm into the show and I was so excited about the movie and I do think the

2434
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:42,180
movie pulled almost everything off except for Bustopher Jones is a big miss.

2435
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:42,740
Interesting.

2436
01:39:42,740 --> 01:39:46,180
And Skimbleshanks, I'll also say Skimbleshanks is better in the movie than

2437
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:48,100
I think the stage performances.

2438
01:39:48,740 --> 01:39:52,260
That was quite a inspired look and feel and what was going on?

2439
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:57,140
As we learned with Starlight Express, trains, not the easiest thing to do on

2440
01:39:57,140 --> 01:39:58,820
stage, but that's it.

2441
01:39:58,820 --> 01:40:02,020
Starlight Express is running somewhere in the world right now.

2442
01:40:02,020 --> 01:40:03,140
So what do I know?

2443
01:40:03,140 --> 01:40:03,860
I'd like to watch.

2444
01:40:03,860 --> 01:40:04,420
I'd like to see it.

2445
01:40:04,420 --> 01:40:05,940
I haven't seen Starlight Express.

2446
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:06,580
Yeah.

2447
01:40:06,660 --> 01:40:08,580
But you should see the movie.

2448
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:09,140
Okay.

2449
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:13,620
I mean, you got a kid and at some point they need to watch love that will scare

2450
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:14,180
her.

2451
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:14,660
Oh, yeah.

2452
01:40:14,660 --> 01:40:16,260
It's a good scare because that's the other thing.

2453
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:17,380
Talk about the good scares.

2454
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:20,500
In the beginning of Cats, the music's very creepy.

2455
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:23,700
It's like, it's like really spooky.

2456
01:40:23,700 --> 01:40:24,020
Yeah.

2457
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:27,140
And as that music's playing, the lights are off and then the cats walk up the

2458
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:30,660
aisles and like I said, I always try to sit on the aisle and like I was like

2459
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:31,860
looking at a cat across the way.

2460
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:33,460
Then I turn around, there was like a cat right in my face.

2461
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:35,380
It goes, does that thing?

2462
01:40:35,380 --> 01:40:36,340
Oh, it's so good.

2463
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:37,940
It just scares the shit out of you.

2464
01:40:37,940 --> 01:40:38,420
It's so fun.

2465
01:40:38,420 --> 01:40:40,580
I would like to be scared by a cat on Broadway.

2466
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:41,860
Yeah, it's great.

2467
01:40:41,860 --> 01:40:42,180
Okay.

2468
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:44,180
Then they're also like, you can look at them and they're a bunch of like

2469
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:47,460
good looking folks in tight clothes, but they're cats.

2470
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:48,740
Oh, there's a horny element to it.

2471
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:49,940
There's a little horny element.

2472
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:51,300
It's very understated.

2473
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:51,940
It's very understated.

2474
01:40:51,940 --> 01:40:52,980
Now I'm getting to it.

2475
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:55,140
Now I'm getting to the heart of what's going on here.

2476
01:40:55,140 --> 01:40:56,740
Like, and it's not like the animals.

2477
01:40:56,740 --> 01:40:57,860
The cat ladies.

2478
01:40:57,860 --> 01:41:00,420
Oh, it's, I'm attracted to the ladies portraying the cat.

2479
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:00,740
I don't know.

2480
01:41:00,740 --> 01:41:03,300
It's, it's, it's, it's very titillating.

2481
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:04,180
It's very fun.

2482
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:04,660
It's a very exciting show.

2483
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:05,780
God, I didn't know that.

2484
01:41:05,780 --> 01:41:08,020
I mean, I guess it makes sense because like, I know there's like a whole

2485
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:11,140
community of people that like are very attracted to the thundercats.

2486
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:11,460
Yes.

2487
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:14,580
And they've, the cats always felt very thundercats to me.

2488
01:41:14,580 --> 01:41:16,820
Very thundercats in the, especially the face design.

2489
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:17,300
Facially.

2490
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:17,540
Yes.

2491
01:41:17,540 --> 01:41:20,980
And I, I'm a big Zubili Zoo fan from our childhood.

2492
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:21,940
I, do you know, are you familiar with Zubili Zoo?

2493
01:41:21,940 --> 01:41:22,660
I don't know if I know Zubili Zoo.

2494
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:23,300
Ben Verene.

2495
01:41:24,020 --> 01:41:25,940
They were very much dressed like cats.

2496
01:41:26,820 --> 01:41:28,820
Well, you know, well, we'll do a little Zubili Zoo on the way out.

2497
01:41:28,820 --> 01:41:31,540
Let's, let's do a little bit more about the ride.

2498
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:36,900
The gray ride that we all love.

2499
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:40,260
The color palette.

2500
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:45,620
We are doing a fair job of some hardcore ride theory talk mixed with some good tangents, guys.

2501
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:51,940
The color palette on the ride, just like the bright greens and then all of a sudden

2502
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:55,460
there'll be like a splash of like neon orange.

2503
01:41:55,460 --> 01:41:59,060
Like you get the, each room has its own like color profile.

2504
01:41:59,060 --> 01:41:59,620
Yeah.

2505
01:41:59,620 --> 01:42:01,620
And makes everything so memorable.

2506
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:04,740
I don't really want this, but part of me is almost like, man,

2507
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:07,940
I'd love to like look at this, not in this ride vehicle.

2508
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:09,220
Yes.

2509
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:13,140
And I think it would take away some of the illusion of how big it is, obviously.

2510
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:17,060
But sometimes I'm just like, man, the colors in here are so cool.

2511
01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:17,300
Yeah.

2512
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:19,860
I would just like to see it unobstructed.

2513
01:42:19,860 --> 01:42:24,900
I have a weird aversion slash desire to doing that in pirates specifically.

2514
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:28,660
I would like love to see the ceiling of pirates because I never look up.

2515
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:29,460
I never want to look up.

2516
01:42:29,460 --> 01:42:30,820
I never want to try to find it.

2517
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:31,300
Yeah.

2518
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:35,060
Because that room, the room with the ships at the beginning is so massive to me.

2519
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:40,420
I just don't like, I truly feel outside, but I know I've gone underground and it's a great illusion.

2520
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:45,860
But like if pirates ever stopped and the lights were on, I'd be kind of like.

2521
01:42:45,860 --> 01:42:47,860
Well, there's something creepy about it.

2522
01:42:47,860 --> 01:42:48,420
Yeah.

2523
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:49,860
But it would like break my heart.

2524
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:54,660
But also it's like, I can't explain it, but it's like I want to see it,

2525
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:57,300
but I know it would ruin the ride for me.

2526
01:42:57,300 --> 01:42:57,780
Yeah.

2527
01:42:57,780 --> 01:42:58,900
I mean, I understand that.

2528
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:03,060
I mean, I think a lot of it, even when you see like pictures of haunted mansion,

2529
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:05,300
lights on, ride vehicle is stuck.

2530
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:09,140
You look at some of the sets and you go, this looks like garbage.

2531
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:11,460
This looks like everything looks cheap.

2532
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:12,500
Everything looks small.

2533
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:18,100
Like, is it, was it really worth it to get a peek behind the curtain in this aspect?

2534
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:20,420
I think with the robots on pirates, even when the lights are on,

2535
01:43:20,420 --> 01:43:22,580
you'd still find a bunch of cool shit to see.

2536
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:22,740
Yeah.

2537
01:43:22,740 --> 01:43:25,860
Then you'd see like some of the guys don't have bottom halves.

2538
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:26,180
Yeah.

2539
01:43:26,180 --> 01:43:27,380
Some of them are just tops.

2540
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:32,660
There would be weird stuff and it would be creepy, but interesting.

2541
01:43:32,660 --> 01:43:32,900
Yeah.

2542
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:35,220
But yeah, I don't know.

2543
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:38,980
Maybe I wouldn't want to be out of the ride vehicle to see some of the stuff,

2544
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:40,180
but I don't know.

2545
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:41,540
It's just the colors are so cool.

2546
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:45,460
The other cool thing about it is when you walk in, that's very earth tone,

2547
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:48,580
very, we forgot to mention this is a very steampunk thing.

2548
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:50,980
Well, yeah, although Jules Verne aesthetic.

2549
01:43:50,980 --> 01:43:51,380
Yeah.

2550
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:54,580
This is, I was looking, I don't know if you've found anything,

2551
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:58,980
I can't find who was the project lead or something on this ride.

2552
01:43:58,980 --> 01:44:00,260
I didn't really come across that.

2553
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:04,340
And we know Tony Baxter is Mr. Jules Verne and he tried to put a bunch of Jules-

2554
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:09,460
I think there's a whole generation of Imagineers that Jules Verne just lodged

2555
01:44:10,180 --> 01:44:17,380
so much in their minds and I think clearly there's been so many adaptations of Jules Verne

2556
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:23,620
and H.G. Wells, but Jules Verne especially works well for like police making.

2557
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:27,860
Well, yeah, and it feels somewhat timeless, not somewhat, but I guess timeless at this point.

2558
01:44:27,860 --> 01:44:32,500
But there's, yeah, there were many different attempts to put a bunch of Jules Verne shit

2559
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:36,580
in the back of Disneyland and it's in its own like port, I write port Disney,

2560
01:44:36,580 --> 01:44:42,500
like there have been so many Jules Verne concepts lying around Imagineering over the years.

2561
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:46,580
So it wouldn't shock me if a lot of Tony or whoever was involved in this,

2562
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:50,580
but I was wondering, yeah, who did anyone have like the real vision for this?

2563
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:51,300
I'm not sure.

2564
01:44:51,460 --> 01:44:55,700
Yeah, Jules Verne, the Jules Verne look in this thing is very much like the Venn diagram of like

2565
01:44:55,700 --> 01:45:00,820
Adventureland and Frontierland. It's got like a little bit of like fantasy and a little bit of

2566
01:45:00,820 --> 01:45:08,340
like rustic exploration and stuff like that. So it makes sense that 20,000 Leagues is a Disney thing

2567
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:13,380
and that's why I'm surprised there's nothing in the park that's, in the LA park that's like this.

2568
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:18,580
Right. There's a, I forget which specific scene, but when they do electricity on the ride,

2569
01:45:19,220 --> 01:45:24,980
it looks so good. It's so fun. It's like just this like, it looks just like little ribbon

2570
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:29,380
lighting or whatever you would call it. Like whatever I use to light my toy shelves.

2571
01:45:29,380 --> 01:45:31,300
I think it's projection lightning.

2572
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:32,420
Do you think that's what it is?

2573
01:45:32,420 --> 01:45:35,620
I think so. Cause I, cause I don't see, cause I think when you do the ride through,

2574
01:45:35,620 --> 01:45:38,260
like it's on the tentacles, like it's, it's how you get away from the squid.

2575
01:45:38,260 --> 01:45:40,340
You know what? You're probably right. I'm looking at it right now.

2576
01:45:40,340 --> 01:45:40,740
Yeah.

2577
01:45:40,740 --> 01:45:41,300
Yeah. I think you're right.

2578
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:44,340
I thought it was black light. I thought it was a physical safety.

2579
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:49,700
Illusion if we're all arguing. I think you're on, I think you're closer to what it is.

2580
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:52,660
The other cool thing about that is watching the movie, there's a scene. It's, it's,

2581
01:45:52,660 --> 01:45:56,580
it is the most regrettable scene in the movie is where there's a bunch of, they go to an island,

2582
01:45:56,580 --> 01:46:00,500
there's a bunch of cannibals that chase them. It's, it's sure it's not great in modern day,

2583
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:04,740
but they get them up, they all hop on the ship and they get them off the ship by doing electric

2584
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:10,660
shock on the ship. And that effect is like, I think on purpose, the ride effect of the

2585
01:46:10,660 --> 01:46:14,420
lightning is the same effect they use. And it's like the same color. It's the same shape.

2586
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:18,580
It's the same squiggle of the lightning. I think it's like an intentional homage to like

2587
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:22,020
how the novelist protects itself by like overcharging itself, but it's cool.

2588
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:27,060
It looks, I think you're right. It almost looks like laser lights that aren't in a straight line.

2589
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:28,340
Yeah. There's something.

2590
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:28,580
Yeah.

2591
01:46:28,580 --> 01:46:32,500
I don't know. Maybe there's some very simple explanation for what that is.

2592
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:41,300
I wonder if that was the timing on the novel, 20,000 Leagues, was electricity still very new

2593
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:43,300
and modern? Oh, I don't know.

2594
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:48,100
Like, cause I w we watched around Halloween. We watched Halloween three season, The Witch,

2595
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:53,780
which is not a good movie on a lot of levels, but there is some interesting stuff in it. And it,

2596
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:59,860
there are some obsessions of America at the time, the advent of closed circuit TV,

2597
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:08,660
divorce, the rise of divorce, like commercials, like television commercials and stuff.

2598
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:15,860
So every now and then popular obsessions, I feel like make their way into media.

2599
01:47:15,860 --> 01:47:16,100
Yeah.

2600
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:22,980
And I feel like the rise of electricity around the turn of the century kind of like

2601
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:27,700
really affected a lot of people's brains. Well, I think there is also something with the,

2602
01:47:28,660 --> 01:47:33,540
I think there's something very like nuclear bomb about Nemo, because the whole thing is

2603
01:47:33,540 --> 01:47:39,060
the ship engine is like this magical power source that nobody knows. And you can't even look at it

2604
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:45,460
without like a huge blast shield in front of your face. And then the spoiler, Volcania Island or

2605
01:47:45,460 --> 01:47:50,420
Volcania Lagoon blows up at the end. And it's a very like, it's a practical effect, but they

2606
01:47:50,420 --> 01:47:54,900
really have rigged the explosive to look like a mushroom cloud. I think they are playing like this

2607
01:47:54,900 --> 01:48:03,300
is like, Captain Nemo has harnessed this power that is like a nuclear bomb. In fact, to the point

2608
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:09,540
of, I'm kind of surprised slash maybe we should save this, Godzilla versus Captain Nemo would be

2609
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:16,660
like a great thing, like set it in the fifties and like do something like that. But like maybe

2610
01:48:16,660 --> 01:48:21,780
Nemo's power is the guy that unearthed Godzilla. Godzilla is 70 years old as of yesterday.

2611
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:23,620
Yes. Happy birthday to Godzilla.

2612
01:48:23,620 --> 01:48:25,140
Happy birthday, Godzilla.

2613
01:48:25,140 --> 01:48:27,860
30 years until the public domain for Godzilla.

2614
01:48:27,860 --> 01:48:29,940
Holy shit. That's going to be great.

2615
01:48:29,940 --> 01:48:31,700
We're all going to make a Godzilla movie at that point.

2616
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:35,380
All these gods, all these monsters and Dick Tracy,

2617
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:38,340
they're eventually going to clash in the blood and honey universe.

2618
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:44,100
I mean, you're actually, you're probably right that Dick Tracy won't get brought into blood and

2619
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:46,580
honey. So we got to beat that Dick Tracy out. Yeah.

2620
01:48:48,100 --> 01:48:51,380
Yeah. What year did this ride get made actually?

2621
01:48:51,380 --> 01:48:52,740
This was an opening day.

2622
01:48:52,740 --> 01:48:53,460
2001.

2623
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:55,220
Attraction. 2001.

2624
01:48:55,220 --> 01:49:01,540
Yeah. And the projection, the lighting projection on stuff where you project onto things, is that-

2625
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:02,500
Projection mapping, they call it?

2626
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:06,820
The projection mapping, yeah. When was that effect like kind of popularized? Like what was the-

2627
01:49:06,820 --> 01:49:12,260
Well, they've been doing a version of it for decades, but there's like a more, I'm assuming

2628
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:16,660
there's like a more modern version of it that they've been doing for the last decade or couple

2629
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:20,900
decades at this point. Cause like they do so many projection mapping shows on the castle.

2630
01:49:20,900 --> 01:49:21,540
Yeah.

2631
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:25,780
And I feel like, I feel like it was all of a sudden, like everything was projection mapping

2632
01:49:25,780 --> 01:49:28,900
and it was like, oh, wow, cool. They can do a lot of cool stuff. And then it kind of got boring to

2633
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:33,140
me. I'm like, oh, everything's projection mapping. And now I'm seeing more projection mapping and

2634
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:38,660
there's stuff like in, I think Paris, maybe that they do on the tower of terror there.

2635
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:43,300
And then they have like a Marvel drone show in addition to the mapping they do.

2636
01:49:43,300 --> 01:49:44,260
Oh, that's cool.

2637
01:49:44,260 --> 01:49:46,900
And now I'm like, okay, maybe I'm back into the projection mapping.

2638
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:49,700
Cause like that's like half box ghost is like a projection map face.

2639
01:49:50,660 --> 01:49:55,060
No, I think, uh, yeah, that's complicated. It's like a real head that they,

2640
01:49:55,780 --> 01:50:02,500
I think there's a projection in his, we are still not sure exactly, but it's not like pretty

2641
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:07,220
projected. I don't think from far away or anything. Like, like, I mean, an old school version of

2642
01:50:07,220 --> 01:50:12,500
projection mapping are the singing busts. Right, right. It was just a film, but that's just,

2643
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:17,620
that's from decades ago. Um, but I'm not sure. I feel like we tried to figure out what the illusion

2644
01:50:17,620 --> 01:50:22,900
was on the cat box goes up. So I forgot any of the speculation. Cause I think we read different

2645
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:29,860
like ideas of what it could be. I think there is like an official Disney video of them setting it

2646
01:50:29,860 --> 01:50:36,580
up. And I think one thing they alluded to was a tiny projector inside the hat box.

2647
01:50:36,580 --> 01:50:40,660
Huh? Like projecting, but small. Yeah, kind of.

2648
01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:43,300
Yeah, I forget. It was in whatever we talked about was interesting

2649
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:49,300
man years ago, but they, especially with the one at mansion, they do try to keep, so there is a

2650
01:50:49,300 --> 01:50:53,380
certain cave fade to some of the stuff. Right. They want to, they want to, they don't want to

2651
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:57,220
show all their behind the scenes. It's all a pepper's ghost. If you have a question,

2652
01:50:57,220 --> 01:51:02,340
you go a pepper's ghost. Oh, is the, is the last Atlantean a pepper's ghost? I, I, I couldn't

2653
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:06,100
remember the ride. And I also couldn't tell from the ride vehicle. Cause there's a little more

2654
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:11,140
complicated. Um, and it wasn't quite, it was 2001. I wouldn't be surprised with peppers because it

2655
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:17,540
couldn't do the, uh, the, who's the, the, the, the shaman priestess from, uh, avatar, the shaman

2656
01:51:17,540 --> 01:51:22,100
of song. That's the, you know, that's, they're showing their, their brushstrokes there.

2657
01:51:22,980 --> 01:51:28,020
That you're talking about this guy. Yeah. This one is like waving goodbye. Yeah. Uh, but no,

2658
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:32,100
you just get, it just kind of goes, the lights turn off, I think. Okay. So he's just, he's just

2659
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:36,820
in a little box waving at us. But these are like, we really probably didn't even do a good job

2660
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:42,580
describing. They're almost like, like seahorse people. Yeah. And they look like they're about

2661
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:46,820
what? Three, four feet tall. Maybe this one's actually bigger. Maybe it's like four foot tall.

2662
01:51:46,820 --> 01:51:50,500
Yeah. They're, they're a little, they're little people. They got fit and they got kind of

2663
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:57,060
thin hands. I'm trying to think what the, who's the, they look like Navi adjacent, but they're

2664
01:51:57,060 --> 01:52:03,140
not fully Navi. Well, that's the ride vehicle to use their way of water ride. Well, that's good.

2665
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:10,020
But the rumor is, is they're using the pirate Shanghai boat technology to do this new water ride.

2666
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:14,420
Right. Okay. Because then you can do like these big screen, like theater rooms with,

2667
01:52:14,420 --> 01:52:19,780
with stuff where you go underwater. And then a Tolkien can swim by and be like, yeah, yeah.

2668
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:25,860
But like, yeah, a little, like more of like even like a small, I don't know, d ticket,

2669
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:32,020
avatar, a little sub here. That's funny. Cause, but I think the, the Navi adventure is already

2670
01:52:32,020 --> 01:52:35,300
filling that hole. Like if they didn't. Well, they're there, but I'm going to California

2671
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:41,700
adventure. Yeah. Like a way of water dark ride. Yeah. It's water. Cause like the main e-ticket

2672
01:52:41,700 --> 01:52:46,180
is going to be way of water dark, not dark ride, but like, well, I guess kind of, but like an

2673
01:52:46,180 --> 01:52:51,220
e-ticket dark ride. Yeah. With like a dynamic ride system. Cause if you do the Nemo ride

2674
01:52:52,260 --> 01:52:56,260
now, you just add it. Cause one thing about the Nemo ride right now, the 20,000 leagues under

2675
01:52:56,260 --> 01:53:00,580
the sea is that you don't have a ton of animatronics. There's some. Yeah. There's the,

2676
01:53:00,580 --> 01:53:03,780
there's the squid. And then there's a few of those guys are kind of like really simple ones.

2677
01:53:03,780 --> 01:53:09,300
But if you started having those like shaman of song level animatronics, like you could make

2678
01:53:09,300 --> 01:53:15,300
an incredible squid on this new one, you know? Yes. So I think that, I don't know. I think there's,

2679
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:21,220
I wouldn't be against in the middle of the ride, the squid fucking you up. Yes. Like I wouldn't

2680
01:53:21,220 --> 01:53:26,340
mind getting jostled. I don't know if the ride system could handle it. Maybe you'd have to alter

2681
01:53:26,340 --> 01:53:31,860
it. I mean, it feels easy. Like there's going to be a hanging ride. Isn't that the Donkey Kong

2682
01:53:31,860 --> 01:53:36,580
ride is going to hang and then. No, it's a mine cart. So you're on the ground. You're thinking,

2683
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:41,620
I think of the element of the ride that there's an extra little bar that's going to make it like

2684
01:53:41,620 --> 01:53:46,820
that's going to be hidden. So when you jump track, it's going to look like you're flying.

2685
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:51,300
You're on a fake track, right? You're elevated. It's not hanging. You're elevated. The car is

2686
01:53:51,380 --> 01:53:56,740
right. Right. Right. And they can't seem to get it to work in Japan. It has, it's behind. See,

2687
01:53:56,740 --> 01:54:02,580
that's, that's just been the running thing. I feel like last few years of like, it's a technological

2688
01:54:02,580 --> 01:54:09,620
Marvel. It works every other day, but it's like, we need to run this thing every day. Harry Potter

2689
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:16,260
won't open with Epic Universe. Oh God. And look, we got to book, we got to book our live shows that

2690
01:54:16,260 --> 01:54:20,820
weekend. Now we got to get it up. We got to get in gear and we got to get down there to celebrate.

2691
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:26,980
But as I'm like, Oh, if everything's not going to be open, I don't know. Man. I was at, I was

2692
01:54:26,980 --> 01:54:32,260
talking to a person who works in the theme parks and actually was like designing rides on the more

2693
01:54:32,260 --> 01:54:35,940
creative level, but also works with the engineers and stuff. And I was very curious about like,

2694
01:54:35,940 --> 01:54:39,780
like I've been talking about, like I'm a big guy and I, there's some rides I cannot get on

2695
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:43,780
universal. Yeah. Yeah. Especially universal. And I'm like, why is universal? Why would life of pets,

2696
01:54:43,780 --> 01:54:48,260
which is a dark ride, why would they not accommodate somebody like, if you tell me

2697
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:54,340
like the Harry Potter arm thing, okay, there's probably an engineering issue, something. Okay.

2698
01:54:54,340 --> 01:55:00,660
I like, I'll buy that safety issue. Fine. I'll buy flips people up and, okay, let's go with your pets

2699
01:55:00,660 --> 01:55:05,540
goes three and a half miles an hour. And also it's literally like, you could just do one bench seat

2700
01:55:05,540 --> 01:55:10,420
out of anything. Like why not? And I was like, why would they not have them? Like, Oh, it's they,

2701
01:55:10,420 --> 01:55:15,220
we definitely could. I think it would save like four days of prep. And so that saves them like

2702
01:55:15,220 --> 01:55:19,140
$200,000. So they think that's not worth it. It's just like, it's purely in a money issue.

2703
01:55:19,140 --> 01:55:21,460
Cause I was like, is there an engineering thing I don't know about? And they're like, no, no,

2704
01:55:21,460 --> 01:55:25,300
it's just like, if you have to make a design a new seat, that's just going to cost another

2705
01:55:25,300 --> 01:55:29,460
two weeks of work or something like that. And it's just like, it's, it's crazy. Like,

2706
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:32,900
how it feels like it should be so easy to accommodate that.

2707
01:55:33,860 --> 01:55:41,700
Especially because theme parks as tourism destinations go out of their way to advertise

2708
01:55:41,700 --> 01:55:48,580
accessibility. Right, right, right. Now Disney would like, you know, sick people or non-mobile

2709
01:55:48,580 --> 01:55:54,580
people or people with issues to jump through a lot of hoops to get that access ability. But that's

2710
01:55:54,580 --> 01:56:00,820
another thing entirely, but it's like, yeah, why wouldn't they, if they're so high on, on doing

2711
01:56:00,820 --> 01:56:05,460
this on it's for everyone ages eight to 80, blah, blah, blah. Why would they not?

2712
01:56:06,180 --> 01:56:11,620
Yeah. Disney's better. Disney's better. Universal's awful. Like they're bad for at least,

2713
01:56:11,620 --> 01:56:14,980
at least side stuff. I mean, like, I'm not sure about everything else, but I could get on most

2714
01:56:14,980 --> 01:56:24,420
rides at Disney. The, the, the avatar ride, the, the writing, the guys, uh, the guys,

2715
01:56:24,420 --> 01:56:30,580
if you want to ride some guys, um, the mighty guys, the mighty guys, the mighty guys. Yeah. Uh,

2716
01:56:30,820 --> 01:56:35,140
that, that one is like literally the, just like my, my calves were just a little too big to like

2717
01:56:35,140 --> 01:56:39,700
strap me in so close. And I told that guy's like, motherfucker kicked that thing into my leg. I

2718
01:56:39,700 --> 01:56:46,580
don't care. I want to, I want to ride these guys. Uh, yeah. But, uh, but Universal's just like,

2719
01:56:46,580 --> 01:56:51,220
so insanely weird on like, that's like, it said life of pets. There's zero reason I

2720
01:56:51,220 --> 01:56:55,620
shouldn't get on life. I don't even want to go on like a little box that's going on a track.

2721
01:56:55,780 --> 01:57:01,540
Yeah. Well, and even, uh, even Mario Kart, which is one, uh, I would say this, thank goodness.

2722
01:57:01,540 --> 01:57:07,220
Universal, they, they, they, with Mario Kart, they decided to hit, they hid the test one.

2723
01:57:07,220 --> 01:57:11,220
Oh, right. Right. Oh, I know. But then now you can like go into like a little,

2724
01:57:11,220 --> 01:57:15,540
you run a little thing, you test out, but the Mario Kart is like, I heard that it's not size

2725
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:20,580
accessible. Okay, cool. I bet I'm going to try anyways. I get on it and I bring the lap bar down

2726
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:26,340
and like, it's down. It's around my legs and it just doesn't click. And I'm like, why does it,

2727
01:57:26,340 --> 01:57:31,300
they just, there's like a gear with like clicks and just make two more clicks and I'd 100% fit

2728
01:57:31,300 --> 01:57:34,660
on this motherfucker. You almost feel like adding insults, injury or something. Like,

2729
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:38,420
yeah, just like to cut, like, I don't know. It felt like there was a guy laughing somewhere.

2730
01:57:38,420 --> 01:57:44,100
Ha ha ha. Yeah. Like I could have done it, but we didn't. It's like, I couldn't, these two widgets

2731
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:50,180
cost us $350,000. So now you and everybody else like you doesn't get to ride this ride.

2732
01:57:50,180 --> 01:57:54,180
It is insult injury. We already live in America and have to eat poison every day.

2733
01:57:55,380 --> 01:58:00,980
Come on. I know. I feel like, yeah, I've also just feel like Universal's ride vehicles are

2734
01:58:00,980 --> 01:58:06,900
uncomfortable in general. Right. It also just feels like there's like some like sick pervert

2735
01:58:06,900 --> 01:58:14,660
designing the like seats, not a pervert in a sexual way. Mr. Comcast is like torture device

2736
01:58:14,660 --> 01:58:20,180
seats. Yeah. Cause like, look, I've talked about it at length on this show, the mummy ride,

2737
01:58:20,180 --> 01:58:25,780
which like makes my genitals fly into my body somewhat, like the way the, which the seat is

2738
01:58:25,780 --> 01:58:32,580
angled up and you're just like sitting on it. I don't know why my genitals retreat on that.

2739
01:58:33,140 --> 01:58:38,260
It sucks. I don't know. Like I know I'm a tall guy and maybe that's part of it, but yeah, but,

2740
01:58:39,220 --> 01:58:44,340
but they're, they're, they're riding vehicles, presumably for human beings. And we are all human

2741
01:58:44,340 --> 01:58:48,980
beings with different shapes and sizes and ways to get around. And it's like, uh, we, and we're,

2742
01:58:48,980 --> 01:58:52,660
we're literally talking about parts. I don't mean to get into this, uh, this accessibility thing on

2743
01:58:52,660 --> 01:58:58,500
this 20,000 leagues. This is a tangent that feels a little heavy, but, uh, this is what drove Captain

2744
01:58:58,500 --> 01:59:03,220
Nemo to go under the sea and attack ships. I'm going to go, I'm going to get in my own little

2745
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:08,500
Nautilus and start just bombing universal. So I can get on secret life of pets,

2746
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:14,100
audio bombs on this podcast. That's right. Like, like old, old Captain Nemo, my pal.

2747
01:59:14,100 --> 01:59:17,860
Then they say Nemo, cause you keep calling him Nemo, which is what they say.

2748
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:23,140
No, I, this is why I imagine James Mason says it because Captain Nemo, I just, he's,

2749
01:59:24,420 --> 01:59:27,620
he's not Indian, which is bad, but he has a very pleasant voice, which is good.

2750
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:31,620
So I don't know how to deal with that. Yeah, I understand that. Um, I dunno,

2751
01:59:31,620 --> 01:59:37,300
is there anything else we want to shout out about the ride before we go? I don't know. It's,

2752
01:59:37,300 --> 01:59:40,660
it's hard sometimes cause you're like, ah, the ride is great. You should go on the ride

2753
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:42,980
and that's podcast ride sometimes.

2754
01:59:42,980 --> 01:59:43,700
Check it out.

2755
01:59:43,700 --> 01:59:47,620
Let me ask you this. So, so you haven't gone to Disney Sea yet, Jason. Let me just start throwing

2756
01:59:47,620 --> 01:59:51,940
these out to you. So let's say it's end of the day and whatever imaginary trip has happened,

2757
01:59:51,940 --> 01:59:56,340
you could go on one more ride and it's, uh, it's either 20,000 leagues under the sea or,

2758
01:59:56,340 --> 01:59:59,140
and I'm going to give you a few ors and you tell me whether you're going to go on

2759
01:59:59,140 --> 02:00:02,180
20,000 leagues or this ride. Okay. Does that make sense? Like you have to make it

2760
02:00:02,180 --> 02:00:07,300
Just from like afar, my assessment from afar. Just from, just from your assessment from afar

2761
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:11,620
or reputation or just what you heard on this podcast? Re-rides or first time riding?

2762
02:00:11,620 --> 02:00:16,260
Uh, uh, first time riding. Oh, okay. Yeah. Like so, so you basically have to make a hard choice.

2763
02:00:16,260 --> 02:00:19,940
Got it. So it's like between this, between 20,000 leagues and tower of terror.

2764
02:00:20,660 --> 02:00:26,260
Oh, tower of terror. Uh, this and Soren. Uh, this.

2765
02:00:26,260 --> 02:00:33,620
Okay. 20,000 leagues or the Indiana Jones roller coaster. Oh, this is okay. I've, I've,

2766
02:00:33,620 --> 02:00:37,300
I don't know, but they're easy. These can be easy questions. What, what, what, what,

2767
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:40,340
what do you think would be a harder choice? Oh, 20,000 leagues or water topia.

2768
02:00:41,620 --> 02:00:50,020
Oh, I only know a little about water topia. Oh man. So I'm probably have to do this. I want to

2769
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:58,420
see this or eating a steak at Magellan's, the restaurant, the sea headquarters society

2770
02:00:58,420 --> 02:01:08,660
of explorers and adventures. That's tough, but I feel like there's better steak likely to be at.

2771
02:01:08,660 --> 02:01:14,580
There's better steak, uh, in the rest of Tokyo. That's right. It's a great steak. I, yeah,

2772
02:01:14,580 --> 02:01:20,740
I'm curious. I do think the hardest coin toss for me having done both is this versus water topia.

2773
02:01:20,740 --> 02:01:25,940
Yeah. Water topia. I like a lot. It looks pretty cool. Oh, it's cool. Yeah. It's also like a unique

2774
02:01:25,940 --> 02:01:30,020
ride to me. It's just like, I've never seen anything quite like it. I guess like the dancing

2775
02:01:30,020 --> 02:01:36,180
cars in, um, in cars land, Luigi's little dance or whatever. Uh, God, I, I, I'm going to get

2776
02:01:36,180 --> 02:01:40,820
raked over the coast. I don't know a single ride name. Uh, I called it Luigi's little dance.

2777
02:01:40,820 --> 02:01:45,060
You kept calling secret life of pets, life of pets. Well, it's not very secret.

2778
02:01:46,580 --> 02:01:53,300
He's watched all the films. He's watched all the Louis CK. That's true. Yeah. Just the first one.

2779
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:57,460
Just the funniest dog. Just, he just, yeah, he just licks himself in front of other dogs and people

2780
02:01:57,460 --> 02:02:03,060
don't like that. Yeah. Uh, but, uh, but water topia is so cool. And I actually, I actually water,

2781
02:02:03,060 --> 02:02:07,300
cause the thing about water topia is he said, Hey, let's shout out the last thing about 20,000 leagues.

2782
02:02:07,300 --> 02:02:11,380
I'm going to go on a water topia tangent is like, it's right on the Bay and it's almost like an

2783
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:16,100
infinity pool type thing. And you could kind of like see out into the Bay. And I was doing

2784
02:02:16,100 --> 02:02:23,380
water topia during sunset, like in Tokyo Bay. It was amazing. That was like one of my highlights

2785
02:02:23,380 --> 02:02:28,980
of the trip besides sin bad. Uh, but, but 20,000 leagues, I think it's kind of technically a better

2786
02:02:28,980 --> 02:02:34,340
ride, but, but water topia is just kind of a neat little sum bitch. You know, I think that's a thing

2787
02:02:34,340 --> 02:02:40,420
that always appealed to me about theme parks in general. It's like, it's just kind of like a thing

2788
02:02:40,420 --> 02:02:46,820
that evokes a lot of feelings and thoughts and you can't do it anywhere else. So sometimes when

2789
02:02:46,820 --> 02:02:54,020
they just make, as it's called, sometimes the book report version of the movie, it's like, well,

2790
02:02:54,020 --> 02:03:00,340
this feels a little less special. You know, if it's not a transformative ride, it feels less special.

2791
02:03:00,340 --> 02:03:06,180
You know what? I will also, what's unique about this is that it's a little box, like very rarely

2792
02:03:06,180 --> 02:03:11,140
are you going to go on a ride vehicle that's an actual box that they put you in. Generally it's

2793
02:03:11,140 --> 02:03:16,340
open air on some level. I can't, I mean, can you think of anything other than the other subs

2794
02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:22,420
where you're in a box or in a actual first thing I think of is, is a state fair ride called the

2795
02:03:22,420 --> 02:03:27,140
Gravitron. Oh sure. The Gravitron. Yeah. But I love the Gravitron for being that because it's the,

2796
02:03:27,140 --> 02:03:30,020
it's like you're in the park, you're outside all day and you're in the, the one time you go inside

2797
02:03:30,020 --> 02:03:34,180
and there's like disco lights and. Yeah, no, it's great. But like there's no dark ride where

2798
02:03:34,180 --> 02:03:39,540
it's a box, even with a window. Just secret life bets. It's a literal box. Well, but it's open.

2799
02:03:40,180 --> 02:03:45,460
I mean, you're right. It is a literal box. Well, this is, it is funny. This is a unique ride system

2800
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:52,340
compared to the other subs where it, you do walk into it and it's not as claustrophobic,

2801
02:03:52,340 --> 02:03:56,660
but like submarines in general, it's a little claustrophobic. Sure. A little bit. You're right

2802
02:03:56,660 --> 02:04:03,380
up on that glass. But yeah, if you got, I mean, this is like, this is like the most potentially

2803
02:04:03,380 --> 02:04:07,140
depending, cause they'll put a couple other couples with you, but this is the most intimate

2804
02:04:07,140 --> 02:04:11,060
ride vehicle. This is very like. If you were to go in alone or in Jason's case,

2805
02:04:11,060 --> 02:04:16,180
go in with a couple other swinging couples. Sure. This is the most intimate. What is this,

2806
02:04:16,180 --> 02:04:21,940
Lord? This is not something to even say. The Jason's a swinger? Yeah. No, no, no, no.

2807
02:04:21,940 --> 02:04:25,460
Yeah. You're like, we're going to wait for the car with the upside down pineapple. With the

2808
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:32,180
upside down. We've talked about that. That's a joke on the show. But no, it's, it is interesting

2809
02:04:32,180 --> 02:04:38,820
being in there. Cause like, you do feel like we're like in our own little little pod. This is a,

2810
02:04:38,820 --> 02:04:43,220
this is a ride for smooching. If you're going to sneak a ride for smooching. Can you flick

2811
02:04:43,220 --> 02:04:49,860
these spotlights off? Yeah, you could just turn them off. Right, right. No, cause like each bench

2812
02:04:49,860 --> 02:04:54,340
is like a pair. So if you, if even if you don't have to look at them, even with the other two,

2813
02:04:54,340 --> 02:04:57,860
even if it was like strangers in the car with you, you could, you could be like, give your back to

2814
02:04:57,860 --> 02:05:01,700
them. It's like, yep. You don't need to see what they're doing. Yeah. Cause they're not pointing.

2815
02:05:01,700 --> 02:05:06,580
You're not looking at them and it's dark in there. Probably the sexiest Disney ride. Probably. And

2816
02:05:06,580 --> 02:05:12,260
we talked about this. So the second sexiest is when you're in the Haunted Mansion and you're

2817
02:05:12,260 --> 02:05:16,500
leaning back to go into the graveyard and the thing tilts you down. Dude, I do kind of think

2818
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:19,700
Haunted Mansion is the same thing. I'd like anything. It's like, I didn't get to go there

2819
02:05:19,700 --> 02:05:24,100
as like a teen, but I do think of like, when I was a teenager, theme parks were always like sexy

2820
02:05:24,100 --> 02:05:28,420
to me because you can go there and meet girls and you could like take a date there and you could

2821
02:05:28,420 --> 02:05:35,060
always like sneak off and then smooch. Yeah. And then I think that a Disney does a great job

2822
02:05:35,060 --> 02:05:39,460
and it's good that they do of keeping that out of the parks. But then once in a while, Haunted

2823
02:05:39,460 --> 02:05:45,220
Mansion, 20, those things are the same. You go to Tokyo Disney, you get a little bowl. Everybody

2824
02:05:45,220 --> 02:05:50,260
puts their room keys in a bowl before you get on the ride. Well, you better make sure you get

2825
02:05:50,260 --> 02:05:54,980
one out because I think some of those hotels are the style where you put your room key on to turn

2826
02:05:54,980 --> 02:05:58,820
the light on. That's right. And then you swap couples on the benches. That's right. If you

2827
02:05:58,820 --> 02:06:03,380
really like whine a swing, if you really want to play. And you're literally swinging from the top.

2828
02:06:03,380 --> 02:06:06,980
This is the swingiest ride in Disney for sure. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying.

2829
02:06:06,980 --> 02:06:12,260
So there's another feather in its cap. That's another good thing about this ride. Another nice

2830
02:06:12,260 --> 02:06:17,300
thing, cool cast member uniforms, which are based on the movie. They're the little blue sailor

2831
02:06:17,300 --> 02:06:24,420
uniforms with some purples and teals in there. It's a cool get up. Yes. That's the ultimate

2832
02:06:24,420 --> 02:06:30,180
thing about it is I think everything that you do here brings you into that world. And even before

2833
02:06:30,180 --> 02:06:35,940
the ride happens, I do think it's transformative. Next level immersive. Yeah. And that's the epic

2834
02:06:35,940 --> 02:06:40,180
universe. They're promising it and that's what we want. That's what we keep saying over and over

2835
02:06:40,180 --> 02:06:48,820
again. You can find it 20,000 leagues under the dang sea. Yep. Well, there it is. Matt Mazani,

2836
02:06:48,820 --> 02:06:53,780
you've survived podcast the ride. Wow. The second gate, I guess. Do we say that? Does Scott say the

2837
02:06:53,780 --> 02:06:58,740
second gate when he says it? No, he doesn't say that. I can't remember. I've only heard him say it

2838
02:06:58,740 --> 02:07:04,500
hundreds of times. I honestly didn't remember which stream this was going on. Well, that's

2839
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:09,780
the whole thing. We need to have a big meeting, Jason and I. We have big plans going on. Not

2840
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:14,740
just Marmaduke May and big Jason tees, but we have big plans this month. We have to do a big

2841
02:07:14,740 --> 02:07:18,660
credit card episode. There's going to be a whole bunch of elements that he isn't even aware of

2842
02:07:18,660 --> 02:07:23,860
that are going to be happening during this credit card episode. Oh, wow. You don't have to be

2843
02:07:23,860 --> 02:07:29,700
involved in anything. I'm bringing extra things in. Oh, okay. Because we're going to do it up.

2844
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:34,340
We're going to do credit card episode points. I'm very curious to hear an update because you

2845
02:07:34,340 --> 02:07:39,940
had not talked about credit card points in quite a while. So I'm curious to see where you're at.

2846
02:07:40,820 --> 02:07:44,820
Well, that's going to be part of my credit card point journey because the listeners voted for

2847
02:07:44,820 --> 02:07:50,260
this. It's not like I suggested doing this recently. Have you guys gotten more server space for the

2848
02:07:50,260 --> 02:07:55,300
extra traffic for this episode, the credit card episode? Well, we should. What you're saying is

2849
02:07:55,300 --> 02:07:58,020
a good piece of advice. You don't want people to go to download it and they can't get it because

2850
02:07:58,020 --> 02:08:02,900
the servers are overloaded. The servers have been crashed. Yeah. From, yeah. So like that DJ

2851
02:08:02,900 --> 02:08:09,220
Khaled album. What's going to be interesting too is I have to make sure my bank account

2852
02:08:09,220 --> 02:08:13,140
can hold all the money. That's right. From what we're going to get when everyone signs

2853
02:08:13,140 --> 02:08:16,820
up for this credit card point episode. Because we've never checked the capacity of that bank

2854
02:08:16,820 --> 02:08:21,300
account. Right. We don't know. Yeah. We don't know. This money's just shooting in when they

2855
02:08:21,300 --> 02:08:26,980
hear this riveting episode. But no, there's a lot of, we have a lot of fun plans and we're

2856
02:08:26,980 --> 02:08:32,980
going to talk about it soon off mic. Oh boy. Yeah. It's not about, it's about church. It's

2857
02:08:32,980 --> 02:08:38,580
about big dogs. Beautiful. Many versions of big dogs. And yeah, anyway, Mavisani exit through

2858
02:08:38,580 --> 02:08:46,180
the gift shop. Yeah. Plug away. You've got a cool short that you've recently made. Yeah. I

2859
02:08:46,180 --> 02:08:50,500
shot a short film last year. We've been running it through the festival circuit and now it is out

2860
02:08:50,500 --> 02:08:56,020
online. It's called Big Brothers. Starring Mike Mitchell, a friend of the pod, I believe. Very,

2861
02:08:56,020 --> 02:09:01,620
yes. Very good friend. Yes. Then Eddie Pepitone and Jesse Klein and Winston Carter and Leroy

2862
02:09:01,620 --> 02:09:07,700
Patterson. It's a great cast and it's on Omeleto, which is a YouTube channel that does a bunch of

2863
02:09:07,700 --> 02:09:13,140
short films. So O-M-E-L-E-T-O. Check that out. I wrote and directed it. It's a blast. It's a,

2864
02:09:13,140 --> 02:09:16,660
it's a, I don't know, we've got some pro wrestling fans. It's got some pro wrestling stuff. It's a

2865
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:22,260
comedy. It's fun. It's a five brothers go to fix their mother's house. And after she dies

2866
02:09:22,260 --> 02:09:26,580
and the dad shows up and it's a big brouhaha, but. And you take a bump in the movie. I take a big

2867
02:09:26,580 --> 02:09:30,660
bump in the movie. Yeah. Oh yeah. You gotta, you gotta see me. You take a stunt. Do you think it's

2868
02:09:30,660 --> 02:09:36,180
a more severe stunt than those kids took? No. Okay. Those kids. I'm telling you, when you watch

2869
02:09:36,180 --> 02:09:39,380
Kung Fu Kids 2, you're going to be like, well, that's like, that's the inspiration. You watch

2870
02:09:39,380 --> 02:09:44,420
Kung Fu Kids 2 and say, I want to be a Kung Fu kid. I want to fall off a ladder through a table

2871
02:09:44,420 --> 02:09:50,820
for fun. And it was fun. But the moment before was extremely scary. I bet. I was like, it's all

2872
02:09:50,820 --> 02:09:55,300
really good. But then you're up there and you're like, well, this is fucking high. Yeah. Wow.

2873
02:09:55,300 --> 02:09:59,860
Yeah. So yeah, I was actually afraid of breaking the location too. Cause it was like an old house

2874
02:09:59,860 --> 02:10:04,340
built in the 1800s. And I was like, well, I just go through the floors into the basement. We'll see.

2875
02:10:04,340 --> 02:10:11,620
Sure. Hey, director taking the bump himself, not making other actors do it. You got it. You can't.

2876
02:10:11,620 --> 02:10:16,740
Hey, that's what the great Vince McMahon would do. Okay. What? What do you mean?

2877
02:10:16,740 --> 02:10:22,980
What do you mean? I was trying to pay a compliment. We should time since we're recording this in

2878
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:30,660
November, uh, 2022, before anything bad happened with Vince McMahon. In 22, I knew Vince was a good

2879
02:10:30,660 --> 02:10:37,220
guy. That's for sure. A good man. A good man with good beliefs and good practices. Uh, so yes,

2880
02:10:37,220 --> 02:10:41,860
anyway, check that out. We'll probably, yeah, we'll post the link. Um, and then yeah, hopefully,

2881
02:10:42,580 --> 02:10:45,940
uh, we'll have you back on to, uh, unveil the line of shirts.

2882
02:10:45,940 --> 02:10:52,660
Hell yeah. Um, and we'll maybe, I, I don't want to say a Minotaur should be a spokesman for it or

2883
02:10:52,660 --> 02:10:58,500
being featured, but we'll see. Maybe it, maybe it'll happen. Yeah. Well, I, for your sake, I hope the

2884
02:10:58,500 --> 02:11:03,380
Minotaur doesn't show up, especially during that credit card episode. That's not, but that would

2885
02:11:03,380 --> 02:11:08,100
be very scary. We can't tell the Minotaur when we're doing it. Oh yeah. One of the things I'm going

2886
02:11:08,100 --> 02:11:13,460
to bring is an ax. That's smart. Kill a Minotaur if he comes during the credit card episode. Yeah,

2887
02:11:13,460 --> 02:11:16,020
you can try. That'll be fun. All right. Well, I'll try.
