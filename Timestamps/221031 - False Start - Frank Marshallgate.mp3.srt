["The Friar's Theme from The Cemetery Gate"]

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Welcome to Hauntcast, The Fright, The Cemetery Gate, where today true fears are faced.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Quite genuinely, I think I will prove, a good boy, a scared boy will face some fears, and we'll see if we come out the other end.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I am that scared good boy, Scott Grave Digner, and we're talking about a fear that has manifested for me for many, many years, which is scary trees, animatronic trees, talking trees.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We'll get into the ins and outs of it, but that's what we're doing, and I have some help today from Jason Skeleton.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hi, I'm excited to tackle this topic. You were very passionate when you brought it to the table, and you did briefly second-guess yourself, but I was like, no, I think you know that this is a thing we should address.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Just how, and how many samples, like, without breathing, like, without taking a breath, you were able to produce?

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh yeah, well, I've been thinking about it for a while, because this is, it's one of those things, it's a thing that I think I need to hammer out.

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This is the forum and the way to do it, with like, how many, with several thousand therapists, I guess, listening, which thank you all for being here, but the main ones being Jason Skeleton and Michael Madsen.

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Okay, so I'm going to try to do it how I think it should be said again. I've said this before, I'm not saying you did it wrong, but I think from now on, I would appreciate if Michael Madsen was saying, Michael Madsen.

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's right, yeah, yeah.

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So just a real ramp up.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm so, like, jamming to the point.

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's okay, I know when you're-

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I forgot to give it the color it needs.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Jason, could you try it for me?

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Michael Madsen.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's Don Pardo.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah, we're hovering right on Don Pardo.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Michael Madsen.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay, I like that reading.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He never hosted, so we never got to hear Don Pardo say the name.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's a good point.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I didn't get to host her on Halloween time.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I hosted other during the regular seasons, but would it be funny if I hosted like three or four times? You didn't know?

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
No, I missed those, weird. I just wasn't watching.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I was, I was, I was 96. I was 12. Musical guest, Delamitri.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Did they get a second song or did they just do the-

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No, just the one from the Flipper movie.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. If you only had the one, then that's all you'd do.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Good song, though.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I do like that song, yes.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Roll to Me.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Roll to Me, yeah. No, I've put on Roll to Me before.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Before we get into that, though, there is something to address from a previous haunt cast, The Fright.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Michael Madsen, accurate, because you got mad at us last week.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And I think we have, we've done a little bit of further research and we have to go over this a little bit.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yeah.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We're going to get, we're going to go back into Frank Marshall Gate here.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Last week, if you didn't hear the episode, we talked about this horror award show, basically, where the recipient the first year was the director of arachnophobia, Frank Marshall.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But you might know Frank Marshall's name better on this podcast as being a good friend of Jimmy Buffett.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And as such, he is mentioned on the show all the time.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Often, yeah.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yes.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Often, yeah.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So this was a big moment to get into Frank Marshall and where Michael Madsen took the conversation was the time that we all went to the premiere of the Jurassic World ride.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And you got, I went back and re-listened to it, you raised your voice.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And you got animated and upset.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Because we didn't remember that we saw Frank Marshall speak.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yes.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
At this event.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Now, within the episode, you caught yourself.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And realized that it was very possible that this was not Frank Marshall speaking.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
He was there, but that there was another similar looking old man.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He is similar looking.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I will, you have to give me that at least.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I mean, in the broad sense.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
In the broad sense.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
They are old and they are white.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I think there's different levels of hair receding.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But, you know, you did catch yourself, you did apologize.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But later that day, I was like, well, let me figure this out completely.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And who that was, who gave a speech at this event was Ron Meyer.

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Who is a longtime Universal executive.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I didn't realize he left the company.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He left in 2020.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
An executive from 85.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Right.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
A year after we were there.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He left the company.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Good Lord.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Major career there.

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
One of the founders of CAA, apparently.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, yeah.

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah.

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This guy's a huge, huge, huge big wig.

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Hey, you know, he maybe deserves, there's an alternate universe where we're like, well,

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
you didn't see, you don't remember Ron Meyer, one of the founders of CAA speaking.

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I believe kind of instrumental, like in the early days of the Universal theme parks or.

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Maybe.

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Maybe he was like rubber stamping stuff or was somewhere in the background.

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay, sure.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I also, I believe also a mediator during the Conan Leno Tonight Show debacle.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh, wow.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Which we need not go back into.

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Not yet.

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I guess.

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah.

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We haven't, actually, we really, we talked about the previous Leno debacle.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But I bring it up to say.

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah.

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I mean, look, you did, of course you caught it.

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You caught it.

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's true.

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It just, what I think was so strange was the, the emotion, the raw emotion that you had

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
for us not remembering.

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This, this seemed like a huge moment for you.

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You were, you were astounded that we did not remember this.

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But then as it turned out, you did not remember it correctly.

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I did not remember.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yes, you're right.

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I got, look, I got worked up.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Anytime Frank Marshall, Jimmy Buffett's good friend comes up, I get excited.

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And I do remember the feeling of there's Frank Marshall.

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He's there.

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Because obviously we saw Pratt was there.

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Bryce Dallas Hart, Frank Marshall, all on the stage together.

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Travarro all on the stage together.

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So I was for sure very excited that Frank Marshall was there.

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
There's no way that wasn't the case.

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I think you might be the only person in attendance who would put Frank Marshall on the same plane as Chris Pratt.

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I would rather not, actually truly nothing against any of the actors or director of Jurassic World.

125
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You nearly forgot to mention the director was there.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah, right. Sure.

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But I would rather talk to Frank Marshall.

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We all know how we feel about the director.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Well, sure, sure.

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We wanted to get on the boat with him for sure.

131
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah, yeah, we wanted to be on the boat.

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But yes, Frank Marshall, I was so excited.

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I would be more excited about talking to him about just the island lifestyle, just about island life.

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Just about island time in general and talking to him about Jimmy Buffett.

135
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Nobody talked to it.

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Were you doing that calculation?

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Were you like, this is our chance?

138
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He wasn't hanging out though.

139
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He was just, he popped up on stage with everybody because I watched the video as well and I went, oh God, he was just standing on stage.

140
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And that's where the feeling came from.

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So really, I think what this is about is that I'm so stimulated by Frank Marshall being in my presence.

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You are stimulated by Frank Marshall.

143
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It felt so like, oh my God, Frank Marshall's there.

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And I conflated these two things in my head that Frank was speaking.

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You gave him a speech.

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
In a way, he was speaking to me just by being there.

147
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Just his presence.

148
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Let me do a little minute by minute of this too because there was a lot going on.

149
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Okay, first things first, Frank Marshall, the giddiness before his name is even said.

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
If you go back and listen, it's a lot of like, do you want to say it?

151
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
No, I want to say it.

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
No, do you want to say it?

153
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
There's so much.

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You guys are both bubbling.

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
He loves Frank Marshall too.

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I do like Frank Marshall.

157
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Let's calibrate your Frank Marshall feelings.

158
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I like Frank Marshall.

159
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I was very excited when they just, I think they brought him on stage as the director of Arachnophobia.

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah, he accepted an award at this thing we covered last week.

161
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
At the Horror Hall of Fame.

162
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And I was like, wait a minute, didn't Frank Marshall direct Arachnophobia?

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And then here he comes and he's got like a wild.

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The 90s Buffett hair.

165
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
90s Buffett hair.

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I think, was he wearing like a t-shirt with a blazer over it?

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Like a black blazer or something?

168
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Possibly, yes.

169
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But, and then of course the joke is that Big Bob the spider lowers down from the ceiling and picks up the award and raises it back up.

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But so I was, I was excited to say, I think we were new in our infatuation with Frank Marshall.

171
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
He looks like Jimmy Buffett.

172
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He has the look of Buffett in like the fruitcakes video.

173
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He's got kind of the mullet.

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Let me ask this.

175
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Through what media are we supposed to know that Frank Marshall is Jimmy Buffett's best friend?

176
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Why does everyone, why do you know?

177
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The media we're making.

178
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The media we're spitting.

179
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Why do I know this?

180
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Because of us.

181
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I know it from you talking, but how do you, how are, more importantly, how do you know it?

182
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I've known it for a long time and I'm trying to remember where it first pops up because it dates back to before the podcast when we had put the list of streets together for the Margarita Village or whatever it's called.

183
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Because I put like Marshall Lane and I made sure to let them know that this was named after Jimmy Buffett's good friend, Frank Marshall.

184
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Well, I think profiles in newspapers or magazines of either one usually mentions, oh, and here's an interesting fact.

185
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Their friend is so-and-so.

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And you're reading a profile of Frank Marshall?

187
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm just trying to remember where, I actually don't know where I first learned this, but he produced the musical and the escape to Margaritaville.

188
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But then when you go back, you realize they've been friends forever.

189
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
They've been friends for 20, 25 years.

190
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And I think it also is, it's, it is, it is in a similar way.

191
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Like when Jason and I would read comics or something and you would learn, like you'd learn about like a new character and then you go, oh, wow, the characters have been around for 20 years.

192
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Here's what they've done.

193
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's like that, except instead of a man with superpowers.

194
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's a guy who like makes phone calls in an office all day.

195
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Well, his superpower is getting these movies made.

196
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Similarly, along the same track, running parallel to these train tracks.

197
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I saw a clip this week from the Drew Barrymore show had George Clooney on.

198
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And they were very chummy, you know, they're old friends.

199
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
They've worked together before and they told a story about they were, they went out one night when they were shooting Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.

200
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And Drew Barrymore had just gotten divorced and was letting loose a little and got drunk and made out.

201
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
They kept saying, and you made out with, I made out with your best friend, George.

202
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And I was like, oh my God, did Drew Barrymore make out with Randy Gerber?

203
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And it's like, no, not the case.

204
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
She made out with his close friend and hairstylist, Waldo Sanchez.

205
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We have new Clooney Waldo friends? Did Waldo get a briefcase?

206
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Waldo Sanchez? Did Waldo get a briefcase with a full of a million dollars?

207
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I don't know, but I learned about a new guy.

208
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
They just started talking about Waldo.

209
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And then there's, you know, this is the Daily Mail and Yahoo News was like, here is the person they are talking about.

210
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This is great. I'm so happy Waldo entered the chat.

211
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So Mike, when you go home in between bottle feeding your two month old.

212
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Trying to know about Waldo Sanchez.

213
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
In between holding your beloved child and you got your phone going in the other hand.

214
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
See what you can find out about Waldo.

215
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
If he got the million dollar, I wonder if he got the million dollar briefcase.

216
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I bet he did.

217
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Was it only investors or was it just people they knew?

218
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yeah, he's one of them.

219
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
His buddies. Yeah, Waldo Sanchez got a briefcase full of a million dollars.

220
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
All right.

221
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Wow. He got the magic.

222
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We're talking about one.

223
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,000
We're in the tide of one never always told story and then I got pulled into another.

224
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But you heard the excitement Jason and I had with Waldo Sanchez.

225
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The orbit of guys.

226
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Now say Waldo Sanchez.

227
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
All of a sudden you learn he produced like Indiana Jones.

228
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You'd be like, well, Waldo Sanchez, isn't this fun?

229
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah. Yes.

230
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
This is fun. I guess so.

231
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Here's what let me keep doing the minute by minute.

232
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You're both like you're erupting with excitement before you even said his name.

233
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But Jason, having said that you're kind of a Frank Marshall guy, you quickly move on.

234
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
We're talking about, oh yeah, he did direct a couple of movies.

235
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And then Jason says, well, speaking of directors, and then you talk about something else involving directors.

236
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah. Mike does not stand for this.

237
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You turn the ship around.

238
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You are. Everybody goes flying to the side.

239
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You were like, no, no, no.

240
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Frank Marshall has come up.

241
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
We are talking about the Jurassic World thing.

242
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So you like you throw us back into it.

243
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And that was a mistake on my part.

244
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That was an error.

245
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Thank you so much for being there.

246
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That was a fielding error on my part.

247
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Thank you for acknowledging that.

248
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I misread your vibes.

249
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And I thought it was time to move on.

250
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I think you might have caused the voice to be raised.

251
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I appreciate that.

252
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I think that put Mike into an agitated state.

253
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's not the first time that's happened in my life.

254
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
See, this is I appreciate that, Jason.

255
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And I think you just got I think you're correct.

256
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I think I felt like my volume was going to be the thing to get people back on track here with what we needed to talk about.

257
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You needed to just corral the energy and get it back.

258
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And that got me overexcited.

259
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And that got me my brain firing and conflating memories.

260
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You're also you're all over the place because you raise your voice to say you don't remember him speaking.

261
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But right before that, you get very inward and you say and friend,

262
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Frank Marshall, who's the producer, Jimmy West, and Frank Marshall, Frank Marshall spoke there.

263
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And you say it so solemnly.

264
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It reminded me of something you would say about Christ.

265
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Like and Jesus went and lo, he spoke there.

266
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
He spoke to them and the word was good.

267
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He produced some of the greatest movies of all time.

268
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So, you know, in a way, he did hoot.

269
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
He did the BFG.

270
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
We're talking.

271
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Did the BFG.

272
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:32,000
This is what I was what I wanted to get at was like the like, look, at the end of the day, Jimmy Buffett is your thing.

273
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Right. And it crosses over with Jason.

274
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It does.

275
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You go pretty deep into it.

276
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But Frank Marshall is a deep spire within yours.

277
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's a thing within your thing.

278
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah. The idea that even if he had spoken, the idea that we're supposed to recognize this man.

279
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Well, remember, which and by the way, even if he gave the exact speech that Ron Meyer gave, I looked that up and the speech was like, oh, I never could have imagined the positive success of this franchise and this adventure.

280
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Sixty five million years in the making.

281
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And we thank our partners for the dullest thing.

282
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But for this show, where we talk about Frank Marshall a lot in my head, when I think, oh, Frank Marshall spoke, I was like, how could we not remember that he was there doing like it was shocking to me.

283
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It was shocking to me that it wouldn't be something you would remember because of the time many times Frank Marshall.

284
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So even though I was incorrect about the speaking, I was incredulous that you wouldn't remember that because of Frank Marshall being one of the top 10 characters on this show.

285
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But the thing is, though, like Jason, OK, you remembered him being there at all.

286
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Right. I remember you didn't even remember him being there.

287
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And that was shocking to that got me even more fired up.

288
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You're still fired up.

289
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You don't remember him being there.

290
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You're taking this even though you were wrong about the speaking.

291
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm getting upset again.

292
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
We don't remember a guy being a little confused that that wouldn't be.

293
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I don't think I don't think we generally had good vantage point.

294
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That's true.

295
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:09,000
We did not stage and I automatically have like a foot less than most people at seeing a stage.

296
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
We have to go back into the photos and see where there was there anything blocking.

297
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Here's but here's look, it's also this.

298
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's been this was three years ago.

299
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That's true.

300
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It wasn't just any three years ago.

301
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Most.

302
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah.

303
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The most insane three years of any of our lives.

304
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Both of us had children.

305
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,000
All of our lives have been re re atomized and put back together in a bizarre shape.

306
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And somehow with all of that going with like the country almost ended, it still might.

307
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's still possible.

308
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
One of the things that we are supposed to have retained in that three years was a silent.

309
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Well, first of all, was a speaking Frank Marshall, which even you were wrong about.

310
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yes.

311
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
But also just Frank Marshall standing somewhere.

312
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Somebody who and this is what my point is.

313
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yeah.

314
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Jimmy Buffett is your thing.

315
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yeah.

316
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Frank Marshall is so deep within your thing.

317
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's not my thing.

318
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Jason, I understand putting a little blame on because he's asserted he's a bit of a Marshall head.

319
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I don't know.

320
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I don't know.

321
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I've maybe seen a photo of this man twice.

322
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Well, I don't know what he is.

323
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I think you're you're, you know, three years recombobulating our minds and lives and stuff.

324
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I think that is both an endorsement for me forgetting and Mike getting remembering.

325
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I think it simultaneously answers both those questions.

326
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You're saying I've been hanging on to you were hanging on.

327
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It was just a light.

328
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It was a bright moment.

329
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And you were clinging to like one day, one day things will be back to normal and I'll see Frank Marshall from the

330
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:56,000
briefly on his stage with five executives and then leave a glorious moment, which then you equated with firework.

331
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That was the best of it was turning to do you remember the fireworks?

332
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Yes. I remember when the sky exploded with light and color and sound.

333
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I went back and watched it.

334
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
That was a spectacular fire.

335
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
A lot of fireworks.

336
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It was so high in the air.

337
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It startled everyone, including Frank.

338
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Yeah.

339
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Bryce jumped out of her big clacky heels.

340
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It was an incredible fireworks display.

341
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And somehow that is equals the producer of the the US dub of Ponyo standing somewhere and not speaking.

342
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The producer of War Horse.

343
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Mr. War Horse himself was on stage standing there because he didn't have anything to do that night.

344
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
He had nothing else to do.

345
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So he was over there because it was close to his house.

346
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I bet.

347
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Wait, I guess.

348
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So you're where you've landed after this relitigation is you don't regret the being mistaken about the speech because in your mind he did speak.

349
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Well, he doesn't need to.

350
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
He doesn't need to say anything again.

351
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I look I like to be correct.

352
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So I am I'm regretful of not being right that he spoke.

353
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I do.

354
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I don't like that.

355
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I was wrong about that.

356
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
At least I caught it fast dish.

357
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But the feeling would have been the same whether he spoke for 30 minutes or he just popped up on stage.

358
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
We are in the same space.

359
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
We are within 100 feet of Frank Marshall.

360
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And I'm so excited about it.

361
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It wouldn't.

362
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It would not have mattered.

363
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
The only thing that would have been different is if I if he was wandering around in the area where we were and we got to speak with him.

364
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That would be the only thing that would have made it even more exciting.

365
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And if we got to speak to him and he spoke to us and he blessed us that day.

366
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And if you were.

367
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yeah.

368
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I would ask him I would he would dip his fingers in my my tropical cocktail of some kind and he would bless me with the with the pineapple and rum.

369
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,000
If so you'd be excited that the producer of the BFG walked up to you at a party and put his fingers in your in your beverage.

370
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Oh my God.

371
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I would be thrilled.

372
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And then and then wiped it on you.

373
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Oh my God.

374
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm realizing there's a story that I was told now and I think I can say it and I'm going to say it and then double check to make sure this is this is related to Randy Gerber.

375
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But I have to tell this story.

376
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I have to tell the story.

377
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Now this is going to be its own episode I guess.

378
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
They're OK.

379
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Just break this off.

380
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's possible.

381
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's possible.

382
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So let me tell I'll tell the story real quick because I have not told you guys I cannot believe it because I think I've been sitting on this for a few weeks now.

383
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
A friend of mine was at the Hollywood Bowl.

384
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
He was with some friends.

385
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
He had a bottle of Casamigos tequila.

386
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And they were splitting it among the friends.

387
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And a gentleman walks over to them and says hey that's like some good tequila or whatever makes a mention of it.

388
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm one of the owners the original creators of Casamigos tequila.

389
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
We're talking about the third mystery man.

390
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Michael is it Melman or something.

391
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I know what is it.

392
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What's the guy's name.

393
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I think that's someone else.

394
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
We got to look this up now.

395
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
What's wrong that you don't have this at the at the ready.

396
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
There's this.

397
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Well Randy's kind of a star.

398
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Michael Melman.

399
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Michael Melman.

400
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Michael Melman.

401
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Michael Melman.

402
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Meldman.

403
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Meldman.

404
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Meldman.

405
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Michael Melman.

406
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Michael Melman.

407
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
A different guy.

408
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So he's he's talking to these friend of mine and his friends and they're very excited especially my friend who listens to the show and knows about is deeply invested in the Gerber lore and all that.

409
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So he says to Michael he says I have a friend who is so into Casamigos.

410
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Can I take a photo with you.

411
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And Michael says no.

412
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Perfect.

413
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And now the craziest part happens because that's great.

414
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
That's by itself great.

415
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah.

416
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
That he came over and introduced himself because he saw the bottle.

417
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That's insane as well.

418
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That he feels that level of pride.

419
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That he wants to make sure people know that he was involved.

420
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yeah.

421
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So he leaves and then a couple minutes comes back over with an empty glass and goes hey top me off.

422
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Whoa.

423
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And asks them to give them some of their Casamigos after refusing them after refusing the photo then wants free Casamigos from them because he was involved.

424
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So they were like I guess so and gave him some which is insane.

425
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So good though.

426
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
What a better what a better interaction though.

427
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Yeah.

428
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
He gave you a lot like this this little like interactive Casamigos guy experience.

429
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I feel like the you know vibe of an outdoor concert venue and stuff.

430
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Someone walks by with a glass and you have a bottle goes hey man top me off.

431
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I feel like it's just customary.

432
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It's just courtesy to go like sure.

433
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Oh yeah I'll pour you a slug.

434
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
OK.

435
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
But this very very rich man.

436
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You somebody walks up to you at a concert you start giving your liquor away.

437
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I like if I have a full bottle of liquor.

438
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Yeah I think so.

439
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm curious to see this play out.

440
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's like if you have a joint and like yes someone offers you one or you offer that to that now maybe not now post covid.

441
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I think it's just customary.

442
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It all depends.

443
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I think he should have said top me off and then handed him a 20 because he's likely a very rich man.

444
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
He's 100 percent very rich.

445
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Anyway so I don't I want to deflect.

446
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I just wanted to say that story because it's so great.

447
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yeah.

448
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Anyway go back to Frank Marshall.

449
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Should we just end this episode and call it false start and put it out as that own thing.

450
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Yeah sure.

451
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Great.

452
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
OK. Let's do that.

453
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Let's for the rhythm of it.

454
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Well we'll explain the context.

455
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Yeah.

456
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
So you survived a bunch of fucking Frank Marshall.

457
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Cosmigos Waldo Sanchez bullshit.

458
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Or Waldo Sanchez coming soon I guess.

459
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Coming very soon yes.

460
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Regrets I guess immediately.

461
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You shouldn't have opened this box because Jason introduced a new player into the game.

462
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I've been lax.

463
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I've had something I wanted to get you and Lindsay for you know a baby gift.

464
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And I've been a plush Waldo Sanchez.

465
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
We got it.

466
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I think a toy is making a seven inch Waldo Sanchez toy.

467
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
So I saw a moment where it's like oh I can give him a little something now and that's a new guy.

468
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Thank you.

469
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Yeah I appreciate that.

470
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Are these guys because they aren't evil.

471
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Well I think this is a different flavor.

472
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yeah.

473
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Because we know guy with a capital G is Nathan Masri.

474
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Yeah.

475
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
A friend of famous person is different.

476
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It's a lowercase.

477
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
A little more gentle.

478
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
We'll sort this out.

479
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
OK.

480
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
False start.

481
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Thanks for surviving that.

482
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
You've probably heard the other one.

483
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Yeah.

484
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
This makes sense.

485
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
OK.

486
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Let's just refresh.

487
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Take a deep breath and we'll do the scary trees.
