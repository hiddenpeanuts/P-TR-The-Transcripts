1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Warning.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:25,400
The following live podcast is hosted by three men nursing severe abracadabra hangovers.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,040
One of us was nearly too depressed to perform tonight, having lost his Mickey hat on Guardians

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,960
cosmic rewinds.

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,960
That's true.

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:45,280
During the show, one of the hosts may start floating Yogi Bear style towards the aromas

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,520
wafting from Gideon's bakery.

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:57,520
And now, just down the road from the world's largest McDonald's, it's podcast at Ridley!

11
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,040
Oh, man.

12
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,040
Oh, man.

13
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,720
Oh, man.

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,560
So psyched to see everybody.

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:36,040
Welcome to Podcast the Ride Live.

16
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,040
Thank you.

17
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,960
Hosted by three guys who are thrilled to be here, but also need to wrap it up quick so

18
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,460
we can wake up at 7 a.m. for the Tron virtual queue.

19
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,040
Maybe some of you guys too.

20
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll soon check my app to make sure my name is in there, which is Scott Gertner.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hi.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,480
Hello, everybody.

23
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,760
My name is in my app as well, and it's Mike Carlson.

24
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,760
Thank you.

25
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Tap it, applause.

26
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,760
That's okay.

27
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,200
And my name is not in the app.

28
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,280
I'm having a lot of difficulties, but I am Jason Sheridan.

29
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,440
Here, let's have a seat.

30
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,440
Let's settle in.

31
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,600
There's a lot going on.

32
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,760
I think we've got some fun surprises for you.

33
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,920
How's everybody feeling at the late show here?

34
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,920
Wow.

35
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,960
You know, I did the check in the first show, but why not do it?

36
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,200
Disney people, Disney cast members.

37
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,200
We got them.

38
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,560
Great.

39
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,560
Universal people.

40
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,120
Do we have universal people?

41
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
What do you call that?

42
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
Are you minions?

43
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,120
Are you minion?

44
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
What are you?

45
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
Team members, right?

46
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,920
Welcome, team members.

47
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,200
And, well, here's a round of applause, and this should be everybody who's excited to

48
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,600
be at Icon Park on iDrive.

49
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,640
Icon Park fans.

50
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:11,400
This is the most PTR ass place that we've ever done a show.

51
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,280
I can't believe it.

52
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,600
We did one right before this at some point in the window, a little train passed by.

53
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,120
So there's a lot of entertainment for us.

54
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,120
I like that.

55
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
That's true.

56
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,080
We're doing this in the shadow, for listeners who haven't been to this place, we're doing

57
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,360
it in the shadow of a giant Ferris wheel.

58
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
That is right behind.

59
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,360
I hope people hit it up before or after.

60
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,880
Let's all go right after.

61
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:44,560
We are really, really near a Madame Tussauds, like steps away.

62
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,560
Like if we all just like, it's less than 100 feet, right?

63
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,360
We could all encounter a wax bad bunny.

64
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,080
I wish I could say that was one of our guests this evening.

65
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,000
We are not going to wheel in a wax bad bunny.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We love Icon Park.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,720
We're excited to be in Icon Park.

68
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,720
But we didn't come to Orlando just to be in Icon Park.

69
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,700
We of course had equally stupid places to visit.

70
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,320
We didn't even, of course we wanted to come here, but it was kind of out of our hands.

71
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:23,080
It was something that we had to do, a mission that we were given, if you will.

72
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
It was out of our hands.

73
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,600
It was out of our control.

74
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,200
We feel the weight of it now.

75
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
It's been a tough week.

76
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,040
It's been a busy week.

77
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,960
The only person I think who can fully explain what exactly this mission entails is Mike

78
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
Carlson.

79
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
Okay.

80
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,040
I just want to get this perfectly correct.

81
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:57,160
We're here for a daily, extremely necessary series.

82
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:11,160
Exploring the stores, restaurants, chocolate emporiums, and wonderful magic that makes

83
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:20,520
up Universal City Walk Orlando.

84
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
It's happening.

85
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,520
It's happening.

86
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:30,240
This is the announcement right here.

87
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,720
And we've even been issued the name.

88
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,980
From on high, we've been given the name.

89
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,520
What is the name?

90
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:46,040
The City Walk Orlando saga, the multiverse of madness.

91
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,400
Wow.

92
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,960
It has been said this is our big Marvel Hall H or whatever the hall is.

93
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
It's Hall H.

94
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
That's the Disney letter.

95
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,960
It's Hall H.

96
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,320
Well, no, I know that, but where do they do announcements like at D23 or if they're at

97
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,880
the contemporary, what's the other D23, the one here?

98
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,360
Is there a Hall D?

99
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
Destination D.

100
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,200
Do they do anything for that?

101
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
Is it the Hall D?

102
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
What is it?

103
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
There's a Hall D23 at D23, right?

104
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,120
Am I wrong?

105
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
There were a few people talking.

106
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
You know what?

107
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
Ultimately, who cares?

108
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,080
What we're about to do is going to be better than any Marvel movie.

109
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,920
Even the ones that were better 10 years ago, remember?

110
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,400
It's going to be better than all of them.

111
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,400
We're so excited.

112
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,920
We're going to be back with our first daily mall-oriented series in a long time.

113
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,080
You would be shocked how little time we have spent in theme parks since we got here on

114
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,360
Monday.

115
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,480
We have to go drink slushy drinks.

116
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,260
We have to have desserts with desserts on top of those and desserts on top of those.

117
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,240
It simply must be done.

118
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,000
How are you guys holding up?

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,360
Well, I think I said in the first show, the first few days, I was like, wow, it's really

120
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,880
leisurely here at City Walk Orlando.

121
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,880
And then yesterday kind of rocked all our shit, like kind of cleaned our clock.

122
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:19,480
And coincidentally, it was also the day that Universal Florida, like half the park was

123
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,360
down and we were greeted by announcements at the front.

124
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:31,240
I have never heard anything like this saying, like, Universal Florida is experiencing a

125
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,040
number of technical difficulties.

126
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,880
If you have a multi-park pass, why not start your day at Islands of Adventure?

127
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,960
And it's like, oh, I've never heard a suggestion of like, perhaps you would have more fun if

128
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,480
you went next door.

129
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
Go away.

130
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,640
Welcome everyone.

131
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,520
Now unwelcome.

132
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,520
Don't come in.

133
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,280
Yeah, that set the tone.

134
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
It set the tone.

135
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,280
But you know what?

136
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
You know what was good?

137
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
Because it helped us focus.

138
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,920
It helped us focus and go have one of the worst lunches we've ever had in our lives.

139
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,880
And I'm not going to reveal the place.

140
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:14,920
It is surprising, but at least half the table was like hand in head bent over.

141
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,680
Like, oh no.

142
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,040
And it only got worse from there.

143
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,600
The night ended with me cackling joker-esque to myself.

144
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,600
I was at a little bar where the bartender asked me, do you need some water?

145
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,200
In a way where he seemed really worried.

146
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,320
But we're not going to reveal all of this yet.

147
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,840
The official, here's the timelines of the listeners here at 2.

148
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,520
Here's what we're committing to.

149
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,960
Q1 2024.

150
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,120
This series will be released.

151
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
We can't wait to do it.

152
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,320
And it's been such a blast being here and doing it and meeting a lot of great Orlando

153
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,320
folks.

154
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,000
And look, we're crazy, but we're not that crazy.

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,200
We had to slot in some time for some other stuff, which is the topic of tonight's show.

156
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,880
You know, we could do one of these fly by night new attractions that everyone is abuzz

157
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,000
about.

158
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,120
One of these trendy things that people are interested right now.

159
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,720
Will they be in decades?

160
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,800
Who knows?

161
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,000
These fancy coasters and what have you.

162
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Actually, wait.

163
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,400
So the hat.

164
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,280
I lost my hat on the Guardians coaster two days ago.

165
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,440
And I'll probably retell this whenever we talk about it on an episode.

166
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,600
Well, you're not one to retell stories.

167
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,440
Well, when the stories are so good, you have to repeat them.

168
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
I lost my hat.

169
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
I was wearing it.

170
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
I forgot I was wearing it.

171
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,840
The employee was like, I go, oh, sorry, I lost my hat on the ride.

172
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,400
How do I see if somebody can find it?

173
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:54,600
And he goes, did they tell you to take it off?

174
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,280
And I go, oh, I didn't.

175
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,120
If they did, I didn't hear it.

176
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,680
I just kind of forgot I was wearing it or whatever.

177
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,760
Well, they probably told you to take it off.

178
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,200
I go, yeah, maybe.

179
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
I don't know.

180
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,480
And he goes, I need a big sigh.

181
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,920
And I go, I'm not mad.

182
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,360
I'm not yelling at you about it.

183
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,840
And he goes, well, maybe.

184
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,600
I don't even remember how to resolve.

185
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,040
He was just like, maybe they'll find it.

186
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,040
I don't know.

187
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,200
And then I found somebody else and they go, oh, just go to Lost and Found.

188
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,600
So kind of a come down from an incredibly exciting roller coaster with great music into

189
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,320
a harsh customer service interaction.

190
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,720
He was mad at me.

191
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,920
It did not result in you getting your hat.

192
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,240
He made me feel, yes.

193
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,520
At that point, what has happened since, Mike?

194
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,720
I got an email.

195
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
They found the hat.

196
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:00,040
So I'm going to Disney Springs tomorrow to pick up my hat.

197
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,720
Yes.

198
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,080
Get that hat.

199
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,600
Get that hat.

200
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
Get that hat.

201
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
Get that hat.

202
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,640
Get that hat.

203
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,360
And here's the thing.

204
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,400
And somebody pointed this out to me and I'll talk about it later.

205
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:22,240
That hat now has sort of had like a walk off on a ride.

206
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,000
So now that I'm going to be wearing the hat going forward, I will know this hat has been

207
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,080
in the bowels of Guardians' coaster, which is pretty sweet.

208
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,560
Will I share that with any normal human?

209
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,400
We'll see.

210
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,000
This hat touched a floor.

211
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But what a floor.

212
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,280
Yes, no ordinary floor.

213
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,520
A special floor.

214
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,240
So what are we talking about?

215
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,240
What is tonight's entertainment?

216
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,400
What we're talking about is a tradition.

217
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,520
It is an Epcot tradition.

218
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,400
It is a tradition that we've never covered on the show.

219
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
It is very special.

220
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,560
It is very rare.

221
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:11,680
It only runs for one third out of the entire year, every year.

222
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:18,240
It appeals to our love of treats, our love of adult libations.

223
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,240
And what we are talking about this evening is the Epcot International Food and Wine Festival.

224
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,240
Yeah.

225
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:31,000
I heard a good yeah from the audience.

226
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,520
Which we have now been to twice.

227
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,360
It was going when we were here in 2019 too.

228
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
Uh-huh.

229
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
Yes.

230
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,000
And two years ago for a bachelor party.

231
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,960
I'm representing the bachelor party right now.

232
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,520
Cool bachelor party Epcot retro shirt.

233
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,520
I love it.

234
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,520
I'm getting addicted.

235
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,480
It's got to be at least every two years.

236
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,880
I have to leave my young son to go drink wine in a fake Morocco.

237
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,760
I absolutely must.

238
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,360
It's been a tradition since 1996.

239
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
And that's the only fact I know about it.

240
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,440
The research over, the end.

241
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,600
But here's one thing.

242
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,440
You don't have to research to know this.

243
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,920
The best way to do the Epcot Food and Wine Festival is to get a big group together.

244
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,440
You know, you want a big rowdy, hard drinking, hard snacking crew.

245
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
Yeah.

246
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,440
Right?

247
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,520
And we got the three of us.

248
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
That's something.

249
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,520
That's a start.

250
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,760
And we did grow it from there.

251
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,160
And luckily we did grow it from there.

252
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,480
Of course, Jason's girlfriend Jane is here.

253
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,480
Give it up for Jane.

254
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
Where's Jane?

255
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
Yeah.

256
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
She's here.

257
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,800
Happy Jane Clare was with us.

258
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,240
We made new friends as we went.

259
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
Taylor's Taylor.

260
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,240
Hey Taylor.

261
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
Great to meet you, Taylor.

262
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
Kevin.

263
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
Where's Kevin?

264
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,240
Yeah, yeah.

265
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,240
Hey, good to see you.

266
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
Thanks for making it.

267
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,920
Kevin from Telethon who loves Epcot and Tomorrowland music loops as much as I do.

268
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,280
So we're, you know, we're meeting people.

269
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,960
We're making new friends, but we still, we wanted more.

270
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,800
What we thought is there, is there somebody who we really love who's been on the show

271
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,480
before who could join our big Epcot drinking posse?

272
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,120
And we started running through friends of the show who live in the Orlando area.

273
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,440
Matt Cardona, the wrestler we discussed.

274
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,280
Who helped us find this venue, brought us to Tin Roof.

275
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
Thank you, Matt.

276
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,840
Hashtag thank you, Matt.

277
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,840
Where's Matt?

278
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,280
Matt is wrestling in Japan tonight.

279
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,880
Shoot, shoot.

280
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:40,200
We thought of podcaster and founder of theme park planning site touring plans, the great

281
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
Len Testa.

282
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,680
That is someone we checked in with.

283
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,320
He's in the area.

284
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,080
Why can't Len Testa be here?

285
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,480
He's also wrestling in Japan.

286
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,520
Just kidding.

287
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:00,920
He's giving some sort of a theme park based talk at MIT with Jim Hill.

288
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
Wow.

289
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,360
MIT Tin Roof.

290
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,680
MIT Tin Roof.

291
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,040
I think we're having some fun, right?

292
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,920
So we're distraught.

293
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,920
We don't know what to do.

294
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,280
And luckily a friend of the show stepped up and said, well, I'm in the area.

295
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,680
And by that I mean the East Coast of America.

296
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,960
I'm practically next door in New York City.

297
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,160
I will pop down.

298
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,200
That's the kind of baller move that makes you want to bump a guy up from being just

299
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,600
an accidental PTR legend.

300
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Ladies and gentlemen, from Blake Check, it's Griffin Newman.

301
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
Yeah.

302
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Wow.

303
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Yes.

304
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Wow.

305
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:01,000
I really appreciate you guys introducing me with the names of guests who would have been

306
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,520
more exciting.

307
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,080
I love a good anticlimactic windup.

308
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,240
No, no.

309
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,600
We built it up for distance wise.

310
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,960
You traveled the nation to be here.

311
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
It's so exciting.

312
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,680
We were just saying you didn't have anything going on.

313
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,680
Yeah.

314
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
Yeah.

315
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,680
Who's not booking?

316
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,680
I guess none of us have been.

317
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,680
It's true.

318
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:28,280
You either just got to become a data scientist or enter the squared circle and just start

319
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,480
getting tossed around a little.

320
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,480
You know?

321
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,240
I've always been stuck between those two poles.

322
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,120
Hard science and physical competition.

323
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,120
And I exist in this weird nebulous middle space.

324
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,320
Well, we'll help you out.

325
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,560
I'll hit you with a chair in the back when we're wrapping up.

326
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,560
Thank you.

327
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,720
I don't know how much it's going to continue to be relitigated across the show or if I

328
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,720
should just butt in with my Rashomon perspective now.

329
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,280
But Mike and I were sharing a row at Cosmic Rewind.

330
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
Yes.

331
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,280
Oh, no.

332
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,280
Add your perspective for sure.

333
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,280
Okay.

334
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,280
You have an interesting one.

335
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,840
So when he stepped off the ride and said, hey, I'm sorry, my hat flew off.

336
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,920
Do people, do they collect objects?

337
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,840
His line was, let me ask you a question.

338
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:21,520
Did someone tell you to take your hat off?

339
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,440
Like he said it with that scolding energy.

340
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,440
Yeah.

341
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,160
To which Mike said, no, I don't think anyone did.

342
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,860
And when that conversation is done, he walks over to me and says, I'm not wrong, right?

343
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,840
They didn't tell us to take our hats off because I was wearing a hat.

344
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,260
And I said, Mike, a woman leaned over to me very quietly, not a secret, but just it wasn't

345
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:51,580
serious pronouncement and said, you may want to hold onto your hat, which is very different

346
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,660
from you must take your hat off.

347
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,660
Yeah.

348
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,660
Indeed.

349
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:02,580
And to just rewind a little further, Cosmic Rewind a little further, the ride starts,

350
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:08,540
we're launched, 10 seconds in, everyone else is screaming, and I just hear Mike go, well,

351
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,780
I lost my hat.

352
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:19,700
And I look over and he's just full speed going.

353
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,420
And then at that moment, the words rung in my head, I held onto my hat for the rest of

354
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,740
the ride and I made it through.

355
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,740
Okay.

356
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,740
So because I lost my hat, did you give an extra tug or grab your hat?

357
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,180
The bravery of your hat saved my hat.

358
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,180
All right.

359
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,180
Wow.

360
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,180
Let's all thank his hat.

361
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,180
Yeah.

362
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,180
Thank you, hat.

363
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,820
Thank the hat.

364
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:44,660
I put my hat in the little pouch.

365
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,660
Like a good boy.

366
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,180
Like a good boy and a game back safe and sound.

367
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:54,860
It's also nice to know, I mean, it's clearly from you being here and for the listener that

368
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:03,820
you did not then also lose your Mickey ears and the ears, there's something specific,

369
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,020
a character I haven't seen on merchandise before.

370
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:12,700
A character that one could say has been almost willfully under merchandise.

371
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,140
As if despite someone who actively wants merch very badly.

372
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,260
These are part of the Disney 100 celebration in which they're doing a lot of merch from

373
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,340
the different eras of the Disney company.

374
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:29,580
Some of the most beloved films, films that have perfect Rotten Tomatoes scores and definitely

375
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,300
permanence on the culture.

376
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:41,380
And they put out a series of commemorative ears, including this pair of Pip the Chipmunk.

377
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,860
Pip the Chipmunk.

378
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:51,860
They are technically, technically ears from enchanted and not disenchanted.

379
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:56,940
But let's all agree to not think about that.

380
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:03,780
You know, if Pip had, I know some of those Epcot wine glasses are a little bit small,

381
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,500
they're kind of sample size, but it'd be a lot for him.

382
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,740
If Pip got drunk on a bunch of Chardonnay, what do you think he'd say?

383
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:17,500
Jumping jelly beans, I'm sloshed.

384
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Love that.

385
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,220
He didn't know Pip would be a guest tonight.

386
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,620
Well, so, you know, we got a crew now.

387
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,020
We got a good crew for drinking around the world.

388
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,020
We got friends.

389
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,460
We got Chipmunks.

390
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,900
The crew is built up.

391
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,980
Can I say it?

392
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,460
I don't want to be self-deprecating here on stage.

393
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,460
I don't want to bring the mood down.

394
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,500
I'm a guest.

395
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,020
You brought me out.

396
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,460
Polite applause, perfunctory applause.

397
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,100
I'm not a special guest.

398
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,700
You know, I've been on the show before.

399
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,860
I was here on the early show.

400
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,940
Me joining the crew, it's not breaking news.

401
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,980
It's not anything that's going to move the needle, right?

402
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,780
This is far too much.

403
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,820
No, Scott, hear him out.

404
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,820
What else don't you like about yourself?

405
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:16,620
I think it's a bummer that we have here an empty chair and a mic that's going to go unused,

406
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,060
and I'm the best guest that will come out tonight, and that sucks for everyone in the

407
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,940
crowd, and I'm sorry.

408
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,820
I apologize.

409
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,820
You're right.

410
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,100
So let's start in India.

411
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,940
We had some samosas, and we...

412
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,940
No, no, no, no.

413
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,100
Griffin, I have a plan.

414
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,420
We have a plan.

415
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,420
We kept going.

416
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,260
We had to flesh out this Epcot drink and crew correctly.

417
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,260
We wanted to...

418
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,940
Okay, we're thinking only people who've been on the show before.

419
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,980
Is there somebody who hasn't been on the show?

420
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,460
Somebody who can bring some true Orlando flavor?

421
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,220
Somebody who loves Epcot and the food and wine fest?

422
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,980
Maybe if we reached out to this person cold, he might join us.

423
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,340
And now I turn to Mike to tell you who that person is.

424
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,580
So I thought about it.

425
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,780
Who would be an expert at this?

426
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:07,740
Who does this and maybe documents it and shows things?

427
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,060
And I said, well, maybe I have an idea.

428
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,820
And I reached out and I said, sir, would you be interested in coming on the podcast when

429
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,300
we're going to be in Orlando?

430
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,380
And it was one of the most magical moments I remember.

431
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,420
I showed it to the family.

432
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,900
I was with my family because we watch his videos.

433
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,700
And he said, yes.

434
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:35,700
He was with us at Epcot and he's here tonight, ladies and gentlemen, from the YouTube channel

435
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,660
Paging Mr. Morrow.

436
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,860
We just call him Nate.

437
00:22:46,300 --> 00:23:02,380
Center.

438
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,260
We got you the center.

439
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,660
Nate, hello.

440
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,660
Hello.

441
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,260
Hi.

442
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,260
Wow.

443
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,180
Hi, guys.

444
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,020
Welcome to Podcast the Ride.

445
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,260
It's so great to see you here.

446
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:14,660
Geez.

447
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,180
Finally.

448
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,260
Excited.

449
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,660
So, yeah, if you're not familiar with Nate, he does a channel where he goes around to

450
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,180
the parks, Disney parks.

451
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,140
But now lately he's been going to England.

452
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,860
He's been going to Comic-Cons.

453
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,380
His channel is one of my favorite TV shows, I guess.

454
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:34,220
It's like The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, and then Paging Mr. Morrow.

455
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,900
Paging Mr. Morrow, yeah.

456
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:40,140
And yeah, we've been talking about him on the show here and there.

457
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:46,740
It's just like your videos are so nice and pleasant and you take us through places we

458
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:52,820
wish we could go more often, like Polynesian Resort, Epcot Center, and then you'll go to

459
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,420
Disney Springs and show us the new cookie at Gideon's.

460
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:00,260
And as I was telling you backstage, when I see a thumbnail when you've got the new cookie,

461
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,220
I go, we're watching this now.

462
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,900
I put that up on the screen.

463
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:09,100
I make my whole family watch it and they're like, oh, that does seem like a good cookie.

464
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,780
So thank you for being here.

465
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,780
We're very excited.

466
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,780
Wow, I'm excited.

467
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:17,940
I've never done a live podcast before.

468
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:23,060
I actually think I've only done like five podcasts in my life.

469
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:29,780
You were telling me that you did a podcast hosted by professional wrestler, D-Von Dudley.

470
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,500
I did, yeah.

471
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,620
I did D-Von Dudley's podcast.

472
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,900
Which I was like, I didn't know we had a podcast.

473
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:43,500
But this is my intersection of like you and one of my favorite wrestlers when I was a child.

474
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:49,260
So I haven't watched it yet because we've been doing so much City Walk, but I will get to it.

475
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:53,100
And I will watch it faster than I will promise to watch Yellowstone.

476
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:59,500
And similar to what D-Von became known for, we will put Griffin through a table at the

477
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,500
end of the show.

478
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,500
That's right.

479
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,180
Sit by a chair thrown through a table.

480
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:11,060
You've also been like, I'm almost like, as we're heading here, like, wait, he's going to

481
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,580
deign to do our little thing.

482
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,820
You're hanging out with superstars.

483
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,660
You're hanging out with Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul.

484
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,660
Yes.

485
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,660
At Epcot.

486
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,900
Has any of you guys, people saw this video?

487
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,580
Can you explain how that came together?

488
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,580
This is a bizarre thing.

489
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,300
Yeah, that was, that was close.

490
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,980
That was two weeks ago.

491
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,140
We were at La Cava inside Epcot.

492
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,140
Of course.

493
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,180
And we were going to an event later on that night where Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston were

494
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,500
like doing like a tequila tour.

495
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,220
Yeah, because they have their own tequila.

496
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,540
Yeah, they were going to Frontera, Cocina, and Disney Springs.

497
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:50,100
And then they had like other stops like Waldorf Astoria.

498
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,220
And we were like, oh, let's go to Epcot.

499
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,220
I started my day.

500
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,220
I wanted to go check Moana.

501
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:58,180
And then we went to La Cava, me and my friend, Sean.

502
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,540
And I was like, I bet you they would come here.

503
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,140
If I was somebody, I would want to go.

504
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,180
If you're a tequila company, you got to go to La Cava at Epcot, Mexico.

505
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,180
You know what I mean?

506
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,180
Yeah.

507
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,540
And they just randomly showed up.

508
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,340
And it was all like just regular people there.

509
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,540
Like it was like no special event.

510
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,340
They just came in and just started making drinks for everyone.

511
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,340
And like it was great.

512
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,620
And we became friends.

513
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,180
It was insane.

514
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,900
Like we were talking and yeah.

515
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,420
And oh, my friend Sean.

516
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,220
He was like, oh, he told Aaron Paul, he's like, what have you done at Epcot?

517
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,220
And he's like, nothing.

518
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,300
I just walked in here and he's never done anything at Epcot.

519
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,580
And he was like, what do I do?

520
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,500
And he was like, guardians.

521
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,220
And yeah, I got to do guardians.

522
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,940
So somehow we ended up going on guardians with them.

523
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,140
Yeah, it was great.

524
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,900
Geez.

525
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,260
Wow.

526
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:55,780
Now, cynical me, I'm thinking, well, this must be some planned photo op situation

527
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:01,380
rather than what actually happened, which is an organic theme park friendship brewing,

528
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:07,180
leading to then a mass roller coaster ride with great cool actors.

529
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:07,980
This is great.

530
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,580
I think we got to hang out with Nate for a couple hours.

531
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:15,980
And there's some pixie dust trailing off you, I think, in the parks.

532
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:21,820
I feel like because everybody, you get stopped so often, so much more often than we do.

533
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,260
Much more often than we do.

534
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:29,580
And besides that, then you just, if it's not people recognizing you from videos, it's your friends.

535
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,260
You're just like, you're the, you're, I hate to say it, Jason, you're the mayor.

536
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,460
I think you're the mayor of Disney World.

537
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,500
Oh, that's OK.

538
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:42,300
Hey, yesterday I met the mayor of Port of Ventry at Islands and she whisked me well.

539
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,300
Yeah.

540
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,580
Nate, can I ask you a question?

541
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:54,220
Speaking of all the friends you make every step you take in the Walt Disney World Resort,

542
00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:00,380
Cranston and Paul, I think their celebrity tequila has been very popular.

543
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,580
It seems to have been a successful launch.

544
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:07,060
It's a growing sector of the industry, these celebrity tequilas.

545
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,820
Many people think the trend was really kick-started by Casamigos.

546
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,900
Have you heard the story of George Clooney and the briefcases?

547
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,900
No.

548
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,660
Mike, do you know this story?

549
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,980
Well, I do know the story, but I think it would be better if Jason told it.

550
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,580
Jason, do you know this story?

551
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,580
Well, if you want to help me out, we can...

552
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,580
Have you heard this story?

553
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,580
All right, I'll help you out.

554
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,580
I'll chime in.

555
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,580
I'll chime in.

556
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,580
So...

557
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,300
Hating this like the Dudley Boys.

558
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:40,420
George Clooney and Randy Gerber, and Randy Gerber is spelled with an E at the end, not

559
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,420
a Y.

560
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:45,900
Husband of Cindy Crawford, father of Kaia Gerber, star of Bottoms.

561
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,980
And they're friends.

562
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:52,260
And they just sort of were hanging out in Mexico one day, and they created...

563
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,940
Scott's chugging his beer while I'm telling this.

564
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,940
For fun, the way you do when you're hanging out.

565
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:01,540
They created a tequila for fun, and they weren't expecting to market it.

566
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,540
And then one day...

567
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:06,260
All right, long story short...

568
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,820
I don't ever do that.

569
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,820
Probably a mistake.

570
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,820
Oh, yeah.

571
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,820
You got to resort to something.

572
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,820
Anyway, continue, fellas.

573
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,220
If you're drinking Casamigos, you actually want to do the opposite.

574
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,020
You want to sip on it because it's very smooth, you know?

575
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,260
It's a sipping liquor.

576
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,580
Long story short, they sold the company, and George got all his friends together, and he

577
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,460
put a briefcase on the table in front of each of them.

578
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,220
Some of his oldest friends, friends who aren't movie stars.

579
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,220
Guys he goes way back with.

580
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,220
Regular people and production people, you know?

581
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,980
People who knew early on in the rough years, you know?

582
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,740
Lowly execs and directors and sort of, yeah, common folks.

583
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,420
So each briefcase contained a million dollars.

584
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:50,820
And he said, this is for all of you for sticking with me over all these years.

585
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,860
And he said, you all have to take it.

586
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,020
If one of you says no, then nobody gets it.

587
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,500
And also taxes have been paid, so don't worry about that.

588
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
And they all took it.

589
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,500
And they all took it.

590
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,420
And he helped out his buddies.

591
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:07,620
And the reason everyone is reacting like this is because Scott feels we tell this story

592
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,020
too often on the show.

593
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,300
Yeah, now that you've heard that story, do you think that that should be told in full

594
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,460
in, you know, 18 episodes of a podcast?

595
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,580
Does that seem valid?

596
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,180
I feel like I'm going to tell this story to somebody else.

597
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:27,060
It sounds like it was a pretty good story.

598
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,060
It's a pretty good story.

599
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:35,100
Much in the way that Casamigos is best sipped slowly, that story lingers the more time you

600
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,100
spend with it.

601
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,100
It grows.

602
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:42,460
It swishes around a glass that is the podcast.

603
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,140
Let me tell you one more thing, Nate.

604
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:49,300
I am also, I'm a little nervous that you're here in a way.

605
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,300
And I'll tell you why.

606
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,540
And I think Jason should be too.

607
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:58,980
Because I think that Mike would dropkick us in a second to have you as his new co-host

608
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,300
on Podcast the Ride.

609
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,300
This could be the moment where the change out happens.

610
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,140
This might be a Machiavellian scheme in play.

611
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,300
I'm a little worried, but I don't know.

612
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,100
I might be reading into that too much.

613
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,100
Oh, no, no.

614
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,100
I don't think so.

615
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,100
I'm scared now.

616
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,100
I don't even know what to say.

617
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,100
I'm like, I think you're good.

618
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,100
You think I'm safe?

619
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,100
Can I calm down?

620
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,100
Okay, okay.

621
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,100
I'll let that anxiety go.

622
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,580
As my jug of beer kicks in, I think I'll stop worrying about it.

623
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,380
Well, that's great because I really don't want to go back to riding the rails with a

624
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,820
Bindle.

625
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,460
You're safe for now.

626
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:40,980
But in the future, if both of you have some opinions I don't care for about a new Aerosmith

627
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:47,140
song or an old Aerosmith song, then maybe I will reconsider.

628
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:53,020
But for now, I think the core three, the Holy Trinity as I call it, are safe for now.

629
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,020
Yeah, safe.

630
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,860
I'm sad that you didn't get to ride Aerosmith the other night.

631
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,860
You didn't?

632
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,860
No, you didn't.

633
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,860
Oh, yeah.

634
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,860
Oh, you're sad for Mike.

635
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,860
Yeah, the timing didn't quite work out.

636
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,700
Mike was hoping for last minute jaunt to see the bad boys from Boston themselves.

637
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,300
Yeah, I don't think it's going to happen on this trip, sadly.

638
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,860
But instead you had to hang out with old and new friends.

639
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:18,100
Yes, well that was, we hung out at Abracadabra, which is pretty good.

640
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,100
Very good, I would say.

641
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,100
Oh, yeah.

642
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,100
That was...

643
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:28,340
And we went to Jelly Rolls.

644
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:32,340
I'm still sad there were no Bare Naked Ladies.

645
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,340
We put in...

646
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:40,580
We were trying to get someone on the piano to play a Bare Naked Ladies song.

647
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,140
Mike, say what was written on the napkin.

648
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,140
What was it?

649
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,780
Did Kevin write it?

650
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,780
Kevin...

651
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,620
I think, Wade, I think I know.

652
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,620
You texted me about it.

653
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:54,980
It was any Bare Naked Ladies song besides One Week.

654
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,660
Right?

655
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,060
Trying for deep cuts, trying for deep cuts.

656
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,340
You were looking for If I Had a Million Dollars.

657
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,340
That would have been fine.

658
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,340
That would have been good.

659
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,340
Yeah, that would have been good.

660
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,340
Yeah, well I know that.

661
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,840
That must have been hard for you to be at a dueling piano bar and not hear Bare Naked

662
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:16,900
Ladies because it had been two entire nights since we were at a different dueling piano

663
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,740
bar and heard Bare Naked Ladies.

664
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:27,780
Where the same where it was One Week and then Mike said, deeper, rarer.

665
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,500
And they did it.

666
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,500
That's a little City Walk Saga preview.

667
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,500
That's a Pat O'Brien's thing.

668
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,380
I would love to finish that story, but you're going to have to wait for the episode.

669
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,180
Boys, boys, not now.

670
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,180
Save it.

671
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,180
Yeah, well, you know, why not?

672
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,020
I'd like, you know, look, we'll jump around.

673
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,940
That was where the night ended food and wine wise.

674
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:56,500
But what a good capper to go to the magic themed bar at the at the Boardwalk Hotel and

675
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:05,420
then go to the dueling piano bar where admittedly after all day drinking around the world and

676
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:11,280
a bunch of magic themed drinks, then I walked up to that door and heard a very loud version

677
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:17,900
of American Girl on piano and I heard someone say $20, please.

678
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,100
And I said, good night, everybody.

679
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:29,220
And I went and instead stared wistfully at the swan and dolphin.

680
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,460
I leave and go do it right now.

681
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,740
Now that beer's kicking in.

682
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,060
Sorry, everybody.

683
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,380
Good night, everybody.

684
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:43,900
Now when I hear what one might call even an obnoxious version of American Girl, I have

685
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,780
the opposite reaction.

686
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,820
I need to hang out here.

687
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,900
And that's what I did.

688
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,420
You sprint in that direction as all of you did, as Griffin did.

689
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,660
And then what happened?

690
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,260
Everyone followed me except Scott.

691
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,220
And I feel like there was a moment when you were like, what the fuck?

692
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,220
What are you all doing?

693
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,020
No, no.

694
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,580
So we're we're walking down the Boardwalk.

695
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,340
I think the night is over.

696
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,620
We're just going to let Mike go to Jelly Roll alone.

697
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,600
And you say, I really don't want to do this.

698
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,460
And I go, Scott, I agree.

699
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:22,060
Every step I get closer to Jelly Roll, the louder the speakers are, the less I want to

700
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,060
go inside.

701
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,060
Yes.

702
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,060
I'm with you.

703
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,060
You understood.

704
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,060
Let's order a lift.

705
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,860
And then American Girl kicked in and I went smell you later, motherfucker.

706
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,700
Siren song, I'm in.

707
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:38,020
So we kept texting you at every song that played to try to convince you that you were

708
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,700
missing out on something.

709
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:46,940
I sent you a text and I said, Scott, this place fucking rocks.

710
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,740
All caps.

711
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,900
You said, I'm thrilled with my choice.

712
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,900
Thrilled.

713
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,660
I said, Scott, they're performing the I'm Just Ken song now.

714
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,700
You said, I've never been more confident in a decision.

715
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,180
Number one, this.

716
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,580
Number two, marrying Aaron.

717
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,420
And just.

718
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,220
I threw my wife under the bus.

719
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,380
I'm my wife taking care of my son.

720
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,940
I'm sorry, Aaron.

721
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,740
I miss you so much.

722
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:26,820
And I've never missed you more than being outside of that tooling piano bar.

723
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:32,660
Your next text was a photo of your hand holding a twenty dollar bill.

724
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:37,900
And you said, just admiring this twenty dollars I still have.

725
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,900
I still got it.

726
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,900
I still got it, I think.

727
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,700
I didn't spend it on anything.

728
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,780
We did get free popcorn, though.

729
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,780
You missed out on the popcorn.

730
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,780
Damn, Nate.

731
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,300
Was there a little, you said there was some sriracha in it?

732
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,460
Buffalo, yeah, they put buffalo sauce in the popcorn.

733
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,460
And it's free.

734
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,100
It's not even normal popcorn.

735
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,100
You got to kick up.

736
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,500
All right, a little jealousy brewing now.

737
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:07,380
And just some perspective, I was in bed and I went, what are all these text messages I'm

738
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,100
getting?

739
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,100
What is going on?

740
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,980
What is this twenty dollar bill?

741
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:18,140
Well, the last two were Mike text, they're doing Can You Picture That from the Muppet

742
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:22,860
movie and Griffin is going wild.

743
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,340
Which I was.

744
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,340
Which I was.

745
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,340
Not alive.

746
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,340
But you put a request in.

747
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,340
What was your request?

748
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:32,340
My request was Paradise by the Dashboard Light from Meatloaf because I wanted to see if they

749
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:37,780
would do, I wanted to test if they'd do the baseball section, if they would do the talking

750
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,780
part.

751
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,280
I love that song.

752
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:45,880
The guys started playing American Pie by Don McLean, which is a long song.

753
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,760
And I said, I whispered, I don't know if it was to Kevin, I whispered to somebody, I go,

754
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,440
these people know the crowd.

755
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,640
They ain't doing this whole song.

756
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,840
And I was absolutely right.

757
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,840
They did two verses, moved right on.

758
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,480
So yeah, they would probably not do that section is what I'm saying.

759
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:07,640
What did freaking out mean when some piano people are playing an Electric Mayhem song?

760
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,560
You know how Mike, it's there, it's there.

761
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,560
Oh Muppet Arm.

762
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,320
He like flops his arms around the way they do.

763
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,680
Let's all freak out at once.

764
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:23,280
Oh great audio content, great audio stuff.

765
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,960
You know how when Mike hears a song he loves at a bar, he points up with one finger?

766
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,960
Oh I know.

767
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,640
Oh I know.

768
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,720
When they started playing Can You Picture That, I did two fingers.

769
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,560
When Mike texted you, he's going wild.

770
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,560
You were going wild.

771
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,560
I was going wild.

772
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,840
See Nate's right, he was going wild.

773
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:47,060
And your response by the way Scott was, that's cool, I will give them that.

774
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,640
That was the first one, that was the first one I got.

775
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,840
I love that you got two electrics, you got Electric Mayhem and you got Electric Light

776
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,840
Orchestra.

777
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,840
Now we're talking.

778
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,800
I like electric bands apparently.

779
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:06,040
Nate, what do you, I also, look, I want to call you Mr. Morrow in full, so badly.

780
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,040
Is that okay?

781
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,600
Yeah, you can call me Nate, Mr. Morrow.

782
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,160
I don't want to say the...

783
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
Hello Mr. Morrow.

784
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,560
It's just so fun to say.

785
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,200
Here I'll just do it once.

786
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,200
Mr. Morrow.

787
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,200
Mr. Morrow.

788
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,480
He makes people happy too.

789
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,900
What do you want to hear at Jelly Rolls?

790
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,800
What makes you freak out Griffin style?

791
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,280
Oh my, you know, I get excited.

792
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,400
We've been trying to get them to do Manor Muppet, that was one for a while.

793
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
I like Manor Muppet.

794
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Yeah, that's a good one.

795
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,400
Oscar winning.

796
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,400
Yeah.

797
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,080
I like every once in a while when they get all on stage and they do like the Rocky Horror

798
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,640
Picture Show, you know what I mean?

799
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,640
Oh they did it then.

800
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640
Yeah, like they, you know what I mean?

801
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,640
The Time Warp.

802
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,640
They did the Time Warp.

803
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,600
Because they add more elements than just the two pianos.

804
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,520
Like they have like two singers, dancers, they get up on top of the bar.

805
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,520
They beat box, they go.

806
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,520
They do.

807
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,520
Yeah.

808
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,880
And it kind of catches the off guard.

809
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,880
But I like that.

810
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:04,840
I like good feel music where everyone's singing along and they're dancing.

811
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,640
You just reminded me, I don't even know if we told Scott that two white men on piano

812
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,080
performed Baby Got Back by Sir Mix-a-Lot.

813
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,080
That did happen.

814
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,080
That happened.

815
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,080
That did happen.

816
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,080
Thrilled.

817
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,480
Thrilled with my decision.

818
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,600
I changed nothing about the text exchange.

819
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,960
Let's talk a little food and wine to make sure that we do the topic in the topic.

820
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,360
And I really, you know what's funny is we landed on this and especially with Griffin's

821
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,760
help he was encouraging this.

822
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,240
And before we put it together that oh my god this is a great topic for Nate.

823
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,520
You must, first of all you must have been at food and wine this year tons of times,

824
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,520
right?

825
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,520
I'd imagine.

826
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,520
Oh yeah.

827
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,520
At least a couple times.

828
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,520
It's so long.

829
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,520
It really, I know.

830
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,800
And then doing that math, like how come I've been here so many times and one was in July

831
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,040
and the others were in November?

832
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,680
How is that all one thing?

833
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,720
It's so long.

834
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,960
I know but you know what they keep on releasing food like throughout the week so they don't

835
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,920
put out all the new food at once.

836
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:11,600
Oh so there's new food in the first month or in the last one.

837
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,000
Yeah and even boots, like some of the boots open up like later on.

838
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,840
I think they had just some boots open up like less than a month ago.

839
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,840
Brand new ones.

840
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:25,520
Do they announce, like do they say oh in two weeks we're going to have a new sushi roll?

841
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,520
Oh yeah they're announced.

842
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:31,600
Yeah and then one of the boots like they'll give you the times, it's all on the passport.

843
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,480
Okay so you have to go in to do it.

844
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,080
Are you, do you research the new booth before you go or you just kind of let it fly when

845
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,080
you're doing your videos?

846
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,840
Oh no I just go and say yeah I usually just pick one thing.

847
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,840
No I think that's a good idea.

848
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,440
Sometimes yeah you just go with it.

849
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,200
Yeah no I think that's a good strategy.

850
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,360
I don't want to, there's something that I don't want to go too far without doing because

851
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:59,600
again I did all that build up, we got to build up our drinking around the world crew.

852
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:04,400
But now we're sitting here and we don't feel like a crew to me.

853
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,920
I mean we're all friends, we're getting along but there's something that we're missing.

854
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,800
Shirts.

855
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,840
We're missing the shirts.

856
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,400
This is something that I don't think I was fully aware of.

857
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,160
I think our friend Doug Jones made us aware of this, shout out to Doug.

858
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,600
He I think turned us on to that like okay look around when you're at food and wine.

859
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:31,160
But there are these shirts that are so nuts that are all combining Disney and classic

860
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,920
Disney songs and all this stuff into these wine puns.

861
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,360
I wrote down a few just real ones.

862
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,680
Like there's a Finding Nemo one that's just keep drinking.

863
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:49,720
There's one with Vanilla Pea from Wreck-It Ralph that says drink up glitches.

864
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,120
I've seen a couple of shirts.

865
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:00,760
Do any come to mind, do you recall any like oh that was a crazy one or a funny one or

866
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,280
no pressure?

867
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:11,360
Pretty early in the day I would say like noon or before that we stepped into a restroom

868
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:18,480
and there was a pretty large burly man who looked black out drunk.

869
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:24,240
He had an arm rested against the urinal and his body was like four feet away and he was

870
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:31,160
pissing and he was moaning to himself and he was wearing a shirt that said drinking

871
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:38,160
around the world checklist and when he finished and like wobbled out eyes half closed I followed

872
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,320
after him and there was another guy who looked exactly like him with the same shirt who grabbed

873
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:50,320
him by the shoulders and went man up, man up, we have two countries left, pull it together,

874
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,760
pull it together.

875
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,840
They were going to make it.

876
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,480
They were going to make it.

877
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,560
And they were going to make it before 1pm.

878
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,880
Wow, wow.

879
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,840
Man up.

880
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,360
It's very funny that you have a story like that because at the end of the night, I close

881
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:16,120
out the end of the night by going to the France ice cream parlor to get the scoop of ice cream

882
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,720
pressed into a brioche bun.

883
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,880
Oh I'm so excited to see what flavors you got.

884
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:34,520
And while I was in line, there was like a family, they all had champagne flutes.

885
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:40,240
The park is about to close in three minutes and they were still going strong and the one

886
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:47,240
guy is just telling a story about like oh him and his wife, they went to a wedding and

887
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:54,680
this guy came up and put his arm around the wife and was like oh I want to introduce you

888
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,920
to some people and this guy starts telling the story and he's like and that's my fucking

889
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,800
wife and you don't do that.

890
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:09,160
He starts saying like so I don't want to see Jason for months after that.

891
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,920
If I saw Jason, I was going to beat the shit out of him.

892
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:19,920
I was going to fucking kill Jason and I am standing three feet away going like I know

893
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:27,240
this isn't about me but I just want to get this ice cream and get away from this guy

894
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:32,480
because he is just like foaming out the map and she is just standing next to him like

895
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,120
smiling and laughing like yeah I'm into this.

896
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:42,640
I love this story of loudly cursing an Epcot center.

897
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,400
Nate asked what flavor?

898
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,400
Oh yeah.

899
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,800
Salted caramel ice cream and chocolate sauce.

900
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,240
I feel that's good.

901
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,200
It was a good combo.

902
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,200
Have you had that Nate?

903
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,560
Oh yeah I always mix up the flavors in there.

904
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,560
You can get crazy.

905
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,560
What's your preference?

906
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,560
What's your number one?

907
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,560
I like it pistachio or raspberry.

908
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,560
Oh that sounds good.

909
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,560
Pistachio or raspberry.

910
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,560
That's it.

911
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,560
Yeah.

912
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,560
And then a little sandwich.

913
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,560
Oh it's really nice.

914
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,560
Handmade ice cream sandwiches.

915
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,560
Wow.

916
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,560
Yeah.

917
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,560
Wow.

918
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,560
Wait and that's all year round too.

919
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,560
That's not festive.

920
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,480
That's year round.

921
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,480
Okay.

922
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:23,240
What I was saying I think that you know all of us in our individual shirts Jason and his

923
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,240
what is your shirt Jason?

924
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,800
Jane found this on Depop.

925
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:37,640
This is what does it say the Mickey it's like dress for success and it's Mickey wearing

926
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:46,960
like five layers of bespoke clothing and it's telling you it points at every piece of clothing

927
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,440
and it must be like thousands of dollars of stuff.

928
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:58,960
I have no idea why they were selling a shirt of Mickey in like Savile Robe Finery.

929
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,840
Has anyone ever seen that image before?

930
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,840
I guess not.

931
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,840
It's very indie.

932
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,840
I love it.

933
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,040
It's for success.

934
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,040
It reminds me of Michael Eisner.

935
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,040
Wow.

936
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,040
Right on.

937
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,040
Well I hate okay.

938
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:17,760
I'll say is that Nate we all share a love of a certain former CEO.

939
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,760
Hello.

940
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,760
Hello.

941
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,200
You did a hello unprompted.

942
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,240
You didn't even know we have a thing about hello.

943
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,240
We were meant to meet.

944
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,520
We're all hello fans.

945
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,040
But anyway look Jason shirts cool and all.

946
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,840
This is some of the captions.

947
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,360
Pure wool herring bone overcoat.

948
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,560
Jason Jason say it like Mickey man up and say it like Mickey.

949
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,760
Man up man up man up.

950
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,760
You can do this.

951
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,760
Finish it.

952
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:49,160
Old calfskin leather Italian beef roll Penny love.

953
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:58,360
Try to find it on pure silk crepe neckwear.

954
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,560
This is Jason's having to read upside down for the listener.

955
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,560
This is challenging.

956
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,560
That's it.

957
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,560
I give it up to Jason.

958
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,560
Can you do one like Stitch.

959
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,560
Stitch is going to be good.

960
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,560
Well well tweet trousers.

961
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,560
Perfect.

962
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,560
Perfect.

963
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,560
Perfect.

964
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,560
Chef's kiss.

965
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,560
Designer cologne.

966
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,560
I don't know what that's pointing at.

967
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,560
How would they point it to it.

968
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,560
Your shirts good but your shirts got to go in the garbage.

969
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,560
Or at least get covered up.

970
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,560
As does your Griffin fast and furious shirt.

971
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,560
I have a Toretto family garage work shirt.

972
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,560
It's all nice but there's no unity up here.

973
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:51,560
I didn't have I didn't think of this in time to have to get custom shirts for all of us.

974
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:58,560
But with the magic of a little pressing on I am going to turn all of our shirts into Epcot wine shirts.

975
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,560
All right.

976
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,560
Are you ready for this.

977
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,560
OK.

978
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,560
So.

979
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:07,560
And anybody can can claim them except for Nate because I have a special one for you.

980
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,560
OK.

981
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:15,560
So here is if you're a fan of if you want to get so drunk you feel like you're going to centrifuge.

982
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,560
You might like this one.

983
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,560
I'll do it.

984
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,560
Mission shit faced.

985
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,560
We hold that up.

986
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,560
Beautiful.

987
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,560
Beautiful.

988
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,560
Put that on my that's for Mike.

989
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,560
Mission shit face.

990
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:33,560
Here's for the Epcot the classic Epcot lover.

991
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:38,560
This is a world of Mo shots.

992
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,560
Anybody want to claim this either one of you.

993
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,560
All right.

994
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,560
That's Griffin.

995
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,560
There you go.

996
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,560
Just just press that on you.

997
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,560
And then here's a tribute to what replaced that.

998
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:54,560
And this is I got a DUI on test track.

999
00:49:54,560 --> 00:50:01,560
Credit to Aaron for that one.

1000
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,560
Thanks, Aaron.

1001
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,560
Perfect.

1002
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,560
Nailed it.

1003
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,560
Nailed it.

1004
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:09,560
And then this one I'm going to claim this one.

1005
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,560
I'm excited for this.

1006
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:17,560
This is if you're a fan of an old attraction and wonders of life or a little guy took you

1007
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:22,560
into the human body then you might enjoy this shirt which is.

1008
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:32,560
Buzzy saw my liver and quit the command.

1009
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,560
All right.

1010
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,560
That's me for sure.

1011
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:42,560
And then finally for our special guest I am so excited to present you this because there's

1012
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:47,560
a style for the listener this is style of these things where it's like a wine glass

1013
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:53,560
topped by the iconic hairstyle or a hat that a character typically has.

1014
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:58,560
And that's kind of what I've tried to do because I feel like you have an iconic fashion sense

1015
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,560
Nate.

1016
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:04,560
And that is why I've made you this one which is paging Mr. Moore Merlot.

1017
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:25,560
Paging Mr. Moore Merlot.

1018
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,560
Paging Mr. Moore Merlot.

1019
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,560
I can fix that for you here.

1020
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,560
I'll fix it up.

1021
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,560
You guys chat amongst yourselves.

1022
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,560
Yay.

1023
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,560
There we go.

1024
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,560
Yeah.

1025
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,560
Wow.

1026
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,560
I feel so honored.

1027
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:44,560
It really you do have because we got like I mean is it a fedora what kind of hat we

1028
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,560
tie.

1029
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,560
What is your what do you call your head.

1030
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,560
Yeah.

1031
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,560
And glasses.

1032
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,560
I see you in there.

1033
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:50,560
I see the perfect.

1034
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,560
Great.

1035
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,560
Great.

1036
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,560
I was so happy.

1037
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,560
Look at us.

1038
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,560
We're a team now.

1039
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,560
Here.

1040
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,560
All right.

1041
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:02,560
We can properly go around the world at this point.

1042
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,560
Well so where to begin.

1043
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:12,560
I mean like I don't know what were particular highlight experiences for everybody at Epcot

1044
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,560
the other day.

1045
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:24,560
I had some a sake cocktail that tasted like juice and then I had everything else I drank

1046
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:28,560
that alcohol in it also tasted like juice.

1047
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,560
So I don't know that I necessarily had a highlight.

1048
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:35,560
I had some tiny beers that I was a big fan of because I will say overall even before

1049
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,560
even I won't even praise a specific thing.

1050
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:41,560
Having six ounce beers is good.

1051
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,560
Yeah.

1052
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,560
I don't need too much.

1053
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,560
Just have a little taste and then you can keep moving on.

1054
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,560
Obviously they give you the option to have a bigger one but I think we were every time

1055
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,560
I got a little one I got so excited.

1056
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,560
I was like isn't this cute.

1057
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:57,560
The cup is cute and then I would drink just a little bit and I wouldn't get a tummy ache.

1058
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,560
Yeah.

1059
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,560
Yeah.

1060
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:05,560
And it fit the bill in a couple situations for sure.

1061
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,560
I mean is this a good time to talk about.

1062
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:14,560
I don't know if it if we're jumping to it too fast but to me one of the most special

1063
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:20,560
things going on this year is over at the Odyssey Pavilion.

1064
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,560
Wow.

1065
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,560
OK.

1066
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,560
Well good.

1067
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,560
We're going to plus for that.

1068
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,560
I love the Odyssey.

1069
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:31,560
I love that that isn't gone or replaced by anything cool like a ride or whatever.

1070
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:35,560
It's this odd boxy building that they got to fill up with something every once in a while

1071
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:42,560
and that currently is something called Brew Wing Lab at the Odyssey.

1072
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:49,560
And this is and I'm so happy Griffin is here because this is a Muppet experience a new

1073
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,560
Muppet experience just for food and wine.

1074
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:58,560
And then as soon as Griffin saw that it was Muppets he went wild.

1075
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:05,560
Not only that but centered around my favorite Muppet straight man Bunsen Honeydew who I

1076
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,560
argue is quietly the funniest Muppet.

1077
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,560
OK.

1078
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,560
And it just he lets everyone else score the basket.

1079
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:16,560
You know he passes the ball he lets them take it to the hoop.

1080
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:21,560
And man you know a lot of like comedy and comedy takes her in the eyes but he manages

1081
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,560
to be funny with no eyes.

1082
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,560
Eyeless.

1083
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,560
Uh huh.

1084
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,560
Eyeless.

1085
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,560
Eyeless comedian.

1086
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,560
Jason had tipped me off.

1087
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,560
He wanted to make sure I wouldn't miss this.

1088
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:38,560
Texted a couple days before a trip started that he saw there was this pop up and that

1089
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:43,560
the key item that was getting a lot of buzz was the pickle milkshake.

1090
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,560
Yeah.

1091
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:49,560
Which I did not want to try.

1092
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,560
No but I took the bullet.

1093
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:57,560
I got it later in the day so that you could have the cup.

1094
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,560
I drank the pickle milkshake.

1095
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:06,560
I drank about half of it and then he was like OK.

1096
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:14,560
My review is this tasted like a solid vanilla milkshake that they then just put a shot of

1097
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,560
nail polish remover in.

1098
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:23,560
And then as I was walking to the bathroom I was like oh I kind of taste dill now.

1099
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:29,560
And so I cleaned out the glass so you could have it.

1100
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:35,560
Then I bought the frozen fusion which was just like a tea smoothie so I could have a

1101
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,560
little glass.

1102
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,560
Sorry to cut you off Jason.

1103
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:44,560
When you tasted the dill minutes later was that like a slow release capsule of medicine?

1104
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,560
Oh yeah.

1105
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:50,560
Yeah it was like I finally bit the cyanide capsule in my back molar.

1106
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:54,560
Jason you know most people don't know this he keeps a little capsule in his mouth that's

1107
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,560
full of dill.

1108
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,560
Yeah a little dill.

1109
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:09,560
Yeah no it wasn't like a porrent but it wasn't wild and then I just had orange cardamom wings

1110
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,560
which were just yeah they were nice.

1111
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:19,560
It was like nice wings a little herbally sauce but you guys had much more of an experience.

1112
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,560
Can I ask real quick though Nate have you had this pickle milkshake?

1113
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,560
Yes I love the pickle milkshake.

1114
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,560
Wow.

1115
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,560
I do.

1116
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,560
I honestly and I don't like pickles.

1117
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,560
Really?

1118
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,560
I don't know.

1119
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,560
It works for me.

1120
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,560
It tastes like a shamrock shake.

1121
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,560
No.

1122
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,560
I hate shamrock shakes.

1123
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,560
You got a hard no.

1124
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,560
One hard no.

1125
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,560
One firm no.

1126
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:49,560
I understand what you're saying yeah it has very similar texture and a little bit of flavor

1127
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,560
yeah.

1128
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:54,560
I mean I see a lot of people who really don't like it though they're like oh this is disgusting

1129
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:55,560
I don't think it's disgusting.

1130
00:56:55,560 --> 00:57:00,560
Yeah I don't think it was disgusting I was just like oh not this isn't for me I shouldn't

1131
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,560
drink this you know.

1132
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:06,560
Can I ask you said you don't like pickles Nate every time you've eaten a pickle in the

1133
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:12,560
past do you think to yourself I wish this tasted 40% more like a milkshake.

1134
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,560
Has that been the missing element for you?

1135
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,560
I could probably like pickles that way.

1136
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,560
I would say so.

1137
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,560
Yeah.

1138
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,560
Do you like pickles on hamburgers or anything?

1139
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,560
I am plain.

1140
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,560
Oh really?

1141
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,560
Hamburger burger bun I love it.

1142
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:32,560
Like I love it I like that style with like the tomato like I'll eat like a slice of tomato

1143
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,560
on it or even on white bread.

1144
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:39,560
That's like the original way like that one place that invented the hamburger up in I

1145
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,560
don't even know where it is.

1146
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:41,560
Wherever it was.

1147
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,560
Yeah.

1148
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,560
Louis lunch.

1149
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:49,560
Yeah they just do it's literally just like bread hamburger tomato.

1150
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:54,560
Okay I that's I like a pickle I feel like I generally don't eat pickles alone I eat

1151
00:57:54,560 --> 00:58:00,560
them on things but I did not try this pickle milkshake and maybe maybe I will get back

1152
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,560
to the park maybe I'll try it.

1153
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:06,560
I'm a simple man with burgers what I like is just all I want is just kind of that patty

1154
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:10,560
and the bun but I want the patty to be sushi.

1155
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:14,560
I want it to be a combo of burger and sushi.

1156
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,560
Your classic burgueshee form factor.

1157
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,560
Yeah that's you know you're right that's I was searching for the term what I'm searching

1158
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,560
for is burgueshee.

1159
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:27,560
It's kind of the superior yeah that's what I want and you'll hear about that soon enough.

1160
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,560
Yes.

1161
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:34,560
So Scott I feel like you should talk about your order at the Brew Wing Lab.

1162
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,560
This is what we're building up to.

1163
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:42,560
I'm just gonna I'm gonna cut to the chase because I didn't give it a lot of thought.

1164
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,560
I didn't do a lot of research.

1165
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:47,560
I saw a term and I and I went for it.

1166
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:55,560
I looked at the menu and I saw unnecessarily spicy yet extremely tasty scotch bonnet pepper

1167
00:58:55,560 --> 00:59:00,560
curry wings with with cool cucumber yogurt.

1168
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:06,560
Let's get I thought maybe I get more yeah but it ended at the yogurt separate it with the

1169
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,560
wings was without applause point.

1170
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:18,560
So I went for that and because I like I'm fine with spice I think I don't think I'm a spicy

1171
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:22,560
hot wing avoider.

1172
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:31,560
And it it shows up and first of all I don't I hate to start disagreeing with the person who

1173
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,560
just yelled right now.

1174
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:36,560
I what's that.

1175
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,560
All right we're all good we're all good.

1176
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:45,560
The it it shows up.

1177
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:49,560
It doesn't look great to me looks like a big old.

1178
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:54,560
I mean like cool cucumber yogurt you can picture what that is that's like refreshing and dill

1179
00:59:54,560 --> 01:00:01,560
and and not just kind of like a plop like a bird plop on top of hot wings.

1180
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:12,560
A single bite one single bite and I am done for gone just gone beyond belief to where just

1181
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:18,560
it's the immediate up and like handshaking and and a tongue out of control immediately.

1182
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:23,560
Immediately after one bite felt like you were doing a bad bit.

1183
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:30,560
Yes it was a very vague sort of impression of a person eating too much spice.

1184
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,560
It took me a moment to realize you were actually struggling.

1185
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:44,560
Yes yeah I I take one bite and I and I am like oh my oh oh my oh geez and which does not sound

1186
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,560
like how I talk.

1187
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:52,560
It does sound like a bit mode you would that volume that level of facial expression and I told

1188
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:59,560
you you you seem like you're doing a bit right now and you went oh wow I guess I must seem like

1189
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:05,560
I'm doing like a season two of SNL will ferrell character.

1190
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:10,560
That was out of yes I thought I like I it's like kind of an early on not quite as good will

1191
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,560
ferrell the hot too hot of wings guy.

1192
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:18,560
Oh dear lord dear lord that is spicy that is spicy.

1193
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:26,560
I felt like such a hack but I wasn't exaggerate it honestly was what genuinely came out of me.

1194
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,560
We're not playing it up at all.

1195
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,560
The wing the wings made me hacky.

1196
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:36,560
Activated the hack part of the hurt you and they ruined your comedic sensibility.

1197
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:42,560
Yeah yeah yeah which is good set up to then like do it again on a stage something that was there

1198
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:46,560
was like a mad TV character like the too much coffee guy.

1199
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,560
I felt like the too much coffee guy.

1200
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:54,560
I think I could have gotten if I was on mad TV in 96 I think I could have gotten too hot of wings

1201
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,560
guy on like 11 times.

1202
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:01,560
I think I'm I think I'm on the board every week with that thing.

1203
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,560
What's that.

1204
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,560
Oh never mind.

1205
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,560
I know that.

1206
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,560
We'll talk later.

1207
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,560
So that's done.

1208
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:17,560
That's those wings are immediately in the trash right after as if the one did it to me and then Mike had a theory

1209
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:23,560
and the theory was wing chasing because you had a different type of wing to buy.

1210
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:31,560
And I am going to say the name or I got the peanut butter and jelly wings and I thought OK maybe what you do is

1211
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:36,560
eat the hot wing then you eat the peanut butter wing because it's a sweeter thing.

1212
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,560
So I offered that to you.

1213
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:42,560
I wanted to help you which and you sampled mine too.

1214
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:47,560
Yes and I think we both agreed that it was kind of an interesting it was like a tongue coder a little bit.

1215
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,560
I think the wing chasing did work.

1216
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:50,560
I think you were correct.

1217
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:54,560
Now I didn't like the wing you gave me at all.

1218
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:57,560
Oh no the wings I was got were bad.

1219
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,560
They were medicinal at that point.

1220
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,560
They were purely balm.

1221
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,560
Yeah I didn't like the wings either.

1222
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,560
I wanted corrective wings.

1223
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,560
I didn't want tasty wings.

1224
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,560
Yeah.

1225
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:11,560
Now I have I have just like a bad body in general.

1226
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:19,560
So I was telling you guys that any time there's any sort of seasonal change my whole signal system breaks down and New

1227
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,560
York the weather was starting to change.

1228
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:25,560
It went from like 80 to 40 in one week and then I came here.

1229
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:32,560
So immediately upon landing here my allergies were like out of control and you're doing this whole act out with the wings

1230
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:42,560
and you go like you want to try this and I took one bite and I felt like I was on cocaine but also immediately my allergies

1231
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,560
cleared up like it did work.

1232
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:47,560
And then you and I at one point were like we're not exaggerating right.

1233
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:48,560
Like it does feel like we're on cocaine.

1234
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:49,560
It really feels like okay.

1235
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:53,560
And then we leaned into each other went I've never done cocaine.

1236
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:54,560
You've never actually done cocaine.

1237
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:55,560
You've never actually done cocaine.

1238
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,560
No I haven't.

1239
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:57,560
This definitely feels like cocaine.

1240
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,560
No no no but I think this is what this feels like.

1241
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:00,560
It's got to be like even the wings.

1242
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,560
It's got to be like cocaine.

1243
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,560
It's got to be.

1244
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,560
That is yeah that is what was going on.

1245
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,560
Yeah.

1246
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:13,560
And you having only had mellow peanut butter wings are like these fucking so I'm not with these psychos.

1247
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:14,560
We don't have matching shirts.

1248
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,560
I am not.

1249
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,560
I was I was checking my phone for the app.

1250
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:22,560
I was just looking to see what we could get on next and I was like oh yeah spicy wing huh.

1251
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,560
Oh still going on huh.

1252
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:30,560
Well you want some of these.

1253
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,560
OK.

1254
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:32,560
Well you're true.

1255
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:35,560
You're true plus one at any theme park is your phone.

1256
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:38,560
Well yeah that's the way it can be tough to get the attention.

1257
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:45,560
That's the way it has to be though because somebody has to like use the time efficiently when they're at the park with that whatever it's called Jeannie Plus.

1258
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:49,560
I don't want to step in something right now but I'm going to say this.

1259
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:56,560
I've gotten a lot of hate over the years for not being a particular fan of the ride living with the land.

1260
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,560
I know I know.

1261
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,560
Feel this bad.

1262
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,560
Feel free.

1263
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,560
Yeah.

1264
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,560
Hang on hang on.

1265
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,560
Let me say where I'm going with this.

1266
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:10,560
This hate is directed at me and only at me.

1267
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,560
We all went on living with the land together.

1268
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,560
Guess who was on his phone.

1269
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,560
One hundred percent of the right.

1270
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:23,560
Get him.

1271
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,560
Who me.

1272
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,560
Who me.

1273
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,560
Go stand like you're being crucified against the brick wall.

1274
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,560
And this was a respectful living with the land ride.

1275
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,560
The boat was quiet as a church mouse.

1276
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:38,560
I haven't seen that in years.

1277
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:42,560
But then this little glowing light illuminating his face.

1278
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,560
I turned it on night mode.

1279
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,560
I turned it on night mode.

1280
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:48,560
I turned it on the contrast.

1281
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:51,560
I'm no villain.

1282
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,560
I was trying to make the rest of the day better for them.

1283
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:58,560
I wasn't texting or checking the web.

1284
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:07,560
At one point in the ride, Mike, without lifting his eyes off of his phone, like nudged me with his elbow.

1285
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:08,560
You should pay attention.

1286
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,560
This is an important room.

1287
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:12,560
Wow.

1288
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:17,560
That's frowning tomato girl.

1289
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:29,560
Well, right before that living with the land ride, too, we had about a 30 minute ordeal where we were all trying to buy Disney Plus.

1290
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:32,560
I was trying to buy Disney Plus.

1291
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:33,560
Genie Plus.

1292
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,560
We were not signing up for the streaming service.

1293
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,560
I'm already a subscriber to Disney Plus.

1294
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:40,560
We all bought straight to five years on Disney Plus.

1295
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,560
We're going to have it forever.

1296
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:47,560
They were sitting outside and Jan and I were down in the food court and gotten a snack.

1297
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:50,560
I was trying to buy Genie Plus on my phone.

1298
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:57,560
It would go through and Apple Pay would come down charge.

1299
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:01,560
Then 10 seconds later, it would go refund.

1300
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:09,560
It would just charge me and refund me about four times before we eventually just bought it on her phone.

1301
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:15,560
Then finally, which is also was like, I don't know how much we're going to use this today.

1302
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:20,560
We might be buying this to do living with the land.

1303
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:26,560
By the time we actually got on the ride, we were all real relaxed.

1304
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,560
We were all like, thank God it stopped.

1305
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:31,560
Thank God the app stopped and we can just do a ride.

1306
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:38,560
The entire Genie Plus hassle took absolutely longer than if we had just gone into the line.

1307
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:45,560
It took us over 30 minutes to link a reservation for all of us on the ride at the same time.

1308
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:48,560
The ride queue at that moment was 20 minutes long.

1309
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,560
We go on the whole ride.

1310
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,560
Mike's on his phone.

1311
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,560
You're just kind of stewing.

1312
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,560
The ride ends.

1313
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:59,560
You step off and you go, well, I'm getting wine.

1314
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:02,560
It disappeared.

1315
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:03,560
I didn't even see it.

1316
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,560
It's like the water on her was just gone.

1317
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,560
This is not a bit.

1318
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:08,560
He ran away.

1319
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:09,560
This is not a bit.

1320
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:10,560
I said, Scott, where are you going?

1321
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:11,560
You're going, I don't know.

1322
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:12,560
And I don't care.

1323
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:16,560
And you ran into a crowd and we just had to find you later.

1324
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,560
Daddy knows what daddy needs.

1325
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:26,560
I mean, it's app hassle and then a ride that folks, I want to like the ride.

1326
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,560
I want to be like you.

1327
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,560
Don't you understand?

1328
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:32,560
I feel like the boy in the plastic bubble.

1329
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,560
Everyone is outside.

1330
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:37,560
They're laughing and they're running free and I'm not invited.

1331
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,560
And I went on it and I still don't get it.

1332
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,560
Help me get the ride.

1333
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,560
Nick.

1334
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,560
What?

1335
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,560
The ride news.

1336
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:47,560
Well, yeah, all right.

1337
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,560
A little like a kusvik guitar.

1338
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:50,560
Yeah, yeah, that's not bad.

1339
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,560
That's not bad.

1340
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,560
Nick, do you like living with the land?

1341
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:54,560
I love living with the land.

1342
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:55,560
I do.

1343
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:59,560
And you know, you can eat from living with the land.

1344
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:01,560
You mean you can eat while you're on the boat?

1345
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,560
No, you can eat the food from living with the land.

1346
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,560
But later.

1347
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,560
Later.

1348
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,560
Not on there while you do it, but they have little signs for food and wine.

1349
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:10,560
Right, right, right.

1350
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:14,560
They say like the yucca fries that are like grown on living with the land.

1351
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,560
Right.

1352
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,560
So it's kind of fun, little food and wine twist.

1353
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:22,560
Do you like the first part of it or the second part when you see this, like hopefully see a scientist or something?

1354
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,560
Oh, I like the music and I'm always looking for a scientist.

1355
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:26,560
Yeah.

1356
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:27,560
I'm always looking.

1357
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:30,560
And anyone that's on the like the behind the scenes, I'm always looking.

1358
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,560
Behind the scenes, the tour, I'm like, oh, look at them over there.

1359
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,560
Oh, yeah.

1360
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:41,560
We saw some with the big pole by the trout pond and we all waved and they went back.

1361
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:48,560
Yeah. How often, just because you're always in the parks, how many times a week on average do you go on living with the land?

1362
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,560
Or a month?

1363
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,560
If I go into the land, I'm probably going on living with the land usually.

1364
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,560
Okay.

1365
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,560
Literally.

1366
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,560
So I would say probably like once.

1367
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,560
Once a month or a week?

1368
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,560
Once every two weeks, maybe three weeks.

1369
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,560
I think I had one time.

1370
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:05,560
Yeah.

1371
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,560
I used to go ride Soarin' before work.

1372
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:09,560
I remember I did that a long time.

1373
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:12,560
I used to like, you know, like I used to work like 3 p.m.

1374
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:17,560
I used to actually go in like go to Epcot at like 11 a.m. and go ride Soarin' and then go to work.

1375
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:19,560
Okay. This is before you were born?

1376
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,560
Yeah. It was like the total like, all right, I'm ready for my shift.

1377
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,560
Yeah. I love Soarin' so much.

1378
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,560
I need help. I need help.

1379
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,560
I don't want to get booed anymore.

1380
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,560
I want to be on the right side of history.

1381
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,560
I'm trying to get better.

1382
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,560
Do you have, answer me this question.

1383
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:36,560
Why do I not like living with the land?

1384
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,560
But I love the Mexico boat ride.

1385
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,560
Why is that?

1386
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,560
I love Mexico.

1387
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:46,560
I like, it was one of the first things I did when I got on.

1388
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:50,560
I was so sad when we didn't get to do it a second time once we hooked up with you.

1389
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:54,560
What's, they're both slow moving, relaxing boat rides.

1390
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,560
What's going on?

1391
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:56,560
What's going on?

1392
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,560
Do you have, can you, I don't know, not to make you psychoanalyze me.

1393
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:02,560
What about the mighty hooves of the buffalo?

1394
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:10,560
And there's like so many great things about that ride, the house, the forest scenes with the running water.

1395
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:11,560
Yeah.

1396
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:15,560
There's some atmosphere there. You got something there. Sure, sure.

1397
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:18,560
Yeah. I mean, there's so many great things and the music.

1398
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,560
Would you say...

1399
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,560
Maybe music is the key. Thank you. Yes. Okay.

1400
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:26,560
Would you say though that the Mexico boat ride is better than living with the land?

1401
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:29,560
Oh, no. I can't.

1402
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:37,560
Honestly, I do love that ride, but living with the land is, I mean, you got to truly live with the land.

1403
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:43,560
Well, that's what, yeah. I mean, look, I understand the message of it.

1404
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:50,560
The message is to be one with the land, to live with the land, to not get like distracted by like your devices.

1405
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,560
Oh, oh.

1406
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:55,560
Have you rode it by yourself? Like on a real nice slow day?

1407
01:11:55,560 --> 01:12:00,560
I've done that before and there was no boats and you just get to listen to music without looking at your phone.

1408
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,560
You know what I mean?

1409
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,560
Hey, there we go.

1410
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,560
I was tapping everyone.

1411
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,560
I was just saying, no, no, no, no.

1412
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:12,560
Maybe try it out. Go for a nice little boat ride for yourself.

1413
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,560
Take it in. Look for the hidden Mickey's.

1414
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:20,560
Oh, sure. Oh, there's the yeah, there's there's shrimp live in little Mickey cages.

1415
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,560
I noticed that.

1416
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,560
Look for the pumpkin Mickey.

1417
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,560
I didn't see the pumpkin Mickey. I'll look for the pumpkin Mickey.

1418
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,560
Or go on the behind the scenes tour.

1419
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,560
That is one thing we didn't get to this week.

1420
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:37,560
It occurred to me that it would probably be funny to go on the behind the scenes tour.

1421
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:46,560
But was it also possible that I would end up wanting to like drown myself in a salmon tank?

1422
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,560
Also possible. I don't know.

1423
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,560
That'll be for next trip.

1424
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:58,560
I believe when you ran away, I said to Griffin, is there any way we could sign him up without him knowing for the side behind the seeds tour?

1425
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,560
But I don't think that's possible.

1426
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,560
Would you show up in your app and force you to go?

1427
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,560
I don't think so.

1428
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,560
I got bummed after we left.

1429
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:13,560
I found out they were selling little like seedling, little plants that they grew.

1430
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:16,560
You could buy little plants from living with the land.

1431
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,560
You can take them home with little pots.

1432
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,560
Have you done the tour, Nate?

1433
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:23,560
No, I've never done the tour.

1434
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,560
We should have done the tour.

1435
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:26,560
I want the ride.

1436
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:35,560
I've been in the back area one time for like a VIP tour, but I never got to do the tour tour.

1437
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,560
I always wanted to.

1438
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,560
That's the tour, though. That's the tour.

1439
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,560
All right.

1440
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:47,560
Well, we're going to, okay, I don't know when we'll, the next time we're back, do we just need to reunite this entire group?

1441
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:50,560
And the live show is behind the seeds.

1442
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,560
I am ready.

1443
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,560
Behind the seeds.

1444
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,560
Behind the seeds.

1445
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,560
Behind the seeds.

1446
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:59,560
Wait, wait, wait.

1447
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,560
One more chance.

1448
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,560
Mike, stay off your phone.

1449
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,560
Mike, stay off your phone.

1450
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,560
Look at the seeds.

1451
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,560
Look at the seeds.

1452
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,560
Live with the land.

1453
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,560
Live with the land.

1454
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:18,560
Can you bring one of those cases you put in when you go to like see a stand-up show for my phone?

1455
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,560
Oh, yeah.

1456
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:26,560
You know, there was a lot of back and forth about like what should the subjects of the shows be, the live shows, right?

1457
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:27,560
Right, right, right.

1458
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:31,560
So I was going to do a lot more stuff across several days at the park.

1459
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:35,560
What would give the most meat to a show?

1460
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:41,560
And Food and Wine Festival, I think the fear was, is this kind of a picaresque story?

1461
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,560
Is it a scattered narrative?

1462
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:46,560
A little bites and sips here and there?

1463
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,560
Is it going to be a story of all these little glimpses?

1464
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:50,560
Oh, and we split off.

1465
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,560
You know, it can be, you know, it's aimless.

1466
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,560
You're walking around, you're having fun.

1467
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:55,560
But what is the tale to tell?

1468
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,560
What is that, a fucking Robert Altman movie?

1469
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,560
Where's the narrative propulsion, you know?

1470
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:00,560
Sure.

1471
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:01,560
We're not Cassavetes here.

1472
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:02,560
Come on.

1473
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,560
Story, story is what we want.

1474
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,560
And I said, I think I found the spine of the story.

1475
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:17,560
I became aware of a certain passport that was being handed out at Epcot to participate in an event called Emile's Promage Montage.

1476
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:27,560
Oh, oh, Emile, of course, the food loving brother from Ratatouille presents a montage of cheese.

1477
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:33,560
I'd say montage is not the right word to describe a crawl in Orlando heat.

1478
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:34,560
Yes.

1479
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,560
Many, many cheeses eaten hours apart.

1480
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:38,560
Yes.

1481
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:43,560
But there was a list of 10 participating stands with different cheese dishes.

1482
01:15:43,560 --> 01:16:04,560
And if you got five of those stamps from any your choice, five out of the 10, you could then go to simmering sips hosted by Corksicle and get the completer surprise stamp and a special off menu treat only for completers.

1483
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:11,560
Which, by the way, I appreciate being up to full fledged PTR legend.

1484
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:17,560
But completer is the main term I would like people to associate with me.

1485
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:18,560
OK.

1486
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:19,560
Completer.

1487
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:23,560
That man completes.

1488
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:32,560
And so I just for days leading up to this, I was like, guys, I'm telling you, this fucking fromage montage is going to pay off.

1489
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,560
It's going to give us like an arc.

1490
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:36,560
We're going to have a fun journey.

1491
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:39,560
It's going to keep the show in line.

1492
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:42,560
Here's a thing I didn't tell you guys.

1493
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:47,560
Go to the first stand of what I knew had to be five early in the morning.

1494
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,560
Check my backpack.

1495
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:53,560
Realized I had left my lactate in the hotel.

1496
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:59,560
Oh, and I would say my body is not good at processing any food.

1497
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:02,560
Dairy pretty close to the bottom of the list.

1498
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,560
You didn't you didn't talk about playing it cool.

1499
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:08,560
You did not mention this one word.

1500
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:09,560
I did not.

1501
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:10,560
Whoa.

1502
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:14,560
There's people talk about Montezuma's revenge.

1503
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:18,560
I had a meal's congestion when I got back to my hotel room.

1504
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:22,560
There was four hours of hacking and spitting.

1505
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,560
No, I'm telling you.

1506
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:26,560
But I felt the need to do this.

1507
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:30,560
And I did in fact get five stamps.

1508
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,560
Wow.

1509
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,560
I completed the mission.

1510
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,560
I got the.

1511
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:36,560
What did I get here?

1512
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:45,560
The Schinken Nudeln from Germany, which is somewhere between I'd say like a casserole and a mac and cheese like a German mac and cheese.

1513
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,560
Did you do all this too?

1514
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:48,560
No, no, no.

1515
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,560
I don't like I like doing the cookie stroll during the festival.

1516
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,560
The holidays.

1517
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:54,560
They have a cookie one where it's all cookies and not cheese items.

1518
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,560
Right.

1519
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:56,560
I like that's another situation.

1520
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:57,560
Yeah.

1521
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:58,560
OK.

1522
01:17:58,560 --> 01:17:59,560
With stamps.

1523
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:00,560
Yeah.

1524
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,560
Do you get a complete or surprise?

1525
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:02,560
Did you complete?

1526
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:03,560
Oh, yeah.

1527
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:04,560
What was the surprise?

1528
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,560
It's a surprise.

1529
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:07,560
That's right.

1530
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:10,560
I didn't know I was on stage with two completers.

1531
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,560
Oh, yes.

1532
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:14,560
I was there when you completed this and you were happy.

1533
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:15,560
I.

1534
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:19,560
Like there was a level of like I did it.

1535
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:23,560
I don't know if I've ever finished a thing that much in my life.

1536
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:24,560
Yeah.

1537
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,560
Grilled cheese from Greece.

1538
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:30,560
I got the the Pão de Queijo from Brazil.

1539
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:41,560
I chose weirdly to not get the Canadian cheddar and bacon soup during a hot Orlando afternoon.

1540
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:43,560
I didn't feel like chugging that.

1541
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:50,560
And I got the Southern pimento cheese and I think the Boracanofig and balsamic souffle from Wine and Wedge.

1542
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:54,560
But I got I completed all five and my reward.

1543
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:55,560
I got this cup.

1544
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:56,560
I've been quietly.

1545
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,560
It's been here the whole fucking time.

1546
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:02,560
I didn't even realize he was drinking out of that cup the whole night.

1547
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:03,560
I know.

1548
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,560
Refilled it mid show.

1549
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,560
The clues were there.

1550
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:07,560
Whoa.

1551
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,560
That blew my mind.

1552
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:09,560
You've been holding that all night.

1553
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:12,560
I will say it's a plastic cup with a lot of give.

1554
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:15,560
It may not survive a flight back.

1555
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,560
It's real flexible.

1556
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:18,560
Oh, yeah.

1557
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:23,560
But this was filled with the reward you got for eating five different cheese dishes.

1558
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:33,560
In my case without lactate was cheesecake flavored soft serve with a mini cheesecake on top.

1559
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:36,560
I was really excited when I got it.

1560
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:37,560
I looked at all of you.

1561
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:38,560
I went, this is great.

1562
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:39,560
This is so great.

1563
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:40,560
This is the best thing I've eaten all day.

1564
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:44,560
And then we went to the bathroom and I poured half of it out.

1565
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:47,560
I thought he housed it.

1566
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:49,560
I was like, wow, he must have loved it.

1567
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:50,560
I did love it.

1568
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:51,560
I did love it.

1569
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:55,560
And then it started to one by one break down my central nervous system.

1570
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:56,560
Jesus.

1571
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,560
Wait a minute.

1572
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:58,560
Wait a minute.

1573
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:05,560
So now what I'm putting together is that because you're going to hear about it in the city walk saga in many, many parts.

1574
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,560
Was this yesterday?

1575
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,560
What is time?

1576
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:09,560
What is happening?

1577
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:10,560
Yesterday.

1578
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:15,560
Yesterday was death day.

1579
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,560
Yesterday was the day that broke us at City Walk.

1580
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:26,560
And it's the day that everything broke at Universal Studios where there was a solid three hours where we didn't do one thing somehow.

1581
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:31,560
How are we in here and in this heat and not doing one actual activity?

1582
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,560
The morale was so low.

1583
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:43,560
And what I didn't know until now is that from the time we left you to that, you were just you were vomiting and I wasn't vomiting.

1584
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:44,560
I wasn't vomiting.

1585
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:45,560
OK.

1586
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:47,560
But there was a constant struggle.

1587
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:53,560
Ironically, at the death day lunch, you seemed fine because you just had a grilled chicken sandwich.

1588
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:54,560
That's true.

1589
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,560
I went a little simple.

1590
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,560
Yeah.

1591
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:00,560
Wait, did you eat some cheese on the pizza later too?

1592
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,560
At that point, it was kind of a some cost fallacy thing.

1593
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:05,560
I didn't even think about that.

1594
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:10,560
We went to Abra Kedavar and we said, let's get one of each food item you have.

1595
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:16,560
And the three food items were cheese and meat plate, cheese fries and cheese pizza.

1596
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,560
And I did partake in all three.

1597
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:23,560
I was also combating the amount of wine I'd had at all the booze.

1598
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:24,560
It was like I had to.

1599
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,560
You got to do it with something.

1600
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:41,560
Can I also say I don't know if there are further questions about my digestive system, but we went to Abra Kedavar and Taylor, your friend in our group asked about if they had like what specialty mocktails were.

1601
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:44,560
She listed some of the specialties, our server.

1602
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:54,560
And then she said, and also we have the, I forget what the two were, but she said something like we have the Arnold Palmer, which is we call it the Mickey Mouse here.

1603
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:58,560
And we have the Shirley Temple, which we here call the Minnie Mouse.

1604
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:02,560
And Mike kind of immediately tensed up.

1605
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:12,560
And then he went, his eyes narrowed and he went, would it be possible to get a Minnie Mouse with alcohol?

1606
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:16,560
And she went like a dirty Shirley Temple.

1607
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,560
And Mike said, I wouldn't say that.

1608
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:23,560
And she said, because I can't call the drink a dirty Minnie.

1609
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:29,560
Yeah, I said we can't say dirty Minnie.

1610
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:33,560
And she said, oh, and like she took a second and was like, oh, I understand what you mean.

1611
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:36,560
Yes. And I said this drink is called a dirty Shirley.

1612
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:40,560
But you've told us now that it's called a Minnie here by transitive property.

1613
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,560
It would be a dirty Minnie.

1614
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,560
Yeah, but I didn't want to think about it that way.

1615
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:51,560
Too late. You had a dirty Minnie inside you.

1616
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:52,560
We tried to.

1617
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,560
I'm stating facts. I'm stating facts.

1618
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:59,560
At the table, we tried to redub it a flirty Minnie to keep it a little more.

1619
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:02,560
That's nice. That's wholesome. I like that better.

1620
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:07,560
But then, Nate, you started talking about different events you'd gone to recently.

1621
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:12,560
And every time you talked about something at a smaller size, I said Minnie.

1622
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:18,560
You said Minnie and Mike would just go like this to me.

1623
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:25,560
Because we had started in such a place. I just every time it reminded me of her.

1624
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:29,560
Your Orlando Hall Pass.

1625
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:32,560
You were talking about this like it is Casablanca.

1626
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:37,560
Like you're a Rick staring out into the sky thinking of her.

1627
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:42,560
I have a photo as she was walking by me in Epcot and I took a quick one with her.

1628
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,560
Oh, you did a creep shot? Is that what you're talking about?

1629
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,560
Not a creep shot. She was looking.

1630
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:49,560
It's not like you took a creep shot.

1631
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:52,560
She's out there to take photos with. It just happened to happen when she was standing.

1632
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,560
She was walking by.

1633
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:59,560
Can I talk about a completist thing I did food-wise?

1634
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:01,560
How are you a completer, Jason?

1635
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:03,560
Well, so we had...

1636
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:06,560
You better have the stamps to back up the story, by the way.

1637
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,560
You better have the stamps to back up the story.

1638
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:12,560
Oh, I don't.

1639
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:20,560
So we ended up doing Guardians around like 2.30 or so in the day.

1640
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:26,560
And so Jane and I had gone off and I was sampling some food stuff.

1641
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:32,560
And I just wanted to have some food in my belly, but not too much before a big crazy coaster like that.

1642
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,560
Because it really moves you around a lot.

1643
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:47,560
And so I had half a cheese and fruit plate, a plate of stone crab claws,

1644
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:53,560
half of a frozen frappuccino, and an M&M cookie.

1645
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:56,560
And then I got on Guardians.

1646
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,560
And I was fine.

1647
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,560
What a lineup.

1648
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,560
So you completed just a meal of your choosing?

1649
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:08,560
Oh, I just ate a bunch of weird food and I was like, oh, I hope I'll be okay on Guardians.

1650
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:11,560
A completer of the crazy crab challenge.

1651
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:18,560
I was eating crabs at like 11.30 in the morning and they didn't quite crack them all the way.

1652
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,560
So I was like, I had to break them all open.

1653
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:23,560
But I love my crab.

1654
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:26,560
You were asking me about those crabs a lot.

1655
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:27,560
You were asking if I had them.

1656
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:31,560
I was like, oh, wow, he's really going on about the crabs.

1657
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:32,560
Welcome to the podcast.

1658
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:33,560
Excited about the crabs.

1659
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:34,560
I know.

1660
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:35,560
And now I see them.

1661
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:36,560
Yeah.

1662
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:37,560
Did you do, have you done the crab?

1663
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:38,560
Yeah, it was good.

1664
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:39,560
Yeah. Okay.

1665
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:40,560
Is it hard to break them?

1666
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:41,560
Oh, yeah, a little bit hard.

1667
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,560
I got the champagne there too.

1668
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:44,560
I got the Dom Perignon.

1669
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,560
They sell it in a big cup there.

1670
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,560
It was funny.

1671
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,560
Yeah.

1672
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:53,560
That booth was just shrimp cocktail, crab cocktail, and like three or four kinds of champagne.

1673
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,560
Yeah.

1674
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,560
Okay.

1675
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:56,560
It was very elegant.

1676
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:57,560
Yeah.

1677
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:58,560
Elegant, did you say?

1678
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:59,560
Yeah.

1679
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:00,560
It was very elegant and fancy.

1680
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:07,560
Yeah, and you're eating crab claws and drinking champagne on a trash can.

1681
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:13,680
You pointed this out, because I was like, I mean, I assume Paging Mr. Mara has to go

1682
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:18,520
into food and wine fest, and I didn't realize what a thing this was, that it's what you

1683
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:19,520
do.

1684
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:20,520
You grab a trash can.

1685
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:21,520
That's what it's about.

1686
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:22,520
Yeah.

1687
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:23,520
Well.

1688
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,400
I did it last night at the Christmas party, and I realized that if it's not an Epcot,

1689
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:26,400
people look at you.

1690
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:32,880
I was at the Christmas party, and I was eating, I think, a waffle and some Sleepy Hollow,

1691
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:36,280
and I just grabbed the closest trash can, because the tables were there, and it just

1692
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:37,840
looked weird, because it was like ice cream.

1693
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:38,840
It was a sundae.

1694
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:39,840
Oh, okay.

1695
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,360
It was on the trash can, and I was just like.

1696
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:44,320
And no one else was eating on a trash can.

1697
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,320
Yeah, yeah.

1698
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:46,320
It happens.

1699
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,000
But Epcot, you always see it everywhere you go.

1700
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,560
Right, because there's limited space.

1701
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,560
Yeah.

1702
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:52,560
That's what you do.

1703
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,000
I'm going to be sad to go back home and eat at a table.

1704
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:56,600
Or in California.

1705
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:00,080
Can I ask you, because this is the type of thing we would talk about on the show.

1706
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:04,400
Is there, do you have a favorite trash can to eat on in Epcot?

1707
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:05,400
Yes.

1708
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:06,400
You do?

1709
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,400
Absolutely.

1710
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,240
Over by the gazebo, where Minnie actually meets.

1711
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:12,760
Oh, now I'm liking the sound.

1712
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:15,960
It's in the front of World Showcase, in between Mexico and Canada.

1713
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:16,960
There's a little gazebo.

1714
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:17,960
It's very nice.

1715
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:18,960
Got a nice backdrop.

1716
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:21,440
You can see the monorail go by.

1717
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:22,440
I like a view.

1718
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:23,440
Yes.

1719
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,600
It's a great view.

1720
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:27,440
Is there something special about the trash can, or it's just mostly the view?

1721
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,440
No, it's the view.

1722
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:29,440
Okay.

1723
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:30,440
Yeah, yeah.

1724
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:32,440
I mean, if you get a trash can, you got to have a good view.

1725
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:37,440
Do you have a least favorite trash can in Epcot?

1726
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:40,440
Probably next to the restrooms.

1727
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:41,440
Okay.

1728
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:42,440
Yeah.

1729
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:43,440
Bad view.

1730
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,440
Bad view staring at toilets.

1731
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:46,440
Yeah.

1732
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:50,440
We have to start winding this down, which makes me sad.

1733
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:53,440
I'd love to stay here for as long as humanly possible.

1734
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:56,440
I wish we'd done a third show that we could go into right now.

1735
01:27:56,440 --> 01:28:00,440
I was going to say, Nate, you were saying something before the show.

1736
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:02,440
Is there something you have?

1737
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:04,440
Oh, I got you guys something.

1738
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:05,440
What?

1739
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:06,440
I did.

1740
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:13,440
Well, because you know how we were talking about buying antiques and little Disney props

1741
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,440
and cool stuff?

1742
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:21,440
My friend Taylor, we actually went and we got stuff that I thought you guys would like.

1743
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,440
Something like Disney history.

1744
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:24,440
What?

1745
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:25,440
Really?

1746
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,440
Yeah.

1747
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:27,440
Oh my god.

1748
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,440
Is that a big bag?

1749
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:29,440
What?

1750
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,440
That is a giant bag.

1751
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:31,440
It's been here the whole time, like the glass.

1752
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:32,440
Taylor, thank you.

1753
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:33,440
Oh my god.

1754
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:34,440
This is really cool.

1755
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:36,440
I really know you guys would appreciate it.

1756
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:37,440
This is like our birthday.

1757
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,440
I really wanted to share it with you guys.

1758
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,440
Wow, this is the nicest.

1759
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:42,440
Whoa.

1760
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,440
This is like Christmas morning.

1761
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:45,440
I love that.

1762
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:46,440
Thank you so much.

1763
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:47,440
Thank you so much.

1764
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:48,440
Oh, geez.

1765
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:49,440
This is nuts.

1766
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:50,440
All right.

1767
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:53,440
So like most of the stuff, I try to make like everything and Taylor helped me pick out some

1768
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:57,440
really cool stuff because like she was like, oh yeah, this would be perfect.

1769
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:59,440
But like there's some things that are unique.

1770
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:02,440
So we got Shrek glasses in there that are really kind of cool.

1771
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:03,440
Wow.

1772
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:04,440
Yeah.

1773
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:05,440
Wow.

1774
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,440
Brain Shrek 4Ds.

1775
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:07,440
Oh my god.

1776
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:08,440
Cool.

1777
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:11,440
This is a little bit of a surprise.

1778
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,440
Oh my god.

1779
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:13,440
Cool.

1780
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,440
This is an 8 by 10.

1781
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,440
This is incredible.

1782
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:21,440
It's the dinosaur family at MGM Studios.

1783
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:25,440
We were talking about those kind of photos just out there and that's why I was like, oh

1784
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,440
man, maybe I should give them to you because I was like.

1785
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:31,440
This is a sticker or a patch with a phrase that means a lot to me.

1786
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:37,440
And the phrase is the 21st century begins October 1st, 1982.

1787
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:38,440
That is opening day.

1788
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,440
It's opening day.

1789
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:40,440
I love it.

1790
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:44,440
I feel such emotion from that, especially also because that's when Donald Fagen's The

1791
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:45,440
Nightfly album came out.

1792
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:46,440
Yes.

1793
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,440
Hell yeah.

1794
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,440
Give me some applause on that.

1795
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,440
Greatest day in the history of the world.

1796
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:55,440
This is an Epcot continuation of a dream.

1797
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,440
Dawn of a new Disney era.

1798
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:00,440
Looks like Epcot opening polo shirt.

1799
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:01,440
Nice.

1800
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:02,440
Geez.

1801
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:05,440
Well, mine is a Soarin' polo shirt.

1802
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,440
That's a.

1803
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:11,440
I think that's Walt Disney Imagineering or one of the.

1804
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,440
Oh, that's the project team one.

1805
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:14,440
Yeah.

1806
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:15,440
Oh, wow.

1807
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:16,440
So that's how you worked on it.

1808
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:17,440
Happiest celebration on earth.

1809
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:18,440
That's fantastic.

1810
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:19,440
Geez.

1811
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:26,440
I was I was specifically complaining to Taylor about a Disney merch blog that posted an April

1812
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:33,440
Fool's story about the Muppet Vision 3D glasses being sold as sunglasses.

1813
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:38,440
Now each of us have a pair of the Muppet Vision 3D glasses on our faces.

1814
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:39,440
Wow.

1815
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:43,440
This looks oddly terrifying.

1816
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,440
What do we have here?

1817
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:50,440
These are 1940s and 1950s Ben Cooper Halloween costumes.

1818
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:51,440
Wow.

1819
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,440
Wait for it.

1820
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:53,440
Oh, hell yes.

1821
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:54,440
Mickey Mouse.

1822
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:55,440
What's the deal with Ben Cooper?

1823
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:56,440
Now they're very old.

1824
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:57,440
You probably don't want to take them out of the box.

1825
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:00,440
Like most of them, they have that really cool smell to them.

1826
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:01,440
It's because it's the gauze.

1827
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,440
That's what they used as mass back then.

1828
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:04,440
OK.

1829
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:05,440
Yeah.

1830
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,440
This is a hundred year old gauze.

1831
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,440
Yeah.

1832
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:09,440
Wow.

1833
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:17,440
It's Donald mass looks like he's in the strangers, the strangers who come to your house and terrorize

1834
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:18,440
you.

1835
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:19,440
Wow.

1836
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,440
Mickey's mouth is like caving in.

1837
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:23,440
Whoa.

1838
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:26,440
This is how I felt after the wings.

1839
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:29,440
This Pluto is pretty cute.

1840
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:30,440
I love Pluto.

1841
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:31,440
It is the best shape.

1842
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,440
Pluto is definitely doing pretty good.

1843
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:34,440
This is awesome.

1844
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:35,440
Geez.

1845
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:36,440
Gosh.

1846
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:37,440
Thank you so much.

1847
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:38,440
This is insane.

1848
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:42,440
This is incredible history mixed with terror, which we love.

1849
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:43,440
That's fantastic.

1850
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:48,440
I mean, it reminds the old like how like weird and scary the old Mickey costumes were in the

1851
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:49,440
50s.

1852
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:50,440
You've seen those old photos.

1853
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:51,440
It flashes you right to that.

1854
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:52,440
That's so cool.

1855
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:53,440
I love these.

1856
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:54,440
I have several because I love them so much.

1857
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:55,440
Oh, yeah.

1858
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:56,440
This is going on my Disney shelf.

1859
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:57,440
Yeah.

1860
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:58,440
I know you guys appreciate it.

1861
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:02,440
And like I said, I love going to Lakeland Antique Mall and I love going shopping.

1862
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:06,440
A lot of these props you can actually go buy right here down.

1863
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,440
It's right in Lakeland.

1864
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,440
And it's really cool.

1865
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:13,440
It's awesome that you get to find like little bits of history.

1866
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,440
I love it.

1867
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:15,440
Yeah.

1868
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:16,440
Could you you think you said this?

1869
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:20,440
You have some of a country bear thing that I was very intrigued by.

1870
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:22,440
Oh, I got teddy bear's fur.

1871
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:23,440
Yeah.

1872
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:24,440
Whoa.

1873
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:25,440
Whoa.

1874
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,440
Yeah.

1875
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:27,440
I totally forgot.

1876
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:29,440
Teddy bear is fur.

1877
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:30,440
Yes.

1878
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:33,440
And it even has some of the pink stuff still left on it.

1879
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:34,440
It's from a refer.

1880
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:37,440
And a lot of that stuff you can get checked with like property control and stuff.

1881
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:43,440
And if it's sold through any of the old Disney, Anna, like auctions, it all comes with certifications.

1882
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,440
So it's really cool.

1883
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:49,440
Nate, the energy with which you said that, I truly thought you were about to say, yeah,

1884
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:51,440
I got teddy bear's phone number.

1885
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,440
Yeah.

1886
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:55,440
Oh, I'll be right up.

1887
01:32:55,440 --> 01:33:02,440
Yeah.

1888
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:03,440
Whoa.

1889
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:04,440
Wow.

1890
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:08,440
I don't know where else to go from there.

1891
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:09,440
That's oh my God.

1892
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:14,440
You know, let me let me do something really quick on the end because to make sure that we fully covered.

1893
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:20,440
You can't talk about Food and Wine Festival without bringing up Eat to the Beat.

1894
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:22,440
Somebody bought something for Mike.

1895
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:23,440
For me?

1896
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,440
Oh, wow.

1897
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:29,440
Casa Migos.

1898
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:30,440
Wow.

1899
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:31,440
Right on time.

1900
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,440
Like, we're winding it down.

1901
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:33,440
You know what, Nate?

1902
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:39,440
There was a third silent person involved in Casa Migos named Michael Melman.

1903
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,440
And you don't see him on the ads with you.

1904
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,440
You don't see the ads of George and Randy.

1905
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:47,440
He's not on those ads, but he is very important in the story as well.

1906
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:51,440
And I just want everyone to know that or remember it.

1907
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:52,440
It's less good than the briefcase.

1908
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:55,440
Wait. OK. So say his name and then do the shot.

1909
01:33:55,440 --> 01:34:01,440
Thank you, Michael Melman.

1910
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,440
Yeah. There he does it.

1911
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:04,440
There he goes.

1912
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:07,440
And now that's perfect timing because here's what I was going to do.

1913
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:11,440
I was about to give Mike one of his favorite experiences in the world.

1914
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:13,440
And it is in here's what here's what my plan was.

1915
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:16,440
And I'll need your help with a little applause on this, too.

1916
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:19,440
Food and Wine is happening, but something else happens during that.

1917
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:25,440
It's at the American Adventure Outdoor Stage and it's called the Eat to the Beat concert series.

1918
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:38,440
And this is where all of Mike's favorite bands come to rock, to jam, to play the three songs of theirs, you know, and then three others.

1919
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:41,440
The Sick Nasty is Bands in America. Yeah.

1920
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:46,440
So here's the gift I'm going to give you now with some tequila coursing through your veins.

1921
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:51,440
I'm going to say the names of some of the bands that played this year in twenty twenty three.

1922
01:34:51,440 --> 01:35:01,440
And I would like you to do the ultimate Mike, a song is on finger point and ever been and let's whatever you feel like you want to do audience.

1923
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:06,440
OK, so here we go. Who's played this year? Why we got Hanson.

1924
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:08,440
Yeah, Bob Bob.

1925
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:16,440
I watched Hanson set about a week ago on YouTube from me to the beat from me to the beat.

1926
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:24,440
And tell me, Nate, if you've been to any of these, the Joey Fatone and Friends watched it as well.

1927
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:29,440
But one up saw it on YouTube. I did.

1928
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:35,440
That's amazing. My YouTube wants me to see the sets from me to the beat now.

1929
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:39,440
Uh huh. It's the well. Yeah, it's that and the person next to me.

1930
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:42,440
Your entire algorithm.

1931
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:45,440
Let's give it up for the Baja man.

1932
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:51,440
Oh, we left the dog one up. I saw them at Epcot in twenty nineteen.

1933
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,440
Oh, yeah, you did that one. No, that's right.

1934
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:58,440
Well, I'm sorry that you didn't get to do Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.

1935
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:01,440
We are competing. They were tonight.

1936
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:04,440
We're competing with Big Band. Oh, we probably lost some audience.

1937
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:09,440
Oh, geez. I thought it seemed a little thin out here.

1938
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,440
It's electric Daisy Carnival night, too.

1939
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:15,440
Wow. It is busy right now.

1940
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:21,440
Let's I know you're going to want to put one up for Sugar Ray Sugar Ray.

1941
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:23,440
Have you seen Nate? Have you seen him?

1942
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:28,440
I did. I've seen him many a times. I love every morning.

1943
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:31,440
This is why this is why I watch you.

1944
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:34,440
We're on the same. This is why you'll be the second host soon enough.

1945
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:36,440
The deal will be made backstage.

1946
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:42,440
And finally, let's all put one in the air for Hoobastank.

1947
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:45,440
Hoobastank. And one more thing.

1948
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:47,440
I think this could be a good applause line.

1949
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:51,440
This is something that I think we'll all remember for a while that after this great day of friendship

1950
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:56,440
and Epcot drinking that we were at the front of the park and we were under Spaceship Earth

1951
01:36:56,440 --> 01:37:00,440
when we found out that the sag after a strike was over.

1952
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:06,440
Yeah. Yeah.

1953
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:11,440
Hypothetically, we can work again if we get cast in theory.

1954
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,440
We can work again.

1955
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:17,440
The only problem now is that no one wants to hire us.

1956
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:20,440
Back to my believe you said the miracle of Epcot.

1957
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:22,440
Dude, dude, dude.

1958
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:25,440
It was an Epcot miracle.

1959
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:28,440
This entire thing was an Epcot miracle.

1960
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:33,440
And now I'm happy. I was just so happy you could do it with us.

1961
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:37,440
Nate Paging, Mr. Morrow, You Survive podcast, the ride.

1962
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,440
Give it up for the sky.

1963
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:46,440
I'm so glad you could do it. Oh, my God.

1964
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:51,440
Completer Griffin Newman, you completed podcast, the ride.

1965
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:55,440
You came from fucking New York and I've had a great time with you all week.

1966
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,440
I'm so glad he did it for you guys.

1967
01:37:57,440 --> 01:38:00,440
I got two stamps, one from each live show tonight.

1968
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:04,440
Yeah, you completed both shows.

1969
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:07,440
I think a lot of you folks completed both shows too.

1970
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:11,440
And we thank you so much. We can we thank everybody who came to all of them.

God damn. I want to do this every single Friday night.

1973
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:24,440
I think you guys probably all do too.

1974
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:29,440
