Welcome to Podcast the Ride the Second Gate, the best podcast Patreon in all the land,

2
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,720
don't you deserve the best. I'm Sky Gardener, there's my Carlson. Hello, I'm my Carlson and

3
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,320
I'm sure that's the only time you're gonna hear the voice today. I won't promise it. Getting it

4
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,760
out of the way now. There's no way. I don't feel like I need to do the voice. Yes, but you don't

5
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,400
want to be sweaty or desperate. Oh no, there I am doing it again. Jason. Hi, I'm here too. Oh no,

6
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,560
Jason got extra timid. He went the other way. I got scared by the loud voices. Oh no, it's Jason,

7
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:04,440
Jason like slash, I don't know, like what's a fun like child character? What's the most famous child

8
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:17,160
character of all time? Oh, Lilo? Yeah, Jason mixed with Lilo. Lilo's not a coward. What about Cindy

9
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,440
Luhu? Was that a Cindy Luhu style voice perhaps? Mr. Grinch, whatever she says. I don't know if

10
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,440
any of these are the most famous child character of all time, though I'm struggling to come up with

11
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:32,120
a replacement. Kevin McAllister. Oh, the most famous child character of all time, Peter Pan,

12
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:39,080
the boy who doesn't grow up. But that wasn't a Peter Pan, that was more of like little Michael.

13
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:47,320
Yeah, the eighth most popular lost boy. Yeah. Yeah, one way towards the back. He's got like,

14
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,720
he's not even a key, he's not even a rabbit or a fox or you know what they wear on their heads.

15
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:59,800
I'll watch your flank or no, I'll watch your back. Oh God, guys, I'm starting to think I should grow

16
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:06,840
up. I like the cut of your jib kid. That's right. No more of this eternal kid. You're the least

17
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,840
creepy of the bunch, kiddo. I don't think I went around this island anymore. I just want to like

18
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:21,240
send emails, send an office and do email. That's right. We vilified Peter Banning and his big cell

19
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,920
phone, but I say get on the big cell phone. Start moving and shaking, getting things done in this

20
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:34,120
world. Yeah, I just want to send emails as a really interesting. It is kind of a good encapsulation

21
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:40,920
of adults in most of what being an adult is. Yeah. Yeah, either hard labor or email job. Those

22
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,440
are your two options. Right. We chose email job, I guess. Yeah, emails. Much closer to it. What it is,

23
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:54,440
I'd say, unless it is a performing job. And that's what we're talking about today is a particular

24
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,960
performing job. And I don't think we've settled yet as we recorded on what we're calling it,

25
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:08,680
but what we're focusing on is the Gaston face character in the parks. Right. Or I don't know

26
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,640
if we call it walk around Gaston. I don't know if we call it meet and greet Gaston.

27
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:24,280
There's versions of it. I met and greeted him years ago. I think it's Gret. I think Gret is the

28
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,880
met and greeted. You met and you met and you met and Gret. And then he beat the shit out of you.

29
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:35,560
Yes. Beat the shit out of you. Right, the shit. But then he walks around sometimes, too. So I

30
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,400
think it depends. So it's like, I was going to also for part of me was like, oh, yeah, they don't do

31
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,480
this in Disneyland. So we'll call it Walt Disney World Gaston or something. And I'm like, no,

32
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,880
they do do it in Disneyland. I've seen videos of it, but I've never seen him in Disneyland.

33
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:55,240
Yeah. And he's in the he's been in the shows perennially. That's another way to experience

34
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,200
Gaston is in the Beauty and the Beast musical. But that's not what this is. I mean, we're focusing,

35
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:07,480
I think, on the particular type that they started doing in 2012 with the new Fantasyland expansion,

36
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,800
where you can get in a line, have a moment with Gaston and, you know, who obviously is the

37
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:21,160
antagonist of Beauty and the Beast, who is a very barrel chested, egotist cheeseball.

38
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:28,280
Sure. And boy, have they encapsulated the character really well in these meet and greet

39
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,320
moments that you get that they have just gone full throttle and let these these fun park

40
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:40,120
performers go nuts. Yes. Let me ask this, though, because you came up with the phrase off-brand

41
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:46,120
Doc Brown. Do you think this is off-brand off-brand Gaston? I don't, because the rules

42
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:53,560
change when you are moving mediums from animation to a live person. I think what feels so weird

43
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:00,280
about another Doc Brown walking around is that we know that that's supposed to be Christopher Lloyd.

44
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:08,200
Right. And also they get the wig so wrong so often. Yeah. That's that's a separate aspect,

45
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:14,040
as opposed to this, where I think the wigs are immaculate, the wardrobe is immaculate. They get

46
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,840
the open chest right. They get the muscles right. Yes. And I also, Christopher Lloyd, I guess,

47
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,240
is just so specific of a performer. It's just you're always going to be like, that doesn't

48
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,280
really, that's not quite the character. Yeah. But I don't know, there's something about Gaston that

49
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,040
I feel like so many different people can play him. I've seen so many different videos of him being

50
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,160
played by different people. And I go, oh, that's good. And that's good. And that's right on. And

51
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,880
different flavors. Some people get, you know, some people get the look exactly right. Sometimes it's

52
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,480
attitude. Sometimes it's voice. Yeah. But it's always, yeah, I don't know, it's become a fun,

53
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:55,320
open-ended assignment for performers to put their stamp on. And I don't want to sidetrack.

54
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,600
And what I'm going to mention is going to be old news by the time the

55
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,600
listeners hearing this, but it's impossible for me to ignore. And I'm curious if it's the same

56
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:12,200
for you guys, because I guess what I'm asking is, is it tough for you guys on this particular

57
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:18,680
morning, Thursday, April 11th, to record this episode under the shadow of the surprise

58
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:27,480
announcement of the death of American icon OJ Simpson? Maybe, you know, to me, it is a massive

59
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,360
elephant in the room. To you guys, the elephant might not even be in the room. But I need to,

60
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,800
we didn't even talk about it as small talk on the way into record. I think I need to process a tiny

61
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,760
bit. Sure. On the Gaston episode specifically, you think? I do. Well, and you know, it tied

62
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:48,360
together in my head, I think, because I think there are some similarities between Gaston and

63
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:55,720
the dearly departed OJ Simpson. You know, a strapping guy, an incredible physical specimen. Yes.

64
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:05,320
Huge, imposing, muscular, you know, lives among all of his totems of his achievements. That's

65
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:13,400
true, yeah. You know, but also not great attitudes towards women. You know, wants them to be

66
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:20,600
subjugated and domesticated. And Gaston also, as we learn, is, I don't know if he doesn't get to do

67
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:26,760
it in the film ultimately, but he certainly desires to murder. Well, because a beast,

68
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:33,320
of course, you're referring to Gaston's attempted murder of the beast. Yes, yeah, yeah. He not only,

69
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:40,360
you know, he's got the dark charisma of OJ Simpson to where he can lead a group to, you know,

70
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,040
to all want to do this terrible thing together. I mean, if you, maybe, you know, the angle,

71
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,120
if you would come in with more of like a Here's Lucy guest star has passed away.

72
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,240
That's more of what I'm like, well, now I'm ready. Was he not? I feel like he, what is the,

73
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,680
I wonder what the most up your alley thing is. I mean, I've definitely seen OJ doing magic

74
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,280
as introduced by Bea Arthur. Well, he was on Here's Lucy. Yeah. And he was, oh, he was.

75
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,040
That's what I'm saying. He was on Here's Lucy. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Has this come up before?

76
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,400
It has. And does this qualify as a PTR curse? This might be the third time I've brought it

77
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,040
up on the show, actually. I'm pretty sure. I'd believe it. I'm pretty sure. Uh-huh. Here's Lucy

78
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:23,000
tends to be, that's just one of those like erasers for me. Here's Lucy, yeah, well, for the, for the

79
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,560
public. Not, I love Lucy, but you throw here's in there and then I immediately forget the fact. Well,

80
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,840
I love Lucy, Lucy Show, then Here's Lucy, which ran for like seven years. And it's full of. Like

81
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,760
more than the, are there more Here's Lucys? There might be. Yeah. I actually don't know that off,

82
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,960
but yeah, there were. OJ is in the episode with Ginger Rogers, right? And they all make a line

83
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,040
and they're like, well, I think I still got it. And they all do a little dance. That is right.

84
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,560
You're not making a joke. Huh? That's real, right? No, I am making a joke. Oh, okay. I don't know. I

85
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:57,560
believe it. Absolutely. OJ and Ginger Rogers. Except when did Ginger Rogers die? That'd be my

86
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:03,480
biggest question. Doesn't matter. She was on Here's Lucy after she is dead. You think, you think a

87
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,000
death is an obstacle to being booked on Here's Lucy? Also 1995, so she was alive. Here's Lucy,

88
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,680
you could be a ghost and appear on it. That's something you people don't know.

89
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,320
So that's why I was confused by Jason. What was so notable about the show is like it was the,

90
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:21,080
it was the first and only post-death appearance of many of the golden age of Hollywood's greats.

91
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,520
And Jason said that so confidently because I've seen the clip of OJ and Here's Lucy. I've not

92
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,360
seen the full episode. I didn't watch the full episode of Here's Lucy. No, I just said that

93
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,200
because there was a clip that went around a while ago. Oh, where she's dancing with her daughter

94
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,960
and Ginger Rogers. Yes. And Lucy LaValle and her daughter are dancing. Yes. And the crowd is loving

95
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:44,680
it. They're so excited to see the old, the old gang doing a little dance. Sure. Yeah. And I recently

96
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:51,320
brought up the, the Jackie Gleason appearance with, with Jack Benny on the Here's Lucy clip

97
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:58,840
that I just saw like a couple of weeks ago. OJ goes to speak. He's a guest speaker at a Beverly

98
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:06,360
Hills chamber of commerce luncheon planned by Lucy. Then there, then he helps him get into a USC

99
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:14,120
football game. Wow. He talks about his real life first wife, Marguerite, and his kids in it. Wow.

100
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:20,280
Which this website says gives it an eerie feel. But it all has an eerie feel now that we're,

101
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:26,840
now that we're talking about him having said goodbye to him. Sure. But anyway, well,

102
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,960
okay, obviously we got to do this then all of, we, we, we, we, we have to go through all of his

103
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:39,160
variety show sitcom appearances to properly send them off. Sure. Sure. Here, here's Lucy. Of course,

104
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:46,600
I first became aware of, uh, in the gift shop for Lucy attribute and there were all these DVDs.

105
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,720
I love Lucy, Lucy show. And I'm, I was standing there. I was like, what the fuck is this?

106
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,280
Here's Lucy. I think it's funny. I bring up like the, the death of a, like one of the most

107
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,400
memorable figures in history. And there's a little bit of interest in it, but here's Lucy

108
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,640
becomes, I'd like to talk about when I first saw it, here's Lucy DVD. Well, you're hosting

109
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:13,320
the show with two lunatics. I hate to tell you. Well, I was trying to try and tie back to Lucy

110
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:20,120
attribute. No, I'm on board with Jason. I'm back to Lucy attribute. We weren't on Lucy attribute.

111
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,480
Yeah. I'm Jason's right on my wavelength here. All right. Well then you, I'm sorry I interrupted.

112
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,840
Do you have anything to say about the first time that Jason learned about here's Lucy?

113
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,080
No, he wasn't done with his important story yet. Was, were you not? Was there more story?

114
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,520
Oh, no. I mean, I was pretty much done. Uh, the back of the DVD is explained. It was the show he

115
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:44,440
made, she made with her kids. Right. Yes. So I was like, oh, okay. That makes sense. I understand.

116
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,560
Now somebody calmed you down and said, no, no, read the back of the box. That makes sense. I

117
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,440
understand that. Yes. Before that you were livid. You were starting, you were foaming from the mouth.

118
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,360
I was. Get on compute. You thought you were going to seizure the death. I only knew two.

119
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,640
It was a Lucy show I don't know about. I'm not spending enough time with Mike Carlson, clearly.

120
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:11,720
Gail Gordon was on this too. I believe playing her brother, not Mr. Mooney, her boss. By the way,

121
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:18,280
club three subscribers, uh, get Gail, just somebody suggest Gail Gordon as a topic for the next poll

122
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:23,560
so that we can see it land right around 2%. Let's just watch it coast right in there.

123
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,880
One of these days I'm going to have a big victory with one of these and it's going to shock the

124
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:35,400
nation. That's why I stay consistent with it. I think. And, uh, you know, um, yeah, keep,

125
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,840
keep aiming in the right, the same direction. Somebody point, somebody pointed out the new

126
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:44,360
Beetlejuice trailer. A Beetlejuice says the juice is loose at the end of it, um, which yeah,

127
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,800
that's interesting. Yeah. And now he was the, OJ was the nickname was the juice. And now it's,

128
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:55,560
they obviously can't include this in the film, but now OJ could hang out with Beetlejuice.

129
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:01,240
That's true. They could do reshoots, I suppose. And do that. I mean, they can't, I mean more

130
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,920
like in the war, if we believe that Beetlejuice is real. And we do. Yeah. Yes. Yes. And we do.

131
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:14,040
Putting on daily graveyard reviews, uh, in, in, in where does he live? Does he live in hell? What

132
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,800
is Beetlejuice's afterlife? That's a good question. There's probably a name for it that I don't

133
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,200
remember. I haven't seen the movie in a long time. I like the movie. Uh, this movie also is

134
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,520
going to be very serious. It's just very serious. It feels, you know, the tone is the, I mean,

135
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:32,360
when I heard the serious day, Oh, it was the serious day. Oh, one thing I never liked about

136
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,120
Beetlejuice one is they, they took, they were so flippant about day. Oh, daylight come and me want

137
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:45,400
to go home. Right, right. Isn't it? Isn't that a joke? I don't know. Every real, every trailer does

138
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:51,400
serious versions of, I thought that was a parody of every trailer doing. I think you're giving

139
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:57,160
them a lot of credit. I'd like to believe that Jason, but I feel like I've seen it with dumber

140
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:05,320
songs. I have gone back and forth on it. There's also the same like Ecto one reveal dusty pull away

141
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:11,880
and it's the little town, the same like you remember this thing when you were little, here it is under

142
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,640
a dusty cloth, a dusty blanket. I don't remember if they did this, but I, I, I bet probably there

143
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:25,880
was like a, you know, an eerie sounding six year old girl saying an invisible man sleeping in your

144
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,800
bed and then it gets dubstep. That's another important thing about current trailers. We have

145
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:40,440
to do dubstep the 13 year old musical genre. We have to slow down songs, then dubstep them.

146
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,320
Yeah. Yeah, for sure. I hope we know this never changes. This is, this is trailers forever.

147
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,000
Anyway, sidetrack got us off the, I just wanted to, it's, it's on my mind. Sure. It just happened.

148
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,360
This whole time we're recording, it's like, I'm imagining a hulking OJ Simpson behind me. Right.

149
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,080
Upset if I don't acknowledge him. Well, again, like Jason, I want to remember the simpler times

150
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:06,440
when he was dancing with Ginger Rogers and Lucio Ball and her children, you know, that's the way

151
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:12,920
we're thinking. Yeah, a nice memory. We Mandela affected ourselves. From now on it was, it was

152
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,680
on the Ginger Rogers episode. Yeah, sure. And if, if that wasn't the case, then we can AI it very

153
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:25,000
easily. But again, you know, I, oh, I read the weirdest AI article about Don Knotts yesterday

154
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:31,800
that said Don Knotts shot himself in the head on Sullivan's show. AI prompts, come up with an

155
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:38,280
exact sentence that Mike Carlson would say. Yeah, I am AI, but literally the story was just, it was

156
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:43,560
like saying it was a history that Don Knotts had pulled a gun out on the stage at the Ed Sullivan

157
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:49,960
show and shot himself in the head on live TV. And I'm like, this did not happen. I know. Sorry. Wait,

158
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:56,280
who said Don Knotts shot himself? This AI article I was reading yesterday. Claimed that. Don Knotts

159
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,280
had killed himself on the Ed Sullivan show, live on the air.

160
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,640
Okay. Well, this is, I was reading about Don Knotts and going, I agree. Don Knotts was alive in the

161
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:16,120
nineties. This isn't true. Unless he went back to the, like, I don't, I don't exactly know how he

162
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:24,040
died. I don't think that he went to the David Letterman, now hosting a theater, the Ed Sullivan

163
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:29,000
theater and killed himself there. Well, I, I, I was reading this and I'm like, this is, it didn't

164
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,880
say it was AI, but I assumed it was AI. Unless there was a sick, twisted person trying to make

165
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,480
people think that this happened to Don Knotts. Is this close enough in your history, you could say

166
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,880
the name of the website that- You can take a look. A website that is a source of AI Don Knotts

167
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,760
articles. Yes. And why, how did you, what do you think was the Google prompt that led you

168
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,360
to an article that said Don Knotts killed himself? I think I was looking up with Don Knotts' death.

169
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:59,880
I think I was looking up- Well, Mike was looking at his favorite website. It's called ZergNet and

170
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:06,280
it's at the bottom of all websites. And he's like, wait a minute. You were just, just calming

171
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:13,640
yourself at the end of a long, busy day with reminding yourself how Don Knotts died. I swear

172
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,920
we'll talk about Gaston. We will, but I am curious. I do want to know, I want to know the history. I

173
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:23,640
want to know the search that led you here and then what is this so that we can all not trust

174
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,760
this website. Was it InsideTheMagic.net? I'm looking so far, the first Don Knotts results I've had

175
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,560
from yesterday is when I was looking up Don Knotts as Les Calhoun, his character from Matlock,

176
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,320
where he would join the show later and it was just Andy Griffith's neighbor.

177
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,600
And there's like a compilation of Les Calhoun clips that I was watching.

178
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,800
Uh-huh. How many hours a day of your life are devoted to Don Knotts?

179
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,000
Yesterday, 20 minutes or so, 22 minutes perhaps.

180
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,680
If you average that out, some days it's more like 40, some days are tough, you only get four.

181
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,720
Okay, here it is. It's RobotMonkeys.net.

182
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,120
So we can't trust RobotMonkeys.net anymore?

183
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,080
No. And then it said, on June 30th, 1963, comedic actor Don Knotts shot himself in the head with a

184
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:17,720
.38 caliber revolver during the live airing of the Ed Sullivan show. And I was like, that's,

185
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:24,760
that is not true. I know. I'm smart. I know what happened. And that did not happen. So then there's

186
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,600
a whole like, there's a decent amount of text here about this fake thing that didn't happen.

187
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:39,080
So this is, this is what you get up to when we aren't with you. We need to record more episodes

188
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,960
to try to stop you from going down these rabbit holes. Jason, we need to start committing to six

189
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,440
episodes a day to keep Mike away from dangerous ends of the internet, like RobotMonkeys.net.

190
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,360
This wasn't going to come up. This was for me. I didn't tell anyone about this.

191
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:59,240
I may have sent Andrew Grissom the less Calhoun compilation, but other than that,

192
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,520
I wasn't going to tell anybody about this. This just organically has come up.

193
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:07,480
Yo, you're so embarrassed and upset that suddenly you found yourself talking about Don Knotts's

194
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,960
I'm not embarrassed. I'm just explaining this was for me. This was not for-

195
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,760
I did not want to talk about this. Don't make me talk about it.

196
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:20,200
Don't make me sing. Yeah. Like this is a real, oh gosh, how embarrassed. Yeah.

197
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:27,800
Then I get to talk about less Calhoun, Don's famous character. That was not the,

198
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:35,560
what's Mr. Furly and then Barney. We were almost on our way to a particularly

199
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:41,560
tidy episode. We almost got there. Like the top of it was really tight. It was my fault.

200
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:47,800
I of course know that it was my fault. Oh wait, but now I'm like, any results for Don Knotts,

201
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:57,400
O.J. Simpson? I do, is this real? I'm looking at a photo of O.J. doing a stick up with a gun

202
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,600
in 1980 at Knotts Berry Farm. Oh my God, really?

203
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,920
Is this photoshopped or is this real? Whoa. I don't know.

204
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,200
Why would this be made up? I don't know.

205
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,240
Why would the Ed Sullivan show be made up? Yeah, that's true.

206
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,720
You think that's real? I don't know what to trust anymore.

207
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:22,680
It's hard to know what to trust on the internet. But unless you're like a real Don Knotts scholar

208
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,880
who really knows about his life, like I kind of am, an amateur scholar of Don Knotts' life,

209
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,760
but you're not going to be able to know. Now we're precariously in the zone of having

210
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:38,680
to declare a false start, which we could do, but I think we can veer it back. I think we can get

211
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:45,640
there. I just won't even try to do a tidy segue. Well, you know, Don Knotts is not the physical

212
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,160
specimen. That guest John is. No one fights like Don Knotts.

213
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:59,080
No one mugs like Don Knotts. No one stays on Mike Carlson's mind like Don Knotts.

214
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:10,280
Okay. 2012, new fantasy land expansion. An area opens called the Enchanted Forest,

215
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:18,120
and this is a bigger committed to Beauty and the Beast land within a mini land within an expansion.

216
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:25,800
And I kind of thought about how much real estate they gave Gaston.

217
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:35,880
Because you've got Gaston's tavern now. You can go into the bar where he has songs sung about

218
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:43,640
himself and he uses antlers in all of his decorating. There is a really fun statue out there,

219
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:51,720
which is him kind of holding a bunch of barrels that water is pouring out of using the area.

220
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:58,760
That's the fountain aspect. He's stepping on a very beleaguered LeFou, his constant companion.

221
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:05,240
The plaque, I think, says that the statue is twice polished by LeFou.

222
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:14,440
So this whole zone is very fun using the egotistical nature and the put upon nature of LeFou.

223
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:21,800
For a while, they had a variant of the turkey leg, which was a big pork shank.

224
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:31,480
You could get and eat as if you were Gaston eating a big pork shank. It doesn't appear

225
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,000
that is on the menu anymore. You think the pork shank is gone?

226
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I think the pork shank is gone. What's on the menu at Gaston's? Because I think there was

227
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,480
like kind of a, they don't sell alcohol there, but you could get something that was kind of

228
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,680
like a kid's fun drink. Yeah, I thought it was funny. I do have this in front of me.

229
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:56,520
Meal period snack. And then the section is labeled quick bites. So if you want a Quibi,

230
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:02,440
go to Gaston's Tavern. And they have the gray stuff cupcake, which you can also get at Disneyland,

231
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:08,600
which is a pretty fun dessert. I did think it was weird that like, okay, so Gaston's Tavern,

232
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,640
they've got to have some big meaty like shanks. That makes sense to me that they started there,

233
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,920
but now it's a ham sandwich. You get a ham sandwich with chips.

234
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,240
Ham sandwich or wormson and roll. Or the cupcake.

235
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:27,480
And then non-alcoholic like fizzy apple juice, essentially, which is funny to imagine, you know,

236
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,880
the machismo of that tavern in the movie. And in real life, you can go there and drink apple juice

237
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:39,480
and have a ham sandwich and chips. Uh-huh. You know, it's like Jason's tavern.

238
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,080
I was going to say Jason, the worms, warm cinnamon roll and apple juice.

239
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:51,960
You kidding me? That's like your heaven. I honestly, I never really saw any like glowing

240
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:58,920
reviews of the pork shank. Pork also works. I never saw like that. I don't think caught on

241
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:04,120
like the turkey leg. For one thing, I feel like that is very greasy.

242
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,160
Yeah, it might not be. Well, I mean, turkey leg and they've, I feel like they've engineered

243
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:15,640
the turkey leg over time to be a tidier meal, even though it's not, it's still like a giant thing.

244
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:23,480
I'm looking at it on disneyfoodblog.com and this, what I'm looking at is pretty disgusting.

245
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,520
It doesn't look good. I know it looks like very fatty and kind of disconcertingly

246
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:36,520
white and then the, the big bone. Uh, unless this is AI generated, like, I don't know what

247
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:41,080
website, I can't research live on the air anymore. Right. I'm going to run into one of these monkey

248
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,960
situations. Right. Monkey robot. What is it? Monkey robot. And there's, wait a minute. They said they,

249
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:52,760
they served monkey shanks here once too. That can't be right. Right. It was a much more robust menu.

250
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,880
Yes. When I went the first time, I feel like it was more robust even. And yeah, they didn't,

251
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:04,520
yeah. You run into the problem, of course, where it's like a G rated movie and you can't like

252
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:10,040
serve beer in there. I guess I'm trying to think of an example of a place where was, is there anywhere

253
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,920
that's like technically themed to a G rated movie where they are selling alcohol at all?

254
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:20,360
Like, is that, is that the problem? Is there no precedent for that? Where isn't, um, I was going

255
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:26,760
to say Mario. There's no alcohol in Mario land. No, no alcohol in Mario. Um, you can, can't you get,

256
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:34,120
uh, in Toy Story land. Minions. Minions. Yeah. Minions cafe. You can get a beer in there or

257
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,440
something. You can get some tall boys. Yeah. And right across from Minions and Secret Life of Pets

258
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:45,240
is that dreaded, uh, tavern where you can, you can get hammered. A den of debauchery. A den of

259
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:51,080
debauchery. Yeah. You can have a puppet. You can add the, the puppet from Secret Life of Pets. The,

260
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:58,200
what? The puppy or puppet? There is a, there's a puppet sort of like the New York street actors.

261
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,880
Oh, there's one of the character from Secret Life of Pets in those facades that'll yell at you. Oh,

262
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:10,280
okay. So yeah, you can get hammered and get yelled at by a puppet. Yeah. Which is pretty fun. But is

263
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:16,360
there a Disney example of that? Probably not, right? Toy Story. I think you can, I think, yeah,

264
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,720
you can get beer in Toy Story. In Toy Story land. Mm-hmm. In Woody's, like, lunchbox. I think so. Is

265
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,560
that, or is that just the stand? I forget. I think so. I remember because it was brought up,

266
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,800
like, again, as all things alcohol are. This was brought up years ago by Jason, like,

267
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:35,080
and you can get beer in the Toy Story, but it's always brought up as if, like, you can watch a

268
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:42,040
live sex show in a theme park. It's always the tone. Oh, boy. Wait, so you'd be okay with that,

269
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:49,560
Jason? Well, after dark, you know, if it was, like, an after hours event. It's alcohol always

270
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:54,200
scandalous. Live sex at a theme park. This we're okay with. What if there was, after 9 p.m. on the

271
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:59,320
Great Movie Ride, they would switch one of the scenes out for just a porno. Or just, like,

272
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,720
yeah, rotate it around. Or something. Yeah. And Great Movie Ride would now just have one scene

273
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:09,000
that was a porno. Wow. Like, Footlight Parade isn't there anymore. It's just a porno in its place. No.

274
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:15,960
Oh, wait, sorry, sorry. The Great Spank Movie Ride. Okay, sure. Yeah, yeah. Well, even if they could

275
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,720
do it during hour, they should just have the Xenomorph has Little Mouth come out and Little

276
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,080
Mouth says, come up and see me sometime. Why? Oh, that, when you say live sex show, that's what you

277
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:33,960
mean. You want. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Maywest innuendo, yeah. I don't know if I can keep doing the episode.

278
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:42,040
I'm so aroused by that image. That's going to be in that new, that new Alien movie. I think that's

279
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:48,120
actually a scene in there. Whatever it's called, that Romulus, Alien Romulus, I believe is the

280
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:53,160
new Alien movie. Is there a TV show coming? I've lost track of the Alien. If there's a famous movie,

281
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:57,400
there's a TV show coming. It either was just canceled and they're doing a new one in two

282
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,520
years or it is coming. So I'm pretty sure there is like a Noah Hawley Alien show or something.

283
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:09,480
Yeah. They're doing, they're doing a, here's Lucy, like a prequel where it takes six seasons

284
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:16,840
to even get to Lucy. Right. Thank goodness. It will be so boring until. Yeah. Gail Gordon calls

285
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:24,040
herself Black Blood and then throws something in a river and that causes. It causes Lucy to be born?

286
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,840
Oh yeah. And then you see, you see a little shape form and then it sprouts a little bit of red hair.

287
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,240
Yeah. And you, if you listen close to him, it's very like guttural animal, but it sounds like

288
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:43,800
I want to be in that show. Okay. Who are we? I don't know. Gaston's Tavern.

289
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:49,560
Punchy one. Gaston's Tavern. Really? So yeah, they could, I guess, because of the Toy Story

290
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,960
precedent, they could have beer at Gaston's Tavern. I think like, well, I don't know what,

291
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,880
I don't know what the problem would be. Well, we're operating, we're operating.

292
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,760
They have wine in the Beauty and the Beast restaurant. What am I even saying?

293
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:05,400
Yeah. I think there actually may be many examples of alcohol in G rated movie places.

294
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,280
Why wouldn't you have a big stein of some kind and serve beer in Gaston's Tavern?

295
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:17,800
Because if Walt found out that there was, you know, Walt's intention was Castle Park. If there

296
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:24,440
is Castle, then alcohol can only be in three select places surrounding Castle. I guess it is

297
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:30,040
because it's in the Magic Kingdom and it can't walk around. No, you have to be seated and you

298
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,440
have to be served. So that's got to be what it is then. It's just that there's no seating at

299
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:40,440
Gaston's Tavern and they don't want you roaming like every other park where you're allowed to roam.

300
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,400
Because I don't know, you'll get it on, because Small World's too close by, I guess.

301
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,720
Like it's too, you'll dump it in, you'll dump the beer in the river.

302
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,440
The Small World's drugged out naked guy is what they've been fearing the entire time.

303
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,240
That's true, yeah.

304
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:03,400
That was Walt's vision. Walt actually saw all that in a vision with his last ounces of strength on

305
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,480
his deathbed. He drew exactly that naked guy.

306
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,280
Going into Small World.

307
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,840
And that's been in a vault at the studio. Like, I don't know, Walt saw something and I'm worried

308
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,440
that one day it'll happen. It's an apparition and we're going to see it someday.

309
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:16,840
Right.

310
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:22,520
And when that guy showed up on whatever he was on, all of Walt's worst nightmares came true.

311
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,560
The hand came out of the, Walt's hand came out of the grave.

312
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,840
I told you.

313
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,200
Give a big thumbs down.

314
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,920
Right. Yeah, no, he went right back in. He just was like, I wanted to see.

315
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,520
I'm going to be rolling down here, FYI.

316
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,440
But he said, the juice is loose.

317
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,680
Well, that's actually at Gaston's Tavern, the juice is loose.

318
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,400
The apple juice.

319
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,200
The apple juice, yeah.

320
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,080
And if you just, and if you like sugar highs, then the juice might get you a little juice.

321
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,800
Oh yeah. Have you been, have you been in there?

322
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,560
I think I just walked in, didn't buy anything. I just saw the Antler Room, which is great.

323
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,800
Which I, you know, I like that they have, as part of this expansion, that they gave Gaston

324
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:12,920
a big footprint because I do like Gaston. I always liked him in the movie. He's a great villain,

325
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:19,640
a fun villain. He turns so dark and murderous, but before that, he's a great love to hate

326
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:25,640
kind of character, a very funny blowhard that completely illustrates who Belle is,

327
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:33,480
that she is not like the three girls who together swoon over Gaston, who I guess were like,

328
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:41,560
they're like, any one of us, doesn't matter. Or all three at this, I mean, all three at the same

329
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:47,320
time would be the ideal, but yeah, but it shows you Belle's smarter than them.

330
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,720
Right. Or just, or has more refined taste.

331
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,320
Sure. And the song is fun. Like the song in the movie is funny. It's still funny.

332
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,720
Like it's kind of my favorite thing in the movie, even though the movie, I liked all of it.

333
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,760
Yes. Like, oh, this is really good. He's really funny.

334
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,440
It's always been very quotable to me. I don't remember what the, like,

335
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,120
I don't remember what the LeFou line is leading up to, I know.

336
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,880
Oh yeah. Yeah. It's a great voice. It's a, it's a, it's a wonderful bellow.

337
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,840
It's like in the wheelhouse. I like to stay in. It's one of the, he's one of the great bellowers.

338
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:26,440
And it's such a, like, it's funny that, I mean, I guess what it comes out at 91 and it's like,

339
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:32,120
I'm surprised it actually took them that long to put them in the, in the park because it's such a

340
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:38,040
fun character to do. And even still like, I'm surprised he's not in there more. I'm surprised

341
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:42,360
I haven't run into him in Disneyland because it seems like such a popular thing because all these

342
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,080
posts generally go viral, I feel, not all of them, but some of them. Well, and we're describing a

343
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:55,880
kind of old phenomenon. I feel like 2014, 15 seemingly was the time where these improvised

344
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:02,440
interactions in meet and greets had a pretty big viral footprint. And the view counts on some of

345
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:08,440
these are still immensely high and deservedly. So there seems to be, I mean, they're all really

346
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:15,160
funny, but there's one guy who really recurs and he's not exactly in that, like in that particular

347
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:20,200
voice range, but he, but the, like, he does just have this like blow hard. Whoa, what the fuck?

348
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:25,160
He's kind of like, he's almost like a situation kind of guy. Sure. Yeah. Just really what Gaston

349
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:31,720
is the original situation from Jersey shore. But boy, is he fun. Cause it's the same guy who

350
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:39,400
has the, um, I think there's a, I think there's a pushup contest situation where somebody

351
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:45,000
challenges them to do pushups. And I think there's the assumption, look, the muscles are fake,

352
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,160
the muscles in the suit are padded. So you might think maybe the guy's weaker under there,

353
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:57,000
but he'd boy, he did go for it with no preparation. This was faked or something,

354
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,640
but he ends up going, uh, one arm with it and the other guy crumbles pretty quickly.

355
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,600
Yeah. It almost feels like too perfect in a way. If it's completely impromptu, I don't know. I'm

356
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:13,160
not accusing anybody of anything. I'm just, it almost feels like planned in the perfect way that

357
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:19,080
it plays out where Gaston embarrasses this guy. It's really good. I saw a couple videos like that.

358
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:25,160
I think what it is is a lot of people can't do very many pushups. Well,

359
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:31,720
Gaston can probably do like a million pushups. Yeah. Oh, you're, so you're saying he,

360
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:37,320
maybe he's not like the strong man you might think he is. I think he needs an average shape

361
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:42,840
versus the average theme parkour. Well, I think he probably needs to be pretty fit when they're

362
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:49,480
casting, but I think they're like, how many pushups can you do? How much, what flex?

363
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,880
Could I, with the muscle suit, am I, I mean, maybe I've aged out of it, but could I do it with the

364
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:58,040
muscle suit? Could I play Gaston? Do you think I'm too, cause it's, I think height is a big thing too.

365
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,200
Height's a big part of it. But would it look, it might just look too strange. It'd be like,

366
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:07,880
why is Gaston so old and why his muscles don't even, they certainly aren't real.

367
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,480
I was going to say, why does Gaston seem so youthful? Like why is his Gaston so hip?

368
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,840
He might be 13. That's how youthful he is. Honestly, I feel like, can you even work when

369
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:23,480
they're, when you're that young? Whoa, this Gaston gave me a ride today and his shuffle went right

370
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:30,120
from Craig Finn to Haim. It was the reverse. Oh, excuse me. Haim to Craig Finn. Yeah. Well,

371
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:35,560
Haim, at least they're in their thirties. Craig Finn is in his fifties. I suppose so. Yeah.

372
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:40,280
So at least I'm like 10 years hip. I just mean in terms of cool music. Well, thank you for talking.

373
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:47,240
Also from the 2010s. Sure. Yeah. Wait, so you're okay. You're giving Mike credit for liking cool

374
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:54,760
music from the 2010s after a 10 minute stint about Don Knotts. Look, we all contain multitudes.

375
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:04,200
I contain multitudes. I love Haim. Love watching S.D. play the bass. Well, you should have pided me

376
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:11,480
down, Ed. So yeah, I was like, ah, I wonder, obviously these probably people are like 27,

377
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,680
28, but I do have the question of like how fit everybody is. And I don't, they don't probably

378
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:23,400
want, I doubt they want Gaston doing pushups constantly, nor do I think the performer Gaston

379
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,840
probably wants to constantly be doing pushup challenges. Yeah. Yeah. So no, if you're not

380
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,840
going to go viral, then what's the point? Right. Cause there was all the like, and I don't, there's,

381
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:37,320
I feel like I've seen this disputed, but there was that rumor for many years and there's pictures,

382
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,680
maybe there's one picture of that. You would say Andy's coming to Woody and Jesse and they would

383
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:48,120
fall over as in like the joke in Toy Story when they would, the toys would just flop down when

384
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,520
there would be a human. And then people were like, yeah, if this happened or if this was happening

385
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,560
regularly, they don't want like, Disney does not want this. It's messing up the suits. It's making

386
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:04,680
them dirty. It's dangerous. Yeah. So that, if it did happen, it was short-lived or there were certain

387
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,080
performers who tried it and it was like, no, this is becoming like, don't yell fire in a crowded

388
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:14,360
building. Exactly. Don't yell Andy. It's not worth the, yeah, there's free speech, but then there's

389
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:19,720
yelling Andy in a crowded Toy Story character gathering. Well, that's, you know, if you, if

390
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:26,200
the trick that people don't talk about is if you're at a crowded Toy Story gathering and you yell

391
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:32,760
fire, everyone will scatter. We'll just run in different directions, start freaking out.

392
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,640
That you can do. You can create a lot of pandemonium. They should have a thing in the new

393
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:43,160
Toy Story when a human tricks them all because they're so like, they never get tricked by humans.

394
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,920
I feel like, like sometimes they'll be like a little, like they'll make mess up a little bit,

395
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:52,360
but you would think once in a while, like potato head would just be walking and forget or like not

396
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:58,920
hear that the human walked in and you'd be like, oh, it would have happened once. They're not all

397
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:05,240
like, so like mentally sharp. Yeah, that's true. I bet you could, well, this is tough. I was going

398
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:10,760
to say, but you could catch some of them in a big net, but that probably get taken at security.

399
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,960
You could catch the Toy Story character in a big net. Yeah, you could catch the toy. Yeah. You get

400
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:19,000
them in a big net and they're like, sir, you can't bring your big net in here. It has to stay in that

401
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
locker outside the gate. You guys are hoping that Toy Story five is about somebody who cracked the

402
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,520
code. Yeah. I saw toys come to life and I'm going to prove it. Right. I'm going to out the world of

403
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:35,160
toys to everyone. Yes, that's what I would like it to be about. It's probably going to be about

404
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,840
the toys in like some situation where they're in like the human world and they have to like climb

405
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:43,960
a big like ladder and they can't cause they're small and that's what they're all about basically.

406
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,440
But this one is mostly going to be about a human character who's being driven mad because he saw

407
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:54,040
potato head walking across the floor for two seconds. I mean, what I, what I flashed to was

408
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,960
uh, Mr. Potato Head's caught and, and I, at first I thought, oh, is then, is he scared?

409
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,760
Is, you know, the jig is up now they know that we're alive, but I think the toys are smarter

410
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:11,000
than that and how do they maintain these rules? I think, uh, potato head needs to make sure whoever

411
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:19,160
saw him never leaves that room, potato heads gotta kill him. I, you know, uh, you know, he can put a

412
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:24,760
bunch of supplies in his back compartment. So I think you just, you just like, uh, thin little

413
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:30,920
wire and he can just like hop around, go jump up a guy behind the guy's neck and like, you didn't

414
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,800
see nothing and you'll never see nothing again. I was going to say the way, or one of his body

415
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,560
parts to one of them have like a point on it. Uh, well they all do a little bit, you know,

416
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:44,760
the mustache has the little like connector piece. So, uh, yeah, I think, I think, yeah, could potato

417
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:50,120
head quickly in an emergency fashion, his mustache into a shank? I, I'd say so. Well,

418
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:56,440
that's a good idea to survive. That's a good idea too. Yeah. Potato had not owned for subtlety,

419
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,800
but he can just wait for that person to be sleeping. They open their mouth. He just drops

420
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:09,560
an ear down there, clogs the airways. Yeah. Smart. Smart. Yeah. Yeah. Then waits for the body to go

421
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,200
to the corner, follows them to that. Like when they, once they like, oh, is this, it must have

422
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,280
been this ear. I put this aside as evidence. Then he can grab it, put it back. No need to ever

423
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:23,880
replace that air. The silent killer. Mr. Potato had. Yeah. Although he probably makes a lot of

424
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,840
noise with all that shit in his butt, like clonk clonk clonking around. If you have that much shit

425
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,720
in your butt, you're going to make a lot of noise. That's true. You're going to make a lot of clatter.

426
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,960
Or you put a handkerchief in there or something to like soften, you know, to push it all to the

427
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,720
side. Well, when you're, you're like moving to a new apartment or a house and you have a bunch of

428
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:45,080
glassware, you got to stuff it full of, you know, paper or newspaper. Yeah. So he's got to do that

429
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:49,800
in his butt. Cushion your fragils. Here's a good tag. You got to cushion your fragils. For Toy Story

430
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:56,440
five, Mr. Potato had, or any of the toys tries to call for help, but all the cell phones are

431
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,800
touchscreen nowadays. So his little plastic hand just keeps hitting the screen. Oh, that's pretty

432
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:07,800
good. Oh yeah. Cause they operated a phone in three, but now, now they need your fingerprints.

433
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:14,200
They need a face scan. That's a good bit. Yeah. My, my pitch reel for, for my pitch reel for Toy

434
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:20,840
Story five, uh, Toy Story versus small soldiers. Yeah. We bring the small soldiers in and they fight.

435
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:28,920
I think it's time. Yes. To bring these equal icons together. Yep. That's what I think. Uh, I think

436
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,320
that I would want to play Gaston. Everybody always says this quite like, what's the thing you would

437
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,600
want to do? Would you want to be on the Haunted Mansion? Would you want to work on Tower of Terror?

438
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Cause you get to be a little creepy, a bit too weird. This Gaston does seem like it's the most

439
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:45,000
fun. Absolutely. This seems like, I mean, it'd be, it may be tiring cause you got to exert a lot of

440
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,560
energy, but this seems fun to do. Well, it seems like the quickest path in especially Disney theme

441
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:57,240
parks to hard funny. That's what I think you watch a lot of these videos and it is genuinely very

442
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:03,720
funny. There's a lot of like angles to work. There's, there's the ego and the, uh, out flexing

443
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:09,240
people, uh, even though the muscles are, are, are stupidly fake. Right. You get to do a little funny

444
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:17,560
fake chauvinism. I mean, in the really, the most viral of the videos, he, uh, Gaston gets into it

445
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:23,560
with a little girl who is really challenging to him and saying, the beast is going to beat you.

446
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:30,200
You're not going to win. The beast is going to win the race. Uh, and he gives it back. I mean,

447
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,200
the little girl, I think like clearly wins the interaction. It's pretty unbelievable,

448
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:39,240
but his comebacks are funny too. And that he's saying to a little girl, like go in the kitchen,

449
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:44,120
get in the kitchen, mom, keep her in the kitchen where she belongs. It is funny that they're like,

450
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:51,160
it feels like almost edgy for Disney theme parks to like, to do, uh, uh, fake chauvinism, you know,

451
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:59,560
like gentle roast battle, like gentle roast material. Yeah. Um, I, yeah, it's like a really

452
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:07,480
good spot for just like fast talking, fast thinking, uh, funny blowhard guys. And I guess if

453
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:13,160
you're asking, do you think you have what it takes to be one of those, what's the biggest roadblock

454
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:18,520
to you? It's okay. You got the, you got the stature and I think you put on the muscle suit and you're

455
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,840
okay. I think I'm okay. I mean, I think, I don't know that I'm necessarily people be like, oh look,

456
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:29,720
is that Gaston's dad or something? I don't know if that's like, it's there. You put on the wig.

457
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,400
Yeah, that's true. I mean, you might be a little older than the age range they're looking for at

458
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:39,320
this point, but well, if I get fillers in my face before I do it, or a little bit of Botox or

459
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:44,840
something, perhaps it would just help to create the illusion that I'm more of the original Gaston's

460
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:51,000
age. More fillers, Mike, you can't do anymore. You're going to get sick. Jason, stop talking

461
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,600
about that. That was a joke I made. I don't have fillers already. Wouldn't it be funny if I, I

462
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:02,360
don't know, injected hormone, if, if I put hormones in my face, stem cells and shot right into my,

463
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:07,320
you're always bringing up Sylvester Stallone and how funny it is that he looks the way he looks.

464
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:13,400
Isn't that weird boy? I would never do anything. I would never look up the specific brands of

465
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:19,160
everything he does. The type of HGH he's on. Yeah. I would never do that. You're just trying,

466
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:25,880
we know the Tulsa King, but isn't it time for a Tulsa Prince? I wasn't sure we were going to go,

467
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,960
I was like, is that going to become Burbank King, but you kept Tulsa and made it Prince.

468
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,560
Yeah, well, he's going to be the, the long lost son. Cause I'm younger than the Tulsa King. I

469
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:38,040
assume that's what he was going for. Jason is the Burbank Prince, first of all. Let's be honest.

470
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,520
This is the man here. He's been that way for, he's been the Burbank Prince for 15 years. Well,

471
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,200
this is what was in my head. Cause I was anticipating some of this, like, could any of us be

472
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:52,040
I think we all could be Gaston, honestly. Well, I mean, what, what occurred to me about who's in

473
00:44:52,040 --> 00:45:00,520
the room, um, you know, within this room, there is, I would say, proportions similar to Gaston

474
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:07,000
and LeFou. Yeah, I knew that was coming. Yeah. But the, but the, the flip of it is that at least in

475
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,640
terms of our real personal dynamics, it's kind of a reverse because it's the tall one who's obsessed

476
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:20,040
with the short one. It is an inverse. That's true. That is you're a hundred percent correct about

477
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:24,520
that. I'm, I would be more than willing to play LeFou if Jason was Gaston. I'm willing to do it

478
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:30,120
right now if we want to do a little play acting. That'd be great. Like, Oh, should we go to the

479
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:35,400
Bob's big boy, Jason? What do you think? I was already there for breakfast. Oh, I know, but I'll

480
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:41,080
pay for your lunch. What do you think? Let's go to Coral Cafe, a different tiner in Burbank.

481
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:46,040
Oh, okay. Are you going to get the same meal you had for breakfast? Yes, I am. Okay. Of course,

482
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:51,080
Mr. Jason. Oh gosh. Jason's so great. Isn't he? Don't you think he's like the best?

483
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:58,360
These eggs are over hard. Send them back LeFou. I asked for over medium. Okay. Over hard. Is that

484
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:04,120
even a real, what does that even mean? I, I think I just always call it a fried egg, but I heard

485
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:09,480
someone ask if they, the waiter asked, do you want it over easy, over medium, over hard? Okay. Well,

486
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:17,800
Mr. Jason, Jay Staun, Jay Staun, are these over hard, Mr. Diner Man? No, I don't want them over

487
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:22,840
hard. Oh, you want them over easy. I want them, I want a firm yolk, but a little bit of yolk.

488
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,920
Jay Staun wants a firm yolk. That's one of the trademarks of his general days. But I want a

489
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:36,280
little bit of goo. Okay. He's got, he wants a little bit of goo on his eggs. Jay Staun

490
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,040
sometimes would have raw eggs, but he started throwing up too much from them. And now he has

491
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:47,960
very specific specifications that he wants his eggs. The guy who ordered the five dozen over a

492
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:55,480
hard eggs is sending them back. You cleared out big boy for the day. We don't have any more eggs.

493
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,120
We didn't have this problem with the buka de pepo last night. They knew exactly what

494
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:04,280
Jay Staun meant. Oh, wait a minute. Yeah. Well the way that would be like,

495
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:11,720
Jay Staun, isn't it, I thought it was Beppo, not Pep. No, it's Pepo. What do you mean?

496
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:17,160
It's Pepo, of course. Of course, I'm always saying it's buka de pepo. Anything you say, boss.

497
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:23,960
More giant dry, dry, dry meatballs, please. Is it hot? Oh, Jay Staun, is it hot dog day?

498
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:31,400
You dry cleaners yet? No, that's Friday, you fool. How many times do I have to tell you that?

499
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,400
Well, can we go to a different dry cleaner and I'll make you hot dogs and bring them and you can

500
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:41,080
eat them while we watch the dry cleaning take place. Make sure they take competitors coupons.

501
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:46,680
Oh, of course, Jay Staun. I'll do my research. We'll know. They'll just be like melting the

502
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:52,680
eatings. I swear they'll take the coupons. Dry cleaner to the stars. I know what they are. Of

503
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:57,080
course, you're one of the biggest stars here. Of course, Milton 80s dry cleaners to the star.

504
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:04,200
They are extremely famous. Of course, 7365. How many dry cleaners can brag about that?

505
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,520
Yes, we know you've said it more than five times on the podcast. That's for sure, Jay Staun.

506
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:15,720
You brought it up, boy. I know I did. You're right. Oh gosh, you're the greatest. You're right.

507
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:20,520
Talk about your loud shoes during your school plays again. No, we haven't heard that one before.

508
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,640
It gets more interesting every time, Jay Staun. They're at least two size too big.

509
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,480
Yeah, I love it. They're adult shoes. They're alive in your role.

510
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,000
No, every time the story grows more color. It's amazing, Jay Staun.

511
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:40,920
This is a great character. Suddenly we got Dooling LeFouz. The Burbank Prince, Jay Staun.

512
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:47,000
You're so commanding. You turn anyone around you into a LeFou.

513
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:55,480
Wow. Wow, wow. All right. I think that just goes to show you with a little bit more confidence,

514
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:01,880
a little bit more swagger, you could get us carrying around bags of to-go giant buka de bepo

515
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:12,120
meatballs. Another batch. Here you go, boys. What is this, 70 pounds? I'm going to have to

516
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:17,160
start pouring some of these on my head. It's cracking my vertebrae in my back,

517
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:24,920
but it's okay, Jay Staun. I'll carry it for you. No problem. I'll stand in the Voodoo Donuts line

518
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:31,800
for an hour. No problem. I'll buy you whatever you want. Oh, better. I've got windy tuna sandwiches

519
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:37,240
to eat. And then I'll go up and I'll check the firehouse subs for pieces of plastic before you

520
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:43,000
eat it. Don't worry. I'll pull the plastic out for you and save it and put it to the side so

521
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:50,200
you can take pictures of it for later. For content. Oh, I'll personally thank them for all the money

522
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:57,080
they donate as well on your behalf. Don't worry. First responders. You're right. That .0025%

523
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:02,040
that the firehouse subs donates does outweigh the plastic that they put in their sandwiches.

524
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:11,880
I don't think the pickle blew away because of, I don't think the pickle blew away in the wind.

525
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:19,320
It was your mighty breath, Jay Staun. Just exhaling makes a tidal wave of air. You laughed and it

526
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:25,400
pushed your pickle away. Go get more pickles to blow away. The reason city food is so windy up

527
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:34,280
here is when you exhale. Everyone's wigs are blowing off up here, Jay Staun, because of how

528
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:43,480
mighty your lungs are. Blown off CityWalk wigs is new. Everyone's wig is blowing off at CityWalk.

529
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:47,640
They got a wig catcher that they got to collect them at the end of the day like it's a roller

530
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:55,080
coaster where people will take their hats off. This is not so far from my life with Jason,

531
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:58,920
I think. Well, that's what I was thinking. That's your point. I do think that you,

532
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:04,520
at the drop of a hat, to cheer up your friend would get a whole bar to sing him a song.

533
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,600
Oh, I would love to. Yes, of course. Yes. Yes. And a made up song about him.

534
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:14,360
That's right. In thinking about this, I did have the lyrics in my pocket.

535
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:19,000
Oh, good, good. No one sleeps like Jay Staun. No one's cheap like Jay Staun.

536
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,280
No one's references are as oblique as Jay Staun.

537
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,640
Yeah. Can't you see he's the heart of the show?

538
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:36,200
That's true. Now, in all fairness, Mike did talk about Tulsa King a lot, a while ago.

539
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,720
What do you mean? I feel like you get to talk, didn't you?

540
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:44,280
I was saying maybe that was my in with the Yellowstone verse. Before it came out,

541
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:48,840
you were kind of like, you know what, I'm a little excited. I think Tulsa King might be the way to

542
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,640
it. Didn't it come out to kind of unify itself? No one likes it. There's a controversy that

543
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:58,920
Stallone was banishing ugly extras from the set, I believe, in the last couple of weeks.

544
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:06,600
I never watched a frame of it. Not like I knew what was happening. I just did not happen,

545
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:12,120
did not watch it. Yes, no, I certainly brought up Tulsa King first. Yes, that's correct.

546
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:20,360
But I have, have I mentioned, I think somewhere on a computer, I have an intro video for a never

547
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:24,520
shot, just like, I don't know, web series or a YouTube short we're going to do called Jason

548
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:29,880
Sheridan's Burbank. Really? Where I put in like Kenny Loggins, I'm Alright, and it was just like

549
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:34,600
pictures of Burbank. And it said, Jason Sheridan's Burbank. And they like can't, the title like flew

550
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:39,240
in, like it's a fun travel. What was that going to be? Like a fun travel show where Jason takes

551
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,800
you around to Burbank and all the sights and sounds. Never happened. But I have the intro

552
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:48,840
video for it somewhere. You're going to whet the viewers, the listeners' appetite for this. Well,

553
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:53,000
there's some of them are going to like pull off to the side of the road and just in anticipation

554
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,840
of waiting for me to find this and post it. I thought you meant if they were in Burbank,

555
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,600
they were going to pull off the side of the road and look around a little.

556
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:06,440
Well, if you're in Burbank, I would recommend that in general. Just take, pull off to the side of the

557
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:13,400
road and see Milton Eadies and get a hot dog if it's hot dog day. Where are you going on Jason

558
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:19,160
Sheridan's Burbank besides famous Milton Eadies and hot dogs? Oh, go to Chili John's. I think the

559
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:24,040
pitch was just honestly, it's going to be kind of real. It's just going to be like his favorite

560
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:29,000
places. Sure. Yeah, I think it was just like California Gold. There wasn't any grand comedy

561
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:36,280
idea behind it. Yeah, right. Yes. Hey, you know what? Let's save the little rifts and tears for

562
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,880
this show. Right. I think the listener, I think there are a lot of listeners who would like to

563
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:46,040
see a joke-free Jason Sheridan tour of Burbank show. I agree. You can point out, you know, how

564
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,000
getting in and out of the Empire Center can be a little difficult. Here's my trick.

565
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,760
You don't want to find yourself turning left over by the Krispy Kreme. You can, did you know,

566
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:03,240
you can pull out near the Staples toward the hotel and you can still go. That light is less busy.

567
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:08,280
Yeah, but not even light. Oh, hold on here. You can actually pull out more closer by the hotels

568
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:12,280
and avoid that light altogether. And there's still a way out onto the main street and a lot

569
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:17,640
less traffic. Yeah. How about that? They change the on-ramps and off-ramps of the freeway. So you

570
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,560
got to be careful. Well, that's, didn't they do that a while ago? Yeah, they did a while ago.

571
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:25,880
Well, it took years, but they did it a while ago. That would have been a thing you would have said

572
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:31,640
a couple of years ago on this hypothetical show. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Another good point, Jay Stone.

573
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:37,320
That's right. No, it still applies. People should know the on- and off-ramp history, Jay Stone.

574
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:42,520
Oh yeah. Did they get rid of your Mediterranean place over there, Jay Stone?

575
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:48,040
There is but three more took its place. Don't worry. Oh, okay. Good. I still need to get

576
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:54,440
pita bread while I shop at Target. Say, Jay Stone, was it hard working in post-production or was it

577
00:54:54,440 --> 00:55:03,240
easy? It just kind of sucked. Tell us about what kind of marker you used on the tapes.

578
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:09,320
China markers, of course. Please, I don't want to beg you, but could I have another China marker,

579
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:15,720
Jay Stone? No. It makes me thought, all right, that's fine. Fair enough. How many feet? How

580
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:20,280
many feet? It was indulgent to ask. How many feet away were you from the hometown buffet,

581
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:27,160
Jason, when you worked there? A block or two. Okay. Not specific feet, not my question, but close.

582
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,760
A couple hundred, I don't know. I guess I don't know what a block is in feet.

583
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:38,840
I'm sorry. I'm stupid, unlike you, Jay Stone. My book learning was not very good.

584
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:46,360
I didn't afford college and I'm not a self-starter when it comes to learning.

585
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:51,320
Mike Fu? Mike Fu, what would be my name? I'm fine with that.

586
00:55:51,320 --> 00:56:00,440
Carl Fu? Le Carl? Le Carl sounds too cool. Le Michael? Le Michael? It also sounds cool.

587
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,440
These are all too cool, I think. It's just I'm spouting cool stuff. Sorry.

588
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:08,600
Mike Fu. It's Mike Fu. That's just the guy who listens to Heim,

589
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:12,760
a cool guy who just naturally kind of comes up with cool sounding things. What can I say?

590
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:19,800
Mike Fu is the Jay Stone sycophant, the cool Heim fan who also talks about Donnots but contains

591
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:29,160
multitudes. That's Le Carl. Le Carl knows who Troye Sivan is.

592
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,120
Damn. Yeah.

593
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:39,720
Damn. Wow. Okay. Did we remotely do the premise of the episode? There was Gaston Le Fu talk,

594
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:45,400
technically. Do we properly tribute these? Look, we mentioned the things. There was one with a

595
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:51,480
little girl and that was good. There was another one where this one was from Disneyland where

596
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,880
Beauty and the Beast are walking and Gaston follows them for a long time. They walk all the

597
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:03,400
way to the small world exit where the nude guy was taken away, in fact. My favorite part of that is

598
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:13,240
that they pass by the monorail and Gaston says, what is that thing? Some kind of metallic snake

599
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:23,880
that your father built? Great. Justified. There's an inside edition clip where a woman was at

600
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:31,800
Disneyland or Disney World. She went on a trip because her boyfriend had broken up with her

601
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:39,000
and she yelled at Gaston walking around. Gaston, I'm single. My boyfriend dumped me and he says

602
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:46,840
something like, I'm looking for the most beautiful girl in the land. Again, a gentle ribbing,

603
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:52,680
a gentle roast. That's pretty harsh. It's all harsh. I guess you could also interpret that,

604
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:58,520
though. He's saying, you're beautiful. Don't worry. I'm looking for 10% more beauty.

605
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:05,800
He's got impossible standards. That's actually the only other point I was even going to make is

606
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:13,080
that there is a little thread in the needle on this of you're doing improv, you're interacting

607
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:18,680
with people, and this character seems to have the most freedom of all the characters. You've seen

608
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:24,600
Cruella DeVille. I've seen the performers do her and it's fun. Basically, everything's like puppies,

609
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:29,400
but with Gaston, you're talking to a true villain. He's supposed to be a chauvinist.

610
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:36,440
There's traps to fall into if you're doing the character as well. You've got to have a couple

611
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:41,160
filters on in your brain. You've got to clean some stuff up. Yeah, you can't be so, because even

612
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:46,840
saying go back to the kitchen is a little bit- Sure, for Disney, if you don't understand the bit.

613
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:52,120
There's nothing Bill and Ted show level happening with Gaston in these clips.

614
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:56,040
No. Yeah, yeah. Block her up, I say.

615
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:05,640
There's a terrible scourge headed for this country. It's called the second Biden administration.

616
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:12,760
It'll kill every man, woman, and child because of migrants coming in from across the border.

617
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,680
What did you pay for that Coca-Cola? $10? We're all going to starve to death at that rate. Don't

618
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:27,000
you see? It's possible it could devolve into that if you were in the right headspace.

619
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,360
There's only one man stronger than me. His name is Donald Trump.

620
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:37,080
I would never do push-ups in his presence. He could easily do a thousand in five minutes.

621
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:44,200
I stormed to the White House looking for the beast known as Mike Pence. What do you mean?

622
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:51,480
I was in prison for multiple years and I'm freshly out and now back to my tavern.

623
00:59:53,480 --> 01:00:02,040
We must kill the election thief. We've got to hang him. Use your wires, use your bombs.

624
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:09,160
The man who brought the absentee ballots at Arizona at midnight. We must take him and murder him.

625
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:14,920
What do you mean a Georgia election official is suing Gaston?

626
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:21,160
Nothing I did was illegal. That was, by the way, very similar to Gail Gordon delivery right there.

627
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:28,840
You finally brought it back to Lucy Attributes, something we're always trying to do.

628
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:32,760
Let's go, boys, to the Capitol. I'll be right there with you.

629
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:39,960
That is funny, Gustav. He sent everybody to the castle and then didn't go. Of course,

630
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,960
it's great that he gets a big fight with, you know, he needs to culminate in a big fight with

631
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:48,920
the beast, but it would be great if like, all right, well, ah, some peace and quiet at the

632
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:52,360
tavern. You know, it's fun when it's full of people, but it's fun when I could just

633
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:57,160
raid the shoves myself. They'll kill the beast probably. I'll assume the job's done.

634
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:04,520
Time to do a deep cleaning. It's so satisfying. Now that's Jayston.

635
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:15,400
Yes. Get me a Swiffer. I enjoy. Swiffer wet and Swiffer dry. Both Swiffers.

636
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:24,840
Wow. Two gallons for one at CVS. No one scrubs like Gaston. No one does the Marie Kondo

637
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:30,280
philosophy thing like to get rid of things like Gaston. You know, there's a lot of legitimate

638
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:40,600
criticisms you can level at her methods. No one does laundry for three days straight like Gaston.

639
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:47,960
No one clears a schedule for laundry like Gaston. Are you crazy? I can't go out. I've got laundry

640
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:56,200
to do in two days time. I'm taking a day trip to San Diego. I've got to be prepared. I'm hunkered

641
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:04,520
down for 10 hours in my research fort. Then laundry. A big episode on myself to do for podcast

642
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:14,360
the ride. My job as a theme park journalist. Of course, Jayston. So yeah. Throw that ponytail

643
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:20,360
out I think is what people. It's time for a new look. Oh yeah. Please. I am due for a haircut.

644
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:28,040
No, you're not. Not anymore, you're not. No, throw it out. I want to see you locks, Jayston.

645
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:34,200
That is a different type of little boy Jayston could be. I was going to say turn of the century,

646
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:40,680
but I mean turn of the 19th century little boy with ponytail and little bow. Right, that's true.

647
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:46,040
You could do that. Sure. Well, it's more like little Lord Fauntleroy. Yeah. Right. Which is

648
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:51,400
another one of the many faces of Jayston Sheridan. A future Halloween, Jayston being the painting

649
01:02:51,400 --> 01:03:00,440
the blue boy. I would really enjoy. Okay, yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah. So kudos to the performers

650
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:05,000
because I do feel like I would have a lot of fun doing this, but I feel like in like minute,

651
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:11,640
I don't know, seven of like a pretty like back and forth improv with some guy challenging me,

652
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:18,600
I would like call him a dickhead or something accidentally. Yeah. Like, oh, fuck you. I'm really

653
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:28,440
sorry. Say, drop trow. I bet you've got a tiny car. No one's filming this one, right? Hey, not

654
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:34,440
everything has to go to the internet, right? Hey, this is between all of you and me. Hey, we're all

655
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:39,400
just having fun. Why don't, why do I give you some tickets for $10 free $10 Cokes?

656
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:44,840
Yeah, they have to give Gaston a couple like tickets or like fast passes that he hands out

657
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:50,600
when he says something offensive. Okay, so raise your hand if I called you a fucking pussy.

658
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:58,440
Oh, that's a lot. Really? I'm sorry. I kind of black out during these sessions. All right. I

659
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:03,080
have to Gaston is a documentary supervisor to get more fast pass, complimentary fast passes.

660
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:07,320
I can write you all some really quick, but I don't know if they'll honor those.

661
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:15,000
Sorry, little girl. I'm sorry. I said your father's a coward and your mother's a whore.

662
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:26,040
I apologize. How would you like to meet Peter Pan? The first half of the day is the regular meet

663
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:32,200
and greet line for him. And then the second half is if you want an apology from him and the guy

664
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:37,560
out of character. Well, I'm really so sorry. When I entered the area and I said, why are we all just

665
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:43,240
sucking our own dicks around here? I really apologize for that. Have you seen a movie called

666
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:49,080
Jim and Andy? Well, that's a documentary that shows you how Jim Carrey really lost himself

667
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:54,760
playing a character. And what can I say? That's what I do for an hour to 75 minute shifts every

668
01:04:54,760 --> 01:05:03,320
day. It's not me. I'm not even there. I become Gaston. So when I said, Hey, hey, sweetheart,

669
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:08,520
why don't you grind up on a real man? I shouldn't have said that. That was in character. I didn't

670
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:14,440
mean to insult your meek boyfriend. I'm so sorry. When I said you're the ugliest girl in town

671
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:21,720
to your seven year old daughter. Well, I didn't see I misspoke. Gaston did it. And here now you

672
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:28,200
can skip the line at the seven dwarves mind train because of it. When I, when I took your elderly

673
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:33,560
father, who's helping taking care of your kids on the trip, when I dragged him hair first over to the

674
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:40,840
drinking fountain and shoved more water in his mouth than he could handle. Again, not I, why do

675
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:46,680
I keep saying that when Gaston? And when I pretend, excuse me, when I pretend pretended that your

676
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:52,040
service dog was the beast and I attacked it, I didn't mean to do that. And I hope the dog will be

677
01:05:52,040 --> 01:06:00,440
fine. But because of that, here's a free front of the line pass to the Dumbo ride. I, I'm sorry. I

678
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:07,880
gave your grandmother the undertaker's tombstone pile driver and then cross my eyes and stuck my

679
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:14,760
tongue out like the undertaker. Here is a light up bubble wand.

680
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:25,160
In retrospect, Gaston should not have cracked his daily five dozen eggs and made you eat them raw

681
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:34,200
one at a time in front of him on off the ground. Here is it. Here is a fast pass. Here's a front

682
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:39,080
of the line pass for the people mover. I know there's not usually a line, but sometimes there's

683
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:45,000
a little delay. You could get past like six people with that. Pretty good little boy. I am sorry that

684
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:52,840
you're yelling. You'll never defeat the beast. Got me so angry. I made you smoke a whole pack of

685
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:59,400
cigarettes. And frankly, I'm sorry to everyone who was in the line, who ended up having to wait an

686
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:04,120
extra hour while I did these methodical punishments while Gaston did methodical

687
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:09,480
punishments. Those were interesting to watch too. Weren't they? Were you not entertained?

688
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:17,080
Were you not entertained? It gets to you sometimes. And I think I will be forced to do just like

689
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:24,040
Pluto or Chippendale next week. Jobs where I can shut up. I'm going to be Pluto from now on.

690
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:30,040
So none of this will happen again. And Pluto is going to keep his tongue in appropriate places.

691
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:36,040
You will not ever lick anything inappropriate. Security, we have another Pluto beating happening.

692
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:43,480
We need to tackle the Pluto. This is a six, seven, nine, which is of course when Pluto wraps his

693
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:52,040
tongue around a small child's neck, ties it tightly and runs away with the kid dangling from his mouth.

694
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:58,680
Pluto will not stop doing pushups and screaming. I think we have another rogue Gaston punishment

695
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:04,760
on her hands. Pluto has also been yelling, I got that dog in me very loudly as he pushes

696
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:09,960
women's boyfriends away and snatches the girlfriend up and runs away with him.

697
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:15,320
Pluto is out of control. He has done once again, a tombstone pile driver.

698
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:24,840
Pluto has a tombstone pile driven a grandmother on Main Street. He has yanked the head off of the

699
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:33,480
dog from up, declared there's only one dog around these parts, thrown the head in the lagoon.

700
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:39,720
And now he's attacking every service animal in the park. He will not stop high-fiving Cruella

701
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:46,280
de Vil saying they had it coming, they had it coming. And then he says, I am ready to sacrifice

702
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:53,000
my skin for you. And he is cutting off the pieces of his uniform and allowing her to use them to

703
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,920
make puppy coats. And they're constructing the coat now in the middle of Main Street USA.

704
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:04,680
They've priced the coat at $700, which frankly, given it's shoddy construction, seems like too

705
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:09,960
much. Too much. The costumes have been around for too long. That is not fresh costume fabric.

706
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:16,840
It's dirty old costume fabric. So again, seize any cameras that are filming any of this,

707
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:20,360
burn them and make sure these don't end up on Inside Edition.

708
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:26,280
I wonder who the most famous Gaston, I wonder if anyone's gone on to stardom from the Gaston,

709
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:31,800
if it's a rocket to the moon as far like, is there anybody on TV? Is anyone on the new walker?

710
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:39,640
The guy, do you say the new walker? The guy who I think was in the most great viral Gaston clips,

711
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:45,880
his name, Rob Walker. Wow. I believe that's reported by GQ. Yeah. Yeah. So I want to shout

712
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:50,120
him out. I was looking because I would love to find out. Yeah. That he has some, he's had a big

713
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:55,800
career or at least he's well, whatever is happening because really funny. Or at least he's like

714
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:01,960
playing like Popeye now at islands of adventure. Yeah. Sure. Where you get a little more rope

715
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:11,320
where you can be looser there. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Not that Popeye's so bawdy, but.

716
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:17,960
But he could be. He could be. Yeah. Hey, there's a special room in me ship. I'm going to show you

717
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:22,920
the room in me ship that Aleph don't get to see. That voice though, it makes everything sound a

718
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:28,760
little more lecherous. Even a normal, even a non-lecherous statement sounds lecherous.

719
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,960
You think, you think the arms look weird. Wait till you see me, Dick.

720
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,800
Yeah. Hopefully it's also got a little pipe.

721
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:47,080
That's it. You survived. It's got to be a podcast. The right, the second gate,

722
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:52,760
a little corn cob pipe Popeye's. Dick smokes a little corn cob pipe. Is that what you're saying?

723
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:58,600
Yeah. Yeah. It was no innuendo. I was just talking about little corn cob pipe.

724
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:03,960
The Masked Magician's Dick has a little mask and Popeye's Dick has a little corn cob pipe.

725
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:08,680
Let's see if we can, see if we can keep this a runner. Let's try. What topic can't we give

726
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:14,200
a little Dick amenity to? Hey, you did it. Thanks for subscribing to the second gate.

727
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:20,360
Sometimes we do episodes where we talk about the topic more. We will do that someday,

728
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:24,040
