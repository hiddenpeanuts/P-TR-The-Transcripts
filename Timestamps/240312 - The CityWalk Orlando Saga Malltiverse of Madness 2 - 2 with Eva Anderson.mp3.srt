1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Forever!

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,560
Dog!

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,620
When your town has made you frown

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,520
When your square has made you swear

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,900
When life gives you one more punch

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,980
You need a doughnut soaked in Captain Grunge

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,640
You need a place, a place to stroll

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,620
With alcohol, a place that features part of the Berlin Wall

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,620
Where seam-punk robots sell chocolate snacks

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,620
A place where you can tattoo your lower back

11
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,760
So let's go take a walk

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,960
Let's all go to City Walk Orlando

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,880
Tonight, tonight

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,340
Madness, a daily, extremely necessary series

15
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,100
Exploring the shops, restaurants, and cosmic wonder

16
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,420
That make up Universal City Walk Orlando

17
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,300
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the City Walk Orlando Saga, Multiverse of Madness

18
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,600
Day 5 and the madness certainly is setting in

19
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,340
I'm Scott Gardner, Mike Carlson, hi

20
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,900
Hello, I'm here and I'm mad as well.

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,500
Going mad, not mad, I'm not angry, I'm going mad

22
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,600
Jason Sheridan, how you doing?

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,860
I'm here, I had to comb through my souvenirs for this one

24
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,060
Because I had more artifacts to have here

25
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,080
Oh yes, oh great

26
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,320
That deal with today's

27
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,280
This is a fun thing, you're kind of the artifact keeper

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,640
We've just been to Orlando

29
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:50,080
And that's the episode you heard yesterday was our live show with the level keeper

30
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,440
There's all kinds of keepers in the mix

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,140
It's kind of refreshing to do one in a different way

32
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:03,100
And I think the only way to get some fresh energy at this point is to have somebody come in

33
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,140
Who would not be a Podcast the Ride series without

34
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,800
Here she is making her 48th appearance on the show

35
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,520
Eva Anderson

36
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:19,260
Hi guys, I'm so happy to be back in another Multiverse of Madness with you

37
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,360
Thank you for joining us in the Multiverse

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,200
You've survived every saga at this point with some harrowing moments

39
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,400
Hopefully we don't know what's around any bend, but hopefully you do this one as well

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,120
Yeah, Eva's been on 48 times, there could be 48 sectors in this Multiverse

41
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,800
We don't know

42
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,460
That's one thing to catch you up to, we have not been told how long it's going yet

43
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:46,360
I was kidnapped to the underworld last time, you freed me

44
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:53,680
Thank God, you helped us, but we needed your strength to get through every single closed store

45
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,220
I still think about Club Libby Lou, Club Libby Lou haunts me to this day

46
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,540
I'll think of the logo and I'll get a headache

47
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,620
That's a nice memory

48
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:12,460
That girl who lied about her father dying in Afghanistan so she could get a makeover

49
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,600
God, I forgot

50
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,260
I listened every listen recently

51
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,660
Well, we'll see what horrors we encounter here

52
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,980
And speaking of horrors, I want to ask a question, and if this becomes irrelevant we could cut it

53
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,880
But it seems like something fun to talk about for now

54
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,920
You know, not to be too inside baseball, but we are recording this a good deal of time before the episode will come out

55
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,060
And it's a length of time in which something very important is scheduled to happen

56
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,080
And so I pose this question to all of you

57
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,460
Do you think that by the time the listener is hearing this episode, has David Copperfield made the moon disappear?

58
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,540
The tides have destroyed

59
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,180
Tides are fucked

60
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,320
It's like Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the dolphins are gone

61
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,720
So long and thanks for all the fish, you know

62
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,480
There's two things that throw this up in the air

63
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,720
One is that our friend Jason Waller pointed out

64
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,640
Making the moon disappear disappeared from the Save the Children website

65
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:25,340
The day that a certain list was publicly

66
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,980
Yeah, we've alluded to this in episodes, I think before it happened

67
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:35,560
That some documents will be undisclosed, whatever you want to call it

68
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,600
And these being the Jeffrey Epstein documents

69
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,860
And I think mostly it was names that you would expect

70
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,700
There is some Clinton, there are some bad billionaires who you've never heard of

71
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,380
And there was a lot of Copperfield

72
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,040
Not like specifically, but him just having weird conversations with women at dinner

73
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,040
Yeah, let's be clear, there's no implication of acts or whatever

74
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,080
We don't, we can let our imaginations run wild, allegedly, allegedly

75
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,280
But, I mean, is it great that he was there?

76
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,000
No, not really

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,260
It seems like he supposedly should have been made very strange small talk

78
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,940
Yeah, Asquest did magic tricks for people hanging out on Epstein Island

79
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,580
Yes

80
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,140
So now Save the Children, not Q Save the Children

81
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,880
But Real Save the Children doesn't maybe want to sponsor this event

82
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,200
And isn't the movie about God's Children not for sale?

83
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,700
Oh yeah

84
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,660
Sound of Freedom?

85
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,220
Is Sound of Freedom Save the Children?

86
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,460
Is Third Save the Children?

87
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,620
Oh, I thought that was the Q Save, is that a separate part of Q Save the Children?

88
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,440
It's just something they want to do, I don't know how much their official organizations

89
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:47,120
Sound of Freedom, by the way, hit Amazon Prime and I feel like I've heard no one talk about it

90
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,500
I know, I keep wanting to watch it

91
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,740
They all saw it already

92
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,760
I guess, they all got the free tickets

93
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,940
Seats filled, real people in those chairs

94
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:02,140
So, on the one hand, that got taken off the website, on the other hand, one of your Redditors

95
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:09,900
Mentioned that they went to the show and that the show's opening is the Moon Will Disappear in February

96
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:16,780
Whoa, there's like a hype up video of, and I assume he then addresses all the allegations

97
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,460
Just because everybody in the audience is thinking about it

98
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:25,020
I think they just played that hip hop song Black Magic where they sing gave a cover feel a lot still

99
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,060
That's exciting

100
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,600
So the answer is, you know, maybe

101
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,320
But the other thing I want to say is that, even though we're months in the future

102
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:43,260
The other thing that happened this week is that other guy from the Vegas Groove Blender, James Dolan

103
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,840
Got in a ton of trouble

104
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,500
So the Wheel of Guys is really having a tough

105
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,220
It was already a rough group

106
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:56,120
It's in my garage and it's facing out so I pull my car up and see them every day

107
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,380
And now I just have to mention, I gotta start putting red Xs over them

108
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,160
They're even more canceled than they were before

109
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,760
All I'm saying is like Vince from Yow Wolf, Haunted Museum Man

110
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,540
You're the only ones kind of

111
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,000
You're a beacon of light

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,660
And also, you know, the various Liberace men

113
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,740
Those guys are great

114
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,580
Don't fuck around this year

115
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,700
We need to make it

116
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,020
Make it through, yeah, yeah, it's a curse time for everyone we put on the Wheel of Guys

117
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,660
We're sorry we brought you all into it

118
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,100
Not all of you, some of you deserve to be there

119
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,820
And you're getting what you deserve, but

120
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,600
Is it our, is it another curse that we're doing?

121
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,560
Because like, anytime we talk about an old actor that's post 80

122
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,340
They die within days

123
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,980
And then anytime we talk about a guy

124
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,660
Within a matter of months, they've done something horrible

125
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,280
Is it possible?

126
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,420
Or in many cases, something they did 17 years ago becomes disclosed

127
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,100
That's true

128
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,380
So maybe we're not causing it

129
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,980
But maybe it's a good curse and we're uncovering the evil deeds

130
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,600
Yeah

131
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,080
So it's actually, this is a good version of a curse

132
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,600
So either Copperfield has made the moon disappear and you're listening to this from like a bunker

133
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,660
What do we do?

134
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,640
Underwater bunker

135
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,540
There's no, the oceans, they

136
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,260
Either they've receded entirely or we all live in the ocean now

137
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,620
Yeah

138
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,440
It's, but yeah

139
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,100
There's no water or all water

140
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,060
Yeah

141
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,320
There's no option

142
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,660
And there's no such thing as like twilight, what happens if

143
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,260
What does night look like if there's no moon?

144
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,720
Is everything darker?

145
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,560
It's gotta be right?

146
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,460
Certainly a little darker, yeah

147
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,480
I don't know how dark it is

148
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,500
Because there's nights when it's cloudy

149
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,220
Yeah

150
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,540
But you're still getting a little light

151
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,620
I think if before the alligator, before this was all revealed

152
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,420
He might have made the moon disappear and then given it back

153
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,640
Now it might stay disappeared

154
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,020
He's like, this is what you get

155
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,160
You never should have doubted me

156
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,120
You bring down a major talent, one of the greats, the greats, the best in my field

157
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,380
And if you want it back, then why don't you go find a magician as good as me to bring it back

158
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,620
Can't do it, can you?

159
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,460
I mean this could be the time we need leadership

160
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,620
This might be the day that Donald Trump finally becomes presidential

161
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,020
He demands the moon back?

162
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,180
Every, if you remember a few years ago, every time an event would happen

163
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,740
This is when he becomes presidential

164
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,080
Yeah, well this one, certainly that would do it

165
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,000
Biden's weak, he's been weak on moon

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,440
He's been weak on the moon

167
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,940
He's been weak on moon, but we love moon

168
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,220
We're getting it back, day one it'll be there, you'll see

169
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,480
Look in the sky and we'll build a wall around the moon so it can never be disappeared again

170
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,860
David Copperfield is still on this old group chat that I have going, it's still kind of going

171
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,480
I won't say what it's about

172
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,080
I won't say it's about

173
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,260
Alan Dershowitz still sends funny dogs sometimes

174
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,780
Okay, well with that bit of business out of the way, which also there's a world where it did happen

175
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,140
And we had to do an emergency episode and we're, but I don't know

176
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,140
It's not feeling in the cards for February

177
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,120
Do you think it's not gonna, what are the predictions?

178
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,300
We should definitely say it's not happening so that when it does happen we have to do an emergency episode

179
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,120
Like we never thought Dick Tracy 2 would happen

180
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,580
Oh yeah, who really thought that of all things that we had talked about before

181
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,940
That unannounced it'd be back

182
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:32,520
Could Copperfield really get it together because the Super Bowl is around the eighth, ninth?

183
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,260
Somewhere around there

184
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:40,520
And they're building, they're already, they just destroyed everything from the F1

185
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:46,660
And now they're building sports center like broadcast facilities at the Bellagio Fountain

186
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,020
So construction has begun again

187
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,260
Wait, is the Super Bowl in Vegas?

188
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,340
It is in Vegas

189
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,580
What are they doing?

190
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,760
That's crazy

191
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,500
This is too much for one sit and it's sphere mania all at the same time

192
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,140
The sphere is not the perfect shape for a football though

193
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,580
So I wonder how that's gonna work

194
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,780
Does it need to be the shape of a football?

195
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,620
Well I'm just saying a basketball when they turn into a basketball it's perfect

196
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,780
Oh yeah, oh if it just had the stitching on it

197
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,480
It's gonna be fine but it won't be as perfect

198
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,620
They're gonna have to build little additions, little cone addendums to make it work

199
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,300
Okay well we'll know how some of this has played out

200
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:28,340
But one thing that we don't know yet is today's sector assignment for which we briefly welcome back

201
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:33,700
No longer the level keeper but rather his cousin and our primary keeper, the sector keeper

202
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:52,440
Alright there we go, Hollywood Drive-In Mini Golf, Red Coconut Club, Fuel Rod Kiosks

203
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,180
Amazing

204
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:59,280
Now that all said, you know what, he's the guy kinda like keeping us on topic on these

205
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,740
Putting up these borders, these walls

206
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,000
You know I say, well the cat's away, the mice shall play

207
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,160
I think you should be able to, there's a number of things that I think we need to address

208
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:14,260
Especially because you did several trips to City Walk

209
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:20,600
In the endless amount of time that we've been asking friends of the show to visit City Walk

210
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,940
That was enough where you ended up being there twice

211
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,060
Twice in the window that you were discussing this

212
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:33,320
So I went in the summer with my brother Dash, we went to all the parks

213
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,380
This was before the Groove Blender

214
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:41,040
And I was like, oh they're doing, I knew this was happening

215
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,000
So my brother and I consciously hit a number of locations just in case

216
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,580
And taking time away from parks

217
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,200
Yeah, writing down what we did, what we ate, what happened

218
00:12:52,200 --> 00:13:01,380
And then spoke to you and all the places I had asked for had been called already by very cool people

219
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,440
Like people who were so exciting, that they were undeniable

220
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,400
Of course you were too, but yeah I felt terrible because I had said like

221
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,260
You know what, whatever you want, anything you want

222
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,960
And then you said three and I said no

223
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,880
Some of the trickiness is that knowing that you've done a bunch of things

224
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
And that you could work for a number of things

225
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,260
And there's other people I'm like, I can't believe

226
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,100
I can't believe some of these people have no one thing at City Walk Orlando

227
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,100
I feel like they have to do that

228
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:36,320
Your versatility was not, it was great but also a hindrance

229
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,220
But the keeper's not here so I can talk about whatever you want

230
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,460
Well here's what happened

231
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,820
So I was like, so one of the three things that I asked to do

232
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,100
Because I did at City Walk

233
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,160
Was the Back to the Future escape room

234
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,300
Yes, which was just talked about yesterday

235
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:52,680
Which you guys talked about last time

236
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is perfect

237
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,000
Okay, I don't know how you guys felt about it

238
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,500
But it was the worst escape room I've ever done

239
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,640
Wow, wow

240
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,200
Unbelievably bad

241
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,280
Okay, I think that we were sort of like middling

242
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,540
We were a little confused by it

243
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,520
I think that we were a little bit blinded by it

244
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,860
Sometimes it was nice to see some Back to the Future lore

245
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,140
And some expanded Back to the Future 2 lore

246
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,440
But I don't know, I think we were a weird mix

247
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,640
We weren't raving but we weren't so critical

248
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,560
Oh man

249
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,340
So I am so, and also

250
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,800
You asked a question before we did it

251
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,220
Which was, is this your first escape room?

252
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,640
And the answer is yes

253
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,540
I can't imagine it was yours

254
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,900
So you've got to be more opinionated

255
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,800
This is my number two

256
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,660
I did one, I think it was in downtown or Koreatown

257
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,800
For Pascas Zacarino's bachelor party

258
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,900
And it was like

259
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,540
Escape room for a bachelor party

260
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,100
It was like a library, I think with artifacts

261
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,440
I know this doesn't narrow it down

262
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,100
Was it good?

263
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,440
It was pretty good, yeah

264
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,520
There was a lot more like gameplay minded people in there

265
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,440
We did Korean barbecue and then we did this escape room

266
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,300
I'm confused Christopher Lloyd screaming at you that Biff is back

267
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,280
That was my big takeaway from the whole thing

268
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,440
Oh this is how Back to the Future fucked up

269
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,880
Is that there's no bad guy who's not Biff

270
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,500
Yeah

271
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:18,820
Tannen

272
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,240
There's only Buford Tannen who is him

273
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,800
Or himself

274
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,220
Yeah that's all you got

275
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,200
And he's just some dweeb, he doesn't have powers or anything

276
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,760
He didn't even stay famous as an actor

277
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,360
He's just like, he's very good in the movies

278
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,760
But it's like that guy who's like a stand up who played guitar I think was his other thing

279
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,200
Yeah and he'll pop up in things and he's fine

280
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,360
But it also doesn't seem like he's dying to be Biff again

281
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:41,800
No he's mad

282
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,240
So you can't get him not because he's ungettable

283
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,320
Just because he doesn't need to

284
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,780
It's been 30 years

285
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,140
And you can't get him

286
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:54,100
He's not a bad guy but you'll certainly never get Crispin

287
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,880
Crispin despises the franchise

288
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,760
You ever watch any videos where he just says like

289
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,460
Bob Gale is a thief and a criminal and a liar

290
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,200
Like he'll go off

291
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,640
So yeah we're limited in what cast we can participate

292
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,820
But you can have Christopher Lloyd be like

293
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,420
Biff has returned, Biff is coming

294
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,300
And so you're just sort of in these rooms

295
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,440
And my brother and I were playing with a family who also had never done Escape Room before

296
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,800
And it was literally like every single thing malfunctioned

297
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,220
Like we were doing it right

298
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,480
And it just didn't work and it was that girl who was his assistant going like

299
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,780
Hey try to put your hand on the thing

300
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,720
Hey try to put your hand on the

301
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,880
And we're just like

302
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,300
And I kept thinking to this family

303
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,080
I was like you guys are doing it right

304
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,840
You are doing it right

305
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,740
And it's just not working

306
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,600
Were we doing, now that I'm thinking about this

307
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,780
Were we doing things right and it wasn't working?

308
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,080
Because we really felt stupid

309
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,000
I would love to give us that credit but I'm not so sure

310
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,280
I don't know

311
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,720
We were bad, we were bad

312
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,700
The Biff Museum and then the old west room with

313
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,900
Any old west room with cranks

314
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,560
I am not sure if we did right

315
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,300
Or there was people behind us

316
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,700
And they're like alright get out of here

317
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,960
They definitely did that

318
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,980
They definitely said oh I figured it out

319
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,200
You go ahead don't worry about it

320
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,080
Biff is behind you

321
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,820
Right behind that door

322
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,740
I swear

323
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,500
You wouldn't want to see him

324
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,420
This brow will terrify him

325
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,180
My friend Tommy Haunton who is like

326
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,660
A

327
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,380
Brilliant Escape Room designer

328
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,080
He made the Escape Room stash house

329
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,440
He also made the game that you guys came to

330
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,540
Of mine last year

331
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,840
He was the puzzle man in that

332
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,660
I texted him on the way into the Escape Room

333
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,000
And he was like I'm doing the back to the future Escape Room

334
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,960
And he just went oh no

335
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,580
And I was like what?

336
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,680
He's like nothing

337
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,000
Had he done it or he just heard?

338
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,140
He just knew about it

339
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,260
He just heard about it

340
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,620
From everybody being like oh no

341
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,360
This is not possible

342
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,300
So anyway that was my opinion of that

343
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,520
Did you have a quick plus up or anything?

344
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,860
Burn it down

345
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,000
Burn it to the ground

346
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,800
Also but like getting Christopher Lloyd on board

347
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,620
That is funny

348
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,960
I was also like go back and think of

349
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,620
Why did you have to get so locked in

350
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,060
It's an early

351
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,220
What's wrong with Star Wars

352
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,980
Is like Biff being the bad guy in all three movies

353
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,760
Right?

354
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,980
That you can never have new ideas or imagination

355
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,360
Right

356
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,500
Even when you go all the way back in time

357
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,460
The bad guy is Biff's

358
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,240
Relative

359
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,000
There's only one bully of your family

360
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,460
Throughout time

361
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,720
What kind of karmic lesson is this for people?

362
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,660
You have one villain of your life

363
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,960
And you've always been in battle with them

364
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,060
And you are good and they are bad

365
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,140
And there's no way for anyone in that family to ever not be

366
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:43,340
The person destroying you and your father and your parents

367
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,100
And best case scenario is

368
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,360
You flip things

369
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,600
And you have a family where they're still around

370
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,140
Just they work for you

371
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,580
They clean your car

372
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,340
But your villain has to still be in your life

373
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:54,880
Everyday

374
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,200
It does make me feel weird about

375
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,360
Whatever like personal grievance

376
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,380
I want to know about like

377
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,900
Zemeckis's dad

378
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,280
Since the whole deal now

379
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,500
Like thinking about it being like

380
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,800
Yeah I know I'm not as cool as

381
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,840
You Bob

382
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,940
But you know if

383
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,080
Frank at the factory hadn't

384
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,440
Kept me from being myself

385
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,140
Maybe I would be

386
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,420
Like I don't know like is that what every

387
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,760
His entire life was

388
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,060
He's like

389
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,400
Robert Zemeckis is Marty

390
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,240
Slinging a camera on his back

391
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,260
I'm not going to be like my dork old man

392
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,360
But he's also like

393
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,620
But it's true what my dad says it's about

394
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,440
Actually his big problem is Frank

395
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,040
And I'm going to make three movies about it

396
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,040
Who hurt you Zemeckis's dad

397
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,700
So that was my big takeaway

398
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,420
Was the realization that Biff

399
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,940
Is the only bad guy

400
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,620
Whereas you know

401
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,120
Indiana Jones gets to fight

402
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,280
He gets to have new friends like Archimedes

403
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,400
And he also gets to fight

404
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,920
New sorts of Nazis

405
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,120
Like Hannibal the Cannibal

406
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,040
You're right with history

407
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,500
We could have

408
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,680
What's scarier

409
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,500
Some guy who's felled by

410
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,960
Getting a pun wrong

411
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,800
And a little poop in his face

412
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,160
Or like

413
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,800
There's 70 Nazi soldiers

414
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,100
Behind that door

415
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,700
Or even like if he'd gone back into the old west

416
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,240
And it's been like you have to fight Billy the kid

417
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,460
Or I don't know who the coward Robert Ford

418
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,160
I don't know

419
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,540
There's some bad guys

420
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,300
Genghis Biff isn't what you're looking for

421
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,880
You're looking for Genghis Khan

422
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,440
Wait I know I like that

423
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,420
That he is related

424
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,160
Genghis Khan didn't have most children

425
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,020
Genetically

426
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,020
Genghis Biff

427
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,280
That's best of both worlds

428
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,680
Now I want them to make number 4 with Genghis Biff

429
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,220
And I would like an Avengers

430
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,980
Like a Marvel style reveal

431
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,700
Where the theater loses their mind

432
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,560
Because it's like that's the coward Robert Ford

433
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,000
It's Casey Affleck right

434
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,980
There's me the coward Robert Ford

435
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,340
Okay well that's a good rebuttal to get

436
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,620
I think that

437
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,440
The other three things I do not think you have explored yet

438
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,600
So I won't say what they were

439
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,620
The other two

440
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,320
But is there, it seems like

441
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,840
Maybe like Doc Brown that you might have a grave warning

442
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,820
About something that is coming up

443
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,500
I have a warning about one restaurant

444
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,300
That you have not been to

445
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,780
Okay so really quick

446
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,100
Alright can I, I'll explain what happened

447
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,820
So I went

448
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,220
I went to Universal Studios once

449
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,320
In the summer

450
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,060
Then I went home, I was like I covered so much of it

451
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,960
I surely am done

452
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,040
And then in October

453
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,960
I went back

454
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,880
Because I had to go to Crime Con

455
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,080
Which is the true crime convention in Orlando

456
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,480
It was in Orlando that year

457
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,870
It's in a giant Marriott near Disneyland

458
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,220
Disney World

459
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,480
And I was going for

460
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,720
Because I had to, I was researching something

461
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,220
So I flew up by myself

462
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,500
I was staying in another hotel

463
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,900
Like the

464
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,100
Bleed off hotel from the convention

465
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,080
And the first day I got there I was like

466
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,320
There's enough time for me to take

467
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,480
An Uber to

468
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,120
City Walk

469
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,920
To try, to do three more things

470
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,380
You named three of the most fun things

471
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,300
Rejected

472
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,880
X, try again

473
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,640
It's like the night

474
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,280
It's the opening night, it's the night before the convention actually starts

475
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,380
So I have enough time to take a car there

476
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,140
Get out, do some

477
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,140
City Walk, and then get back in time

478
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,340
Because I had to get back for the opening night party

479
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,880
Of the true crime convention

480
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,100
Crime Con where because there was

481
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,820
A band playing at the opening night party called

482
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,260
The Soul Purpose Band

483
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,840
This is a description of the Soul Purpose Band

484
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,880
It really specifically was like wanted to see this

485
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,060
Because it was

486
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,120
They're, okay so

487
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,640
The Soul Purpose Band

488
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,120
They're from Charleston, South Carolina

489
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,320
Performs an eclectic blend of funk and

490
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,100
Soul, R&B, country rock,

491
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,180
Pop and more

492
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,720
Creighton Waters, the South Carolina prosecutor

493
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,080
Who helped convict Alex Murdock is the

494
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,840
Guitarist of the Soul Purpose Band

495
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,620
And this is their like

496
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,600
Crazy logo

497
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,740
So yeah

498
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,180
It's this lime green logo and they look very

499
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,940
So I was like

500
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,560
So I have to get to City Walk but I have to get back

501
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,840
To see the Soul Purpose Band

502
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,400
Wait, Alex Murdock also is the

503
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,660
He's coming back to me as I see him

504
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,520
Yeah, he killed his whole family

505
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,060
He like ran a small town

506
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,900
He was, he

507
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,040
He killed so many people and he's also like

508
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,520
This weird ginger rich guy

509
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,940
It's a great story if you guys haven't looked it up

510
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,340
Eventual Jesse

511
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,480
Plemmons character

512
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,960
Oh, he'll be fantastic

513
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,960
He'll either be prosthetics now or he can do it in 30 years

514
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,700
Oh, okay, so the prosecutor

515
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,760
On that case is on stage

516
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,340
Doing a cover of like

517
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,340
Never have to knock on wood

518
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,760
Oh, it was literally

519
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,740
It was a lot of, I did make it back

520
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,420
It was a lot of Eagles covers

521
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,720
They played on Just What I Needed by the Cars

522
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,940
A lot of Roots Rock

523
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,620
All white guys, guys look them up

524
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,960
They have a Facebook page, they're fun

525
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,180
Wait, did I ask you if they did Mustang Sally?

526
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,240
That's a go to

527
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:16,720
For those

528
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,920
I feel like, yeah, that is

529
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,840
Definitely a go to

530
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,020
It was hardcore

531
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,960
To go back to one of our other ones, Lieutenant Dan

532
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,720
Band vibes

533
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,080
Like a party band

534
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,680
And everyone was like

535
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,200
Wearing these neon glasses and it was like a neon

536
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,800
It was called Neon Rave, it was in a

537
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,160
Ballroom of the Marriott

538
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,860
And we could play like glowing

539
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,980
Jenga, it was great

540
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,100
But anyway, I had like a small window of time

541
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,000
So I got there, I executed a few things

542
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,480
And I accidentally ate somewhere

543
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,380
That made me

544
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,160
So sick that I

545
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,380
Spent all of Crime Con like

546
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,380
Basically having to source Pepto Bismol

547
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,000
In the giant Marriott

548
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,080
Cursing out our names

549
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,880
I think, from all you were

550
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,280
Cursing a specific restaurant

551
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,060
Which I'm not going to name, but when you guys

552
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,000
Eventually eat there, you can say which one

553
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,220
We'll reveal when we get there

554
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,940
This ties into, because we have

555
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,180
Been teasing, I forget if we said it in the live show

556
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,540
Yesterday, but if we haven't

557
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,560
I'll say it now, there was a restaurant

558
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,240
Where things really blew up for us

559
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,200
There was vomit

560
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,340
Involved, do ours

561
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,960
Line up, will be the question

562
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,000
Or are there two such restaurants

563
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,420
In City Walk, and if so

564
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,680
Oh no, I know it seems impossible

565
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,280
How could that be possible

566
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,320
Maybe there are two, yeah

567
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,460
Oh my god, we did

568
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,860
This to you, I almost had it

569
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,700
No, I did this to me

570
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,620
No one made me go to Crime Con

571
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,480
Nobody made me take an Uber to City Walk

572
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,960
And nobody

573
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,600
Made me leave

574
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,380
My very nice phone charging brick

575
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,900
At the airport bar

576
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,900
At LAX, which is why

577
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,180
I got into all this trouble, which I'll explain

578
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,180
To you guys, as part of

579
00:25:59,180 --> 00:25:59,880
My sector

580
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,920
Also feel free to grab whatever

581
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,860
We don't have to go in the order that it was

582
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,940
If it makes sense, or I don't know if that's a closer

583
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,500
You tell me

584
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,880
The order that it's in makes sense

585
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,980
Okay, great, we'll stick with that

586
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,600
Any other details from

587
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,240
Crime Con worth sharing

588
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,680
What an insane thing that you did

589
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,540
Crime Con is incredible

590
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,040
It's like

591
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,560
It was the Marriott 1

592
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,320
Which is like a giant place

593
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,300
Right by Disney World, like I said

594
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,640
It's a convention hotel

595
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,460
So you're waiting for like two hours

596
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,760
For like Starbucks

597
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,980
Crime Con specifically

598
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,660
Is like, yeah, the True Crime Convention

599
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,580
So it's all these kind of people

600
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,240
Like a lot of moms

601
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,120
There to see their favorite

602
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,280
They're like excited, like at Star Wars Con or something

603
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,120
Yes, to see their favorite investigators

604
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,080
And crime personalities

605
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,340
So like you have

606
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,200
Meet and greets with like prosecutors

607
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,360
And lawyers

608
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,640
Yes, yes, yes

609
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,420
And like TV personalities

610
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,150
Like Chris Hansen was there

611
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,160
He's gotta be the star

612
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,980
He was one of the top guys

613
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,640
Nancy Grace was a big

614
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,580
Big person there

615
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,840
TV judges as well?

616
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,940
Oh yes, yes

617
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,220
But also forensic people like Paul

618
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,080
Holes who's called the Golden State Killer

619
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,200
Who's very attractive but also

620
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,280
Very depressed

621
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,480
The ladies love Paul Holes

622
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,020
But also

623
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,180
There's like ladies like waiting for them

624
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,240
Probably like, Paul

625
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,540
There's ladies with shirts like their favorite person

626
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,400
Wow

627
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,540
Okay, and this is top level, it's not just podcasters

628
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,420
There's a podcast alley

629
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,460
Oh, with Yardley Smith

630
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,840
You mentioned this, Yardley Smith is a True Crime

631
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,940
Podcast, is she was there?

632
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,620
Yes, she married a detective

633
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,900
Who has a twin

634
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,120
Brother who's also a detective

635
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,060
And they do a podcast called Small Town Dicks

636
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,340

637
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,960
And they were all there together

638
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,140
Wow, wow, that's all coming together

And Yardley Smith presented an award

641
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,020
Oh my god, there's crime awards?

642
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,740
That's not crime

643
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:06,800
Okay

644
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,360
I heard, I might be conflating

645
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,320
Things but I know like

646
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,100
The most popular podcast

647
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,140
On Patreon is a true crime

648
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,300
Thing but then there was also like kind of

649
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,260
A bit of a scandal with a true crime

650
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,300
Or infighting, is that the same?

651
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
It's not

652
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,140
My favorite murder?

653
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,360
It's not my favorite murder

654
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,260
It's like people throwing confetti

655
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,620
Yeah, the happiest people going

656
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,660
Hooray, crimes, murders

657
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,840
But I think there's a problem with the marriage

658
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,620
There's something

659
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,920
There's like an hour long YouTube

660
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,240
I've bookmarked an hour long

661
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,800
YouTube video but my watch

662
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,680
Later on YouTube is

663
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,780
Just insane

664
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,740
It's like 3000 videos at this point

665
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,280
So I gotta try and find the true crime

666
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,700
Find the true

667
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,200
Crime gossip

668
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,380
Okay, so if you go to Graftree on the number

669
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,240
211 is this some crime thing and then

670
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,460
You have to just like look into them

671
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,740
What's the problem with them?

672
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,360
Okay, that's interesting

673
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,460
It's true crime obsessed

674
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,060
I have spotted that

675
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,560
Because I creep on Graftree on sometimes

676
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,460
My favorite podcast alley was one called

677
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,900
Equine crime, which was just course crime

678
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,760
The podcast

679
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,440
Wow, really?

680
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,020
So you meet them or are they

681
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,280
Live podcasting there?

682
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,320
No, they had little booths where they tell you about their podcast

683
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,300
It was sort of like, here's my little

684
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,920
Like artist alley at Comic Con

685
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,600
I have seen podcast alley at a wrestling convention

686
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,660
A couple years ago too, so I think this might be

687
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,040
Common

688
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,700
Is there a hall H at?

689
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,520
Like did they reveal

690
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,180
Like, you know, we found, is the big reveal

691
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,160
They killed, like found a killer or something

692
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,560
In hall 8, like is there any sort of announcements

693
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,340
That are made?

694
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,300
There was a really

695
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,760
Crazy one that I went to

696
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,480
Cause I got a gold pass where like

697
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,600
After hours we went to

698
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,520
It wasn't like that, it was similar

699
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,440
We went to this

700
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,200
Room and there was this woman named Mack

701
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,460
Who's like this very popular

702
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,080
I think she might be a YouTuber or a podcast

703
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,020
But she's like a southern lady who's like

704
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,200
No, no, no

705
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,960
And she was like, because you paid

706
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,080
Cause you're the gold members, you get to

707
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,700
Investigate, you get to help us investigate a cold case

708
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,500
That no one knows about

709
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,500
And so they basically

710
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,400
Is this legal?

711
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,000
It seems very illegal

712
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,780
This woman had been murdered in the 90s

713
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,600
And they brought her mom on stage

714
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,160
And then we all, the audience just got to ask her mom questions

715
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,760
Is this Sharon Love, mother of Yardley Love?

716
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,080
Confusingly there's a second Yardley

717
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,280
Who factors into this

718
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,500
I don't know if it was that

719
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,420
There's so many, Becky Patty

720
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,080
Grandmother of Liberty, German

721
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,900
It's families

722
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,620
Yeah, the families

723
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,300
There's also like a crazy thing

724
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,640
Well anyway, the weird thing about this event was

725
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,120
There was an open bar

726
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,620
During the crime solving

727
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,420
You have to solve a case

728
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,740
And there's an open bar

729
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,920
So at like a normal convention

730
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,120
You would like ask William Shatner

731
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,440
A dumb question about Star Trek

732
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,000
But here you like cross examine

733
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,220
A witness?

734
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,320
Sort of, or also like something insane that happened was

735
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,560
Like, I was in a different

736
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,040
Room when this happened, but like

737
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,300
These horrible Idaho murders happen

738
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,880
Where they caught this dude who murdered these three college students

739
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,340
It was really gruesome

740
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,500
And they tracked him through

741
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,720
Forensics and they caught him

742
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,760
But they were doing like a panel on that

743
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,520
And just like a woman got on the mic was like

744
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,200
Yeah, one of those people is my son

745
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,640
And like she just had come to the convention

746
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,840
To be like

747
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,060
What's going on with this convention

748
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,240
Would you like to ask me any questions about my own child?

749
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:29,900
Or whatever

750
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,360
So that was like wild

751
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,280
So yeah, crime con's wild guys

752
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,180
But I had to get back there

753
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,180
To see the band play

754
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,080
You got murders and blues

755
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,080
Oh my god

756
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,900
Oh geez

757
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,620
So the first thing, just really important that I showed up

758
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,320
So

759
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,160
As you guys know

760
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,020
Approaching any of these parks from like

761
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,700
Ride share is very difficult

762
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,420
It's a lot of walking

763
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,940
And I had left my

764
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,220
Phone charger

765
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,220
At LAX

766
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,900
So when I showed up I was like

767
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,060
Well my phone's dying

768
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,440
And there's no way for me to leave here

769
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,400
This entire complex

770
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,820
Without my phone

771
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,440
Because I ubered here

772
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,300
And there's not a second option

773
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,420
Because I'm across town too

774
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,680
Wait a second, is this you at the hotel

775
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,360
Or are you at City Walk?

776
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,800
When I showed up at City Walk I was like

777
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,920
But I had a plan because I'd seen these

778
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,060
Phone charging kiosks all over the place

779
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,240
The first time I'd been I was like I'm just going to get one of these

780
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:35,780
Things

781
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,300
Or I'll buy some

782
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,520
I was like they'll sell these, they'll sell chargers somewhere

783
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,580
Like this is a, this is everywhere

784
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,800
Sells these things now right?

785
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,380
Like bricks

786
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,740
Like I can figure this out

787
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,740
So that was the mindset I showed

788
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,240
Up in

789
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,320
I was like I gotta complete some things

790
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,200
But you had a ticking clock

791
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,660
I gotta see Crayton Waters

792
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,760
And I gotta not make myself so

793
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,880
Violently ill that

794
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,760
That Nancy Grace is a

795
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,100
Challenge

796
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,000
And I failed at most of them

797
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,540
This after

798
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,800
The Sussard

799
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,100
We didn't know, this happened a few

800
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,580
Days ago that we didn't

801
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,100
We just asked Devin Sussard like can you pop over to something

802
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,600
So we can do a podcast about it?

803
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,020
We didn't know

804
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,020
That he was there for like real work

805
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,880
He had done a 12 hour day

806
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,040
And was exhausted and then he gets to the

807
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,360
Thing that he picked and the line is massive

808
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,320
And there's still cliff hangers

809
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,240
On that but

810
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,320
Oh great so well, so far

811
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,600
Every guest has been

812
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,680
Put out and put in

813
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,700
Terrible situations

814
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,960
Financially in the hole

815
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,340
Definitely in the red

816
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,820
Did the

817
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,580
Did the factory future

818
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,440
Escape room for nothing

819
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,480
For no god

820
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,100
So I'm gonna hit you back for these

821
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,660
I didn't know you had an

822
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,840
Escape room story

823
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,660
I had an escape room epilogue too

824
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,400
I bought the magnets

825
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,920
Like the souvenir

826
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,540
Jane and I were like

827
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,880
Let's get some magnets, we have a new fridge

828
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,460
There's not a lot of magnets on it yet

829
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,960
So I got the magnets and then I forgot

830
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,180
About them for a while cause my souvenirs

831
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,300
I get tend to sit in the bag for a while

832
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,960
And I was like when I was cleaning

833
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,260
Stuff up I was like oh I should put the magnets on the fridge

834
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,320
And one of the

835
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,380
Magnets

836
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,040
I couldn't tell this was on

837
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,920
Purpose cause it was not on the description

838
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,500
Jane's like I don't

839
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,080
I'm not getting that

840
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,080
To me it smelled like

841
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,320
Burning

842
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,260
It smelled like the fire effects

843
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,800
When theme parks pump in

844
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,260
The smell of like oh that room's on

845
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,280
Fire no

846
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,200
And that magnet smelled like

847
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
That and Jane's like no I don't smell that

848
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,100
I'm like am I crazy

849
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,260
Oh no

850
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,720
One of the two magnets smelled like burning

851
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,740
From the escape room

852
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,600
What does it look like

853
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,700
It's got the DeLorean on it

854
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,260
And the T-Rex on it

855
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,780
And then the escape room logo

856
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,740
So it has like a burnt rubber smell kind of

857
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:05,140
And this is months after you bought it

858
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,980
And it's sealed it's in the bag

859
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,740
I cut the bag open

860
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,400
It's got a scratch and sniff kind of magnet scenario

861
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,940
But then there's no mention of that

862
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,620
It smells like burning tires or dinosaur breath

863
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,600
Did you bring it can we smell it

864
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,660
I brought everything else

865
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,220
I didn't know you had escape room stuff

866
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,240
But has it been aired out by now

867
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,760
Well I'll take a

868
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,700
I'll take a sniff in the next sector

869
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,300
Well some audience is going to have to let us know

870
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,320
Alright go there you don't have to buy the magnet

871
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,600
But go smell a magnet

872
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,920
Does it smell like burning

873
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,880
But it's sealed in the bag so you're not going to be able

874
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,320
Maybe you'll be able to smell it

875
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,720
But wouldn't it smell like burning fresh

876
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,800
From the store

877
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,680
Potentially

878
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,220
It could be the ink

879
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,560
Yeah

880
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,580
What's your baseline

881
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,640
Relationship to smelling in general

882
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,880
Versus Jane

883
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,220
Like are you a better smeller in that apartment

884
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,500
I can't say versus

885
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,100
I think I have a pretty good sense of smell

886
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,940
Are you hyper sensitive to like perfume

887
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,720
My eyes water and I get headaches easily

888
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,300
And he floats after the lady down the street

889
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,420
Now Michael I'm a taken man

890
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,360
I wouldn't do something like that

891
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,760
Well it's involuntary

892
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,320
You can't help it

893
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,820
No he's got surgery

894
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:24,040
He got that part of him taken out

895
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,360
He cannot float anymore

896
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,060
Yikes

897
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,340
So bad smells

898
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,800
I think you know

899
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,240
Let's lighten the mood a little bit here

900
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,400
Unless there's horrible stories to come

901
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,720
At Hollywood Drive-In Minigolf

902
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,460
This is where we landed

903
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,680
You did this on

904
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,500
Did you do this on the first round or was this in Crime Con

905
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,160
No Crime Con

906
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,580
The first thing I did when I landed I was like I'm going right now

907
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,820
I'm going to do one of the two

908
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,420
It was raining

909
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,340
I'm going to do one of these two

910
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,420
You did it in the rain

911
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,120
But I was like

912
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,800
Let's go

913
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,140
Nobody's touched golf

914
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,660
Did you do haunted

915
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,820
Or space aliens

916
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,620
I did haunted

917
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,720
You guys did space aliens

918
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,820
Well they did haunted and Jane and I did space aliens

919
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,580
So this is a minigolf course

920
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,640
That was put in kind of like

921
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,900
Mid 2000's

922
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,700
I feel like this is a later edition

923
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,500
No Fallen Brothers, it didn't replace anything

924
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,060
It just replaced empty space

925
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,420
Because it's under the

926
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,740
It goes under the big parking lot

927
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,480
Bridge with the moving walkways

928
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,120
And I remember seeing pictures of it

929
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,960
A long time ago and thinking this looks kind of

930
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,660
Charming and kooky and it is

931
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,880
Two minigolf courses, the haunting

932
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,800
Of ghostly greens and invaders

933
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,140
From planet putt

934
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,680
And the notion of the whole thing with that drive-in name

935
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,900
Is that

936
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,560
It's like these are

937
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,460
There's kind of a now playing

938
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,900
There might be signage to that effect

939
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,600
So it's like you're entering the world of kind of

940
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,620
Schlocky 50's B movies

941
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,900
So they represent

942
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,980
Scary monster movies and

943
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,140
Alien movies

944
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,100
That's the premise we're dealing with here

945
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,420
Very fun premise I would say

946
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,680
Yeah, good idea for a minigolf course

947
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,340
Themed minigolf is kind of a

948
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,580
It's kind of a crapshoot

949
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,920
It can be a little hard to pull off

950
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,380
But these are good ideas that I don't know

951
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,900
Have been taken before

952
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,880
The intro little panel said the haunting

953
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,940
Of ghostly greens now playing on the

954
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,160
Silver screen the first of 18 spooky

955
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,840
Scenes to make you laugh cry

956
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,100
Scream

957
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,680
That's really nice

958
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,240
You get a lot of custom

959
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,140
Stuff in this place you get little poems

960
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,200
That give you a tip on how to

961
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,820
Play the thing or give you a warning

962
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,460
About a potential obstacle

963
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,760
A lot of funny gravestones

964
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,740
In my case

965
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,940
The gravestone game really good I thought

966
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,780
Very funny swim in peace Bruce

967
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,760
Pet shark

968
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,720
His bite was much much worse than his

969
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,280
Bark

970
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,640
Oh jeez

971
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,860
Does that imply that like a shark ate a

972
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,260
Dog?

973
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,880
Bruce was the pet

974
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,500
Topiaries really cool

975
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,540
Topiaries I'm looking at

976
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,400
Topiary holding a chainsaw

977
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,060
Beetlejuice style

978
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,940
I will say Tim Burton

979
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,300
Vibes hardcore

980
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,720
Nightmare Before Christmas vibes

981
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,380
That shark gravestone

982
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,440
Bruce's shark from

983
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,320
Jaws he named it after

984
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,900
His lawyer of course we all know

985
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,700
It's double clever

986
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,480
When you're a tour guide at Universal Studios

987
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,300
The honor you have of

988
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,960
Saying that line each and every day

989
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,260
It's like introducing the musical guest on Saturday Night Live

990
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,760
Ladies and gentlemen

991
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,720
I'm going to say Evanescence

992
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,380
That's how it feels as good as if you said that

993
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,380
Two more gravestones are like Frankenstein

994
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,540
Various parts born 1833, 1838

995
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,020
1840, 1847, etc

996
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,780
And one that says

997
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,840
Werewolf and then it goes werewolf

998
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,720
And then just points down into the ground

999
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:52,740
Oh

1000
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,900
On the first hole there's the thing where

1001
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,700
There's lumps which are a good thing

1002
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,840
To have to putt over in mini golf

1003
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,060
And then so like that's

1004
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,620
The bulk of the corpse

1005
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,240
And then you've got shoes poking out too

1006
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,100
And that tells

1007
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,740
That shows you if it's a wolfman or a mummy

1008
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,220
I just want to say

1009
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,960
I thought this mini golf course was like

1010
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,340
Wonderful

1011
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,340
It was like super well done

1012
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,760
I played through it alone

1013
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,940
I didn't have anyone in front of or behind me

1014
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:23,060
So I was just like I'm bad at mini golf

1015
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,000
But it didn't matter I wasn't actually keeping score

1016
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,980
I was just like woo

1017
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,660
And I loved every hole there was one where

1018
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,040
Like little

1019
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,800
Like aqua monsters like spit water

1020
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,260
At you over a bridge

1021
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,200
That was really cute

1022
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:36,780
With this guy

1023
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,560
Did one of us get genuinely shocked by that?

1024
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,420
I loved it

1025
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,260
I just thought the whole thing was so charming

1026
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,260
And fun and well done

1027
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,220
I think

1028
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,140
How this came to get I think the golf

1029
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,440
Itself was done by a place that does a lot

1030
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,280
Of themed mini golf

1031
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,160
Called Adventure Golf

1032
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,220
Design and Development

1033
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,540
They do mini golf

1034
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,340
In crazy places like a hotel

1035
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,080
Roof or a cruise ship

1036
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,120
They'll jam it into whatever space

1037
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,600
Very in depth website

1038
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,600
They did the one in the Mall of America

1039
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,620
Which I think I played I think was fun

1040
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,620
They do Great Wolf Lodge ones

1041
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,080
And ones by Niagara Falls

1042
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,620
But then I think that's comboed with

1043
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:17,680
Universal

1044
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,280
Art design people

1045
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,640
So you're getting like enough

1046
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,340
It's not animatronics but it's really good

1047
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,020
I think it's a lot of physical pieces

1048
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,400
Like everybody who did this

1049
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,620
I imagine on not the biggest budget in the world

1050
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,940
This must have been like fun to do

1051
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,540
They all knocked it out of the park

1052
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,920
Great figures just really good

1053
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,520
How was the sci-fi?

1054
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,120
It was awesome

1055
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,580
This was one of the best mini golf courses

1056
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,720
I've ever played

1057
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,600
And I played a lot of miniature golf

1058
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,480
At the Jersey Shore

1059
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,820
I'd shower it in and they're like big

1060
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,860
Miniature golf heads

1061
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,580
And this one was so surprising

1062
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,560
No one in front of us, no one behind

1063
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,500
There was a lot of

1064
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,380
I answered all the questions

1065
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,020
Did you guys do the questions?

1066
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,300
No I got lost on that

1067
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,860
They give you scavenger hunts

1068
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,180
We did the scavenger hunt

1069
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,700
Where it is like

1070
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,820
What is the name of the

1071
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,080
Newspaper reporting the UFO sightings

1072
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,900
The Roswell Register

1073
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,580
The putt aliens

1074
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,640
Are claiming planet earth

1075
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,220
For what planet?

1076
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,320
Putt

1077
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,320
It's in the title

1078
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,960
Each cup and saucer spaceship is creating

1079
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,100
How many orange blast rings?

1080
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:29,920
Three

1081
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,920
So we answered all these

1082
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,800
And then at the end they gave us little scratch off cards

1083
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,640
Oh we got those yeah

1084
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,760
So the one was

1085
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,580
15% off mini golf

1086
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,180
And the other was 10% off any retail item

1087
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:44,900
But fortunately

1088
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,480
I'd already spent the $4 on this

1089
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,780
Ball marker slash poker chip

1090
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,380
That's cool

1091
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:53,560
You bought that at the outset before we started?

1092
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,680
I bought it cause I got so excited

1093
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,500
To see like original merchandise

1094
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,920
I could not find the character

1095
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,620
I forgot they were from planet putt

1096
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,780
But I don't know his name

1097
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,920
Invader

1098
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,740
Guys this is like a very well executed

1099
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,020
Thing

1100
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,960
Just overall I was so impressed

1101
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,020
It seems like it's not popular at all

1102
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:14,500
Yeah

1103
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,080
It's a weird spot though

1104
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,900
It is confusing where it is

1105
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,640
You can miss it

1106
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,760
We played around

1107
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,780
We played through a guy

1108
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,860
Painting and power washing

1109
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,240
Different elements

1110
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,040
So they were doing upkeep while we were there

1111
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,340
Did they also tell you

1112
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,280
If you want to come back and play the other one

1113
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,860
It's free or $2

1114
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,600
There was a little deal

1115
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,320
This would have been good if you had little kids

1116
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,860
I think this

1117
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,060
If you're on

1118
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,120
Using that resort

1119
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,300
As we're increasingly excited about doing

1120
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,580
As a resort and taking your time

1121
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,760
Finding odds and ends

1122
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,900
For sure I think that's a great hour

1123
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,260
One thing I don't know if we've talked about

1124
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,100
On the show that Scott and I were noticing

1125
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,200
We've talked about this before I think

1126
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,880
Is the

1127
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,980
Using certain pop songs

1128
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,860
In a Halloween setting

1129
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,700
Songs that have been now claimed as Halloween songs

1130
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,960
Yeah because this is

1131
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,120
We did this not long after Halloween

1132
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,740
And I noticed it at Halloween as well

1133
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,780
It's kind of a perennial

1134
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,720
You know you're hearing Monster Mesh

1135
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,680
Or Thriller or whatever

1136
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,600
Enter Sandman

1137
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,080
It was not ever intended

1138
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,260
To be a Halloween song

1139
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:31,060
But it feels like there's one element in it

1140
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,200
That is now

1141
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,960
That you could claim has something to do with a monster

1142
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,740
That's scary

1143
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:36,800
We're pulling it in

1144
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,380
Where like

1145
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,940
She blinded me with science or something

1146
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,400
Is now a Halloween song

1147
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,800
And they're playing stuff like that

1148
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,040
And it's

1149
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,920
Hungry like the wolf was one

1150
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,620
Yes they played hungry like the wolf

1151
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,360
That's a stretch because that's not a werewolf

1152
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,220
But he is hungry

1153
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,240
And that's horrifying

1154
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,480
If a hungry wolf is after you

1155
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,800
If you take the song literally

1156
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,220
And wolf is not

1157
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,040
Oh sure

1158
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,900
They didn't write it for the Jack Nicholson movie Wolf

1159
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,300
That is not

1160
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,100
What that song is for

1161
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,040
They should have used it in the trailer if they didn't

1162
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,800
They do play not just Halloween music

1163
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,640
Halloween adjacent songs

1164
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,120
Scott do you remember

1165
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,240
Because I feel like you were with me a couple

1166
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,560
Times that was happening

1167
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,560
It wasn't a Halloween song but it was certainly haunting us

1168
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,760
There was a song

1169
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,040
I kept hearing throughout City Walk

1170
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,900
And I started hearing it again

1171
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,540
And I turned around and there was a live

1172
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,680
Singer and I'm trying to

1173
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,020
Was it a Halloween

1174
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,620
No it was just like this

1175
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,340
You're talking about Halloween song

1176
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,800
That made me think there was like a song

1177
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,920
Haunting me the entire time we were at

1178
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,660
City Walk I just heard it again

1179
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,280
And again

1180
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,800
Do you know what I'm talking about it's like an eagle song

1181
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,380
Or like a

1182
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,160
Classic rock song

1183
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,420
I have a

1184
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,960
I have a guess and actually

1185
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,680
Like wait I'm going to do

1186
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,700
Okay I was just on

1187
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,900
A Disneyland shuttle where they usually

1188
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:05,780
Play Disney

1189
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,780
Music but in this case

1190
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,940
They were playing like for everyone

1191
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,880
Kind of radio rock

1192
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,260
And my guess as to what you're talking about

1193
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,860
I was meaning to

1194
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:17,580
Bring this up on the show somehow

1195
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,680
Just see if you guys can like

1196
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,580
Because basically we played a game

1197
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,740
There were two songs and Aaron and I

1198
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:26,080
Were like what's the next one and I nailed it

1199
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,480
I got it I'm so proud

1200
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,200
So see if and listeners can play along with this at home too

1201
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,100
You know this

1202
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,640
Breed of like karaoke

1203
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,720
Omni present because I think where you heard it

1204
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,640
Was maybe outside dueling piano

1205
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,880
I think so

1206
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,300
Alright here's the two

1207
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,880
See if you can complete the third

1208
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,380
Sweet Caroline don't stop believing

1209
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,900
What's the third

1210
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,240
Oh

1211
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,840
Good question

1212
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,820
For everyone music

1213
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:54,100
It's like what at a wedding it's the wedding

1214
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,240
Crowd pleaser

1215
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,200
Have we got one

1216
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,540
Sweet Caroline don't stop believing

1217
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:02,280
And then it's I'm going to be upset

1218
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,420
With myself too I'm going to be so mad

1219
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,340
I was really proud that I

1220
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,160
Aced it and I think it's the song Jason's

1221
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,340
Talking about too

1222
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,960
It's a famous song

1223
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,280
It's a classic rock song

1224
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,100
Obvious

1225
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,940
I'll keep hinting shortly you know like

1226
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,600
Every man

1227
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,220
Working man

1228
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,520
Oh it's

1229
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,960
Is it September

1230
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,180
Oh is it living on a prayer

1231
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,520
Got it Mike nailed it

1232
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,220
I think it was living on a prayer

1233
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:31,660
Yes

1234
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,300
That was a perfect organic way to bring up

1235
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,880
That game

1236
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,380
It was just driving me

1237
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:42,360
This wasn't a Halloween song but it was haunting me

1238
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,800
Living on a prayer is a little

1239
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,200
Spooky

1240
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:46,940
Prayer is a religious

1241
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,060
It was not in the Halloween mini golf course

1242
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,440
But yeah that could be a Halloween

1243
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,340
Living on a prayer means you could die at any moment

1244
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,460
Yeah that's true

1245
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,020
You're dependent on one prayer

1246
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,260
The docs are scary

1247
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,180
It's hard work

1248
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:01,880
Oh yeah you said a horror movie

1249
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,520
Whatever the character's name is worked on the docs

1250
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,480
Yeah we don't know what time

1251
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:08,740
Union's been on strike

1252
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:10,760
It's scary not knowing when you're going to go back to work

1253
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,920
So you're living on a prayer

1254
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,780
One of the scariest

1255
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,760
The union busters might come

1256
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,990
Like in that Brando movie

1257
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:21,120
Yeah

1258
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,520
On the waterfront

1259
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,140
Throw your brother off of a roof

1260
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,200
Yeah

1261
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,420
Tommy

1262
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,800
Right Tommy used to work on the docs

1263
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,720
If I said Johnny I would have been wrong

1264
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,900
There's only that one priest called Ra'maldon

1265
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,820
Who's kind of on your side

1266
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:38,520
So you can play the haunted mini golf

1267
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,880
But you can also be haunted by songs at

1268
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:41,300
Universe

1269
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,820
There was a trip

1270
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,200
I went on where multiple times

1271
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,780
I heard Life is a Highway

1272
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:49,600
And

1273
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:53,000
The Mamas and the Papas

1274
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:53,860
Oh what is it?

1275
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,360
All the leaves are brown

1276
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,880
California Dreaming

1277
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:00,200
Which Life is a Highway though was it Rascal Flatts

1278
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,040
It was Rascal Flatts Cars hadn't come out yet

1279
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,180
I think

1280
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,700
No Rascal Flatts is Cars

1281
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,060
Sorry was the other Tom Cochran

1282
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,000
You say haunted by these

1283
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,820
Things Mike would say

1284
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,660
Put one finger in the air

1285
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,400
Point and smile

1286
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,860
I don't think I point and smile at living on a prayer

1287
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,160
Don't stop believing

1288
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,800
No I know it's not those

1289
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,340
But you do it for songs that are not surprising

1290
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,120
To hear in public in the least

1291
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,700
That's why I started rassing you for the song

1292
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,760
When he does California Dreaming

1293
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,460
A tear rolls down his face

1294
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,140
Because it's kind of a melancholy song

1295
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,940
Also Tom Cochran Life is a Highway is a good karaoke song

1296
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,560
It is a good karaoke song

1297
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,560
That one

1298
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,540
Anyway we did keep score

1299
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,560
Par was 42

1300
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,840
Jane got 48

1301
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,080
I got 46

1302
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,700
So I won by 2

1303
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,720
Mike 50 Scott 40

1304
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,260
I stopped keeping score because I was bad

1305
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,560
But I had a good time

1306
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,300
Yay

1307
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,440
Well how about that

1308
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,600
We led you to a pretty fun agreeable place

1309
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,720
Nice music

1310
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,520
The 18th hole is really good

1311
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,540
The pressure is on

1312
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,740
You walk into

1313
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:13,400
In the case of

1314
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,480
The haunted one it's like a mausoleum

1315
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,380
And there's kind of like a Frankenstein

1316
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,260
Lair and you go up a

1317
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,720
Rube Goldberg machine

1318
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:22,860
What's it in sci-fi

1319
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,320
It was a flying saucer you went into

1320
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,660
And the floor is spinning

1321
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,740
And Jane's like you probably shouldn't step on that

1322
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:30,920
They're like oh I'm stepping

1323
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:32,960
I gotta step on that

1324
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,280
And there was like one

1325
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,700
There was a hole where the ball was taken up

1326
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,020
And you had a big spiral thing

1327
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:41,000
And you watched it through like a glass tube

1328
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,940
There was also when you walked into a flying saucer

1329
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,600
And to get out you hit a button

1330
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,820
And it swung open the door

1331
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,500
Like it was awesome

1332
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,900
That sounds really good

1333
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,060
Physical design

1334
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:54,740
This stuff's not easy to pull off

1335
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:57,060
It doesn't feel chintzy

1336
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,740
It doesn't feel cheesy

1337
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,780
And my only complaint is that

1338
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:03,820
Right before the 18th hole

1339
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:05,740
We got interrupted in putting

1340
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:08,040
By somebody on the moving walkway

1341
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,980
Who yelled Mike Carlson

1342
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,120
Then I waved and got

1343
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:12,800
Jack shit

1344
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,440
I think what happened was

1345
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,560
And I wasn't going to bring up that aspect of the story

1346
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,740
But I do recall that somebody

1347
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,880
Yelled Mike Carlson maybe said like you're a very

1348
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,620
Good boy

1349
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,920
Correct me if you were

1350
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,620
The yeller to what you said

1351
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:28,720
Maybe this is a different time

1352
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,960
And then I think I pointed at you and I said

1353
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,860
Scott's here and he's like ahhh

1354
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,160
Like it was a noise or something

1355
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,420
It was not

1356
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,800
That could go either way

1357
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,420
Not a bad noise

1358
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:40,740
I'm just saying it was not

1359
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:41,920
It's possible

1360
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,960
I was very visible to them

1361
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,460
They could have been moving fast

1362
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:47,160
I think you were

1363
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,780
To the walkway

1364
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,840
There's hope for me

1365
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,380
You know what I saw

1366
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,100
That stuck in my mind

1367
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:00,060
That was a really nice design touch

1368
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:02,060
They had like at an arboretum

1369
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,700
All the plants were labeled

1370
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,560
Yeah, wait yes

1371
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,260
The haunted one has a bunch of

1372
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,880
Like where you know

1373
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,280
It's Venus flytrap but then like

1374
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,420
Like a haunted greenhouse

1375
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,320
There's a plant called the Boston

1376
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,020
Strangler and the

1377
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,210
And then in parentheses Chokeyus maximus

1378
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,460
It's kind of dark

1379
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:23,860
For

1380
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:24,720
It ties right into CrimeCon

1381
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:28,160
You should have brought that

1382
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,420
Joke to CrimeCon

1383
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,860
And they would have been delighted

1384
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,660
I waited in a long line to present that to Chris Hanson

1385
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,300
At his signing

1386
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,180
What do you think of this joke

1387
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:39,020
I brought a funny plant for you Chris

1388
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,760
And then sprint to the bathroom

1389
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:44,620
Every hour on the hour

1390
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:45,940
Oh god

1391
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:48,120
Here's a cute little

1392
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,100
Chef alien

1393
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,400
And he's got an apron that says

1394
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,900
I heart humans

1395
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,560
And he's standing on a to serve man

1396
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,760
Like the Twilight Zone

1397
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:57,660
Wow

1398
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,600
They even label the fans

1399
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,740
They call the fans something

1400
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,440
It says mystical mist makers

1401
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,420
And I have a video of you getting

1402
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:09,920
Very unpleasantly splatted in the face

1403
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,500
I don't remember that

1404
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,560
I look very grumpy

1405
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,400
Do I ever think of you getting sprayed

1406
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,660
I have a video of you here with the creature

1407
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:18,900
Oh right yes

1408
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,020
That did get me

1409
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:22,140
All this to be posted

1410
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:23,860
Do you guys feel a little

1411
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,880
Unsettled in a way

1412
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,300
That we're here in a saga

1413
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:30,240
Talking about how much we liked something that we did

1414
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,100
It doesn't feel normal

1415
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,380
The only reason that it doesn't feel so

1416
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,260
Odd is because I'm not sure

1417
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:38,080
How many times this is going to happen again

1418
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:38,860
Yeah

1419
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:41,340
I know I'm looking down the rest of that list

1420
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:43,240
We'll see

1421
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,220
This was a great morning

1422
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,860
This is like the first full day

1423
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:49,640
I had a good feeling

1424
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,700
Yes all ahead of us

1425
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,780
It's something you can do really early

1426
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:54,720
You don't have to wait for it to open

1427
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:57,640
I honestly would recommend

1428
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,560
If you got the time to kill

1429
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,480
Or you're taking a little break between parks days

1430
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,820
Do that with a coffee

1431
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:04,800
Refreshing nice

1432
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:06,740
This is certainly

1433
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,360
All the people on that walkway

1434
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,520
Are bypassing this and adding to the theme park

1435
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,140
So like

1436
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,940
So if you don't want to get in

1437
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:16,900
Wait okay general theme park

1438
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,940
This occurred to me also in my recent trip

1439
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:20,600
Where I was in a shuttle and stuff

1440
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,980
There's rope dropping

1441
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,740
And maybe you want a rope drop because you want to get to stuff as soon

1442
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:26,840
But I think there's also a way to play it

1443
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,340
Where you get there purposefully

1444
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,620
An hour or two later

1445
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,840
And then you're not in that mega

1446
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:34,240
Stressful

1447
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,840
I think there's probably a

1448
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,760
Perfect window to hit a theme park

1449
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,560
When everybody sprinted in with a rope drop

1450
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,800
And then you are like half an hour later

1451
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,620
Yeah

1452
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,300
And then you're not

1453
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,800
It's deadly I don't know if anybody's ever waited on Harbor Boulevard

1454
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,380
For I mean any

1455
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:52,000
All Disney security can be like

1456
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,640
Ungodly and then it can like break

1457
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,540
Your spirits and then you don't maybe you don't care

1458
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,840
That you got on whatever on Rise of the Resistance first

1459
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,280
Or whatever

1460
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:01,180
Because everybody who's rope dropping

1461
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,780
They're headed for the long line

1462
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:04,620
Rides first

1463
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:08,080
So that's the only thing you may be sacrificed

1464
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,280
By not doing it

1465
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,280
Is that yeah you are now going to have to wait

1466
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,980
The normal amount of time for some things

1467
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,440
But as far as that crush

1468
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,640
Yes it's more pleasant

1469
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,780
But if you're taking it easy Scott the other hack on that

1470
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,480
Is like if you make a

1471
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,580
Breakfast reservation somewhere

1472
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:25,420
Especially inside

1473
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:26,260
A park

1474
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,620
You gotta show them that on the phone

1475
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,580
Yeah sometimes but also

1476
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:32,980
Like yeah it's just nice

1477
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:35,680
To just wander in have your coffee at breakfast

1478
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,600
I was picturing like going to a hotel

1479
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,780
Where you have when that gets you pass some stuff

1480
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,360
You mean in the park itself

1481
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:44,280
You just walk in with a rope drop and then you just go to breakfast

1482
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,940
Yeah or even after

1483
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:47,900
Rope drop and it's like if you want a

1484
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:50,040
Leisurely day in addition to

1485
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,120
Like in that same vibe of like

1486
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,920
What we were doing with mini golf

1487
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,120
It's like oh factor in a breakfast

1488
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,020
Because that's also a way to save some money

1489
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,120
If you eat a big breakfast it's always the most

1490
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,720
Expensive least

1491
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,700
Expensive meal at theme parks

1492
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,940
Yeah true one thing we did not do

1493
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:07,840
I had been proposing that

1494
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,440
Hard Rock Cafe is a breakfast destination

1495
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,000
Oh right right and ultimately nobody

1496
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,920
Wanted to pull that trigger on themselves

1497
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,320
Grape buffet

1498
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,480
Oh not Hard Rock Hotel

1499
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,740
Hard Rock Hotel is grape buffet

1500
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,460
I've done the Hard Rock Hotel buffet

1501
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:24,060
I'm thinking about just eating breakfast at Hard Rock Cafe and my stomach is like

1502
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:24,380
Turning

1503
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,060
Yeah right I don't look we

1504
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,260
It's like you can practice at Margaritaville or like

1505
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,160
The airport any airport

1506
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,960
Breakfast is gonna feel like I know what four things

1507
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,600
Are on the menu and I don't like it

1508
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,940
Yeah yeah

1509
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,860
At the same time I had a pretty bad

1510
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:42,060
Breakfast at the airport rockin

1511
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,620
Brews on the way to Orlando

1512
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:45,720
But I was thinking I was like wow I got

1513
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,860
Here really early but now I'm getting to just

1514
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:49,640
Sit and enjoy a cup of coffee

1515
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,620
And it's not great and it's too expensive but like

1516
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:54,220
I'm hearing some great music like probably living on a prayer

1517
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:55,840
Having a second at the airport was

1518
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,080
Nice and then Mike on the other hand

1519
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:59,860
So late that the

1520
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:01,060
Door slammed on his

1521
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:03,720
Cause we were on the same flight and I missed it so I got there

1522
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,680
And they close the door and I go I can't get on that

1523
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,660
He's like nope

1524
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:10,020
Next time let the lure of rockin

1525
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,720
Brews get you there and

1526
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,000
Pumping with rock vibes

1527
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I know I didn't even think that there was a rockin

1528
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,420
Brews there which is very exciting

1529
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:19,860
Hanging out at the airport a little bit

1530
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,960
Oh yeah yeah a little time

1531
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,780
To I had it on the other way too I just got

1532
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,800
To have like a salad and a glass of wine

1533
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,460
At Ruby Tuesday

1534
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:28,660
In Orlando

1535
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,840
Orlando airport has some nice little spots like there was like a wine

1536
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,840
Bar where I had like a little hang on my way back

1537
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,960
Not bad yeah yeah

1538
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,240
That's a good place to not if you can build in

1539
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,380
It sacrifices park time

1540
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,140
But if you can like be relaxed

1541
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:43,980
At the Orlando airport it's a nice feeling

1542
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,960
Well it didn't sacrifice any crime con time

1543
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,560
Cause crime con was over for me

1544
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,920
Oh sure okay okay

1545
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,100
So I just could go home What was the finale?

1546
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:52,480
A man is dead

1547
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,380
A man is dead

1548
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,800
And it's all up to you to solve this

1549
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,880
Locked room

1550
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,520
No one can go home until

1551
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,440
The last day was like

1552
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,540
They knew a lot of people would be there

1553
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,000
So that's when they did a lot of like

1554
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,820
Like this guy is innocent

1555
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,500
Guys

1556
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:12,900
And like defense attorneys

1557
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,240
They were all the last day

1558
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,460
That they kind of crammed them into Sunday

1559
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,240
Cause they were like Sunday was only a half day

1560
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,920
And nobody is going to come see the

1561
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,360
We've got to get this innocent man out of prison

1562
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,240
Genius journalist

1563
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,160
Cause everyone

1564
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,980
Cause he's just reasonable and has evidence

1565
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,980
He doesn't play harmonica at all

1566
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,640
Okay help me workshop this

1567
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,100
Could you do a panel there

1568
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,480
Like about Dick Tracy

1569
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,280
And say like a salute to

1570
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,220
My favorite fictional crime

1571
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:41,680
Would that be possible?

1572
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,060
I would have to bury that it was

1573
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,100
Fictional or that it was Dick Tracy

1574
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,680
So it has to be cause it's true crime

1575
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,320
Like some of the worst like

1576
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,140
Crimes of the 1930s

1577
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:53,740
Most grizzly murderers

1578
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:55,820
And then I just present like that guy with the head

1579
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:57,880
With the jar ears

1580
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:58,800
Big head

1581
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,740
Vitamin flint heart and like

1582
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:02,520
Okay

1583
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,640
And I just present it like it's real guys

1584
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,620
Now that's a better panel actually

1585
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,200
Cause you

1586
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,440
Few of you know that there were crimes committed

1587
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,460
On the moon

1588
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,720
And then you just present it

1589
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,800
I've read this book and I just think it's real

1590
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,160
And I'm like

1591
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:21,240
Yeah this is serious

1592
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:24,380
You know crime is much worse

1593
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:25,460
Than is now

1594
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,480
And you guys need to be grateful

1595
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,310
That we're not dealing with these types of

1596
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,300
Psychopaths and that we have

1597
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,980
Better tools than a two way wrist radio

1598
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:35,140
To deal with them

1599
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:37,500
And typically most human heads

1600
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,880
Are more normal than

1601
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,580
In that era where this city alone had

1602
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,520
25 bizarre heads

1603
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,640
At the time we knew which guys were bad

1604
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,250
By the way they looked and we don't have them

1605
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:50,830
Their forehead protruded

1606
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:52,250
A little too far

1607
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,990
Like in silhouette you can tell if they were bad

1608
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,310
I feel like she's doing phrenology

1609
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:57,830
But then I just show pictures of like the crazy bad guys

1610
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:00,230
Yeah I mean if a guy has like a question mark

1611
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,610
For a head that's what I mean

1612
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:03,370
Thank god the innovations in

1613
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:06,390
Magnetic technology have come so far

1614
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:09,490
Alright well

1615
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:11,490
Maybe that's more for

1616
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:12,610
Fake crime crime

1617
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:14,870
Tracy gun

1618
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:17,370
Alright let's keep moving let's talk a little bit about

1619
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:18,810
I was very relieved

1620
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:21,030
That you hit a place that was closed

1621
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:22,970
When we were there so we were maybe going to

1622
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:25,110
Defy the sector keeper by not having

1623
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:27,050
Covered this but thank god Eva that you

1624
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:29,650
Have some thoughts on Red Coconut Club

1625
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:31,210
Yeah so after I went to this

1626
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:31,950
Cursed meal

1627
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:35,210
I went into

1628
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:36,950
I was like what's that so I walked over to

1629
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:37,810
Red Coconut Club

1630
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:40,950
Which I was there during Halloween

1631
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:42,690
So it was

1632
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:44,030
Dead Coconut Club

1633
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:46,050
I saw pictures

1634
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,690
It changes seasonally

1635
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:50,650
Yeah right now they're getting ready for Mardi Gras

1636
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:52,410
And it's Cursed Coconut Club

1637
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:54,910
Nice Mardi Gras is a separate theme

1638
01:00:54,910 --> 01:00:55,550
That's pretty cool

1639
01:00:56,710 --> 01:00:58,850
So really quick I looked up

1640
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:00,730
A little bit I guess Red Coconut Club was like

1641
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:03,010
A straight up club it was open

1642
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:04,670
It closed during COVID and then never

1643
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:06,770
Reopened fully and

1644
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:08,550
From what I could tell from reading about it

1645
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:10,350
People just were like it's a club

1646
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:11,750
Yeah sure

1647
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:14,010
No real theme

1648
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:16,270
I think actually was the reason it was put in

1649
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:18,410
They were hoping for something that was like

1650
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:20,410
Wide enough and not like because a lot

1651
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:22,390
Of that you think about like Bob Marley

1652
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:24,370
Tribute to freedom or like there was like a jazz

1653
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:26,410
But they were trying to think of somewhere that's like

1654
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:27,530
General Club whatever

1655
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:30,410
Everything else is very specific it's like Patty O'Brien's

1656
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:31,050
Or whatever

1657
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:34,150
So I also

1658
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:36,390
I think before Red Coconut Club was

1659
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:38,370
Sharing a space with a place called The Groove

1660
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:41,170
Okay yeah or I think The Groove was maybe

1661
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:42,970
What became

1662
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:43,950
The Escape Room

1663
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,750
Possibly I'm not totally sure

1664
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:48,990
Was The Groove the all ages like the teen club

1665
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:49,550
I don't know

1666
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:52,750
Well I will say I found some really bad reviews of The Groove

1667
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:53,430
That I would like to read

1668
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:56,030
I don't know if you guys are going to touch on The Groove

1669
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:57,810
We haven't yet take The Groove

1670
01:01:57,810 --> 01:02:00,150
That's one you can claim Groove it's in your sector now

1671
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:01,470
Okay The Groove

1672
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:04,630
Okay this is from over two years ago

1673
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:06,710
I did a search for dance clubs in Orlando

1674
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:08,590
For seniors and this came up

1675
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:11,190
None of the people I saw in the photos looked over 45

1676
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:13,970
For all I know it's great for young people

1677
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:15,870
That guy didn't go at all

1678
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:18,110
Off of photos?

1679
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:23,370
You might have been I don't know if that man is a

1680
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:25,830
Widower or anything he might have met the love of his life

1681
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:27,550
He might have got his golden years

1682
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:29,090
Before he met at The Groove

1683
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:30,350
I like this one too

1684
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:32,690
This place if you're a tourist

1685
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:35,350
Hello Universal Studios from another country

1686
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:37,970
That's one sentence

1687
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:40,050
It's mandatory to have a

1688
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:42,110
Driver license to get in

1689
01:02:42,110 --> 01:02:43,790
Unless you carry your passport

1690
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:47,270
That can get lost on the roller coasters

1691
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:52,430
Lost

1692
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:55,570
This comment wasn't written by someone

1693
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:57,830
It was just taken from someone's

1694
01:02:57,830 --> 01:02:58,810
Brain directly

1695
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,350
Without being formatted into a sentence

1696
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:03,050
I like the way you said that too

1697
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:05,490
I'm like oh sure that's fine I can bring my passport

1698
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:09,050
To the theme parks if I wanted to get lost on the roller coasters

1699
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:13,870
The raw pulsing id of America

1700
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:16,170
Is present on any review

1701
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:20,110
I was reading reviews because I got an electric kettle

1702
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:20,970
And I was like

1703
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:23,050
How do I

1704
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:25,350
Descale this they call it

1705
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:26,750
Like cleaning it and stuff

1706
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:29,080
Well I tried

1707
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:31,590
Running it with baking soda

1708
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:33,870
And then I did it with vinegar

1709
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:35,990
And water that seemed like it got more

1710
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:36,890
Of the build up off

1711
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:39,470
You said electric kettle

1712
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:40,350
Like a tea kettle

1713
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:44,310
It's stainless steel

1714
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:47,710
So it could heat up without putting it on a stove

1715
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:50,070
Basically you don't have to use

1716
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:51,430
A range yeah they're really good

1717
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:52,370
It's so fast

1718
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:55,710
And it's just for tea or can you do other things with it

1719
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:57,090
Well it boils hot water

1720
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:59,630
And then you can make pour over coffee or cocoa

1721
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:00,150
Or tea

1722
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:01,490
Or ramen

1723
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:06,050
It's really good for instant ramen

1724
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,770
Does it make a fun noise

1725
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:08,550
When it's hot

1726
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:11,390
But not like that whistle the kettle makes

1727
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:13,990
It doesn't really whistle it kind of yeah rumbles

1728
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:14,430
And then it clicks off

1729
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:16,010
Do you have an old whistling kettle

1730
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:19,130
I think we have a kettle somewhere

1731
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:20,770
That whistles that makes the noise

1732
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:22,830
I don't have a kettle

1733
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:23,910
I don't have a kettle either

1734
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:27,010
I'm kind of interested in it though

1735
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:28,370
So really quick

1736
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,970
Those places close and I might be wrong

1737
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:32,430
About where Groove was but

1738
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:35,330
When I walked into Dead

1739
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:37,410
Dead Coconut Club

1740
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:39,320
I found it to be

1741
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:40,290
Amazing

1742
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,710
So the theme of it was

1743
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:44,070
Let me find it

1744
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:46,690
Very similar in a way to

1745
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:49,090
What we experienced with

1746
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:51,370
With the mini golf it was like extremely

1747
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:53,290
Thoughtfully designed

1748
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:55,770
So the theme was

1749
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:58,070
For this one was that the universal

1750
01:04:58,070 --> 01:04:59,920
Classic movie monsters were

1751
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:02,590
Had put out a movie

1752
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:04,070
A B movie

1753
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:05,990
Called Revenge of the Red Planet

1754
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:08,490
And this was the premier of the movie

1755
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:09,910
Was the theme of the club

1756
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:12,290
So not only were all the universal

1757
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:13,770
Monsters like statues

1758
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:15,930
Around the club in like

1759
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:17,710
Tuxedos or like

1760
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:19,970
Sitting in little directors chairs

1761
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:22,110
Or in some cases there was like a

1762
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:23,970
3D movie theater you could go in and watch a

1763
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:25,910
Little piece of the movie and there were two of them

1764
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:28,330
Were like sitting in seats eating popcorn

1765
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:30,190
With little 3D glasses on

1766
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:32,110
But also there was just like really

1767
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:34,250
Cool I mean I think it was like

1768
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:36,490
The Fry's electronics vibe we crave

1769
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:38,230
Like really like

1770
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:40,230
There was like big cool

1771
01:05:40,230 --> 01:05:41,990
Statues everywhere there was like

1772
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:44,430
Just and it's like that B movie

1773
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:46,330
Sci-fi thing that I don't know

1774
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:48,150
I think it doesn't get old I think

1775
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:50,170
If people really like care

1776
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:52,270
About making a sci-fi B movie

1777
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:54,230
Like Mystery Science Theater Club and they really

1778
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:56,830
Throw their back into it

1779
01:05:56,830 --> 01:05:58,550
Then that's so much

1780
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:00,410
Better than like a

1781
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:02,310
Bunch of things I can think of also it's like

1782
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:04,570
I love that universal still

1783
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:06,310
Does their classic monster stuff

1784
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:08,510
It's like one of my favorite things about them like the fact

1785
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:10,230
That they're going to make a park about it

1786
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:12,090
And that they're still like fans

1787
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:14,130
Even if they don't care about those movies

1788
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:16,450
The aesthetic of it is still like

1789
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:18,590
Especially like I don't know

1790
01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:19,410
People want it

1791
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:21,970
There's absolutely a market and for products

1792
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:23,610
Of it and places of it

1793
01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:24,670
It makes so much sense

1794
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:27,390
Every year when I go to the county fair there's like

1795
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:29,790
There's a horror area where there's like

1796
01:06:29,790 --> 01:06:31,790
Basically teenagers that are making like

1797
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:33,570
Monster movie stuff from that era

1798
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:34,130
Like still

1799
01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:37,470
Oh yeah there's like

1800
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:39,630
There's here's a director's chair that was

1801
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:41,890
Just sitting out that just said the Wolfman on it

1802
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:44,070
That was fun it had his stuff in it

1803
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:45,690
Here's the names of the drinks

1804
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:47,630
At a

1805
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:50,110
Millicent snack bar I forgot what Millicent was named after

1806
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:51,810
Like everything was also like similar

1807
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:54,010
Like named after like

1808
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,750
Like people who made the old movies

1809
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,530
And stuff like that Wait who's Millicent?

1810
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:58,830
I know that name

1811
01:06:58,830 --> 01:07:01,450
Barbie Millicent Roberts

1812
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,970
The creator of Barbie

1813
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:04,890
Oh

1814
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:07,630
Or no that's Barbie's full name

1815
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:09,890
Millicent is in some part of Barbie

1816
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:11,690
Either the creator or Barbie Isn't that Rhea Pearlman?

1817
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:13,710
Perhaps?

1818
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:15,470
I don't know Have you seen the movie?

1819
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:17,230
I've seen half of the movie

1820
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:18,870
Okay so you haven't seen the part where Rhea Pearlman shows up?

1821
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:20,210
It's another half!

1822
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:23,110
It's something that young girls like

1823
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:25,410
Mike's don't have A major character

1824
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:26,710
Played by Rhea Pearlman who's a creator of Barbie

1825
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:29,070
I'm excited about that I like Rhea Pearlman Yeah she's great

1826
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:31,250
Red Planet Punch, Plasma Punch, The Ooze,

1827
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:33,190
Asteroid Attack, those are some drinks you can get

1828
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:35,630
Spirit Free Slime Oh that sounds good

1829
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:36,290
Yeah

1830
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:39,490
And then wait I do have a description

1831
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:41,630
You guys talk for a second

1832
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:43,710
Oh sure Did you see any singer?

1833
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:45,690
I immediately ask you a question

1834
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:47,730
It was a weird time of day

1835
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:48,910
Because it was like 5 o'clock

1836
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:51,710
They seem like they have a live band

1837
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:53,990
Almost every night I just didn't see them

1838
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:55,730
I think a lot of the

1839
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:58,070
Orlando just filled with performers

1840
01:07:58,070 --> 01:07:59,730
So I think a lot of the singers

1841
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:01,630
Jay knew were doing gigs there

1842
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:04,210
There were girl groups doing

1843
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:06,330
Old songs

1844
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:07,610
That kind of thing

1845
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:09,930
It is Barbie's real name Barbie Millicent Roberts

1846
01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:10,430
Okay

1847
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:14,650
I don't think this is a live act

1848
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:16,470
Although from the photos I actually couldn't tell

1849
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:18,630
I was like is it a dummy or is that a show that they do

1850
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:19,550
But I think it's dummies

1851
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:22,950
Maybe this isn't a past year

1852
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:24,430
I'm not sure but it's

1853
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:27,790
The bride of Frankenstein's

1854
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:28,550
The lounge singer

1855
01:08:29,070 --> 01:08:30,450
And so the bride of Frankenstein's

1856
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:33,370
Lounge on top of the piano

1857
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:34,810
And then the piano player

1858
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:36,270
Is the invisible man

1859
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:38,550
So it's just a body and no head

1860
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:40,810
Do you see that or is that a past year thing?

1861
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,110
I don't know if it was there I didn't see it

1862
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:44,750
But yeah there were two stories of

1863
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:46,950
Different kind of installations and stuff

1864
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:48,710
And it did remind me also of

1865
01:08:51,690 --> 01:08:53,230
Jekyll and Hyde too

1866
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:53,790
Like it was great

1867
01:08:54,610 --> 01:08:57,230
But also better designed

1868
01:08:57,230 --> 01:08:58,290
And better thought out

1869
01:08:58,290 --> 01:09:00,390
And an actual cool

1870
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:02,250
It would be cool actually if you had a friend

1871
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:03,650
To hang out there

1872
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:06,050
There were rumors online

1873
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:07,670
That I saw

1874
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:10,050
Of Jekyll and Hyde

1875
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:12,490
The now closed New York

1876
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:13,390
Haunted restaurant

1877
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:15,710
What is even the keyword of what that is

1878
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:16,530
Blue key restaurant

1879
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:20,630
There were rumors of it coming to City Walk Orlando

1880
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:21,970
Could have been there

1881
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:24,490
Which maybe could have what if that had like propped a no no

1882
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:25,810
But something closed

1883
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:28,370
Maybe it was just message boards maybe it was just speculation

1884
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:30,650
But what if that had saved the brand

1885
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:32,110
That could have propped the whole thing up

1886
01:09:32,110 --> 01:09:33,870
Wasn't that the entire thing running to the ground

1887
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:36,270
Because the owner took out a big loan

1888
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:37,870
And then bought an upstate

1889
01:09:38,530 --> 01:09:39,710
How did we look into this

1890
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:41,950
He also opened up a Times Square

1891
01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:42,450
Location

1892
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:46,170
I went to the Times Square one the multi-story

1893
01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:47,530
Times Square one was crazy

1894
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:49,850
Maybe that's right

1895
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:52,050
But also maybe don't open

1896
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:53,810
The Times Square restaurant

1897
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:55,970
Maybe bad economics on that

1898
01:09:55,970 --> 01:09:57,870
It was so rickety when we were there

1899
01:09:57,870 --> 01:09:59,090
When we were in New York

1900
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:01,350
That was coming apart

1901
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:02,150
Charming

1902
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:04,310
I loved every second

1903
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:07,670
Dead Coconut Club if it had like one or two more

1904
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,190
Like animatronic kind of things

1905
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:11,430
I would be like if this was in Pleasure Island

1906
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:14,190
Everyone would love this

1907
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:15,890
Everyone would be totally into this

1908
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:17,510
Oh shoot that reminds me

1909
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:19,790
Wait I have a screenshot of something

1910
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:20,910
I don't think I put it in my notes

1911
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:23,290
There was some crossover

1912
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:25,210
Oh here it is

1913
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:27,230
I think this might be for

1914
01:10:27,230 --> 01:10:29,130
The regular Red Coconut Club

1915
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:31,470
On some website

1916
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:32,570
Not Facebook or anything

1917
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:34,250
Just message board style

1918
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:36,070
Three comments below it

1919
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:37,070
And they're reviewing

1920
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:39,210
Good all purpose Red Coconut Club

1921
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:41,530
Orlando nightclub

1922
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:42,950
And then an anonymous person says

1923
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:44,530
Kind of like Pleasure Island

1924
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:46,370
And then an next anonymous person says

1925
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:48,170
No not at all

1926
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:50,030
Except different nightclubs

1927
01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:51,710
But nothing like PI

1928
01:10:52,530 --> 01:10:54,930
Which really reminded me of what Mike always said

1929
01:10:54,930 --> 01:10:57,270
Mike's haunting thing of looking at the message boards

1930
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:58,310
And seeing people say

1931
01:10:58,850 --> 01:10:59,930
Would have been a good night

1932
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:02,770
Would have been a good night at Pleasure Island

1933
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:03,810
At Mannequins

1934
01:11:05,490 --> 01:11:07,110
This defensive no

1935
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:08,830
Nothing like PI

1936
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:11,330
That is the energy there

1937
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:12,930
I see a lot of people like mourning

1938
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:14,870
People that died recently

1939
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:17,190
I do feel like if I had a time machine

1940
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:19,170
That's where I would go

1941
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:21,010
If I was like I got the access

1942
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:23,410
To the closet from the Stephen King book

1943
01:11:23,410 --> 01:11:25,590
Where he tries to save JFK

1944
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:27,370
But I only would go back

1945
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:29,230
To like late 90s

1946
01:11:29,230 --> 01:11:31,790
I would just go straight to Pleasure Island

1947
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:33,310
And be like how was this

1948
01:11:33,310 --> 01:11:34,890
The clubs haven't opened yet

1949
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:37,650
I'll just do the brand new Disney Quest location

1950
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:41,070
If you did that

1951
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:42,890
If you used the time machine

1952
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:45,250
Ship on that and then were like uh oh

1953
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:46,150
It's bad

1954
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:48,910
There's no way it was bad

1955
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:49,810
Is it bad?

1956
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:52,010
It's going to happen in the next three years or so

1957
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:53,190
If I had a time machine I'd be like nope

1958
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:55,210
Shut up and kiss me

1959
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:58,100
You're my husband now

1960
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:00,350
It's New Year's Eve

1961
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:01,850
It's New Year's Eve

1962
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:02,850
What's 9-11?

1963
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:04,080
Don't think about it

1964
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:06,220
It's just another Tuesday

1965
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:08,210
Don't worry

1966
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:09,450
Oh man

1967
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:11,030
Well this is hey

1968
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:14,370
You're getting good ones I feel like

1969
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:16,250
We've got a consistent

1970
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:16,890
Theme

1971
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:19,650
There's this sci-fi thing

1972
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:21,870
And like you know the

1973
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:23,790
Optimistic sci-fi dreamers

1974
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:25,790
Of the 50s I feel like could have

1975
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:27,710
Only imagined a world where you could just

1976
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:29,570
Buy a battery that charges

1977
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:31,910
Your personal transistor radio

1978
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:33,910
That you do everything on

1979
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:35,790
And I can only assume

1980
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:37,350
Eva that everything worked out great

1981
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:39,410
With this fuel rod

1982
01:12:39,410 --> 01:12:41,310
So here's what happened

1983
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:44,030
I showed up my phone was dying

1984
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:47,890
I was like it wasn't quite

1985
01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:49,590
Dying yet I think I did mini golf

1986
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:52,370
And I was like okay I'll deal with this phone thing so I can hang out for a while

1987
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:53,170
But I

1988
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:55,170
Went to

1989
01:12:56,430 --> 01:12:57,830
One of the

1990
01:12:57,830 --> 01:12:59,030
Basically one of the little

1991
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:01,950
Souvenir shops and I asked like do you guys

1992
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:03,450
Sell bricks for phones

1993
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:05,810
And they're like no but there's a fuel rod kiosk and this guy

1994
01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:07,570
Gave me very elaborate instructions

1995
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:09,790
Go out that way go past foodie doughnuts

1996
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:11,790
Go down this alley it's right by the bathroom

1997
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:14,270
So I walked I did this

1998
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:16,050
Route got to the fuel rod

1999
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:18,210
And not only was it turned off

2000
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:20,590
But like all the places you could put money

2001
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:21,790
In and the things that

2002
01:13:21,790 --> 01:13:24,410
Dispense fuel rods have been like

2003
01:13:24,410 --> 01:13:25,510
Glued over

2004
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:27,950
With like plastic like

2005
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:30,330
Shut down so

2006
01:13:30,330 --> 01:13:31,450
Violently

2007
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:34,390
So I was like huh so then I went

2008
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:36,090
To another part of city walk

2009
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:37,830
And I asked another person

2010
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:40,270
If they sold bricks and they're like no

2011
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:41,830
But there's a fuel rod kiosk and they

2012
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:44,490
Sent me very very specific instructions to another

2013
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:46,610
One so I walked around and around

2014
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:48,170
And around and down a long hallway

2015
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:50,490
To a bathroom fuel kiosk

2016
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:52,750
Like Cronenberg

2017
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:54,070
Glued shut

2018
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:55,130
So

2019
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:58,750
Did fuel rod like not pay a

2020
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:00,750
Bill and they're like alright this is what happens

2021
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:01,570
This is what happens

2022
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:04,810
None of the employees in the park have been informed

2023
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:06,870
That this happened like they don't know

2024
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:08,950
That something's gone wrong

2025
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:10,490
With the fuel rods

2026
01:14:10,490 --> 01:14:12,790
Angry gluing is happening today

2027
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:14,670
In multiple locations so that's when I started

2028
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:16,890
My clock started ticking I was like I'm not going to see Crate and

2029
01:14:16,890 --> 01:14:19,030
Waters I can get stuck here forever if I can't get an uber

2030
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:21,290
But then

2031
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,950
After I knew I was coming

2032
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:25,130
Out to talk about this I started looking into

2033
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:27,250
It and guys it's not good

2034
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:28,530
And

2035
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:30,890
Not to haunt you too much but I do have

2036
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:31,990
A fuel rod right here

2037
01:14:32,930 --> 01:14:34,730
So you bought one at one point

2038
01:14:34,730 --> 01:14:37,110
Well okay I bought this underneath

2039
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:39,130
The Hungry Bear restaurant at Disney

2040
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:41,470
I once again the bathrooms

2041
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:44,010
And I do know

2042
01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:46,490
One of the kiosks you were talking about

2043
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:48,150
I was there

2044
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,690
I passed it a lot

2045
01:14:49,690 --> 01:14:51,650
Between the press penny

2046
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:54,270
Location which I did find on my press pennies

2047
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:54,830
Oh yeah

2048
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:57,970
And the fuel rod was right next

2049
01:14:57,970 --> 01:14:59,530
To press penny yeah please

2050
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:02,230
Oh yeah wait Eva's never seen

2051
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:04,070
One of these you didn't get your hands on one

2052
01:15:04,070 --> 01:15:04,550
Yeah

2053
01:15:05,050 --> 01:15:06,890
That's a fuel rod there you go

2054
01:15:06,890 --> 01:15:08,350
This is a lot heavier than it should be

2055
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:10,230
The one I do have

2056
01:15:10,230 --> 01:15:11,910
That charges you for like four times

2057
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:13,710
Is the size of a credit card and it's like

2058
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:15,170
Oh is it because of the lawsuit

2059
01:15:15,170 --> 01:15:17,330
Well there's something going on with the lawsuit

2060
01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:18,930
Oh right

2061
01:15:18,930 --> 01:15:21,910
So the thing with the wait where's your press pennies

2062
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:24,250
Oh my press pennies are here it's four incredible

2063
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:26,450
Hulks a SpongeBob and a Spiderman

2064
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:28,450
Eva did you know these pennies

2065
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:30,330
Are maybe pre like I think they may be

2066
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:32,190
Pre-pressed or you don't actually bring your own penny

2067
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:34,150
Well you don't put pennies in anymore

2068
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:36,790
I was shocked everybody was acting like

2069
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:38,170
I should have known this but I didn't know

2070
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:39,470
The fact that you thought

2071
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:41,990
I thought these were fresh

2072
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:44,510
It would be funny if you put your credit card in and you were like this isn't my penny

2073
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:45,430
I know

2074
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:48,590
Now listen I've looked into this a little bit

2075
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:50,910
Since we talked about this several days ago

2076
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:52,970
I have not found any

2077
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:54,890
Proof personally that there is

2078
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:56,930
Any kind of penny scam going on

2079
01:15:56,930 --> 01:15:58,790
Perhaps in the credit card variety

2080
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:00,650
I forgot that was the point of the discussion

2081
01:16:00,650 --> 01:16:02,450
Eva's dude don't you watch your penny get smashed

2082
01:16:02,450 --> 01:16:04,370
This was the point

2083
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:06,630
This was Mike's point is that he feels like machines

2084
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:08,230
Used to be such that you could watch

2085
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,710
And make sure it was your penny

2086
01:16:09,710 --> 01:16:12,470
The way a father makes sure that the right baby

2087
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:14,230
Is going in the delivery room

2088
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:16,450
To the general baby room whatever

2089
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:18,490
I didn't do this it was

2090
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:18,890
COVID

2091
01:16:18,890 --> 01:16:20,850
But you make sure it's yours

2092
01:16:23,150 --> 01:16:24,190
And I

2093
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:26,030
It seemed like a revelation

2094
01:16:26,030 --> 01:16:28,530
In that episode when I

2095
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:30,010
When I said maybe

2096
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:31,970
There's no pennies happening at all

2097
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:34,390
Maybe they have a bunch of pennies just pre in there

2098
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:36,270
But then I looked into it and I couldn't find any

2099
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:37,910
Proof so I might have been talking shit

2100
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:39,990
About penny machines not knowing

2101
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:41,970
What I'm talking about there might be no

2102
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:44,230
Penny what I the discussion I did find

2103
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:46,390
About penny machines was this

2104
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:48,050
The big auto

2105
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:50,290
Fill in if you're asking a pressed penny question

2106
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:52,170
Is why is this

2107
01:16:52,170 --> 01:16:53,830
Allowed people are kind of upset

2108
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:55,950
Because you're ruining currency

2109
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:58,010
And there's some loophole that makes it

2110
01:16:58,010 --> 01:16:59,950
Because when you're the rest of the money

2111
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:02,190
Is like to pay like

2112
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:04,050
I couldn't begin to I don't know you're

2113
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:05,990
Like paying for a souvenir circulation

2114
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:08,130
Yeah yeah as long as you never try to

2115
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:09,970
Change as long as Jason doesn't now

2116
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:12,050
Go to Duncan and try to spend those incredible

2117
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:14,110
Hulk pennies but would they

2118
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:15,930
Take them even because now you're taking

2119
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:18,330
Money out of circulation which is ruining the economy

2120
01:17:18,330 --> 01:17:20,450
Yeah how dare you this is why

2121
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:21,870
It's all going to hell honestly

2122
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:23,990
Maybe another thing Trump will fix in term two

2123
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:25,850
Right press pennies we're not smashing

2124
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:28,170
Them anymore no more smash

2125
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:30,430
I think the international parks

2126
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:32,250
It's just like a metal

2127
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:34,370
Circle it's just a slug

2128
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:36,210
Basically they just take some

2129
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:37,990
Metal and turn it into smashed metal

2130
01:17:37,990 --> 01:17:39,830
And they give you a pressed thing of that

2131
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:41,790
This might have to be a runner throughout the series

2132
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:44,310
I actually the Googling I did I started to feel

2133
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:46,230
Bad about what I said about pressed pennies

2134
01:17:46,230 --> 01:17:48,170
I feel like I besmirched their

2135
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:50,310
Name but Mike do you still feel like something bad

2136
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:51,670
Is going on yes

2137
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:54,150
I think it's weird that you don't bring your

2138
01:17:54,150 --> 01:17:56,490
Own penny that's the magic trick

2139
01:17:56,490 --> 01:17:58,530
I brought a penny from home

2140
01:17:58,530 --> 01:18:00,510
Now I'm going to see this magic

2141
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:02,330
Machine puts my favorite character

2142
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:04,490
The Incredible Hulk on my penny I brought

2143
01:18:04,490 --> 01:18:06,550
From home I entirely agree with

2144
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:08,530
Mike do you do you both agree

2145
01:18:08,530 --> 01:18:10,610
I'm not saying I disagree but do you both like

2146
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:12,390
It has to be yours

2147
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:14,410
Yes that's why that's the magic trick

2148
01:18:14,410 --> 01:18:15,830
That's why it's special it's not a penny

2149
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:18,050
Who gives a shit about a magic you may as well

2150
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:20,490
It doesn't even matter that it's doing it on a penny

2151
01:18:20,490 --> 01:18:22,510
If it's not your penny you may as

2152
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:24,490
Well just get me like a little piece of

2153
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:26,850
Up or whatever pennies are technically

2154
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:28,990
With the Hulk on it

2155
01:18:28,990 --> 01:18:30,870
The whole thing is that I

2156
01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:32,590
Brought it here it is now

2157
01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:34,670
It's transformed this is something of mine

2158
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:36,250
And they've made it something better

2159
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:38,130
Much better they put a better

2160
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:40,150
Fuck you Lincoln yeah Lincoln

2161
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:42,330
Is the guy

2162
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:44,690
Okay what did Lincoln really

2163
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:46,390
Ever do the minions however

2164
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:48,570
If Wilkes Booth approached

2165
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:50,410
Bruce Banner fucking

2166
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:52,490
Shit goes down differently okay

2167
01:18:53,110 --> 01:18:54,970
He's turning very green

2168
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:56,590
And he beats the shit out of him

2169
01:18:56,590 --> 01:18:58,950
And that incident is much more

2170
01:18:58,950 --> 01:19:00,970
Entertaining than whatever dumb play they're watching

2171
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:02,630
Right and Hulk watched play now afterward

2172
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:04,570
Hulk will enjoy

2173
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:05,710
The theater

2174
01:19:06,490 --> 01:19:08,130
That's what I would have gone

2175
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:10,110
Hulk wonder what happened next

2176
01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:11,610
Speculated intermission

2177
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:14,870
This is one of those cases I feel like where I

2178
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:16,730
Didn't have a dog in the fight and Mike your

2179
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:18,410
Passion won me over now I am like

2180
01:19:18,410 --> 01:19:19,990
It better be my penny right

2181
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:21,930
Jason doesn't feel this way though

2182
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:23,890
I don't want to just buy a metal slug

2183
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:26,130
With my credit card Jason doesn't want to say this though because he spent

2184
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:28,090
So much money on these dumb fucking

2185
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:29,490
Pennies that aren't his

2186
01:19:29,490 --> 01:19:31,830
I also ended up accidentally buying

2187
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:34,250
I tried to buy one of the Disney

2188
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:36,270
100 anniversary coins

2189
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:37,770
That Tarrant Killam was talking about

2190
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:39,830
But that's not a press that's just a coin

2191
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:41,850
That's just a coin that dispenses but when

2192
01:19:41,850 --> 01:19:43,710
You do your credit card reader

2193
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:46,250
I ended up with four

2194
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:47,770
Of them so

2195
01:19:48,710 --> 01:19:50,530
Those I like though I don't like

2196
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:51,250
These things

2197
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:53,710
I don't like these things because they're not yours

2198
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:56,010
If it's exactly the same thing

2199
01:19:56,010 --> 01:19:58,730
But you knew it was your penny you love it now

2200
01:19:58,730 --> 01:20:00,230
Yes if it was

2201
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:01,930
Jason's pennies I would be all

2202
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:03,870
On board these coins he's talking about I like because

2203
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:05,690
There's no like pretending

2204
01:20:05,690 --> 01:20:08,290
There's no expectation I had

2205
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:10,130
Before right there's no bait and

2206
01:20:10,130 --> 01:20:10,510
Switch

2207
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:13,150
So fuel rods

2208
01:20:13,770 --> 01:20:15,870
Okay so here's the thing with fuel rods

2209
01:20:17,390 --> 01:20:18,350
That's crazy

2210
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:20,010
When they dropped fuel

2211
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:21,950
Rods originally the whole

2212
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:24,050
Point was that you go to a machine you'd buy a

2213
01:20:24,050 --> 01:20:26,030
$30 fuel rod and then

2214
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:27,890
You were promised on the machine unlimited

2215
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:29,810
Exchanges for free unlimited

2216
01:20:29,810 --> 01:20:32,350
Exchanges there was a sign on the seat on the

2217
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:33,990
On the machine that saying as long as you

2218
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:35,930
Have a fuel rod you

2219
01:20:35,930 --> 01:20:37,950
Put a fuel rod in you get a fresh one out

2220
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:39,990
Oh this was a trade situation

2221
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:41,630
I have one too from Disneyland

2222
01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:43,390
You can charge this

2223
01:20:43,390 --> 01:20:45,010
You have to get a charger

2224
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:46,810
But you don't need to

2225
01:20:47,390 --> 01:20:49,690
Yeah you can charge it with

2226
01:20:49,690 --> 01:20:51,410
I think it's micro USB

2227
01:20:51,410 --> 01:20:53,470
And it comes with some

2228
01:20:53,470 --> 01:20:55,490
Cords it comes with these tiny little

2229
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:56,930
Fucking shitty cords

2230
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:59,650
And this is a USB C adapter

2231
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:01,210
So if you have an android

2232
01:21:01,210 --> 01:21:03,390
Or the new iPhones that charge

2233
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:05,410
With USB C and then it also

2234
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:07,650
Comes with a lightning tiny lightning

2235
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:09,390
Cable which I think I've already lost

2236
01:21:10,450 --> 01:21:11,530
Okay well that's

2237
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:14,690
How recent is this purchase?

2238
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:15,770
This is

2239
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:18,710
Let's say September of 2023

2240
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:20,090
Okay fairly recently

2241
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:21,210
So this is after the lawsuit

2242
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:23,270
Yes this is after the lawsuit

2243
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:25,130
There's a lawsuit

2244
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,510
Of all the things

2245
01:21:26,510 --> 01:21:28,970
Oh my god and it's a correct lawsuit

2246
01:21:29,530 --> 01:21:31,890
So basically they just stopped at one point

2247
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:33,710
So like

2248
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:35,570
At one point they just stopped

2249
01:21:35,570 --> 01:21:37,230
Giving free exchanges

2250
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:39,830
They were planning on charging $3

2251
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:40,950
Per exchange

2252
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:44,050
And when people complained the people from the company

2253
01:21:44,050 --> 01:21:45,750
Were like it wasn't in the contract

2254
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:47,990
That you got free exchanges forever

2255
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:49,550
But when you bought

2256
01:21:49,550 --> 01:21:51,850
The lawsuit was like by this company

2257
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:53,790
In LA this law firm

2258
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:56,070
They were like well it said on the machine

2259
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:57,070
Free exchanges

2260
01:21:57,070 --> 01:21:59,170
That was the contract I introduced you

2261
01:21:59,170 --> 01:22:00,710
You've seen that you've paid

2262
01:22:00,710 --> 01:22:03,710
I guess you signed a mini contract while you were doing

2263
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:04,990
The thing or whatever

2264
01:22:04,990 --> 01:22:07,890
So there was a massive lawsuit

2265
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:10,230
And so finally it got

2266
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:12,570
It went back to if you had bought an original one

2267
01:22:12,570 --> 01:22:14,080
You could become like a legacy member

2268
01:22:14,450 --> 01:22:16,630
And you would go back to getting free exchanges

2269
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:18,530
But the bigger problem with fuel rods

2270
01:22:18,530 --> 01:22:19,830
Now that everyone's realized

2271
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:21,890
Is that there's only enough charge in a fuel rod

2272
01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:24,650
To charge like one third of one charge

2273
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:25,490
Of one phone

2274
01:22:26,410 --> 01:22:28,590
They don't do the full

2275
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:30,150
My god

2276
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:32,310
There's a post on

2277
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:34,010
Our Disney World

2278
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:36,610
From like three years ago where it's like

2279
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:38,930
The amount of amperage

2280
01:22:38,930 --> 01:22:40,730
Or voltage is like

2281
01:22:40,730 --> 01:22:42,530
20% of a modern phone

2282
01:22:42,530 --> 01:22:44,190
So that's a three year old phone

2283
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:47,010
And they're saying it's about 20%

2284
01:22:47,010 --> 01:22:48,890
I think my brother had an older iPhone

2285
01:22:48,890 --> 01:22:51,310
And it caught him up to like 40%

2286
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:52,690
Or something from like six

2287
01:22:52,690 --> 01:22:54,890
Okay but as time goes on

2288
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:57,210
I'm not defending them but maybe there was a time

2289
01:22:57,210 --> 01:22:58,870
Where it doesn't sound like there was ever a time

2290
01:22:58,870 --> 01:22:59,970
Where you got a full battery

2291
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:03,070
So that sucks but like it only gets worse

2292
01:23:03,070 --> 01:23:03,590
There's $30

2293
01:23:04,290 --> 01:23:04,810
Jesus

2294
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:07,130
To not, to maybe

2295
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:10,350
Charge a third of your phone and then exchange program is out

2296
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:13,330
This is some Disney wet dream stuff

2297
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:15,090
The legacy members only

2298
01:23:15,870 --> 01:23:17,650
They're taking notes from fuel rod

2299
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:19,750
And then I try to get in there

2300
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:21,470
And it's all glued over

2301
01:23:22,010 --> 01:23:24,170
What's going on fuel rod

2302
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:26,230
It was great

2303
01:23:26,230 --> 01:23:28,590
Oh no because you don't want to waste phone space

2304
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:29,250
Oh wait yeah

2305
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:30,590
I didn't take a photo

2306
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:32,090
You can't even take a picture of the glue

2307
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:34,090
But it was completely sealed

2308
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:35,710
Is that like

2309
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:38,090
Is it like a prize machine in an arcade

2310
01:23:38,090 --> 01:23:40,150
Where there would be a flap but you can't flap it

2311
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:42,310
Yeah exactly it was like jammed things

2312
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:44,870
Into all the orifices of the machine

2313
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:47,310
And you couldn't put your credit card in

2314
01:23:47,310 --> 01:23:48,050
That's just nothing

2315
01:23:48,050 --> 01:23:50,390
You think you're putting your

2316
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:51,710
Bop bop bop

2317
01:23:51,710 --> 01:23:53,530
It was so weird

2318
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:56,690
It's like going to a Meow Wolf with a fake machine

2319
01:23:56,690 --> 01:23:57,870
That doesn't work

2320
01:23:57,870 --> 01:23:59,650
And trying to act like it does

2321
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:02,190
Rather than just getting rid of the machine

2322
01:24:02,190 --> 01:24:03,730
They keep it there to

2323
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:04,850
Taunt people

2324
01:24:04,850 --> 01:24:07,250
This can't be the only person this happened to

2325
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:09,710
And also there's people around the park telling you you need to go there

2326
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:10,490
To get your thing

2327
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:13,350
But also like I went on their website and I was like

2328
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:15,530
Trying to find locators and the locator for

2329
01:24:15,530 --> 01:24:17,450
Fuel Rod Kiosk says that there's one

2330
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:19,530
Outside Voodoo Donuts at Universal City Walk

2331
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:20,230
Right now

2332
01:24:20,230 --> 01:24:23,890
They don't update they don't put a little glue icon

2333
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:25,170
On that one

2334
01:24:25,170 --> 01:24:27,190
That one's a little glue splat

2335
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:30,390
I think they replaced the machines

2336
01:24:30,390 --> 01:24:31,950
Because I thought it was working

2337
01:24:31,950 --> 01:24:33,010
When I was there

2338
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:34,490
When we were there in November

2339
01:24:34,490 --> 01:24:37,910
Did something happen between Eva's visit and our visit?

2340
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:38,870
Potentially

2341
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:40,310
Something weird was going on

2342
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:42,170
Maybe it was because Horror Nights was kicking off

2343
01:24:42,170 --> 01:24:43,630
And maybe there were more people there

2344
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:45,730
Were people doing weird stuff to the machines?

2345
01:24:46,850 --> 01:24:48,510
What if it wasn't glue?

2346
01:24:51,410 --> 01:24:51,990
Oh no

2347
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:52,890
It was frosting

2348
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:54,570
From Voodoo Donuts

2349
01:24:54,570 --> 01:24:55,630
White frosting

2350
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:58,250
Somebody had to be very horny

2351
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:00,830
To cover two entire

2352
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:04,050
Maybe they brought it from home

2353
01:25:04,050 --> 01:25:05,650
In the hotel

2354
01:25:05,650 --> 01:25:06,650
At Tidefire Falls

2355
01:25:06,650 --> 01:25:08,170
There was a Fuel Rod machine too

2356
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:10,410
That also seemed to be running

2357
01:25:10,410 --> 01:25:12,690
So if you're stuck in an airport

2358
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:14,510
Or at a theme park or a hotel

2359
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:16,610
And you want 20%

2360
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:17,910
Of a phone charge

2361
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:20,690
Walk on down to the Fuel Rod

2362
01:25:20,690 --> 01:25:21,370
Machine

2363
01:25:21,370 --> 01:25:23,050
So my question is

2364
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:25,550
If you want a full charge of your phone

2365
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:27,310
Could you

2366
01:25:27,310 --> 01:25:29,610
Pay $30, get a Fuel Rod

2367
01:25:29,610 --> 01:25:31,850
Join the legacy program

2368
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:34,790
Charge your phone 20%

2369
01:25:34,790 --> 01:25:36,910
Put in the machine, take one out

2370
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:38,190
20 more percent

2371
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:40,910
And you just have to sit near the machine

2372
01:25:40,910 --> 01:25:42,590
For as long as that takes

2373
01:25:43,290 --> 01:25:44,390
You can walk around

2374
01:25:45,230 --> 01:25:46,990
There's some in the park

2375
01:25:46,990 --> 01:25:48,230
In the parks too

2376
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:50,770
So your route has to be from one machine to another machine

2377
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:52,190
You certainly have to plan

2378
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:53,730
You gotta pay for park admission

2379
01:25:53,730 --> 01:25:55,150
That's part of it now too

2380
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:56,530
So you've paid your park ticket

2381
01:25:58,370 --> 01:26:01,010
I don't know if you can join the legacy program

2382
01:26:01,010 --> 01:26:02,730
Is that not cut off by time?

2383
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:03,950
Jason are you a legacy member?

2384
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:05,170
That's a recent purchase

2385
01:26:05,170 --> 01:26:07,950
I think they backtracked

2386
01:26:07,950 --> 01:26:09,930
I don't think they implemented the fines

2387
01:26:09,930 --> 01:26:12,370
So they didn't implement the legacy program

2388
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:13,670
It's just back to the old days

2389
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:14,710
I think so

2390
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:16,550
It sounds like you didn't read your contract

2391
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:18,150
No I was poking around

2392
01:26:18,490 --> 01:26:21,030
I was poking around

2393
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:22,230
To see if it would

2394
01:26:22,230 --> 01:26:23,630
I'm a legacy member

2395
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:25,450
I bought this before the lawsuit

2396
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:28,350
I'm glad you guys hadn't told me

2397
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:29,990
There's legacy members in my press

2398
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:31,890
I would have been so nervous doing this podcast

2399
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:33,110
I'm a Fuel Rod legacy member

2400
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:35,790
So intimidated all of a sudden

2401
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:38,830
I think the important thing to convey

2402
01:26:38,830 --> 01:26:40,690
Is that these things suck

2403
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:44,690
They're bad

2404
01:26:44,690 --> 01:26:46,710
It's a starter that you keep in your trunk

2405
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:49,310
And it'll get you a little bit

2406
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:50,930
I think I need to feel the weight on this

2407
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:52,050
Can you trust your ass?

2408
01:26:52,050 --> 01:26:53,250
It's way too heavy

2409
01:26:54,610 --> 01:26:56,490
And for modern phones

2410
01:26:56,490 --> 01:26:59,030
I don't recall having a plastic case

2411
01:26:59,030 --> 01:27:02,350
Jason's got a little cigar holder

2412
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:04,940
It needs to hold all the shitty little cables

2413
01:27:05,450 --> 01:27:08,030
I don't know that I got all the shitty little cables either

2414
01:27:08,030 --> 01:27:08,750
It's so heavy

2415
01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:10,730
It's called Nightcore

2416
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:12,470
N-I-T-E-C-O-R-E

2417
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:14,350
It's like 90 bucks

2418
01:27:14,350 --> 01:27:15,670
It's really good

2419
01:27:15,670 --> 01:27:17,050
It charges your stuff really fast

2420
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:19,610
I have an Anker one from 2015

2421
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:21,470
It holds multiple charges

2422
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:24,790
If you took that though

2423
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:26,150
And you put it in your fist

2424
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:27,010
And closed it

2425
01:27:27,990 --> 01:27:29,430
It's like a roll of quarters

2426
01:27:30,730 --> 01:27:32,790
You could break some wise guy's nose

2427
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:35,070
You could break some sort of

2428
01:27:35,070 --> 01:27:36,790
Something Tracy would do in a pinch

2429
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:37,570
What do I got?

2430
01:27:37,690 --> 01:27:38,670
How can I do some damage?

2431
01:27:38,690 --> 01:27:41,050
You punch, punch and then the acid comes out

2432
01:27:41,050 --> 01:27:43,090
You beat up Pennyface

2433
01:27:44,490 --> 01:27:45,770
The facey villain

2434
01:27:47,150 --> 01:27:49,250
You turn him into a pressed penny

2435
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:50,890
That's the second part of my lecture

2436
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:53,690
How to defeat these bad guys

2437
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:57,910
The weak points in their facial structures

2438
01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:00,990
This also by the way

2439
01:28:00,990 --> 01:28:03,190
Caution, risk of fire and burns

2440
01:28:03,190 --> 01:28:07,010
Do not open, crush heat above 45 degrees

2441
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:09,550
Don't put that in an electric kettle

2442
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:10,790
On the website they're like

2443
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:12,530
Mine got really hot, is this normal?

2444
01:28:12,610 --> 01:28:13,530
And they're like yes

2445
01:28:14,170 --> 01:28:15,870
That means it's working

2446
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:19,270
It gets hot, there's no percentages

2447
01:28:19,270 --> 01:28:20,310
On it

2448
01:28:21,390 --> 01:28:23,470
Sometimes it's lit up red

2449
01:28:23,470 --> 01:28:24,450
When it's charging

2450
01:28:24,450 --> 01:28:27,350
And then I think when it's charged it switches to blue

2451
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:28,710
It's not great

2452
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:30,930
And I have an iPhone 13 mini

2453
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:32,670
So it's a smaller battery

2454
01:28:32,670 --> 01:28:34,950
And it really doesn't charge very much

2455
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:36,510
It feels like sticky too

2456
01:28:36,510 --> 01:28:37,050
The name of the company

2457
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:37,690
Well that's Jason

2458
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:40,710
The Sheridan house residue

2459
01:28:40,710 --> 01:28:42,390
I was eating a coffee bun

2460
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:43,930
Or an apple fritter

2461
01:28:43,930 --> 01:28:46,110
It's not a weird thing, it's a sweet roll thing

2462
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:48,610
It's an LA place

2463
01:28:48,610 --> 01:28:49,970
It's been open forever

2464
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:52,810
If I touched any of Jason's clothes I'd feel that too

2465
01:28:52,810 --> 01:28:54,610
It's all Donut Prince residue

2466
01:28:54,610 --> 01:28:55,190
It's frosting

2467
01:28:55,190 --> 01:28:57,470
They got the photos on the wall

2468
01:28:57,470 --> 01:29:01,690
They have an unusually large number of photos of George Lopez on the wall

2469
01:29:01,690 --> 01:29:02,930
He loves Donuts

2470
01:29:02,930 --> 01:29:04,090
17 photos

2471
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:05,790
Is Donut Prince on Magnolia?

2472
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:07,030
No it's on Olive

2473
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:08,750
Donut Hut is on Magnolia

2474
01:29:09,950 --> 01:29:12,170
Jason's on Donut, he runs DonutTracker.

2475
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:12,770
com

2476
01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:14,490
Also the company that owns this

2477
01:29:14,490 --> 01:29:16,350
Is named Save Me Productions

2478
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:17,790
One word, Save Me

2479
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:19,410
S-capital-M

2480
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:21,490
And no one has checked on them?

2481
01:29:22,430 --> 01:29:23,830
We're messing up

2482
01:29:23,830 --> 01:29:24,870
Real bad

2483
01:29:24,870 --> 01:29:28,630
It's a combination of Save Me products, Save Me batteries

2484
01:29:28,630 --> 01:29:30,290
And Tricopian

2485
01:29:30,290 --> 01:29:32,230
Which is Switzerland

2486
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:36,490
I'm scared about what Tricopian does

2487
01:29:36,490 --> 01:29:38,270
It's better than nothing

2488
01:29:38,270 --> 01:29:40,790
But it's not worth $30

2489
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:42,630
Part of the lawsuit was

2490
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:44,510
The sign on the machines that said

2491
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:45,850
Free unlimited swapping

2492
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:46,430
Yeah

2493
01:29:46,430 --> 01:29:49,110
When they were complaining

2494
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:50,260
Like no, no, no

2495
01:29:50,770 --> 01:29:51,510
It was like

2496
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:54,530
No, you can't do that

2497
01:29:54,530 --> 01:29:55,710
So Tricopian

2498
01:29:56,230 --> 01:29:58,170
According to the suit

2499
01:29:58,170 --> 01:30:00,050
The plaintiff and proposed class members

2500
01:30:00,050 --> 01:30:01,750
Who bought the Friarod now own

2501
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:04,090
A far less desirable product

2502
01:30:04,970 --> 01:30:06,430
That they would not

2503
01:30:06,430 --> 01:30:07,370
Have purchased

2504
01:30:08,050 --> 01:30:10,130
Yeah, but they own it now

2505
01:30:10,130 --> 01:30:11,750
But they thought they could get

2506
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:14,030
I literally

2507
01:30:14,030 --> 01:30:16,330
I bought it because I left my

2508
01:30:16,330 --> 01:30:17,810
Battery in Burbank

2509
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:20,310
We were staying in Anaheim for a few days

2510
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:22,390
And so the only

2511
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:24,370
Time it came through, like my brother's

2512
01:30:24,370 --> 01:30:26,350
Phone was almost dead and it gave him

2513
01:30:26,350 --> 01:30:27,610
A little jump

2514
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:28,610
Yeah

2515
01:30:28,610 --> 01:30:30,110
It is like AAA

2516
01:30:30,110 --> 01:30:33,390
It is like a AAA program for phone batteries

2517
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:33,970
Basically

2518
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:36,990
It would probably keep your phone at like 15%

2519
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:39,190
If you kept getting new ones

2520
01:30:39,190 --> 01:30:41,230
I don't know that it could get your phone

2521
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:42,670
Up to like 80%

2522
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:44,630
But it probably could keep it at 15%

2523
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:45,270
It feels like

2524
01:30:46,490 --> 01:30:49,530
The end of tech, it feels like the end of capitalism

2525
01:30:50,690 --> 01:30:51,690
How could things

2526
01:30:51,690 --> 01:30:52,490
Get this bad

2527
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:54,530
How do we allow Save Me Productions

2528
01:30:55,150 --> 01:30:55,630
To

2529
01:30:55,630 --> 01:30:57,130
It feels like what will happen

2530
01:30:59,390 --> 01:31:00,350
Soon phones

2531
01:31:00,350 --> 01:31:01,950
Won't even have their own battery

2532
01:31:01,950 --> 01:31:03,530
And you'll need fuel rods

2533
01:31:04,110 --> 01:31:06,030
In general just to turn your phone on

2534
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:08,630
And then you'll have to go from fuel rod

2535
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:10,250
To fuel rod to just keep your phone on

2536
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:13,330
That's like end of capitalism

2537
01:31:13,330 --> 01:31:14,970
We live in a 20 minute city

2538
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:16,010
Whatever we call them

2539
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:18,590
The biggest threat

2540
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:20,530
The biggest threat the Democrats

2541
01:31:20,530 --> 01:31:21,450
Are trying to do

2542
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:23,730
They want us to eat the bugs and buy the fuel rods

2543
01:31:24,430 --> 01:31:24,950
Eat the bugs

2544
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:25,970
Wait did we have no

2545
01:31:25,970 --> 01:31:27,650
Scott you have the laptop

2546
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:31,090
Who owns Save Me Products or Trikopian

2547
01:31:31,090 --> 01:31:32,470
Is there anyone good

2548
01:31:32,470 --> 01:31:35,270
It's funny you ask I am already on the LinkedIn

2549
01:31:35,270 --> 01:31:37,810
Of the CEO of Trikopian

2550
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:39,530
Trikopian Inc

2551
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:41,070
And DBA is fuel rod

2552
01:31:41,070 --> 01:31:42,950
So Trikopian is fuel rod

2553
01:31:42,950 --> 01:31:45,010
His name is Chi Yao

2554
01:31:45,010 --> 01:31:46,330
He's in San Diego

2555
01:31:46,990 --> 01:31:49,390
A passionate, energetic, visionary

2556
01:31:49,390 --> 01:31:51,470
Innovator, entrepreneur, business leader

2557
01:31:51,470 --> 01:31:53,230
With a broad and diverse skill set

2558
01:31:53,230 --> 01:31:55,530
Professional experience and cultural background

2559
01:31:55,530 --> 01:31:57,750
Gained from over two decades of exposure

2560
01:31:57,750 --> 01:31:59,210
In technology industries

2561
01:31:59,210 --> 01:32:01,350
And highly challenging global leadership

2562
01:32:01,350 --> 01:32:03,490
Assignments at startups and major corporations

2563
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:05,850
I think we've won jargon bingo

2564
01:32:05,850 --> 01:32:07,570
We got that's a full

2565
01:32:07,570 --> 01:32:08,050
Board

2566
01:32:08,730 --> 01:32:11,210
Is that just like the I read that

2567
01:32:11,210 --> 01:32:12,990
And I was like am I reading the default

2568
01:32:12,990 --> 01:32:15,630
What comes in your LinkedIn bio if you don't

2569
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:16,450
Change it

2570
01:32:16,450 --> 01:32:18,150
That was all nothing

2571
01:32:19,050 --> 01:32:19,770
How do you

2572
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:22,670
I feel like the only way you get these massive contracts

2573
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:24,010
With Disney, Orlando

2574
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:26,330
All these airports is if you have

2575
01:32:26,330 --> 01:32:28,150
So much startup money that you're like yeah

2576
01:32:28,150 --> 01:32:30,770
And you just buy it once and then we charge it forever

2577
01:32:30,770 --> 01:32:32,610
Whoever is like the dip and dots

2578
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:34,350
Lawyer

2579
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:36,610
There's a lawyer that

2580
01:32:36,610 --> 01:32:38,610
Takes all these different brands that no one

2581
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:39,790
Really likes that much

2582
01:32:39,790 --> 01:32:41,890
And makes a deal and puts them everywhere

2583
01:32:42,430 --> 01:32:44,650
I was going to fight for dip and dots

2584
01:32:44,650 --> 01:32:46,830
But my body I like dip and dots

2585
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:48,570
More than I like a fuel

2586
01:32:48,570 --> 01:32:50,010
Yeah, I do too

2587
01:32:50,730 --> 01:32:52,830
I would have to say that as well and I don't

2588
01:32:52,830 --> 01:32:53,550
Like dip and dots

2589
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:56,770
Here's okay this is unrelated

2590
01:32:56,770 --> 01:32:58,710
But it's funny I think and you tell me

2591
01:32:58,710 --> 01:33:00,970
If I'm wrong I looked up save me products

2592
01:33:00,970 --> 01:33:02,870
And I got save me products

2593
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:03,170
Inc.

2594
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:04,490
And what I believe

2595
01:33:04,490 --> 01:33:06,890
This is not the same save me products

2596
01:33:06,890 --> 01:33:07,170
Inc.

2597
01:33:07,370 --> 01:33:08,950
Because this is save me products

2598
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:09,190

01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:11,010
Which are offers for stockmen

2600
01:33:11,010 --> 01:33:12,970
The cold weather newborn calf hood

2601
01:33:12,970 --> 01:33:15,350
To help battle and prevent frostbite

2602
01:33:15,350 --> 01:33:16,350
This is

2603
01:33:16,830 --> 01:33:18,690
Save me products

2604
01:33:18,690 --> 01:33:21,170
This company save me products offers a

2605
01:33:21,170 --> 01:33:22,690
Newborn calf hood

2606
01:33:22,690 --> 01:33:24,730
For your calf

2607
01:33:24,730 --> 01:33:26,650
On a farm

2608
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:29,070
It's that you're what you're showing looks

2609
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:30,810
Like a Mexican wrestling mask

2610
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:32,490
It's like a lucha lucha mask

2611
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:34,370
It's a mask for

2612
01:33:34,970 --> 01:33:36,090
Newborn calves

2613
01:33:36,090 --> 01:33:38,390
I think this is a different

2614
01:33:38,390 --> 01:33:39,990
But what if it wasn't?

2615
01:33:40,250 --> 01:33:41,010
Well I'm reading

2616
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:42,970
I'm not sure yet

2617
01:33:42,970 --> 01:33:44,210
We also sell

2618
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:46,810
Bollock plovers for cattle and we also

2619
01:33:46,810 --> 01:33:48,510
Sell these shitty little batteries

2620
01:33:48,510 --> 01:33:51,250
We also offer interesting horse collectibles

2621
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:53,210
And some items for the farmer rancher

2622
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:55,330
Horse owner antique hound

2623
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:56,730
Art connoisseur

2624
01:33:56,730 --> 01:33:59,090
Collectible items that may just want you

2625
01:33:59,090 --> 01:34:00,390
To save me

2626
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:01,610
What is that sentence?

2627
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:01,970
Huh

2628
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:04,770
We also carry a few one of a kind fine

2629
01:34:04,770 --> 01:34:07,150
Handcrafted small leather items from a

2630
01:34:07,150 --> 01:34:08,790
Local professional craftsman

2631
01:34:08,790 --> 01:34:11,430
I'm sensing equine crime

2632
01:34:11,430 --> 01:34:12,310
It's a fuck

2633
01:34:15,570 --> 01:34:17,330
It's that villainous cow face

2634
01:34:17,330 --> 01:34:17,870
I bet

2635
01:34:20,370 --> 01:34:22,530
You can get a sticker that says

2636
01:34:22,530 --> 01:34:25,430
Faith is confidence in God's world

2637
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:27,530
So that's for your window

2638
01:34:27,530 --> 01:34:28,370
That's for a window

2639
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:31,670
I can't make heads or tails what kind of company I'm looking at

2640
01:34:31,670 --> 01:34:33,590
A religious cow mask company

2641
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:35,410
A religious cow mask company

2642
01:34:35,410 --> 01:34:37,410
Of course we assume we talk about this

2643
01:34:38,630 --> 01:34:40,150
I'm sorry I was looking for this earlier

2644
01:34:40,150 --> 01:34:41,750
But I did find it and it is funny

2645
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:43,950
This is jumping back a little bit in the lawsuit

2646
01:34:43,950 --> 01:34:46,310
But when people were like

2647
01:34:46,310 --> 01:34:48,650
When they stopped doing the unlimited fuel rods

2648
01:34:49,210 --> 01:34:50,310
Someone reached out

2649
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:51,910
This is on a mice chat article

2650
01:34:51,910 --> 01:34:52,770
About this whole thing

2651
01:34:53,350 --> 01:34:54,510
Someone reached out

2652
01:34:54,510 --> 01:34:55,430
Is that Len Testa?

2653
01:34:55,870 --> 01:34:56,010
No

2654
01:34:56,010 --> 01:34:57,210
That's Dusty Sage

2655
01:34:58,890 --> 01:35:02,390
So somebody reached out and was like hey why have you changed your thought policy

2656
01:35:02,390 --> 01:35:03,850
And this was a fuel rods response

2657
01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:05,390
And they just print it

2658
01:35:05,850 --> 01:35:06,370
All caps

2659
01:35:06,370 --> 01:35:09,050
There was and is no contract signed for free swapping

2660
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:10,250
Dear sir or madam

2661
01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:13,390
I am sorry you are upset

2662
01:35:13,390 --> 01:35:15,470
There was and is no contract signed

2663
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:16,910
For free swapping

2664
01:35:16,910 --> 01:35:19,410
We offered this for over five years but has come to a point

2665
01:35:19,410 --> 01:35:21,290
Where we can no longer do this

2666
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:25,750
We do have an app out now

2667
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:26,970
That will offer specials etc

2668
01:35:26,970 --> 01:35:29,030
I can send you a code that will be good until the end of the month

2669
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:29,990
That will help with the transition

2670
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:32,030
Please remember that the fuel rod is rechargeable

2671
01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:34,350
If anything goes awry with the product we will still

2672
01:35:34,350 --> 01:35:35,110
On a replacement

2673
01:35:35,110 --> 01:35:38,450
Kind regards name redacted fuel rod team member

2674
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:41,470
That is by the way

2675
01:35:42,030 --> 01:35:43,490
My level of psycho

2676
01:35:43,490 --> 01:35:45,830
Is that I have used and charged

2677
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:47,970
The fuel rod multiple times

2678
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:50,630
Outside of a theme park

2679
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:51,690
Outside of a theme park

2680
01:35:51,690 --> 01:35:54,110
I'll just plug it in to the USB plug

2681
01:35:54,110 --> 01:35:55,730
And charge it when I go to bed

2682
01:35:55,730 --> 01:35:58,120
I feel like it's a good maybe car

2683
01:35:58,650 --> 01:36:00,310
Emergency car thing

2684
01:36:00,310 --> 01:36:04,070
I guess southern California

2685
01:36:04,070 --> 01:36:05,730
The temperature doesn't

2686
01:36:05,730 --> 01:36:07,050
Flux your way too much

2687
01:36:07,050 --> 01:36:08,330
So you can leave it in a car

2688
01:36:08,330 --> 01:36:10,270
It will probably uncharge after like four months

2689
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:13,010
I have a phone charger that you hand crank

2690
01:36:13,010 --> 01:36:13,990
Oh I see

2691
01:36:14,670 --> 01:36:16,630
It's also a radio and other things

2692
01:36:16,630 --> 01:36:17,570
And a flashlight

2693
01:36:18,350 --> 01:36:20,870
I feel like that would probably work faster

2694
01:36:20,870 --> 01:36:21,890
Than a fuel rod

2695
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:23,370
To charge your phone

2696
01:36:24,190 --> 01:36:26,530
There's another guy a co-founder and a COO

2697
01:36:26,530 --> 01:36:27,630
Joe Yagley

2698
01:36:27,630 --> 01:36:30,610
Sheow and Joe Yagley are the guys to watch

2699
01:36:30,610 --> 01:36:33,450
He was part of something called Eagle Enterprises

2700
01:36:33,450 --> 01:36:33,790
Powergenics

2701
01:36:34,710 --> 01:36:35,770
A lot of real

2702
01:36:35,770 --> 01:36:37,070
Sounding companies

2703
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:38,910
Guess what private citizens

2704
01:36:38,910 --> 01:36:41,250
In the world of podcasting

2705
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:43,590
You're about to become public

2706
01:36:45,830 --> 01:36:47,870
Jason how much do you think a large

2707
01:36:47,870 --> 01:36:49,630
Size calf hood is

2708
01:36:50,630 --> 01:36:51,530
How much

2709
01:36:51,530 --> 01:36:53,790
Can I buy one right now

2710
01:36:54,650 --> 01:36:56,050
What's that material

2711
01:36:56,050 --> 01:36:57,230
What are you working with

2712
01:36:57,230 --> 01:36:58,110
Canvas, leather

2713
01:36:58,110 --> 01:37:01,670
There's many paragraphs explaining

2714
01:37:01,670 --> 01:37:02,690
About the hood

2715
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:04,590
How do you know if they're a boy or a girl cow

2716
01:37:04,590 --> 01:37:07,350
Can you get pink ones with little flowers

2717
01:37:07,350 --> 01:37:08,650
This is a black one

2718
01:37:08,650 --> 01:37:11,290
This looks like the calf is robbing a 7-Eleven

2719
01:37:11,290 --> 01:37:13,470
I don't like the black ones I want gender

2720
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:14,290
Conforming

2721
01:37:16,490 --> 01:37:17,910
I want one with

2722
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:19,690
Rocket ships and Spiderman

2723
01:37:19,690 --> 01:37:20,750
And one with Barbie

2724
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:24,430
And really big wasteful calf gender reveal party

2725
01:37:24,430 --> 01:37:26,790
Wasteful to the level of selling

2726
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:28,330
Random shitty

2727
01:37:28,330 --> 01:37:29,830
Lithium ion batteries

2728
01:37:30,330 --> 01:37:32,030
A lot of touristy places

2729
01:37:32,030 --> 01:37:34,650
The only difference is that there's large and small

2730
01:37:34,650 --> 01:37:36,510
Calf hoods but you can get

2731
01:37:36,510 --> 01:37:37,830
One that has a

2732
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:40,750
Reflective stripe over the calf's

2733
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:42,410
Head so I assume in the dark

2734
01:37:42,410 --> 01:37:43,850
You'll be able to see the calf

2735
01:37:44,270 --> 01:37:45,790
As if it was jogging

2736
01:37:47,010 --> 01:37:48,270
It's like taking a

2737
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:48,770
Late night

2738
01:37:50,950 --> 01:37:52,650
These calves don't look happy

2739
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:54,410
With their hoods

2740
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:56,890
Also it looks like this is photoshopped

2741
01:37:56,890 --> 01:37:57,450
On the calf

2742
01:37:57,450 --> 01:38:00,210
This doesn't appear to be actually on this calf's head

2743
01:38:00,210 --> 01:38:02,750
When you put the

2744
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:04,930
Hoods on they start kicking and

2745
01:38:04,930 --> 01:38:05,170
Drain

2746
01:38:05,170 --> 01:38:07,750
I want to know more of the trinkets

2747
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:08,970
On this website

2748
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:12,030
There's the faith is confidence in God's world

2749
01:38:12,030 --> 01:38:13,370
Terrible graphic design

2750
01:38:14,350 --> 01:38:16,430
And then there's a lot of blankets

2751
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:18,210
Different colored blankets

2752
01:38:18,210 --> 01:38:20,030
You can get wallets

2753
01:38:20,030 --> 01:38:21,490
You can buy leather wallets

2754
01:38:21,950 --> 01:38:24,050
Did you have a price point for that calf hood?

2755
01:38:24,590 --> 01:38:25,350
Oh wait yeah that was the game

2756
01:38:26,090 --> 01:38:27,130
We forgot to answer it

2757
01:38:27,130 --> 01:38:29,050
I was going to say around $40

2758
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:30,990
It's a little high mark

2759
01:38:32,050 --> 01:38:32,530
$120

2760
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:34,430
$80

2761
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:38,550
$6259

2762
01:38:39,170 --> 01:38:40,010
That's a lot of numbers

2763
01:38:40,010 --> 01:38:42,010
And if you want the reflective stripe

2764
01:38:42,010 --> 01:38:42,710
It's $66.

2765
01:38:42,710 --> 01:38:43,410
75

2766
01:38:43,410 --> 01:38:45,210
Why are they in this middle ground

2767
01:38:45,210 --> 01:38:47,590
Why is there smash pennies

2768
01:38:47,590 --> 01:38:48,530
I've got to come into this

2769
01:38:50,650 --> 01:38:51,330
$66.

2770
01:38:51,330 --> 01:38:52,010
20

2771
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:53,250
And then

2772
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:54,850
Four Hulk smash pennies

2773
01:38:54,850 --> 01:38:57,390
You must procure these items from Universal Florida

2774
01:38:57,390 --> 01:39:00,550
You can get Dalmatian toys with little boots on

2775
01:39:01,270 --> 01:39:02,810
How much is that?

2776
01:39:03,230 --> 01:39:05,830
That is $15

2777
01:39:05,830 --> 01:39:07,550
And they have

2778
01:39:07,550 --> 01:39:09,250
One units in stock

2779
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:11,670
They have one single Dalmatian with boots?

2780
01:39:12,430 --> 01:39:13,910
It's unclear if they have

2781
01:39:13,910 --> 01:39:15,450
The two different dogs in the picture

2782
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:18,190
Does the website have an about me

2783
01:39:18,190 --> 01:39:19,690
Or about us section?

2784
01:39:20,590 --> 01:39:20,970
Yeah

2785
01:39:20,970 --> 01:39:22,230
Let me get to that

2786
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:25,710
We're finding that one of the save me productions

2787
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:26,790
Might be okay

2788
01:39:27,450 --> 01:39:28,550
Even tread carefully

2789
01:39:28,550 --> 01:39:30,030
They're at the LA county fair

2790
01:39:30,030 --> 01:39:33,270
They're going to walk up to your delicious huckleberry pie

2791
01:39:33,270 --> 01:39:35,150
Or something like flip it over

2792
01:39:35,150 --> 01:39:37,050
Don't mess with save me

2793
01:39:37,050 --> 01:39:38,870
Nice prize winning pie you got there

2794
01:39:38,870 --> 01:39:41,790
It would be a shame if an angry

2795
01:39:41,790 --> 01:39:43,170
Cav who's been wearing a hoodie

2796
01:39:43,170 --> 01:39:44,590
Doesn't like all day

2797
01:39:44,590 --> 01:39:46,370
Walking up to a plate of

2798
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:49,290
Sugar cookies and breaking one in half

2799
01:39:49,290 --> 01:39:51,010
Be careful

2800
01:39:52,090 --> 01:39:53,410
I'm having a problem

2801
01:39:53,410 --> 01:39:54,530
Finding an about

2802
01:39:55,170 --> 01:39:56,530
Keep looking Mike

2803
01:39:58,050 --> 01:39:59,870
You got back

2804
01:39:59,870 --> 01:40:01,010
What happened?

2805
01:40:01,150 --> 01:40:04,090
That's why I didn't get a drink at dead coconut club

2806
01:40:04,090 --> 01:40:05,230
Because I was like

2807
01:40:05,230 --> 01:40:06,190
There's no time

2808
01:40:06,190 --> 01:40:07,550
You got to see the show

2809
01:40:07,550 --> 01:40:09,530
What happened?

2810
01:40:09,530 --> 01:40:10,110
I was in the dark

2811
01:40:10,110 --> 01:40:10,630
Crater and waters

2812
01:40:12,290 --> 01:40:15,490
I alone sat in a dark

2813
01:40:16,390 --> 01:40:17,250
Conference room

2814
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:18,310
And watched crater and waters

2815
01:40:18,310 --> 01:40:21,810
And then I went

2816
01:40:21,810 --> 01:40:22,770
So you did make it back

2817
01:40:22,770 --> 01:40:24,950
You had just enough fuel rods be damned

2818
01:40:24,950 --> 01:40:25,930
You did get back

2819
01:40:25,930 --> 01:40:31,030
I did have a little bit of time

2820
01:40:31,030 --> 01:40:32,310
So I was considering

2821
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:33,790
Going into

2822
01:40:33,790 --> 01:40:35,770
I was considering

2823
01:40:35,770 --> 01:40:37,810
Coming back or going into

2824
01:40:37,810 --> 01:40:39,530
Sorry, into horror nights

2825
01:40:39,530 --> 01:40:41,650
Because I was curious about some of the very

2826
01:40:41,650 --> 01:40:43,670
Hyper specific Orlando

2827
01:40:44,270 --> 01:40:45,290
Mazes they have

2828
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:47,910
Because there's ones that are based

2829
01:40:47,910 --> 01:40:49,690
On rides that they have

2830
01:40:49,690 --> 01:40:51,250
Or lore that's specific to Orlando

2831
01:40:51,250 --> 01:40:52,350
And less on movies

2832
01:40:53,310 --> 01:40:55,690
I didn't realize how massively popular

2833
01:40:55,690 --> 01:40:57,850
It was there and there was no possible way to get in that night

2834
01:40:57,850 --> 01:40:59,270
I can't get in there

2835
01:40:59,270 --> 01:41:00,890
And also my phone's dying

2836
01:41:00,890 --> 01:41:02,970
Fuel rods, no

2837
01:41:03,630 --> 01:41:06,270
I poisoned myself but I won't know for 24 hours

2838
01:41:06,270 --> 01:41:07,770
And then I was like, okay

2839
01:41:07,770 --> 01:41:09,910
I'm going to walk through dead coconut club

2840
01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:10,890
And then I was like, aw

2841
01:41:10,890 --> 01:41:13,350
And then I just sprinted back and got an Uber

2842
01:41:13,350 --> 01:41:15,090
And I made it back to see crater and waters

2843
01:41:15,610 --> 01:41:17,150
Thank god, thank god

2844
01:41:17,150 --> 01:41:18,390
Okay, okay

2845
01:41:18,390 --> 01:41:22,130
If we had caused the crater and waters show

2846
01:41:22,130 --> 01:41:22,850
To not have been accomplished

2847
01:41:22,850 --> 01:41:25,870
What if I had bought a fuel rod and only gotten 10% out of it

2848
01:41:25,870 --> 01:41:27,910
And then I'd been just so angry

2849
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:30,270
What if I had like bought

2850
01:41:30,270 --> 01:41:32,170
I'd gotten a fuel rod

2851
01:41:32,170 --> 01:41:33,510
Gotten into the park

2852
01:41:33,510 --> 01:41:35,550
And then realized I was fucked

2853
01:41:35,550 --> 01:41:37,670
You've been ripped off

2854
01:41:37,670 --> 01:41:39,870
By the bad Save Me

2855
01:41:39,870 --> 01:41:41,450
Production, not this good one

2856
01:41:41,450 --> 01:41:42,430
Not the good one

2857
01:41:43,390 --> 01:41:44,690
I like these guys

2858
01:41:44,690 --> 01:41:47,130
Are they based on one of the Dakotas or something?

2859
01:41:47,570 --> 01:41:48,910
Where do calves get this coal?

2860
01:41:48,990 --> 01:41:51,090
It's a good question but I have a couple

2861
01:41:51,090 --> 01:41:52,890
Questions that are answered here on the website

2862
01:41:52,890 --> 01:41:55,870
That I want to let everyone in on

2863
01:41:55,870 --> 01:41:57,710
Question, do I need to dry

2864
01:41:57,710 --> 01:41:59,730
The calf off or will Save Me

2865
01:41:59,730 --> 01:42:00,750
Ears do that?

2866
01:42:01,050 --> 01:42:01,630
Answer, Save Me

2867
01:42:01,630 --> 01:42:03,650
Save Me Ears is not a calf dryer

2868
01:42:03,650 --> 01:42:05,930
In cold weather you should always

2869
01:42:05,930 --> 01:42:07,310
Dry the calf off

2870
01:42:07,310 --> 01:42:09,650
Especially if the temperature is 20 degrees

2871
01:42:09,650 --> 01:42:12,070
Or colder where the newborn calf is located

2872
01:42:12,070 --> 01:42:14,030
So Save Me Ears are not

2873
01:42:14,030 --> 01:42:15,190
Drying your calf

2874
01:42:15,190 --> 01:42:17,690
You have to do that before you put

2875
01:42:17,690 --> 01:42:19,370
The ears on them

2876
01:42:20,270 --> 01:42:21,090
Dryads only

2877
01:42:21,630 --> 01:42:23,570
Jason, if you'll excuse me I have another

2878
01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:24,430
Question to read

2879
01:42:24,430 --> 01:42:26,330
Alright, fine

2880
01:42:26,330 --> 01:42:28,330
He's smashing their ears down

2881
01:42:28,330 --> 01:42:30,470
I have a hundred cows to calf

2882
01:42:30,470 --> 01:42:31,750
Out during cold weather

2883
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:33,730
Do I need one for each calf?

2884
01:42:34,290 --> 01:42:36,050
Answer, Save Me Ears is only meant to be used

2885
01:42:36,050 --> 01:42:38,450
For the first 24 to 36 hours of a newborn

2886
01:42:38,450 --> 01:42:39,230
Calf's life

2887
01:42:39,230 --> 01:42:42,390
After that it should be removed or passed on to the next calf

2888
01:42:42,390 --> 01:42:44,410
We recommend having one Save

2889
01:42:44,410 --> 01:42:46,630
Me Ears for the most cows you have had

2890
01:42:46,630 --> 01:42:48,270
These sentences are not that great

2891
01:42:48,270 --> 01:42:50,390
That normally calf in one day

2892
01:42:50,390 --> 01:42:52,250
C-A-L-V-E when I keep saying that

2893
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:54,090
Well because calf and

2894
01:42:54,090 --> 01:42:56,170
Calve is a

2895
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:58,010
It's also a verb

2896
01:42:58,010 --> 01:42:59,650
To calf, I guess I didn't know that

2897
01:42:59,650 --> 01:43:01,890
Having a calf is calving

2898
01:43:01,890 --> 01:43:04,850
Oh, so I should be saying calving on some of these words

2899
01:43:04,850 --> 01:43:05,990
Or whatever, no no I'm saying

2900
01:43:05,990 --> 01:43:07,790
Calving is

2901
01:43:07,790 --> 01:43:09,390
Giving birth to a calf

2902
01:43:09,390 --> 01:43:12,290
Maybe we don't have to do that L so hard, is that what you're calving?

2903
01:43:12,710 --> 01:43:13,890
Calving works fine, I don't know

2904
01:43:13,890 --> 01:43:15,550
Calving, calving

2905
01:43:16,670 --> 01:43:17,470
Not calving

2906
01:43:18,050 --> 01:43:20,090
So you're supposed to

2907
01:43:20,090 --> 01:43:21,930
So, okay

2908
01:43:22,950 --> 01:43:24,550
You're supposed to get a hundred cows

2909
01:43:24,990 --> 01:43:27,050
Yeah, but you don't need one for each cow

2910
01:43:27,050 --> 01:43:28,690
If ten of them are going to give birth

2911
01:43:28,690 --> 01:43:30,090
Every day

2912
01:43:30,090 --> 01:43:32,090
Not only are we going to get more at the same time

2913
01:43:32,090 --> 01:43:34,050
Yeah, you need a hundred because that's too many

2914
01:43:34,050 --> 01:43:36,670
It's six thousand dollars worth of

2915
01:43:36,670 --> 01:43:37,190
Ears

2916
01:43:37,190 --> 01:43:41,030
You also, the turnover, you've got to be calving

2917
01:43:42,330 --> 01:43:42,730
Calving

2918
01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:44,730
You've got to be calving so often

2919
01:43:44,730 --> 01:43:46,570
To make this thing worthwhile

2920
01:43:46,970 --> 01:43:48,790
This is where I pull out as a shark

2921
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:50,190
This is a micro, it's not even

2922
01:43:50,190 --> 01:43:52,290
And my calf can't wear it all year long

2923
01:43:52,290 --> 01:43:54,370
This is for the first 36 hours only

2924
01:43:54,370 --> 01:43:54,870
I'm out

2925
01:43:54,870 --> 01:43:57,810
This is how we know they're not as corrupt as other saving productions allegedly

2926
01:43:57,810 --> 01:43:59,890
Is that when they didn't just go

2927
01:43:59,890 --> 01:44:02,010
How many do I need?

2928
01:44:02,170 --> 01:44:03,110
They just went a hundred

2929
01:44:03,570 --> 01:44:05,630
One hundred, right now

2930
01:44:06,170 --> 01:44:07,890
What's your credit card number?

2931
01:44:09,130 --> 01:44:10,310
You know that they're good people

2932
01:44:10,310 --> 01:44:12,890
Because they're like no, you actually only need it for the first day

2933
01:44:12,890 --> 01:44:14,690
Is there any sort of exchange

2934
01:44:14,690 --> 01:44:15,870
Program that they offer?

2935
01:44:16,210 --> 01:44:17,170
Can I

2936
01:44:17,730 --> 01:44:20,410
Hand me down, when the kids get too big

2937
01:44:20,970 --> 01:44:24,290
I can go back to the calving hood machine

2938
01:44:24,290 --> 01:44:25,650
And exchange it for another one

2939
01:44:25,650 --> 01:44:27,390
Can I become a legacy member

2940
01:44:27,390 --> 01:44:28,730
For the calving machine

2941
01:44:29,230 --> 01:44:31,410
I don't believe there's any sort of rental

2942
01:44:31,410 --> 01:44:32,830
At least that I can see

2943
01:44:32,830 --> 01:44:34,250
Just from this brief glance

2944
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:37,210
All I know, and I don't know what the context

2945
01:44:37,210 --> 01:44:39,070
Is, but there's just a graphic

2946
01:44:39,070 --> 01:44:40,230
Here that says

2947
01:44:41,150 --> 01:44:43,150
Lost profit with like an angry

2948
01:44:43,150 --> 01:44:43,630
Looking

2949
01:44:44,710 --> 01:44:46,730
That cow's coming to me in my dreams

2950
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:48,750
I think what the subtext is

2951
01:44:48,750 --> 01:44:50,970
That we're not saying is that if the calf

2952
01:44:50,970 --> 01:44:52,810
Gets frostbite, it's ears fall off

2953
01:44:53,550 --> 01:44:54,950
Oh, that's what we're

2954
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:56,190
Fighting against with these hoods?

2955
01:44:56,630 --> 01:44:58,910
It's smashing down their ears and keeping the ears

2956
01:44:58,910 --> 01:44:59,070
Wired

2957
01:44:59,910 --> 01:45:03,170
Because their ears might just get brutal and stamp off

2958
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:04,890
And the newborn, they're not

2959
01:45:04,890 --> 01:45:05,330
Functioning

2960
01:45:05,330 --> 01:45:07,150
For the first 36 hours, you're protecting the ears

2961
01:45:07,830 --> 01:45:10,110
It's also kind of like an S&M mask

2962
01:45:10,110 --> 01:45:11,430
For the calf

2963
01:45:12,010 --> 01:45:13,950
It looks a little zodiac

2964
01:45:13,950 --> 01:45:16,150
These are going on the website, right?

2965
01:45:16,150 --> 01:45:17,350
These are going on the Instagram

2966
01:45:18,590 --> 01:45:20,470
Let's make sure people are

2967
01:45:20,470 --> 01:45:22,030
What's the website again?

2968
01:45:22,170 --> 01:45:23,530
You can go and bruise it yourself

2969
01:45:23,530 --> 01:45:26,630
Of course, it's save-me-products.

2970
01:45:26,630 --> 01:45:28,370
com

2971
01:45:29,650 --> 01:45:32,090
Might want to just put that in your favorites

2972
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:33,470
So we keep track of it

2973
01:45:33,470 --> 01:45:36,310
Can we ask them, did the

2974
01:45:36,310 --> 01:45:38,190
Dalmatian have to wear boots because its feet

2975
01:45:38,190 --> 01:45:39,230
Fell off?

2976
01:45:39,430 --> 01:45:41,110
Do they sell Dalmatian boots?

2977
01:45:41,350 --> 01:45:43,210
Is that why the toy has boots on?

2978
01:45:43,210 --> 01:45:45,050
Because something happened to its feet in the cross-bite

2979
01:45:45,050 --> 01:45:47,090
Well, Paul had to very sensitive

2980
01:45:47,090 --> 01:45:49,350
So yeah, you probably want to keep those

2981
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:51,410
It's hot, you got to be careful where the dog

2982
01:45:51,410 --> 01:45:52,110
Walks.

2983
01:45:52,130 --> 01:45:53,170
This is in North Dakota

2984
01:45:53,170 --> 01:45:54,230
This is where they're based out of.

2985
01:45:54,230 --> 01:45:55,170
I knew it was in Dakota

2986
01:45:55,170 --> 01:45:56,210
You were right.

2987
01:45:56,590 --> 01:45:57,190
Email us, sorry

2988
01:45:57,190 --> 01:45:59,470
Our email form is not working below because our web

2989
01:45:59,470 --> 01:46:00,750
Host updated their security

2990
01:46:00,750 --> 01:46:03,570
It will send but not deliver email to us

2991
01:46:03,570 --> 01:46:05,230
In the meantime, what does it mean

2992
01:46:05,230 --> 01:46:06,410
To send not deliver?

2993
01:46:06,950 --> 01:46:09,370
It just goes into a chute and then it ends up

2994
01:46:09,370 --> 01:46:10,130
In a river?

2995
01:46:10,790 --> 01:46:12,590
Your email will be printed

2996
01:46:12,590 --> 01:46:14,330
We had the time to write all this out

2997
01:46:14,330 --> 01:46:16,330
But just put another email on there

2998
01:46:16,650 --> 01:46:18,170
Please do more research

2999
01:46:18,170 --> 01:46:20,190
Tell us that there's an episode

3000
01:46:20,190 --> 01:46:22,330
About Yellowstone where this is

3001
01:46:22,330 --> 01:46:24,110
The plot where they're trying to

3002
01:46:24,110 --> 01:46:26,230
There's a whole season about calf hoods

3003
01:46:26,230 --> 01:46:28,150
Mike would have known that if he'd watched the show

3004
01:46:28,150 --> 01:46:29,610
Calf hoods, yeah

3005
01:46:30,030 --> 01:46:32,350
They have links to some of their other favorite

3006
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:34,570
Products and websites

Wait, no.

Yeah, I swear to God

What's PuppyWindows?

3018
01:46:50,330 --> 01:46:51,710
Go back to PuppyWindows

3019
01:46:52,790 --> 01:46:55,610
Can I just say, while you're on the way to that

3020
01:46:55,610 --> 01:46:57,390
Mike, you and I were doing some logistics

3021
01:46:57,390 --> 01:46:59,290
Planning about this series the other day

3022
01:46:59,290 --> 01:47:01,390
And you said, well, you know, maybe we could fit that in

3023
01:47:01,390 --> 01:47:03,350
If we just put it on one of the lighter sectors

3024
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:05,610
We now, what we thought

3025
01:47:05,610 --> 01:47:07,710
I'm like, Fuel Rod Kiosks

3026
01:47:07,710 --> 01:47:09,950
That sounds like a funny five minutes

3027
01:47:09,950 --> 01:47:11,830
Now we're deep into calf hoods

3028
01:47:11,830 --> 01:47:13,790
There's no such thing as a light sector

3029
01:47:13,790 --> 01:47:14,770
It doesn't

3030
01:47:14,770 --> 01:47:17,210
It doesn't matter if we add another one

3031
01:47:17,210 --> 01:47:19,810
Any way we slice it, we're going long

3032
01:47:21,190 --> 01:47:23,250
Alright, now read about, what was it

3033
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:25,090
This is just like a puppy classified

3034
01:47:25,090 --> 01:47:27,090
This is like you look for puppies, I think

3035
01:47:27,590 --> 01:47:29,550
I thought it was a window for puppies to look through

3036
01:47:29,550 --> 01:47:31,870
Or windows for dog

3037
01:47:31,870 --> 01:47:32,810
Pet stores

3038
01:47:34,150 --> 01:47:35,110
There is

3039
01:47:35,110 --> 01:47:37,250
Oh yeah, because you're asking how much

3040
01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:39,330
Is that dog in the window all the time

3041
01:47:40,050 --> 01:47:41,250
I'm so stressed

3042
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:43,270
By the energy of everyone that indicates

3043
01:47:43,270 --> 01:47:44,790
That this could, you have

3044
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:46,870
Nobody's dying to wrap this up

3045
01:47:47,590 --> 01:47:49,070
Clearly, this website

3046
01:47:49,070 --> 01:47:50,950
Could be read in full

3047
01:47:52,590 --> 01:47:54,610
Which is fine, but we have fucking

3048
01:47:54,610 --> 01:47:56,010
How many of these we got to do

3049
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:57,230
There's one more thing I want to say

3050
01:47:57,230 --> 01:48:01,010
Other than, okay, there is some website called Praying Medic Books

3051
01:48:01,010 --> 01:48:03,110
Which are inspirational books on faith and healing

3052
01:48:03,110 --> 01:48:05,190
No, Praying Medic is a QAnon guy

3053
01:48:05,190 --> 01:48:06,390
Oh really?

3054
01:48:06,490 --> 01:48:08,190
He's a big QAnon guy

3055
01:48:08,190 --> 01:48:08,990
Really?

3056
01:48:09,590 --> 01:48:12,070
I think you should see in the Will Summer book

3057
01:48:12,070 --> 01:48:12,650
Maybe?

3058
01:48:12,950 --> 01:48:15,550
Oh, like emotional healing, big book things

3059
01:48:15,550 --> 01:48:18,290
He's a big Q guy

3060
01:48:18,930 --> 01:48:21,450
Oh wow, so calf hooves are Q?

3061
01:48:22,050 --> 01:48:22,630
Damn it

3062
01:48:22,630 --> 01:48:23,930
Calf hooves are Q

3063
01:48:23,930 --> 01:48:26,730
We should have known, it's going to be around any corner

3064
01:48:28,370 --> 01:48:29,990
We started with Epstein

3065
01:48:29,990 --> 01:48:30,910
We started with

3066
01:48:30,910 --> 01:48:32,750
Save the Children and the Moon

3067
01:48:32,750 --> 01:48:35,210
Scott, do you want to summon the Sector Stone?

3068
01:48:35,410 --> 01:48:36,770
It seems like you're

3069
01:48:36,770 --> 01:48:38,330
That's probably a good idea

3070
01:48:38,330 --> 01:48:40,270
Oh look, hey, there it is

3071
01:48:40,270 --> 01:48:42,170
The Sector Stone

3072
01:48:43,190 --> 01:48:45,250
Can anyone else see it better than me?

3073
01:48:45,290 --> 01:48:47,030
Oh yeah, it's a little calf hood

3074
01:48:48,710 --> 01:48:51,150
You'd think it would have been a fuel rod, but no

3075
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:52,710
It's a calf hood

3076
01:48:52,710 --> 01:48:55,650
It could fit right onto the littlest calf ever

3077
01:48:55,650 --> 01:48:57,210
Oh, wonderful

3078
01:48:57,210 --> 01:48:59,690
There's a website called Sand Hill Satellary

3079
01:48:59,690 --> 01:49:01,630
And I only want to bring this up because remember

3080
01:49:01,630 --> 01:49:03,690
Jason, early on in his Los Angeles career

3081
01:49:04,150 --> 01:49:06,810
Interviewed to work at a place that made horse saddles

3082
01:49:06,810 --> 01:49:07,370
He did?

3083
01:49:07,910 --> 01:49:09,250
Oh yeah, in Burbank

3084
01:49:09,250 --> 01:49:11,010
Jason thought he was going to make saddles?

3085
01:49:11,450 --> 01:49:13,030
The recession was really hard

3086
01:49:13,030 --> 01:49:15,110
I was applying to every job

3087
01:49:15,110 --> 01:49:17,470
It's recession this, it's 9-11 that

3088
01:49:17,470 --> 01:49:20,330
Yeah, it was mostly shampooing saddles

3089
01:49:20,330 --> 01:49:21,910
in the Rancho area of Burbank

3090
01:49:21,910 --> 01:49:23,590
Jason was going to get a job shampooing horse saddles

3091
01:49:23,590 --> 01:49:25,230
I don't say this about

3092
01:49:25,230 --> 01:49:27,470
This is going to sound like an insult to you

3093
01:49:27,470 --> 01:49:29,370
But I would say about this about myself

3094
01:49:29,370 --> 01:49:30,970
I'll say about Eva, I don't know

3095
01:49:30,970 --> 01:49:32,330
Eva's been multi-talented

3096
01:49:32,330 --> 01:49:36,010
None of us are going to be good at shampooing saddles

3097
01:49:36,010 --> 01:49:37,170
That's why you didn't get the job

3098
01:49:37,170 --> 01:49:38,690
They knew he wasn't qualified

3099
01:49:38,690 --> 01:49:40,150
No, no, no

3100
01:49:40,150 --> 01:49:42,890
I said I was looking for

3101
01:49:42,890 --> 01:49:44,350
an exciting

3102
01:49:45,190 --> 01:49:45,790
fulfilling

3103
01:49:45,790 --> 01:49:47,690
a new job

3104
01:49:48,490 --> 01:49:51,650
This job is neither exciting nor fulfilling

3105
01:49:53,370 --> 01:49:55,850
Like I literally just plucked it

3106
01:49:55,850 --> 01:49:57,330
From cover letters

3107
01:49:57,690 --> 01:49:58,470
Stop writing

3108
01:49:58,470 --> 01:49:59,650
They can't pretend

3109
01:49:59,650 --> 01:50:03,690
That's what they said to me when I applied to write for Ellen

3110
01:50:09,950 --> 01:50:11,830
You'd be better off

3111
01:50:11,830 --> 01:50:13,970
better off applying at the shampoo

3112
01:50:13,970 --> 01:50:16,030
I applied to be

3113
01:50:16,030 --> 01:50:17,810
a front desk person at a

3114
01:50:17,810 --> 01:50:19,770
dental office or a doctor's office

3115
01:50:20,770 --> 01:50:22,690
The border of Sherman Oaks

3116
01:50:22,690 --> 01:50:23,370
had seen it

3117
01:50:23,370 --> 01:50:25,770
I showed up and there were 30 people there

3118
01:50:25,770 --> 01:50:27,570
and they were like, thank you for coming

3119
01:50:27,570 --> 01:50:29,310
Thank you for submitting your resumes

3120
01:50:29,310 --> 01:50:31,370
You'll hear back from us soon

3121
01:50:31,370 --> 01:50:33,450
And I'm like, did 30 people apply

3122
01:50:33,450 --> 01:50:35,890
for this job and we just had to show up?

3123
01:50:36,290 --> 01:50:37,510
They were just seeing who

3124
01:50:37,510 --> 01:50:38,230
would show up

3125
01:50:38,230 --> 01:50:40,930
It was something like that

3126
01:50:42,270 --> 01:50:43,470
Why'd you say the address?

3127
01:50:43,550 --> 01:50:45,290
That's not far from where you live

3128
01:50:45,290 --> 01:50:47,190
You're like, it's all the way

3129
01:50:47,190 --> 01:50:48,650
in the 15 minutes

3130
01:50:48,650 --> 01:50:50,270
It's like Encino or something

3131
01:50:50,270 --> 01:50:52,170
I don't live anywhere near that

3132
01:50:53,570 --> 01:50:55,570
This is 2008, right?

3133
01:50:55,670 --> 01:50:57,870
Yeah, it's like 2008, 2009

3134
01:50:57,870 --> 01:51:00,190
Do you want me to see about Sandhills

3135
01:51:00,870 --> 01:51:01,390
salary?

3136
01:51:02,050 --> 01:51:03,510
If they can fire you?

3137
01:51:03,770 --> 01:51:05,030
All the way up to the Dakotas

3138
01:51:06,350 --> 01:51:07,970
What I want to do

3139
01:51:07,970 --> 01:51:10,270
is say Eva Anderson, you survived

3140
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:12,170
Firegazer, I had a

3141
01:51:12,170 --> 01:51:14,570
tell you what, Saga, the Multiverse of Madness

3142
01:51:14,570 --> 01:51:16,390
Oh god, do you have any energy

3143
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:17,850
in which you'd want to plug anything?

3144
01:51:17,850 --> 01:51:20,390
Do you need a fuel rod to give you the energy?

3145
01:51:20,730 --> 01:51:21,870
Just read this website if you could for me

3146
01:51:21,870 --> 01:51:22,710
while in your plug

3147
01:51:22,710 --> 01:51:25,050
Oh, Eva's been handing out plugs

3148
01:51:25,050 --> 01:51:27,970
I want to plug a Sandhills

3149
01:51:27,970 --> 01:51:28,430
What is this?

3150
01:51:28,610 --> 01:51:30,070
Sandhills Sadlery

3151
01:51:30,070 --> 01:51:32,270

You are the plan

3160
01:51:48,990 --> 01:51:51,750
Hugh is the plan, you are the plan

3161
01:51:51,750 --> 01:51:52,770
Thank you for that

3162
01:51:52,770 --> 01:51:56,290
You're all digital soldiers, Trump is ascended

3163
01:51:56,290 --> 01:51:57,310
Trump is president

3164
01:51:57,310 --> 01:51:59,330
And of course, where we go when we go home

3165
01:51:59,330 --> 01:52:01,930
And Copperfield will make the moon disappear

3166
01:52:01,930 --> 01:52:04,010
Yes, and Trump and only Trump

3167
01:52:04,010 --> 01:52:05,910
He was sent from heaven to bring it back

3168
01:52:05,910 --> 01:52:07,850
When Trump says we will all put on our

3169
01:52:07,850 --> 01:52:09,770
calf hoods

3170
01:52:09,770 --> 01:52:10,970
and we will all ascend

3171
01:52:10,970 --> 01:52:13,910
But they're gonna have the reflectors, and nobody will bump it

3172
01:52:13,910 --> 01:52:14,630
It's gonna be perfect

3173
01:52:14,630 --> 01:52:17,870
Put the calf hoods on, stand down and stand by

3174
01:52:17,870 --> 01:52:21,610
Dry yourself off before you put your hood on

3175
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:23,790
The hood will not dry you off

3176
01:52:23,790 --> 01:52:26,690
Folks, you gotta dry before a hood goes on

3177
01:52:27,290 --> 01:52:29,530
We love hoods, but can't be wet

3178
01:52:29,530 --> 01:52:31,010
The hoods don't dry them

3179
01:52:31,010 --> 01:52:32,650
