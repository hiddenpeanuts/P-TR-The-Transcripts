1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,680
Warning, the following podcast contains mockumentary style humor, fake endings, sexy humitep, and

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,360
we finally answered the question, what is Michael's favorite Britney Spears song?

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,800
All this and Matt Rogers joins us to talk revenge of the mummy.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,200
Hey, your souls are mine.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,520
This is Podcast the Rye.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,200
Welcome to Podcast the Rye, a theme park podcast hosted by three men who all have a secret fantasy

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,640
of being eaten alive by a horde of scarab beetles.

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,480
My name is Mike Carlson.

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,800
Joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,480
Yeah, I would agree with that.

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,880
I would agree with that.

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,880
Scott Garner, do you also agree with that?

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,400
Of course, that's how you want to go.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,120
I mean, it's at least quick if horrifying and but maybe a little weirdly pleasurable.

17
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:18,640
Yeah, I guess they make it look quick in all the movies and TV, but I do have a suspicion

18
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,800
maybe it's kind of slow.

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,360
It's kind of a slow death.

20
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,160
They don't all move at that hyper speed.

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,440
Yeah, on the Universal Tram Tour, when Whoopi gets eaten alive by scarab beetles, I think

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,960
I feel like it's very quick, but that's just I think for time.

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,680
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,560
I was going to have the fantasy, but I think maybe it's just based on fiction, you know.

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,720
I'm glad there's just scarab talk happening in general.

26
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,920
Love scarabs.

27
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,440
Is anyone confident that scarabs exist in real life and that you could exist?

28
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,440
Right?

29
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,440
Or maybe they don't.

30
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
I don't know.

31
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,600
Do I ever actually do any research pertaining to the real world when we do this podcast?

32
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
I don't.

33
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,200
So that's not what we're doing here.

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,640
No way to know.

35
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,520
It did not occur to me to research scarabs.

36
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,920
I was mostly looking at track lengths and budgets to try and get to the bottom of a

37
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,520
long time mystery.

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,200
Yeah, it's insane.

39
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,600
The heck happened here?

40
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,880
Yeah, I was just I was just looking up linear induction motors.

41
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,200
I yeah, I gave up on trying to understand that.

42
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,640
Well, look, I think our guest probably wants to talk about linear induction motors as well.

43
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,320
You know him from Los Culturises and his upcoming HBO Max show Hot Dog.

44
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,800
It's Matt Rogers returning.

45
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,440
Hey, what's up, everybody?

46
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,120
I just want to say before we start, I'd like to die peacefully in my sleep.

47
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,680
But the scarab beetles thing is definitely a theatrical way to go.

48
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,040
However, I don't think it's painless the way that they scream when it's happening.

49
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
I don't know.

50
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
I don't know, you guys.

51
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Yeah, but it might be quick.

52
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,360
What if it's like, ah, you're gone?

53
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,800
Yeah, but here's the thing.

54
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,360
It's like if I if I'm going to have a quick death, it should be quick and painless.

55
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,760
You know what I mean?

56
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,200
Like it happens instantaneously.

57
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,160
Otherwise, what does it matter how quick it happens?

58
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,800
Like you're literally getting eaten alive by beetles.

59
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Like think about what it feels like to be stung even one time.

60
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,640
Imagine that all over your body.

61
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,320
And also it's kind of starts at your feet and then goes in.

62
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,520
The last thing that happens is your eye gets closed up.

63
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,600
But you know what's happening just like physically and like emotionally.

64
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,240
That has to be true terror.

65
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,280
It does.

66
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,160
I don't disagree with what you're saying, but I think part of me also would be kind

67
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,280
of thrilled that I'm going out like Whoopi did on the tour.

68
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,680
So I think maybe just sort of the tribute to Whoopi on the tram tour, I would be like,

69
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,680
oh, this hurts so much, but oh, this is pretty cool.

70
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,040
You'd be amongst legends in the way that you die.

71
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
Exactly.

72
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,360
Yeah. So I think maybe that could override the true physical pain.

73
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,640
I don't know. We'll have to find out.

74
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,120
And we got to go out.

75
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,040
It's scared beetles.

76
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,080
Her. I imagine Alan Menken will go that way.

77
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,480
Oh, yeah, probably. Yeah.

78
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,400
So we're going to talk, you know, mummy today, revenge of the mummy.

79
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,280
But, Matt, I don't know if you're aware of this last time.

80
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,240
You've been a while since you were on the show.

81
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,200
Yeah, but there's been a lot of character development on the show since you were here,

82
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,680
which we love to see.

83
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,200
We love it. We love it.

84
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,600
Gross narrative people love to follow.

85
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,200
Yeah. Growth. Human growth.

86
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,440
You deem Scott Gardner a no launch queen.

87
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,480
Yeah, I heard that it kind of became merch.

88
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Yes. It emerged and well, I don't know.

89
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,400
Well, I'll tell you that launch queen sold a lot better than no launch queen.

90
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,040
Nobody wanted to proudly.

91
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,400
It's like, no, who's going to come out as a Scott?

92
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,040
You know what I mean? Like, who's going to come out as like a weakling?

93
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,680
Can I ask you a question?

94
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,920
Have you not done the mummy because of the launches?

95
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,280
Well, that's what we're going to do.

96
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,400
That was the case, you see, when we recorded before.

97
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,160
But just like look at that. You're right.

98
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,040
Nobody wanted to identify as a Scott, least of all Scott.

99
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,560
I didn't like that that label.

100
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,760
And I think I became determined to overcome the label.

101
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,240
So not too long after that,

102
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,840
with the help of a bunch of Chardonnay, I braved the credit coaster.

103
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,600
I got over the launch issue.

104
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,600
Did I end up doing it twice?

105
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,040
I feel like I went. I'm not sure.

106
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,200
Well, the point is, it quickly became one of my favorite rides in the park.

107
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,920
It's one of the ones I'm dreaming of now.

108
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,440
I've watched right throughs of that a ton.

109
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,560
I quickly went from just to completely loving it.

110
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,640
And then we all went to Orlando together in October.

111
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,000
And I'm launching all over the place.

112
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,720
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

113
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,720
Nice. Only sort of crazily humid.

114
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,920
Yeah, a little bit.

115
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,880
I know. But I'm I'm rocking roller coaster.

116
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,400
I'm Hagrid's.

117
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,600
Hell, I'm well, besides Orlando, there's that, you know, that horse one.

118
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,160
We did it not a bunch of times in a row.

119
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,440
Pony Express, Pony Express.

120
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,680
There you go. Did you get on the Hulk?

121
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,920
Didn't do Hulk.

122
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,920
That is that is the one of the of the launch lineup at that park.

123
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,360
That's what you will be on now that you've started.

124
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,600
You will. I think so. I think so.

125
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,800
And you and of course, all of that building up to Revenge of the Mummy,

126
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,400
which after all that, that launch, not too bad at all.

127
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,200
That's a lot lesser than some of the other launches that I listed.

128
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,840
OK, so I'm actually going to say this.

129
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,920
And, you know, the fans of the podcast might disagree with me,

130
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,040
but I actually think that the launch in Revenge of the Mummy

131
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,720
is a more intense launch than the one with Hulk, because I think that

132
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,880
the way that you pop out of your seat at the top of like the airtime

133
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,160
that you get at the top of the first launch of the Mummy is one of the more

134
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,560
thrilling moments to be found in the entire city of Orlando, to be honest with you.

135
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,040
Like, I think it's one of the most intense things that can happen to you

136
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,480
on a on a ride in the city of Orlando.

137
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,760
I wouldn't disagree.

138
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,360
I think it's heightened, too, by how cold and dark and like windy it is in there.

139
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,000
You don't know what's going to happen.

140
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,360
The thing is, you've seen the Hulk do what it does a million times.

141
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,960
And so, you know, what's in store for you, which is that sort of, I guess,

142
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,800
inversion coming out of the tunnel, whereas you have no idea where it's going

143
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,800
when you shoot through that mouth of Imhotep.

144
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,840
Yeah, true. No, yeah, no idea.

145
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,200
The layout I knew very little about any of it.

146
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,600
I that's that's the really the benefit of some of this launch queen

147
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,360
journey that I've been on is now I get to like have these new rides to me,

148
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,240
which I haven't had completely new rides since I was, you know, so exciting.

149
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,400
I so wish for that.

150
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,640
I feel like it's actually better to not know anything about the mummy

151
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,600
before you do it. Like whenever I bring people to the my favorite thing to do now

152
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,880
is to bring people to that park that I've never been there.

153
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,400
Like I took my friend Suti there and we just put her on the mummy

154
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,320
and just didn't tell her anything about it.

155
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,000
And it's really fun to watch someone experience what it is,

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,480
because I actually it is my favorite ride.

157
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,040
Oh, yeah, I don't think it's it's it's strong.

158
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,240
I mean, getting to do it, really not really knowing.

159
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,160
I knew some of that meta stuff and everything.

160
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,040
I mean, that was a blast.

161
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,080
And was I not conditioned a little bit?

162
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,840
I know I wouldn't have had definitely one of the peak new ride experiences

163
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,520
of that trip. Yeah. Yeah.

164
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,000
I was going to say the Hulk also, I think, is so intense

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,080
that it almost gives your brain only one experience the whole time.

166
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,600
Like you kind of just gray out immediately and you're just doing it.

167
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,200
The mummy, you're going through the levels, you're experiencing different emotions.

168
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,000
Hulk is just one emotion the whole time.

169
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,720
The thing about the mummy is it truly is the reason why I think it's

170
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,840
the most successful ride in the park.

171
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,640
And it's actually one of my favorite parks is because it genuinely

172
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,520
combines a thrill ride for real with a narrative experience.

173
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,160
And I think that that's not something you can say for Hulk.

174
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,440
Like you're just not you're not removed from the experience

175
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,520
of being on a roller coaster the entire time. Like

176
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:02,120
and I do feel that the back half of Hulk is pretty weak in terms of design goes.

177
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,280
That's why I'm so excited for the Jurassic coaster, which looks like

178
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,560
which looks like it's going to be incredible in the first half

179
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,600
and then even better in the second half.

180
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,440
I think the way that that is shaping up to be designed is really cool.

181
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,760
And the insider intel that I have,

182
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,120
apparently, when it's all done and themed and like put together,

183
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,640
it's going to be pretty amazing.

184
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,040
Wait, you have you do have info because you predicted on our show.

185
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,560
You always have the role of intelligence.

186
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,800
I said this was going to happen on your show.

187
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,600
I said this was going to happen on your show.

188
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Yes. Oh, this ride to the Jurassic one. Did you predict? I did.

189
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,120
I said, wow, I didn't remember that. Oh, my God. You're way ahead.

190
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,600
And now you know, has it been that long ago where I said it was rumored?

191
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,200
Or did I break the Hagrid stuff to you guys?

192
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,400
The born you said born for sure.

193
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,920
Yes, I did. I remember. Yep. Yep.

194
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,840
I'm trying to remember what the specifics about Jurassic were.

195
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,840
So maybe I didn't because it was like a very gray rumor.

196
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,640
Like it wasn't it wasn't like a thing that was definitely going to happen.

197
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,400
But for years, there's been this Jurassic coaster rumored.

198
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,880
And then like probably about a year ago, there started there started to be

199
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,920
markings discovered on the ground and clear small clearings happening

200
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,960
where they were like, something's definitely going on.

201
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,480
And now we see like they're putting what is definitely,

202
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,920
I think, going to be one of the signature rides of the resort.

203
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,880
I mean, it looks unbelievable.

204
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,000
On social media, Raptors are being constantly lowered onto this track.

205
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,840
I mean, I'm sure we're all following these Twitter accounts. Yes.

206
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,960
And large birds of prey have made their home there.

207
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,080
Yeah. The ospreys are like living on top of the top hat. Yeah.

208
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,280
It's it might become a problem.

209
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,800
It will be going forward unless like like once the train once the trains start

210
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,120
going like they'll know not to be there.

211
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,920
But for right now, it's like it's so funny because you'll see updates

212
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,680
that they've made a home on top of the top hat.

213
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,000
And then the next day, they're like, the osprey nest has been removed.

214
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,960
And then it's like the ospreys are back.

215
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,600
The osprey nest has been removed.

216
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,840
The ospreys like, oh, I was going to say the ospreys like me

217
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,360
are concerned about the eye lines when you enter Islands of Adventure,

218
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,480
that the beautiful view of the Jurassic Park visitor center

219
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,440
is now obscured by black track all around it.

220
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,080
See, what do you guys think about that?

221
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,920
I think it kind of hasn't.

222
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,960
I mean, I'm not wild about it.

223
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,880
I think the coaster will be good.

224
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,760
But on the other hand, they haven't really done the boats

225
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,920
that crisscross that lagoon in like, oh, God, 15 years.

226
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,480
Yeah, years. Yeah.

227
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,680
It's also like it's like the visitor center is cool.

228
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,680
And it's cool that it's like framed like that.

229
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,480
But it isn't quite like they just put up a roller coaster

230
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,040
in front of Sleeping Beauty's castle.

231
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,280
Because it's kind of far so far away.

232
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,800
It's not the central icon of the park, and therefore it doesn't ruin

233
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,880
anything aesthetically for me.

234
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,000
For me, it's just like flat out there was nothing in that area.

235
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,560
And now they've put a huge ticket in that area,

236
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,880
which is a great thing for any fans of the parks, especially if you're

237
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,240
like proper roller coaster enthusiasts like I am.

238
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,440
Like for me, it was like devastating when they took down Dillion Dragons.

239
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,600
And I love Hagrid's, but it was missing that big roller coaster to say

240
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,080
I am the same intensity level as Hulk.

241
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,280
And I'm thrilled.

242
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,720
Yeah, yeah, I think it'll be I think it'll be fine.

243
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,000
I might not even have like maybe quite noticed it.

244
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,120
Oh, like, oh, you can't see it.

245
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,600
I wasn't going to be that that big of a loss for me.

246
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,320
Matt, do you know anything about I don't feel free to share.

247
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,880
Feel free to say no.

248
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,600
Do you know what blues roll blues roll in the coaster is?

249
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,880
The famous Raptor Blue.

250
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,000
So I don't know about Rue Rue.

251
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,480
I don't know about Blues specific role in the ride.

252
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,040
I do know some facts about what was going to happen

253
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,760
in the ride before all this covid stuff happened, which I think now

254
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,320
there's a little bit up in the air stuff.

255
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,480
But the ride was supposed to have six Raptor animatronics throughout.

256
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,440
I think what was the idea was there would be two.

257
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,120
And this is going to be, you know, if you're if you are the kind of person

258
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,360
who wants to be a purist and experience these things first, just know that,

259
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,000
A, this is definitely not for sure.

260
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,600
And B, this is going to spoil some stuff. But.

261
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,920
In the first room, the first show scene that you go into,

262
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,200
there was supposed to be two Raptors in there.

263
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,680
And then you launch sort of like the way Chris Pratt

264
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,520
launches with the motorcycle, with the with the Raptors in the movie

265
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,920
Jurassic World into the ride.

266
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,480
Then there's two which we've now seen placed in the actual ride layout itself.

267
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,160
And they are literally there.

268
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,760
It's sort of unclear whether those are audio animatronic or just figures.

269
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,440
I hope they're audio animatronic, but I don't know.

270
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,480
They've definitely been, as we've seen in the ride, we're going to discuss today.

271
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,520
Like they've been known to just put figures of mummies in there that don't move.

272
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,920
And, you know, I don't think they would do that now, but we'll see with budgets.

273
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,680
And then there's supposed to be one or two more

274
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,320
that happen at the end of the ride as like a final scare.

275
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,280
And so so it's again, it's two in the first show scene with the launch,

276
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,080
two during the course of the ride, one at the end.

277
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,440
And apparently there's one in the queue, like one really, really, really

278
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,840
advanced audio animatronic that's in the queue.

279
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,400
That sounds like Blue, doesn't it?

280
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,840
Potentially. But again, I don't know specifically what Blue's role is

281
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,000
or if there is a role for Blue because Blue is at the Raptor encounter.

282
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,480
Like, that's like the big thing with the Raptor encounter is you go meet Blue or whatever.

283
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,960
So I don't know how canonical they're being about this.

284
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,360
Probably not very.

285
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,280
But I don't know about any celebrity cameos.

286
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,680
I don't know about anything like that.

287
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,600
I know.

288
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,480
Clear Dearing's role.

289
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,760
Brice Dallas, it's Clear Dearing.

290
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,200
She definitely went back.

291
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,040
Brice Dallas definitely went back and did stuff for the Jurassic

292
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,360
World ride in Hollywood. And so did Chris Pratt.

293
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,720
I don't know what their role is in this.

294
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,960
I would imagine it's something.

295
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,440
Also, maybe we can get some BD Wong action up in here.

296
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,520
Oh, yeah. He is InGen.

297
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,320
And so this is an InGen themed ride.

298
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,920
I don't know that it's definitely called the Velocicoaster, but it looks like it is.

299
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,480
What's the premise? Are you is it simulating the movement of a Raptor?

300
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,360
What? Like, what are we in the ride?

301
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,440
I don't know if we're a Raptor or we're the motorcycle

302
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,520
that is like the thing that Chris Pratt is riding.

303
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,120
However, I will say it would be a little redundant for them to do a motorcycle thing.

304
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,240
Now they've put the Hargard ride up.

305
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,960
But but I don't know how down they are to do the thing of like

306
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,320
you're a Raptor the way that you were a dragon on Dueling Dragons.

307
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,000
I just don't know if that fits in with the narrative of the park

308
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,160
or that area of the park.

309
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,920
Like we are very much humans experiencing Jurassic World or Jurassic Park

310
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,600
as it stands now.

311
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,120
But I don't know how much they're going to bend

312
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,760
sort of narrative disbelief there.

313
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,520
But I know that we're getting a bunch of animatronics.

314
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,160
I don't know if all six made it with all the stuff that's going on with Covid.

315
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,280
You've seen them, you know, sort of drop the progress on Epic Universe

316
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:17,120
and everything, but they sure are full steam ahead with the Jurassic Coaster.

317
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,640
So it looks like every dollar they were going to spend on it has been spent so far.

318
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,560
I mean, who thought we would have gotten like an enclosure?

319
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,960
You know, like it's so cool what's happening there.

320
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,080
They're really going all out.

321
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,800
And I think it looks like it's going to be the best ride in the park. Wow.

322
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,000
Easy. We get the scoops with you that you're willing to impart

323
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,000
whatever this internal.

324
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,600
This is like a passion of mine.

325
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,080
Like I I'll follow.

326
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,320
I'm sure everyone that, you know, listens to this is following at bio

327
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,440
reconstruct on Twitter like they are every day.

328
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,840
He's so diligent

329
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,520
about like posting new stuff.

330
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,600
And then I follow like on YouTube, like Midway Mayhem.

331
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,320
And I follow like all these like YouTube's like you could really fall down a wormhole

332
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,600
because some of these people are going to the park every day

333
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,040
and just recording like the progress, which I appreciate.

334
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,280
But, you know, just a way for me to live my inner child

335
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,720
without actually going to the parks. Sure.

336
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:12,120
Well, yeah, because I met, you know, we could all be going to Universal Orlando.

337
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:17,960
Technically, how high is anyone's desire to actually do this among us?

338
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,080
Well, not that high.

339
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,280
I think at this point,

340
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:29,280
I think my fear is less about being in the park.

341
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,680
Maybe if it's really crowded, that would probably stress me out.

342
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,000
But I just don't think I'm ready to sit on a five hour airplane yet.

343
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,840
A five hour flight.

344
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,800
As I've flown cross country a couple of times, it's really safe.

345
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,200
And I they make you feel really good about it.

346
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,240
You know what I would do is I would just spring for like a clear membership

347
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,120
or whatever, just to like make sure you don't have to wait on long lines,

348
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,800
like just pay the extra money if you really want to go somewhere. But.

349
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,440
But the flying of it all wasn't what bothered me.

350
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,400
What bothers me is the Florida of it all.

351
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,080
Well, that's another aspect.

352
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,640
You're right. Very important.

353
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,920
Like you're not dealing with it with the finest.

354
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,600
Sorry.

355
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,920
No, no, no. You haven't gone to Florida, though.

356
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,600
No. OK.

357
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,640
No, you're not thinking of an Orlando trip anytime soon.

358
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,880
No, I'll. Here's what I'll say.

359
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,200
If when when this coaster opens, if Covid is still happening, I will go.

360
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,480
But but I'll be really safe about it.

361
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,160
But I'm like not going to be able to wait on this one.

362
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,320
Like, I really want to ride this.

363
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,080
I've got the same way with Hagrid's, like the second it opened,

364
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,880
I went down there and I did it and I was really happy that I.

365
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,760
Oh, yeah, you did it.

366
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,640
We did it and did a whole episode about it.

367
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,600
Oh, my God. What a what a blast.

368
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,840
It's amazing. It's so good. They did such a great job.

369
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,040
Of course, like, you know, with their with Universal's animatronics,

370
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,440
they're always lacking.

371
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,240
And whenever you go to Disney and then go to Universal, it's always like,

372
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,160
I mean, there's a market difference in like the quality of their animatronics.

373
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,360
But they did what they did.

374
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,600
And I'm really happy they use practical sets and effects.

375
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,160
And it was a real thrill ride and they were super ambitious with it.

376
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,440
And I think it was fucking great. Yeah. Yeah.

377
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,160
But the thing I might have sat out if you had not called me out as a no launch

378
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,720
I might have missed what I called the best ride in Orlando.

379
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,000
Had I not made some done some internal work.

380
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,840
It might take that spot for me for the mummy. Yeah.

381
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,200
Oh, it was really was mummy.

382
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,440
And now maybe Hagrid's for me. Yes.

383
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,480
Because because Hagrid delivers on the same thing I was talking about

384
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,640
with the mummy, which is it's a real thrill ride that has narrative elements,

385
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,080
which is what I think these things should be.

386
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,320
And it takes up a lot of space and it makes sense.

387
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,480
You know, you sort of like need launches to make this possible

388
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,560
because you have to like it's pretty hard to start a ride

389
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,920
and then it just goes and goes and goes.

390
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:53,120
Like you need slowdowns and stops and pacing to really tell a story

391
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,120
and give you a full narrative experience.

392
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,520
Agreed. Yeah.

393
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,080
But before we go to mummy, I will just ask Matt, do you have any?

394
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,800
I mean, everything's canceled potentially.

395
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,160
Yeah. You have any epic universe scoop?

396
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,560
I do. I do.

397
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,480
Probably not much more than you guys know, but I know that the lands,

398
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,800
the plan lands were obviously in the Super Nintendo world.

399
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,800
And then there was a classic monsters area, which I was really excited about.

400
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,000
I've been waiting for them to do this for so long.

401
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,680
I've been waiting for them to commit to how good they are at at at horror

402
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,240
and bring that Halloween Horror Nights energy all year round with a land.

403
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,040
And I think that what they had planned was really cool.

404
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,440
It was do you know about this?

405
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,080
The Kuka arm thing.

406
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,920
Yes, it was similar to the Forbidden Journey style,

407
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,280
but it was actually going to be on an actual roller coaster track.

408
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,760
Yeah, I saw that it was going to be with all the classic monsters.

409
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,040
And then their idea for an expansion was they were going to do

410
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,160
the creature of the Black Lagoon, which is like a Jaws type thing.

411
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,560
Whoa. So that was going to that was going to come in the years to come,

412
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,440
which we probably won't see until like, you know, 2030 now. Yeah. Yeah.

413
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,200
I mean, the Universal Monster stuff feels like money in the bank.

414
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,560
Like, it feels like it's it's it's such a and there's going to be a huge

415
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,560
amphitheater there, like whether we're going to do some type of show.

416
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,200
But it's so obvious to me that that's what they're missing

417
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,440
because they're so good at it and it's such a part of the Universal's history

418
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,640
and brand. So that there was obviously

419
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,040
another Harry Potter expansion.

420
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,000
It was going to be more focused on

421
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,520
a fantastic beast, which for me sucks, but that's what they were doing.

422
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,520
And then there was a how to train your dragon land,

423
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,080
which was going to be more of the kids stuff because,

424
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,120
you know, Nintendo is going to be obviously it's for kids,

425
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,320
but it's more for everyone.

426
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,200
And there actually are some legit rides there.

427
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,680
There's going to be not only the Mario Kart ride,

428
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,400
but also the Donkey Kong roller coaster. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

429
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,520
And then there was a huge dueling launch coaster

430
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,840
that was themed to space, which was like just in the hub of the park.

431
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,120
It wasn't themed to any particular land. Yeah.

432
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,560
Oh, yeah. You have to look at the concept art because it's all.

433
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,480
Oh, it's all there.

434
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,400
The curvy building, like off to the one side. Yeah.

435
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,160
It's it's somehow themed to space.

436
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,720
And there's a restaurant that's themed to space.

437
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,880
But basically the central hub of the epic universe was basically

438
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,000
going to be themed to elements.

439
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,640
So you're getting water, fire, earth and then air.

440
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,360
And they were I think they were connecting space with that somehow.

441
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,160
But there's like a fire barbecue restaurant

442
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,280
that we're going to do between classic monsters and Super Nintendo World.

443
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,280
There was like a very cool, like waterfront,

444
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,880
more fine dining restaurant that was like water themed.

445
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,440
And there was going to be smaller attractions throughout that central hub,

446
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,520
because the way that they're going to end up doing it again,

447
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,400
this was all pre-COVID, this was all announced.

448
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,480
But it's basically going to be you enter each land with the wristband that you have.

449
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,280
It's like you can just walk to the park and do whatever somehow.

450
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,800
I don't know how they were going to do this.

451
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,800
But it wasn't like you walk into islands of adventure and you're in the park now.

452
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,400
It's like you have to enter each land.

453
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,400
And then, of course, there was that huge hotel that they were building,

454
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,800
which is like their major resort. Right.

455
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,920
But they were really trying something different with it.

456
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,840
I think there's going to be almost entirely virtual queues

457
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,400
because that's the way that they want to go after the success with it

458
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
that they feel they've had.

459
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,880
But, yeah, I was really excited. Yeah.

460
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,480
Yeah. I mean, the telecom, them being owned by a telecom

461
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,360
is maybe the only saving grace that it won't take another 20 years for them to do it.

462
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,600
You know, they have the money.

463
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,960
I think it's just that they want to just hold a second to wait

464
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,280
to see just exactly what's happening.

465
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,400
I think that, you know, come November, we're going to be seeing

466
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,680
like what the next four years are going to look like.

467
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,240
And I think that that's that's actually huge.

468
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,720
So are you saying that Epic Universe is that the Biden's election

469
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,720
causes Epic Universe and Trump's election?

470
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,560
But that's actually exactly what I'm saying.

471
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,360
And this is Intel that I have is that if you vote for Biden, Epic Universe

472
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,360
will happen and if you vote for Trump, it won't.

473
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,440
So if that's keeping you undecided on the count,

474
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,520
if that's going to get you undecided off the couch, then I'm happy to say it here.

475
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,880
Every that's me. I was leaning Trump.

476
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,680
And but now we're all in very accurate, especially all the Florida voters.

477
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,280
I just insulted apologies.

478
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,960
But if the Epic Universe comes, I think they're willing to vote for Biden.

479
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,040
I hope so. I hope that.

480
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,840
But, you know, they're they're like almost done with the one in Hollywood.

481
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,840
Like they they've constructed the entire

482
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,440
Mario Kart ride building, and they're pretty much like hard at work

483
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,840
at the rest of the framing of the steel framing of the rest of the land.

484
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,880
But I think that, you know, just around the corner here at Universal Studios,

485
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,320
Hollywood, we have a pretty decently finished Mario Kart ride.

486
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,520
So I think we will at least get to do that within the next two years.

487
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,880
I have also heard that with the park being closed, they are finally

488
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,280
getting around to fixing the last scenes of the Jurassic World ride.

489
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,000
Like, you know, that's putting in 100 percent done.

490
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,320
Yeah. All the full like the full kit and caboodle that they kind of like rush through.

491
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,160
What were your thoughts on the Jurassic World revamp when you did it?

492
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,680
We we basically I'll speak for myself.

493
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,800
There's some cool stuff, but there's it's like miss.

494
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,280
It's like missing. It feels missing pieces.

495
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,520
There's long stretches where nothing kind of happens.

496
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,720
I like the tank thing fine.

497
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,800
But is it better than the glory and majesty of Jurassic Park from the old ride?

498
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,080
I don't think it is.

499
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,520
I I'm surprised how much I liked it.

500
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,360
And some of it replaces you're right, that goes away,

501
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,720
but it replaces just some perfunctory here's where we turn around.

502
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,400
So I think that part is a plus up.

503
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,600
But then after that, yeah, it feels like there are less dinosaurs,

504
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,200
which is in no scenario a good thing.

505
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,960
And there and like supposedly from hopefully the redo fixes it,

506
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:06,200
because I do kind of like this weird like habitat they have going now at the top of the lift hill.

507
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,680
But it's like the B mode supposedly, where it's just like what is the

508
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,480
what's that crazy dinosaurs name? I don't remember the indominus.

509
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,440
Dominus Rex. Is that right?

510
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,120
I think it is.

511
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,840
The big bad villain dinosaur in the eye.

512
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,880
Indominus Rex. OK, yeah.

513
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,920
I loved I loved the new scene.

514
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,640
I will say like the they really modernized it to Jurassic World.

515
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,200
I felt like when you come over and there's like the park map

516
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,560
and you go around and then, of course, it is screens,

517
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,760
which sucks. And I feel like we need to lay off the screens, which we've we've said.

518
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,960
But for me, it's like at least there was.

519
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,160
Like I liked that we specifically visited a scene from the movie,

520
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,960
which is with that huge underwater dinosaur and the water effect I thought was cool.

521
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,960
And anything that gets that fucking brontosaurus or whatever

522
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,800
that had been there out of here, that because the thing barely works and moves.

523
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,120
I thought it was so lame.

524
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,480
Slowly falling over.

525
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,000
The skin was so, so bad.

526
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,480
And I'm now realizing I've said the F curse a couple of times.

527
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,840
And I know we have a parent that listens that doesn't like that.

528
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,440
So I've been a refrain. I don't.

529
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,600
I think at this point, a lot of them listen.

530
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,600
And sorry, sorry, folks.

531
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,040
At least we're working, you know, mine.

532
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,880
That's the benefit of parents who still have burner cell phones is

533
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,760
they'll never listen to you say fuck on a podcast.

534
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,960
Well, I'll be cognizant of it either way.

535
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,880
But yes, I was really happy they got that fucking brontosaurus out.

536
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,880
Fuck, yeah.

537
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,680
I never I never thought about this part.

538
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,800
I don't think I know the brontosaurus well enough.

539
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,720
I didn't know it needed to be shot out of its misery.

540
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,040
It was really bad.

541
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,920
It was it was like so if that's going to be the way you set the tone for the ride,

542
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,600
then it's a huge failure because like now it's like the one in Orlando,

543
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,720
the Jurassic Park River Adventure.

544
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,080
I have to do it at night because you can't see the fucking steel

545
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,880
framing around it, which is so shitty.

546
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,120
And you also you notice less that it's like

547
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,880
so such a warm piece of mechanics like.

548
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,200
And then, of course, it is like, but my inner child wants

549
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,840
at least try to pretend that it's real.

550
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,400
And I don't want to have to be on a pound and a half of edibles

551
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,520
for that to be real.

552
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,600
I mean, anyway, but yeah.

553
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,680
Well, that's the real thrill ride taking a pound

554
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,320
to have of edibles to the state of Florida.

555
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,560
Bingo.

556
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,160
I think it's I do think that Jurassic World is like one

557
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,080
extra little dinosaur show scene and then a really cool finale away

558
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,960
from being like like, yeah, in my mind, which I think we might get.

559
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,800
I mean, the thing is that I think is a real bummer is that they really seem

560
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:55,520
to do nothing with the scene that they've turned into the Indominus Rex cage

561
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,840
when you first enter the Rapture Containment Area.

562
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,360
Like what they've done with that is like they've made no choices.

563
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:07,080
Like now I see they've added like that sphere that the boys travel in in the movie.

564
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,600
They've added like a broken sphere to that section, like the gyrosphere.

565
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,600
But there's no story happening there.

566
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,880
You just know, I guess you that's when you find out that something's gone wrong,

567
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,280
but there should be something happening.

568
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,880
There should be dinosaurs there.

569
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,680
We're middle.

570
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,520
Not sure. And you get a wall blood.

571
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,480
You get some nice wall blood, if that does anything for you.

572
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,160
Which it doesn't know so much.

573
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,200
I'd rather see a robot.

574
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,520
Yes. Or you see the blood getting splashed or may are produced in the moment.

575
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,320
The leaked photos of the original concept was the two dinosaur heads,

576
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,040
like budding heads almost at the end of it, as opposed to one just kind of like

577
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,920
like like a peeping Tom in the bushes overlooking at the T-Rex.

578
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,760
Yeah, I think we will get something closer to the concept art.

579
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,200
But when I was there, which was during Halloween Horror Nights,

580
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,680
actually, like it wasn't even the Indominus Rex's head.

581
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,880
They covered it up.

582
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,000
So it was literally just the T-Rex doing what it always has done.

583
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,200
And I was like disappointed.

584
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,120
But for me, it's just like if you're working to get the finished product

585
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,800
in the place where it needs to be, whatever, I'll come back.

586
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,520
I have a season pass to that place.

587
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:11,920
Sure.

588
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,520
I will say I'll transition to the topic.

589
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,800
I was thinking about, OK, there's two versions of this mummy ride,

590
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,280
one in Hollywood, one in Florida.

591
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,880
We know the Florida one's better, but I almost feel bad.

592
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,640
And I'm so hurting for going to these theme parks that I feel bad that I

593
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,600
have such a negative feeling toward the mummy out here.

594
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,000
And I feel like once it's back open, I will never forsake it again.

595
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,560
I will. I want to go on this bad version.

596
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,360
The Chili's two version of the mummy ride.

597
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:47,000
So bad. I get what you're saying, but I know I cannot second that.

598
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,640
I yeah, that doesn't I.

599
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,680
I just enough feelings. Don't worry.

600
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:56,280
But if you this is one of my theme park grievances, like I when the mummy

601
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,080
ride opened in Florida, I was so into it.

602
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,080
And Matt, I'm so happy to hear your enthusiasm for this ride,

603
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,240
because I was going like, am I looking at this through rose colored glasses?

604
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,200
And then when we wrote it last fall, I was like, oh no, this is still great.

605
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,440
This is still so fun, especially in 2004.

606
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,120
It was like such a leap ahead.

607
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,240
And it's aged so well. It holds up. Yeah.

608
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,200
And I think shows like what could have if the ownership of the park

609
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,840
had stabilized a little sooner, like, oh, if the mummy had been the

610
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,040
the early adopter, the standard, like the screen in that

611
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,520
is pretty small, like pretty minor.

612
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,880
That still looks good.

613
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,520
That looks better than like Transformers and Fast and Furious,

614
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,280
like that little one little screen like. But the rest is practical.

615
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,400
Yeah, I mean, Fast and Furious, we don't talk about.

616
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,200
I know, but we haven't gotten there yet.

617
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,760
It's literally such an embarrassment.

618
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,520
It's a bummer. I was the only one who read it.

619
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,840
And I have I've just been sitting on the notes of like just bumping everyone out.

620
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,880
Yeah, we don't want to do this sad, gray episode.

621
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,680
But that will be it's it's so long and so bad.

622
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,640
And it's just there's really very little good about it.

623
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,000
But anyway, I am a Transformers stan and protector.

624
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,040
Like, I think it's pretty fucking great.

625
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,240
I guess. But but but with the mummy, it's like.

626
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,840
And first of all, like something I want to say is this is the first ride,

627
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,600
the first major e-ticket theme park ride that I was like.

628
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,960
Fully following the progress of online, even as a kid,

629
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,840
I think I was in my early teens, yeah, 2004, so I was

630
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,800
probably 12, 13 when they announced this.

631
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,040
And I remember them describing it as a psychological thrill ride,

632
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,920
like they had never done before, like they were using all these terms.

633
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,280
I was really interested in it was like, we're going to play with all your senses

634
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,000
and it's going to be a high speed roller coaster.

635
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,400
And I remember thinking this will be really cool if they can pull this off.

636
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,720
And the fact that they even came close to what they were describing

637
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,640
is pretty unbelievable.

638
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,080
And like you said in 2004, when this opened, like there wasn't shit like this.

639
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:15,120
There just wasn't. So, you know, I think that.

640
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,760
If there's one thing that maybe doesn't hold up about it,

641
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,240
it's the fact that it's like the Brendan Fraser mummy.

642
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,280
Like, you know what I mean?

643
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:28,000
Like that, like property, I don't think is something that's like evergreen.

644
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,640
But the ride itself is evergreen and it was so ambitious from the beginning.

645
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,240
And it was it's fun to ride every single time.

646
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,360
Yeah. Would you give any points to that?

647
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,880
Probably not the L.A. one.

648
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,480
I learned a little about the Singapore one, which seems like sort of a blend.

649
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,880
It's missing elements from Florida, but it does not have the

650
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,120
we're making a movie or the Brendan Fraser of it all did that.

651
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,680
Do you think?

652
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,320
Are those other versions superior at all because they're lacking the little

653
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,040
we're making a film with Brendan?

654
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,400
You know, I don't think the story fully tracks on the Orlando one.

655
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,680
Like, I think that it's a little confusing to go from we're on a set

656
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,760
to all of a sudden we're in the in the world.

657
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,840
Like, I just think they could have, like you said, like,

658
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,520
I think we could have committed to being in the world from the top.

659
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,120
It's like meta in a way that I don't think it needs to be.

660
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,040
But ultimately, if you're able to follow the narrative through the cue,

661
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,240
then it does make sense.

662
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,440
But who's doing that?

663
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,000
You know what I mean?

664
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,160
Like it's your move.

665
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,040
And now it doesn't really drop huge lines at all.

666
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,320
And so you're moving right to the end.

667
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,000
I always have the express pass.

668
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,520
So it's like you're moving, you're breezing through the queue

669
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,640
to the point where you skip all of that

670
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,280
narrative stuff with Brendan's character and like the is the P.A.

671
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,000
that then dies during the ride.

672
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,960
It's like you don't know who that is.

673
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,200
So when you're just going right through and you're already in the

674
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,720
ancient Egypt section, like you miss all of that.

675
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,920
Whereas I do think if I'm going to give one prop to the Hollywood version,

676
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,680
it's just we're in the world of the mummy.

677
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,520
You know what I mean?

678
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,160
Like this is what it's not too complicated.

679
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,520
It's easily accessible.

680
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,520
You don't need and you don't need it to be.

681
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,000
I went on in 2019 not not knowing any of that.

682
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,640
I knew there was like that beat in the middle where the way you think the ride

683
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,840
started, but I didn't know the story or Reggie.

684
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:25,400
I had no idea about Reggie Reggie, the assistant production assistant

685
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,200
or the assistant.

686
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,040
Very important.

687
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,280
But I did the single rider.

688
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,360
I think we all might have.

689
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:37,000
So I literally had no idea what was happening when there was a red hat on a mummy.

690
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,240
I truly just literally didn't even see that.

691
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,760
I think that is an issue.

692
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,560
They need to represent that somehow, even in the single rider.

693
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,360
It's not how that's supposed to be.

694
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,760
So under all that, like mummy bondage stuff that he's got on

695
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,600
is like an actual human animatronic.

696
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,240
But the effect of like when emo tap blows the smoke

697
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,560
or like sucks the life out of him, like him going back to mummification,

698
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,320
like that was like too much.

699
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,360
And also that emo tap animatronic barely works.

700
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,400
So much about that ride is like

701
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,720
just working in like a beta function.

702
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,480
Oh, really? Wait, I don't know any of it was.

703
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,560
So they wrapped it up as a way to get around that they didn't make a perfect Reggie.

704
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:28,480
Like, no, it was just the effect of the mummification happening

705
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,960
was too precarious.

706
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,720
It was just like not working.

707
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,640
Wow. I think this is true.

708
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,880
I'm almost positive this is true, but it's not like a supposed to be a mummy

709
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,480
animatronic, it's supposed to be a Reggie animatronic that then

710
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,320
gets like turned into that.

711
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,440
Yeah, it just was this technology just wasn't there yet for it to look good

712
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,160
and run like every 30 seconds.

713
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,520
Yeah. And in the Hollywood version, a mummy was supposed to jump on the car.

714
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,240
Oh, really? Yeah.

715
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,240
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

716
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,160
And then they had to cut.

717
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,560
They had to cut. So it was like a hydraulic thing.

718
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,440
It was like the mummy was going to hop onto the car and then pull back.

719
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,280
I forget it's like in the beginning of the ride.

720
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,240
It's like so short that who even knows what that means.

721
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:20,080
But they had so many plans for what they were going to do that they ended up landing.

722
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,800
They reached for the moon and landed on a star.

723
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,800
Let's just say that.

724
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,080
I mean, yeah, they got pretty close.

725
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,760
Yeah. There's so many impressive things, especially for what this is 2004.

726
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,240
Yeah. Like crazy stuff that you wouldn't expect because like 2004 was a long time ago.

727
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:42,240
Like Rise of the Resistance is 16 years later and they're maybe in Rise of the Resistance era.

728
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,720
They could if they built this new in 2020, maybe they'd get everything right.

729
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,720
Yeah. Right.

730
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:55,360
The Singapore one built in 2010 cost half as much as the Hollywood and Florida ones.

731
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,680
And it doesn't have like the fake out.

732
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,200
See, it has a scene.

733
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:06,880
It doesn't have the fake out loading scene, but it has an extra emotional effect.

734
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:13,640
Imhotep there and the Book of the Living, which I guess it was their version is much clearer story wise.

735
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,680
And it's as long as the Florida one.

736
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,560
And somehow it costs half as much.

737
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,080
I don't know how they did that.

738
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,560
But the queue and building look incredibly detailed.

739
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:30,480
I think probably because they made it so long after the original rides.

740
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:37,720
There's a lot about like a lot of the money that they spend goes to like sets that they have to originally create.

741
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,360
So that's why you see like a lot of carbon copies.

742
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:46,560
Like that's why Transformers is the same, exactly the same in so many different Universal parks.

743
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,480
And the same thing is going to be true with Mario Kart.

744
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,160
Like they're going to be and Harry Potter for what it's worth.

745
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,760
The entire land is just like copy pasted because it's so much cheaper.

746
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:07,560
So maybe that went into how much cheaper the Singapore mummy is, because they could essentially just recreate a lot of it without without it being exactly the same.

747
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,720
Maybe. How do we even get into that?

748
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:23,280
I mean, we've sort of said it, but the basic idea of the Florida one is that you are on the set of not the mummy returns, but a different mummy sequel.

749
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,000
Revenge of the Mummy.

750
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,320
You are not on the set of the mummy tomb of the dragon emperor, the third in the Steven Subbers Mummy series.

751
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:44,160
And the tone of the videos is very much like Christopher Guest Light, maybe like that vibe of like we're just having a little jokey, some quirky characters.

752
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,400
Yes, like a mockumentary.

753
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,680
Yeah, yeah, which I probably took a long time to shoot.

754
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,640
And now it's like people are just walking right by it.

755
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,360
Like you really booked Brendan Rager for this.

756
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,280
Like fucking what's her name?

757
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,920
A Rachel Weiss was like, I'm not doing that.

758
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,360
She's not present.

759
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,000
I get nothing from this.

760
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,240
It's like in the movies, the mummy movies are like kind of light.

761
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:09,520
I don't know, were they thinking like these videos would balance out the dark because the ride is very dark, a very scary ride.

762
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,200
The queue is really dark, too.

763
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,320
You can't see shit.

764
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:20,000
Yeah. Yeah. So were they thinking like, oh, we'll do this whimsical, this fun little light pre-show to balance.

765
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,080
Like, it is curious to me why they would go completely that tone of like, we're just goofing around.

766
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,880
Well, you have to remember, they're obsessed with how things are made.

767
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,320
So maybe they maybe they felt this was like a subversion on that.

768
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:38,880
Like it's around that area of the park where at the time they did have like, you know, earthquake, which then became disaster.

769
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:47,520
Right. It out. So there is like there's something to be said about them potentially making a comment on the way their other attractions work.

770
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,600
So it's like, see behind the scenes, props from the movie, et cetera.

771
00:40:51,720 --> 00:41:01,520
And then there's a twist, you know, because this this ride at the time was really them saying we're changing the way we do things.

772
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:10,080
And that's where I think it gets like a little heady is they were commenting on the type of universal ride that they've always done.

773
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:17,000
Right. This is maybe that is this the last big ride they made where they had to sort of put in like,

774
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,040
how the movies are made, perhaps.

775
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,400
It seems like they really lost that after this.

776
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,080
Right. But and this and again, this wasn't even that.

777
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,240
I think it was like truly a transition out of that.

778
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,520
Right. Because now it's like there's none of that in the park anymore.

779
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Because Simpsons opens a couple of years after this, like four years later.

780
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,600
And that really isn't how the Simpsons are made or anything.

781
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,800
No, it's just we're in the world of the Simpsons, which is what it should be.

782
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,920
I mean, I think that's great.

783
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,520
Harry Potter is just like, welcome to the Wizarding World, which I think is what it should be.

784
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:58,360
And I think, you know, that's what Islands of Adventure does so well is it's like we're transporting you into worlds,

785
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:05,160
whereas Universal Studios used to be ride the movies and there was like a BTS element to it, which they've really left behind,

786
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,120
I think, so they can capitalize on just getting into the IP.

787
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:15,800
And the most successful of the early rides, I think, easily was Back to the Future, which never had any behind the scenes component.

788
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,560
Like they should have learned then.

789
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,080
Jaws as well. Jaws as well.

790
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:25,560
I mean, like it was just this was your encounter with Jaws and Back to the Future was Back to the Future was so fun

791
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:30,640
because you really felt like you were going you were doing that, you know, like back in the day, Back to the Future.

792
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,960
That was like, I mean, truly chef's kiss.

793
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:39,360
And, you know, Terminator for the same reason, like I really enjoyed that when I first when it first came out years ago,

794
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:43,120
I was like, this felt like a really specific only Universal could do it.

795
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,880
This this very perfectly fits with the IP.

796
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,520
Would any listener be upset if we just we've done a lot of these attractions?

797
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,000
Can we just do Terminator and Back to the Future again?

798
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,040
Because we just and make no new observations or new twists.

799
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,280
I just want to talk about them.

800
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,320
I keep thinking about like, I know there's stuff in my notes we never got to on like,

801
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,600
who cares? They're just saying all the same shit.

802
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,560
I mean, yeah.

803
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,600
For sure. I remake.

804
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,920
How many times has Doughboy's gone to Burger King at this point?

805
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,800
Let's be real.

806
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:22,040
Uh, yeah, fuck you, Doughboy's spoons fired.

807
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,400
No, but I mean, you know, they got we got it, Jason.

808
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,280
You hate Doughboy.

809
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,680
Hey, all right.

810
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,120
You're going to always just pretended to like them.

811
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,520
We know the last of the three of us to do the show, we get the extra.

812
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,720
But you guys haven't done the mummy yet.

813
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,280
Well, no, we have not done this right now.

814
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,600
God, I can't believe it took you guys this long to do the mummy.

815
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,720
You guys have been doing this podcast for so long.

816
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,080
Oh, there's there's giant ones we haven't got.

817
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,880
There's glaringly obvious ones we haven't done.

818
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,880
What an honor to be the person that's the mummy.

819
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,200
Oh, we've and I've had it.

820
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,840
We've had it like earmarked for you.

821
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,080
I was like, well, we got to have Matt back on for the mummy.

822
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,320
And we talked about it a bunch.

823
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,760
Because what did we do the first time?

824
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,000
Twister ride it out.

825
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,480
Twister. Wow.

826
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,560
Yeah. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

827
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,400
Now, wait a minute.

828
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,080
Did you just say disaster, but say disaster, right?

829
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,280
It because I was like, I love it.

830
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,160
Oh, I messed up. I messed up.

831
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,280
What was the disaster subtitle?

832
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,800
Disaster, a major exclamation point.

833
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,440
I'm a picture starring you.

834
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,120
So stupid. I like.

835
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,680
But since you mentioned Terminator and we talked about jaws,

836
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,320
I think mummy might be the last of Universal's

837
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,760
chip on its shoulder of like we're not Disney.

838
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,240
We're a little more cutting.

839
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:42,680
We're a little edgier because like the yeah, the ride itself gets very dark.

840
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,000
But those few lines are pretty sarcastic.

841
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,840
The Q video is pretty sarcastic.

842
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:52,920
A little mean, like everyone kind of like dumps on Reggie a lot.

843
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,560
I think they're they're not killing people in pre shows and rides anymore.

844
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:56,960
You know what I mean?

845
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,360
Like I used to watch Kimberly Duncan get choked out by the Terminator.

846
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,440
And they they they they like literally to death.

847
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,320
And like they've pulled off that.

848
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,720
I remember the one time I went back, like in later years when Terminator was

849
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,640
like happening, the Terminator came up out of the stage and Kimberly Duncan just goes,

850
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,400
I'm going to get security and walks off.

851
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,760
And I'm like, oh, enough people complained about watching a woman get killed,

852
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,600
get killed six times a day.

853
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,240
Yeah. Yeah. Interesting.

854
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,000
But but like with this ride, it's like, you know, Reggie dies.

855
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,760
He dies. Yeah, he eats really painfully.

856
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,440
There is one very funny shot because some of the YouTube

857
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,800
ride throughs got capture some of the pre show videos.

858
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,240
And there's one very funny shot where he's just like crouched on the ground,

859
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,600
wiping up a spill with paper towels.

860
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,520
And as someone who did a fair amount of work when I was younger,

861
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:54,440
that I found very relatable and very funny because he was so shitty and uncomfortable.

862
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,800
They used to really be unconcerned about like optics on that stuff.

863
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,200
They were just like, we're universal and we're setting ourselves apart.

864
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,760
And all these rides are rated PG 13.

865
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,400
The rides used to literally have ratings.

866
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,800
I remember that like it was like like in the park map, it'd be like Terminator 2

867
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,200
is PG 13, which I was kind of movies.

868
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,400
You know? Yeah.

869
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,040
But and obviously like

870
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,920
Halloween Horror Nights was like a rated R experience because that's like so brutal

871
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,120
and like so violent, so insane.

872
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,480
All of that. Yeah.

873
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,560
So it's just like that's their that's their version of that.

874
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,560
But it does seem like.

875
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:36,640
They are only interested in pushing the envelope in that regard now with humor.

876
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,200
Ish. Yeah, right.

877
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,160
Like I couldn't I'll say this, like I think I might have even said this

878
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,960
on the podcast last time, but when I went to Halloween Horror Nights

879
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,640
a few years ago, I saw that Bill and Ted show and it was right before the election.

880
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,760
It was so.

881
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,440
Dark and it was it was so rough to be there in Florida.

882
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,840
Like I listen to you then.

883
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:04,040
What was shared for Trump a lot and like someone playing Trump

884
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,280
and there was someone playing Hillary and like whenever Hillary come out,

885
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,600
it was just like honestly, I should have known what was going to happen

886
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,800
because it was just groans and booze and like at her very image,

887
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,080
which I'm sure would happen now, like they have like a Biden or a Kamala.

888
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,920
I shudder to think what the reaction would be.

889
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,520
But shockingly, like Biden comes out and they shoot.

890
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,520
Yeah. Voice of reason.

891
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,240
Yeah, I mean, like it was all rather right.

892
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,760
But I just I have such a fear of what the actual mentality is.

893
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,200
Literally there and saw it.

894
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,920
And then the election was weeks later.

895
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,920
And obviously it went the way it went.

896
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,000
But I think like if they're willing to do that,

897
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,600
then again, it was Halloween Horror Nights, like at least there is like

898
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,920
they have the spirit of that in them, like they'll they'll go for it.

899
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,920
But we haven't seen it in actual rides, probably because they're

900
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,160
like always going to be there and they have to commit to the murder of someone.

901
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,920
Whereas like in a seasonal show, it's like, yeah, we can kind of make a joke here

902
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,640
and there. We might not ordinarily do.

903
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,680
Pull it. Pretend it never happened.

904
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,960
You didn't see. Also, there's a there's a murder of a woman in Revenge of the Mummy,

905
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,560
too, like that ride operator gets gutted and her blood splashes on you.

906
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,080
Yeah, that's true.

907
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,280
Wait, is there literally? Yes.

908
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,480
It's a water effect.

909
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,360
Or I don't remember that.

910
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,160
I always thought it was the broken glass.

911
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,600
I always thought it was simulating with glass breaking.

912
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,280
To me, it's like woman dies.

913
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:33,160
You get splashed like that to me feels like the the insinuation

914
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,600
is supposed to be that it's blood.

915
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,920
Hmm. Could it be glass and blood?

916
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,160
It could be both. OK.

917
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,280
Is it? I have a thing about

918
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,120
both of those specific iterations of Imhotep.

919
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,920
Is it weird that I find Imhotep cute?

920
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,280
Like the way he the way he moves, he's just like a little weird.

921
00:48:54,600 --> 00:49:00,760
Like the way his arm catches Reggie, he's just so like little.

922
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,560
And what does it remind me of?

923
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:07,520
I like I don't know, like if you if you take a villain and like shrink him down,

924
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,640
it's the opposite of my big stuff problem.

925
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,600
He just seems like he's like he's only like four foot five.

926
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:18,040
Is his movements are so like he has little and jerky.

927
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,240
Imhotep has girl boss diva energy.

928
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:25,000
I mean, basically, Imhotep just put his hand up in Reggie's face

929
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,040
and sucked his soul out.

930
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,120
And it was not even a thing, honey.

931
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,320
Yes, that's how it feels.

932
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,240
You you you he says your souls are mine.

933
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,520
Death is only the beginning.

934
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,360
Girl, he is turning iconic lines in the ride.

935
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,000
Death is only the beginning.

936
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,680
Talk dirty to me, Dad.

937
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,360
Like it's so just erotic.

938
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,240
The with the power that that has.

939
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,200
We have no choice but to stand.

940
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,600
Oh, we have no we had no choice.

941
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,400
Join me and

942
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,800
riches, savor riches for all eternity.

943
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:00,120
Yeah. Or refuse and savor a more bitter treasure.

944
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,120
Saver. Yeah, there's a power, doesn't he?

945
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,920
Oh, yeah, hon.

946
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,040
I mean, like we're talking about.

947
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,800
And then what does he say?

948
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,520
When you when you fall back after the scarab beetles, he's like.

949
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,880
Nothing, not even the magic I can save you now.

950
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,600
I was like, oh, yes.

951
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,720
Damn. I'm about to get taken care absolutely of.

952
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,800
And then they shoot you shoot through his mouth.

953
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,560
It's very sexual, the ride.

954
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,600
Yeah. Yeah.

955
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,360
Serve me and savor.

956
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,840
Yeah, these are all very these are they're sexual verbs, aren't they?

957
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,480
Scott, when you say cute, were you just being like a little bit

958
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,960
like you were bearing a lead that you also were kind of getting a little

959
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,840
worked up by this guy? It was less.

960
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,120
No, I think it was less.

961
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:46,160
I was thinking cute more like a pet, like he just seems like, you know,

962
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,320
the energy of a big dog, but he's little and he tries to act tough.

963
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,200
That's that's what I was thinking.

964
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,680
But I assume you weren't you weren't aspect.

965
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,000
You you weren't erotically interested.

966
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,280
God, not then, but after your description, that that changes everything.

967
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,000
I got a lot of things to do.

968
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,400
Launch Queen.

969
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,640
Arnold, this not taking the queen part out.

970
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,280
That's staying.

971
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,400
No, it's just the no left. That's all.

972
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,880
No, he is.

973
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,800
You know, he's an underrated character.

974
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,480
I feel like just in general, like we all talk about the

975
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,800
obviously IP characters, you know, you're Vin Diesel on what's what's Dom, you know.

976
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:28,200
But this is a character that's not so famous that deserves a lot more attention,

977
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:33,720
you know, like Rex Star Tours or any of the other like in theme park characters.

978
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,120
Well, yeah, Mike, you're you're talking to us from a shelf

979
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,320
full of park stars, you know, the little, you know, characters,

980
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,360
dolls of characters are only in Disney parks.

981
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,480
There's no such thing at Universal.

982
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,200
They're they're much lighter on the merch and worshiping characters.

983
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,040
Not I mean, emo types in the movies, too.

984
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:55,200
But yeah, there should absolutely be the the toy of Rex or the Rex.

985
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,520
This is I'm holding up smart one part.

986
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,520
Sorry, he's very cute.

987
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,320
But there should be an emo tap.

988
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,640
Cute little vinyl figure you can get.

989
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,720
That's with my proportions thing, me calling him cute.

990
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:11,000
It'd be the most adorable, like two inch tall little guy.

991
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:15,160
And they could sell a sexy one and just kind of a cute one as well.

992
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:18,480
Like they could do a full one where he has full like male anatomy.

993
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,800
And then they could do one where he's like a little short stout vinyl.

994
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:26,240
Or he's like just gotten the pecs off of one of the bodies that he's,

995
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,520
you know, stolen parts from.

996
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,640
I have watched the Brendan Frasier

997
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,880
mommy the other night, I sort of understand they have.

998
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,440
I mean, I'm a toy collector.

999
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:39,280
I have, you know, I have these cute vinyl nations,

1000
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:45,120
but I also have what's called hot toys and they are about their one sixth scale.

1001
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,520
They're a little expensive.

1002
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,800
And I have an Adam West that is fully like a man.

1003
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,800
He's a fully little man.

1004
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,000
They call it a hot toy.

1005
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,080
That's the brand. It's called Hot Toys.

1006
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,800
That's not a joke. Whoa.

1007
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,160
Just the brand.

1008
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:01,280
And they make a lot of, you know, one sixth scale toys

1009
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,240
that are realistic proportions.

1010
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,680
And they're very cool, very dynamic.

1011
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,040
And I feel like let's get one of these with a emo tap.

1012
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,760
He was on your shelf.

1013
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,480
Who's on your Park Stars shelf who you'd like to see a little more fleshed out,

1014
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,960
like a lot done, a little more hot toy style.

1015
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:21,240
Well, certainly I would like a full Mark Twain toy.

1016
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,680
Buff Mark Twain.

1017
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,280
That's really good.

1018
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,560
Let's see here.

1019
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,480
I also think that.

1020
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:35,800
A wall, a famous performer, Wally Bogue.

1021
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,520
Oh, the star.

1022
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,800
Golden Horseshoe.

1023
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,000
Wow. You do collect toys.

1024
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:41,840
Yeah. Oh, my God.

1025
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,040
This isn't even the half of it.

1026
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,720
I bet. So, yeah, there's other.

1027
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,520
I mean, maybe a full hunk.

1028
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,520
Mr. Potato Head doll.

1029
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,840
Yeah. Carved up.

1030
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:56,720
You sort of like, yeah, like, you know, slice those sides up a little bit.

1031
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,840
Crunch him in. And yeah, he's looking good.

1032
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,840
Totally. But one last one.

1033
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,920
Adventurers Club.

1034
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,520
Oh, yes. The general, the general or the major.

1035
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,440
A lot of possibilities here.

1036
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,840
A lot of possibilities for merch.

1037
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:16,040
Yeah. But give us our our Universal Park Stars for sure.

1038
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,600
Why don't they have a brand like that?

1039
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,240
They do. We all do.

1040
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,680
But they buy them.

1041
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,720
Well, I bought I got my dad.

1042
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,360
The they had a John Hammond one.

1043
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,440
I got him that when we were down in Florida.

1044
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,560
It was so hard to find.

1045
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,160
I sold it one and I had to keep going back to stores

1046
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,600
because the stock was so inconsistent.

1047
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,840
But it's mostly like that was the main good one.

1048
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,880
The rest was like Woody Woodpecker and then a faceless creature

1049
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,520
with like a film strip for a face that just said universal.

1050
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,720
Who is that? It was not a strippy.

1051
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,520
I've never heard a strippy before.

1052
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,880
It was like nothing.

1053
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,360
But yeah, they should definitely make an emotive vinyl guy.

1054
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:02,880
I mean, I am of the mind that Universal should make a another Brendan Frazier.

1055
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,720
They should just do another one.

1056
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,440
You're a big fan, I think, Jason, these movies.

1057
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,800
I think especially like you were born.

1058
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:17,920
Yes, I think it's they're the perfect like Saturday afternoon on TNT movies.

1059
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,560
And I also think that we're due for a Frazier songs.

1060
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:25,960
Like I think Brendan Frazier needs to have his Birdman or the unexpected

1061
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:30,480
virtue of ignorance like where is Brendan Frazier's big prestige movie?

1062
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,880
You know, I forget he was in crash.

1063
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,160
Oh, yeah. OK.

1064
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,440
Sure.

1065
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,880
That would be the best picture.

1066
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,400
And what we all agree it was the best picture.

1067
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,280
I mean, of course, really, move questionably the country forward.

1068
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,720
You know, had a lot to say.

1069
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,080
The problems we're having now are just because everybody forgot about crash.

1070
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,840
Everyone get a watch and certainly wouldn't make things way worse.

1071
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:00,760
I've never I literally don't know what's contained in the movie crash.

1072
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,520
A bad movie. It's a mess.

1073
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:07,640
I've heard bad, irresponsibly written movie and won the Oscar.

1074
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,560
Scientologist.

1075
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,040
My favorite. That's best.

1076
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,040
Yes, for sure. It beat broke back mountain.

1077
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,560
Oh, yeah.

1078
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,240
And that was like a shock at the time, I think.

1079
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,240
Very much so.

1080
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,840
Yeah, that was like because one was a very good movie and one was bad.

1081
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,200
Yeah, I remember this.

1082
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,600
Yeah, I remember this.

1083
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,120
So it really it sent shockwaves through the industry,

1084
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,720
but not really because the industry is homophobic.

1085
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,640
Sure. Yeah.

1086
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,320
So hold on. Where was I?

1087
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,600
I just have pictures of him a tap up here now.

1088
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,520
Oh, wow.

1089
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,240
Talking about his his sex appeal slash cuteness. Right. Yeah.

1090
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,320
Yeah, it is.

1091
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:50,240
I almost like forget because he's obviously not featured enough in Hollywood.

1092
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,480
So I sort of forget him.

1093
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:56,480
He's he's he's featured, but it's just not in like the animatronic is

1094
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,480
so good in Florida.

1095
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:03,040
And his presence is kind of he does he does he drop from the ceiling?

1096
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,000
I'm actually confused now.

1097
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,920
No, that's Hollywood.

1098
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,560
Yeah. But I'm saying what what is he featured?

1099
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,360
He's his head is featured.

1100
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:14,440
But you go through his mouth in the lunch and also he's in the beginning

1101
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,480
of the ride and, you know, like, I guess his like

1102
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,920
visage is like present throughout the rollercoaster parts and like

1103
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,960
you know, I guess you're sort of teased at the end, like he's not really dead.

1104
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,880
Right. Yeah.

1105
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,480
Haunts Brendan Fraser when he gets his cup of coffee.

1106
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,840
What do we think of that part?

1107
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:38,280
What's there in his opinion about the the Brendan Fraser coffee gig?

1108
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,960
I mean, again, if you didn't know that he was wanting coffee

1109
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,640
in the pre show, that means nothing to you.

1110
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,880
And so like it's got to literally mean nothing to I'm going to go ahead and say

1111
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:52,760
95 percent of the people that ride it on any given day.

1112
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:57,440
It's very much a piece of the Men in Black, the fake world's fair

1113
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:01,840
bookends of the ride, which you really miss if you do.

1114
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,720
They didn't really think about the express pass as much back then

1115
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,480
when designing stuff that there would be separate lines.

1116
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,480
So there you could go to Men in Black, totally skip the setup

1117
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,840
and just go right into the headquarters.

1118
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,520
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1119
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,680
It's kind of an odd ending.

1120
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,520
And I guess with that, we should say you survive.

1121
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,120
I guess I ride. That's the end of wrong.

1122
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,800
Prepare to forfeit your afternoon.

1123
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,200
Our one is only the beginning.

1124
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,040
I it's the best.

1125
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,680
It's the fake out ending of the ride in 2004.

1126
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:42,960
It's good now. In 2004, it was mind blowing.

1127
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,040
And I mean, we also have to say like, that's the part with the roof

1128
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,200
on fire, which is like the ceiling rather.

1129
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,480
That's amazing. I mean, like that holds up so much.

1130
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,600
It's so impressive. It's so hot.

1131
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,440
Like and I miss them doing fire effects, obviously.

1132
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,720
I don't think it probably for environmental reasons.

1133
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,360
They're not doing it all the time.

1134
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,480
But that to me is such a strength of the ride.

1135
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:09,280
And it makes me so reminiscent of the days of Jaws when that tanker would explode.

1136
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:10,920
That's all universal.

1137
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,280
There were so many in both Hollywood and Orlando, so many opportunities

1138
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:18,440
to feel uncomfortably hot, to be real close to real flame.

1139
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,040
A lot of gas smells.

1140
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,320
I associate universal with the smell of real gas.

1141
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:24,560
They've replaced.

1142
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,960
I think I think theme park.

1143
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:30,160
They've replaced maybe real fire with what we I think deemed steam fire.

1144
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,200
Yeah. And the last one.

1145
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,040
We like steam fire. We decided that.

1146
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:37,440
And I think I'm assuming, you know, safer, cheaper.

1147
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,080
So that's probably the way the future.

1148
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,680
But yes, there is something because like

1149
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,480
nothing freaks your body out like a flame.

1150
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,040
Right. Yeah.

1151
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,800
It puts you in a sense of real danger.

1152
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:52,480
It's like, like whenever I'm riding Spider-Man and they decide

1153
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,840
not to do that effect with the fire when the Green Goblin throws the ball.

1154
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,560
I'm always like bummed because I know what it's like to be doing that

1155
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:02,840
and then have that fire happen.

1156
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:05,280
It's so unbelievably impressive. Right.

1157
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,560
And and urgent.

1158
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,800
Yeah. And they do the same thing on Transformers, right?

1159
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,080
It's the same exact.

1160
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,440
He shoots a missile.

1161
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,080
Yeah. So. Yeah.

1162
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,200
And Disney doesn't. Yeah.

1163
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,600
Disney's Disney's track record with fire.

1164
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,200
There's the fire on Indiana Jones, but they don't really.

1165
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,760
Yeah. You're not close to the flame shooting up on Indiana Jones.

1166
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,120
Fantastic. Canyon. Yeah.

1167
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,120
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1168
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,720
Which hasn't been there for years.

1169
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,280
I mean, like even like Rise of the Resistance.

1170
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,200
Like I just felt like something was missing with Rise of the Resistance

1171
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,640
when I did it. I was really so blown away by this.

1172
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,880
Like, I think it's so amazing what they were able to do.

1173
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:42,840
But there was a sense of danger that was missing for me.

1174
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,280
I think I said that I felt like the ride vehicle

1175
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,520
like Indiana Jones, the ride vehicle shakes a lot and gives you that sense

1176
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,840
of I'm in danger the whole time.

1177
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,400
And it's such a smooth ride.

1178
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,920
It was so time. Yeah.

1179
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,720
And there's only a couple of scenes where you feel like, oh, crap.

1180
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:02,760
Like when you're when those guns are going, you're like a little bit like,

1181
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,920
am I going to crash into the gun?

1182
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,480
But other than that, you're not maybe experiencing

1183
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,640
like no. Yeah.

1184
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,560
I respect what they were able to do with it.

1185
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:17,320
But I think like like those blasters firing off, like I wasn't scared.

1186
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:21,160
Like I just I felt like maybe this is because I'm 30.

1187
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,520
But, you know, I and I'm not doing this as a 12 year old.

1188
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:29,960
But I just felt like I think it is primarily exactly what you're saying.

1189
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:34,480
The motion of the vehicle did not make me feel like there was enough chaos.

1190
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,360
Yeah, I don't know.

1191
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,440
Yeah, because I think that was a big when they were doing it.

1192
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:42,640
And Jones trying to figure out how the vehicle would like

1193
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,720
make you feel like you were really going through the thing

1194
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,240
and you were really going to like tip over at any moment.

1195
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,920
And I think that might have been yeah, that might have benefited from it.

1196
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,040
Yeah, a little a little.

1197
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,960
A little goes a long way, probably.

1198
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,600
Obviously, it's like a cool ride vehicle and like it works.

1199
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:03,840
I did the Pooh's Honey Hut in Japan, which is the same ride.

1200
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,920
And that's a much that's a more of a property, maybe for a nice, smooth ride.

1201
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,560
I would agree. Yeah.

1202
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,560
So we like that.

1203
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,240
What do we think of ride vehicles here?

1204
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,760
I mean, we haven't talked about that a ton besides the launch.

1205
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,360
It is a cool I like that it's this little like stout

1206
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:25,160
roller coaster car and you feel because it's not a big long train.

1207
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:28,040
You feel like you're able to really whip around corners.

1208
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,720
And I like the bluntness of the mummy vehicle.

1209
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,520
Yeah, I read a really interesting thing.

1210
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,400
I never knew about this.

1211
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,560
There was there's a theme park insider article from 2004

1212
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:45,160
right before the Hollywood one opened and the ride vehicles

1213
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:50,760
weigh themselves at the loading station so that it can like compensate

1214
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,040
for the weight of the vehicle throughout the ride.

1215
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:56,720
So like they joke like if it's a car full of like

1216
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:01,360
football players versus a car full of children, like the ride can

1217
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,880
counterbalance that.

1218
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,000
And I never really knew that they used to do that with Dillion Dragons

1219
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,520
so that they could meet exactly at the same time.

1220
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,240
Oh, yeah. During the lift till they would get weighed.

1221
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,520
And that's why one car would stop and one would

1222
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:20,280
keep going to catch up to a certain place so that they they would know like once they.

1223
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:25,400
Started going, they would meet up at the places where you're supposed to have near misses,

1224
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,320
but that's a thing that they're able to do. Yeah.

1225
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,480
These smart vehicles.

1226
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,120
It's it's crazy seeing a roll.

1227
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:35,520
I mean, I guess I'm trying to think how many seats is Hulk have on one car?

1228
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,120
Is it the same as this?

1229
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,600
I think four row, eight rows, 32.

1230
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:44,040
I don't know if for whatever reason, the vehicle seems like very impressive

1231
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:47,480
to be a crazy fast roller coaster and just be on like it looks like it's just on

1232
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:50,040
this piece of metal and there's so many seats on it.

1233
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:53,840
This is four rows of four seats. So it's 16. Yeah. Yeah.

1234
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:57,200
I will say and this is mostly a Hollywood situation.

1235
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,800
And I talked a little bit about it on the Six Flags episode.

1236
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:06,000
This ride vehicle, especially when I did it a couple of times in Florida,

1237
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
because I'm kind of tall and because of the way the seat goes up,

1238
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,800
it oftentimes can crush my genitals.

1239
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:17,680
And I really have to make a conscious effort getting into it

1240
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:23,480
to adjust myself to not feel like my penis is going inside my body.

1241
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:26,120
I don't have penile issues on this.

1242
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:30,480
But what I do think is like the way the seats are, there's you sit super upright

1243
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:35,720
and it's a very hard back like it's not like a cushy back for your head.

1244
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:39,800
So the scene where you go into the scarab beetle section

1245
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:43,160
and then you roll backwards when you pull up to the scarab beetles,

1246
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:46,680
it stops so short, so hard. Yeah.

1247
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:47,800
And it really hard.

1248
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,080
And it does the same thing in the fake unload.

1249
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,200
It stops really hard.

1250
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,200
And you you hit you.

1251
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:57,160
You really have to be careful there to not hit the back of your head.

1252
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:01,360
And so that's the one thing I do say to people that I'm doing the ride with

1253
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,400
for the first time. I'm like, hey, for this part, just like lean forward a little bit,

1254
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,040
you know, because because because if your head's back, you're going to go.

1255
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,480
Oh, yeah. It's nice.

1256
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:13,480
There are, yeah, little things like that that I think I'm OK on it now.

1257
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:17,920
But I remember the first time I went on it and it was I think that had the head

1258
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,280
thing, too, and how hard the chair is.

1259
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:23,040
I think I did all the I had all the mistakes happen to me

1260
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,600
the first couple of times on it.

1261
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:29,640
Well, can I say what happened to win Hollywood to me?

1262
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:33,240
And really, I think why I misjudged the whole franchise,

1263
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:36,000
I think for a long time, I didn't know how much better Florida was.

1264
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,960
And I was highly anticipating this in 2004.

1265
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:46,280
And I think I just got thrown by seeing one article that hyped it up too much.

1266
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,920
There was some art might have been L.A. Times or something that said,

1267
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:52,360
this is Universal's answer to the Indiana Jones adventure,

1268
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,560
or maybe even that they were going to top it.

1269
01:05:54,560 --> 01:06:00,680
So I'm getting on that that universe, that Hollywood mummy with that expectation.

1270
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:04,080
I'm about to go on something that is better potentially than the Indiana

1271
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:07,680
Jones adventure. And as we know, not even close.

1272
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:11,080
It's not even close to the Florida mummy itself.

1273
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:16,680
So I've kind of always scored and and at the time I was a no lunch queen.

1274
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:21,760
So all of that factored into me just not going on this ride in Hollywood

1275
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,360
for many, many years.

1276
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:27,840
It's crazy to think about because the Hollywood version opened

1277
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:31,600
like a month after the Orlando one, which I don't think I ever really knew.

1278
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,600
They cost the same amount of money.

1279
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,480
One is much shorter.

1280
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:37,320
I would say very compromised.

1281
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:42,080
The same summer, the compromised Tower of Terror opens a California adventure.

1282
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:47,640
So that was just the summer of abridged rides in Southern California.

1283
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,480
I love loser West Coast cousins.

1284
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:56,560
I when I first came out here and I think I had just been at Universal Orlando

1285
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:00,520
and then a month or so later was at Universal Hollywood and rode the mummy.

1286
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,240
And I was like, what the fuck was that?

1287
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:08,560
Like I was so confused because I will grant that it's simpler story wise.

1288
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,120
But I don't think they ever did a good job

1289
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:15,280
communicating the story in the queue or the story,

1290
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,360
especially the ending was always so janky.

1291
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:22,520
And then I read so abrupt. It's it just ends. It just ends.

1292
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,600
And then I read this.

1293
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:28,560
I found this article from 16 years ago and they had a fully fleshed out back story.

1294
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,200
It made so much more sense to me.

1295
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,520
And I'm like, how did you get how did you mess this up?

1296
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:36,600
Like, I don't I it's just a mind boggling.

1297
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:40,200
Just to like play devil's advocate on the ending of the Hollywood version,

1298
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,200
because the first time I did it, it did just end.

1299
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:45,320
And I'm so used to the Hollywood, the Florida version, which

1300
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,440
so commits to completing its narrative.

1301
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,040
Yeah, as we've discussed.

1302
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:54,720
But the thing about it is like there is something about the fact that it just ends

1303
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,840
on like Imhotep's laugh and like the eclipse.

1304
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,520
Like that makes that is like an eerie ending.

1305
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,240
You know what I mean?

1306
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,280
It's like you almost believe that you've been a part of like

1307
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,320
the re-release of him into the world.

1308
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:13,280
So that to me, I think works for me if I take a second to justify it.

1309
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:16,240
But I mean, flat out, it does just end.

1310
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,040
And then all of a sudden, you're in the load station and it feels like,

1311
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,000
well, did that just happen?

1312
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:26,480
But I do think that thematically and narratively, it does keep its integrity.

1313
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:29,440
Well, because it's like the eclipse is bringing him back.

1314
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:30,520
It's giving him the power.

1315
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:33,480
And then the eclipse ends and then he like disappear like the

1316
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,320
he loses his power is is what I saw.

1317
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,240
And so like that kind of makes sense.

1318
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:44,520
But like I just I don't I don't think they did a great job setting it up.

1319
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,760
And a few years ago, they did tweak it a little.

1320
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,840
But it's like, well, that didn't really add anything.

1321
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,760
It was a real lateral move.

1322
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:55,200
And I thought the eclipse killed him.

1323
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:56,880
I thought that's always happening.

1324
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,320
I didn't take it as that or maybe it did.

1325
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,360
I don't know. It's been a it's been a bit.

1326
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:03,560
None of us know.

1327
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,920
I mean, that's not a good sign.

1328
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:07,000
What does an eclipse do to him?

1329
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,760
I've also done the one in Florida, I think, upwards of like

1330
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,640
probably over 50 times.

1331
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,920
And I've done the one in Hollywood like three or four.

1332
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,920
Yeah. Is it do you like actively avoid it?

1333
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,200
Have you been in that park and gone now?

1334
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,960
It's not only recently living in Los Angeles.

1335
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:26,280
So it's like I've only been a couple of times.

1336
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:29,000
And then I'd only done it like once or twice before that,

1337
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,320
like on vacations and stuff.

1338
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:33,040
So I think it's not that I avoid it.

1339
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,720
In fact, that's actually my favorite part because I love them.

1340
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,680
And I do enjoy the Hollywood Mummy.

1341
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:39,520
I can accept that it's not the Florida one.

1342
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,000
Like, it's not bad.

1343
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,280
I think it might even be the best thing down there

1344
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:46,120
because because Jurassic World, I haven't been able to see.

1345
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,400
And like, it's completely fleshed out state yet.

1346
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,920
But that is my favorite section.

1347
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,000
And especially when Mario Kart is done, that area is going to be

1348
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:55,360
it's going to be all about the lower lot.

1349
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,760
Yeah, yeah.

1350
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:00,280
The area is gentrified with the existence of Mario Kart.

1351
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:06,200
Yeah, I basically yeah, like I I really what I was saying earlier was

1352
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,800
I've been not able to go and I was not going to Mummy.

1353
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,240
I would skip Mummy now.

1354
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,360
And, you know, we take for granted things in our lives.

1355
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:17,840
And now during quarantine, I think I was saying let this be a lesson.

1356
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,400
Always go on Mummy.

1357
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:23,560
It's a privilege, even though it's the airport version of the Orlando version.

1358
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,400
I always feel like that, though, like I always do every ride

1359
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,680
because I never know when it's going to be the last time.

1360
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:31,360
Like, yeah, always will go on ET when I'm there,

1361
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,560
because you never know when it's going to be the last time.

1362
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:37,800
Like it could be any day, for example, with Jaws.

1363
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:42,200
Like, I didn't know the time that I did it was the last time I had ever done it.

1364
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:45,800
And I almost had the instinct to go to go down there and do it one more time,

1365
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:47,760
because that was truly the end of an era.

1366
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:52,200
But I always make sure that I have logged hours on these things

1367
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,600
in case they're going to go away.

1368
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,720
Like, I always do Poseidon's Fury because I feel like its days are numbered.

1369
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:57,240
Yeah.

1370
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:01,240
I just always want to like have it fresh in my memory.

1371
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:06,440
And, you know, the the one that we talked about this last time I was on, but Twister,

1372
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:10,400
you know, I would do it every single time I was there

1373
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,800
because I just knew they couldn't rely on that movie in the long term,

1374
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:16,840
because it wasn't like it's not one that you remember forever.

1375
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:20,600
Like Jaws or Back to the Future or, you know, whatever.

1376
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:25,160
But I genuinely miss Waterworld,

1377
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,680
which they're dying on the hill of every single day.

1378
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:28,920
It seems to work.

1379
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:32,280
I don't know. I don't think it's a full water world area somewhere.

1380
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:33,480
Yeah, it's huge.

1381
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,360
It's strange.

1382
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:38,280
I think they thought about doing a new movie based off the success of the stunt show.

1383
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,800
Oh, is that right?

1384
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,160
No, they have. I know I'm I'm asking.

1385
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,440
You're proposing. They should. Yeah.

1386
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,680
You know what I think that if they would have success

1387
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:51,560
with like a Waterworld Netflix movie, I think that's a perfect.

1388
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:52,280
Yeah. Yeah.

1389
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:55,680
Boot forward on streaming, I think would be really good for that

1390
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:59,360
franchise, because I think people just ultimately didn't want to pay

1391
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,720
to go see that movie in theaters.

1392
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,720
But now if you could just sit on your couch and watch that, I think people would.

1393
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:08,800
And probably decrease the urine drinking element,

1394
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:13,120
maybe give a little less percentage of that of the running time to urine drinking.

1395
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,960
Yeah. Lean on the action adventure of it all, unless on the survivalist aspect.

1396
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,360
I think you'd have something good.

1397
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:21,360
And also, like you could bring back the cost of your character as like a,

1398
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,040
you know, like a mentor for someone or.

1399
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,280
And you know that it's not like.

1400
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,040
But that is also a depressing topic.

1401
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:30,440
Like our world is covered in water because of climate stuff.

1402
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:31,760
That might hurt it. Yeah.

1403
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:36,200
People don't want to let's go into a world of water for a while.

1404
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,240
That's a reboot of Postman instead.

1405
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:42,600
I do keep saying I do it all post man means

1406
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:47,360
really not mean, but I keep seeing people posting about the post man

1407
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:50,760
and the like the fear of the state, the post office. Yeah.

1408
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,200
Oh, right. Right. Of course.

1409
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,640
I didn't realize Tom Petty.

1410
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,960
I think we've talked about it before. Tom Petty is in the post, man.

1411
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,440
Oh, right. OK. Yeah.

1412
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,760
So I don't know.

1413
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,320
I just like that.

1414
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:04,320
That's just a good thing.

1415
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,600
Like about it.

1416
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,240
You know, what's another thing I realized

1417
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:10,480
factoring into my dislike of the Hollywood version that is something

1418
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:14,600
that the Florida one doesn't have on its back is that the Hollywood one

1419
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,040
is the one that evicted our beloved ET.

1420
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,720
That's like a stink. It doesn't have to have anywhere else.

1421
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:24,120
And so you're going to do a lesser version of a really truncated thrill ride

1422
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:28,920
where there used to be a kind of significantly long dark ride.

1423
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:32,000
It just didn't seem like a an improvement to me.

1424
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,960
I just always felt hurt by the ET eviction.

1425
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,560
Well, of course.

1426
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:37,880
And it was ET.

1427
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:41,560
Forgive me. Was the ET was did the building outside look the same?

1428
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,280
Like it was just the soundstage.

1429
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:46,080
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But barely themed. Yes. OK.

1430
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:50,520
Because I think like if they really went the extra mile with the exterior of Mummy,

1431
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:53,800
maybe you could have been like, well, at least it like it's it's visually better

1432
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,560
now than it was before.

1433
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:58,400
It looked just sort of like a boring soundstage, but they didn't do that.

1434
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,320
So it just looks like you're going into a soundstage.

1435
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,720
They just painted it beige is all they did.

1436
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,480
Or orange ish.

1437
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:05,760
I don't know what the color is.

1438
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:09,400
And I'm sure, look, all this stuff, all this stuff is what the universal

1439
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,600
creative people wanted. I'm sure they wanted a theme.

1440
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,640
And it's just a money situation.

1441
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:16,480
I always I don't know why I feel like there's universal creative people

1442
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,560
listening, going, we tried. Shut up.

1443
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,560
It's also like space. There's no space down there.

1444
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,480
And that's ultimately why the ride is not great or not.

1445
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:28,840
Not what we're used to in Florida, because it's just they didn't have the space.

1446
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:32,440
Like, and also remember, it's like ET can be a long dark ride

1447
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:36,000
because you can move slowly like in a high speed thrill ride.

1448
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,640
You got to move through this building and there's just not the room.

1449
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:43,280
So that is something that you run into when you are going to say, let's

1450
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,600
you know, shoot for the moon here with only so much room.

1451
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:51,280
Right. Whereas, you know, like that's why you can fit something like Transformers

1452
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:54,240
or just two levels and it can feel so big.

1453
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:58,040
Like when you because when you compare like what Transformers feels like

1454
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:03,280
to what the mummy is and what Jurassic World feels like to what the mummy is.

1455
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:08,040
Well, I'm nervous about Mario Kart for this reason for that.

1456
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,080
Like, is that going to be enough space down there?

1457
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:12,280
I'm not, because that the building that they

1458
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:16,040
the thing is, they had to fill an existing space with the ET becoming mummy

1459
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:20,520
with Mario Kart, they created a gigantic sound stage,

1460
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,080
which also uses two levels.

1461
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:26,760
So it's not going to be a concern.

1462
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,200
I think that's going to be this.

1463
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,880
It's the exact same size.

1464
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,520
Basically, the ride is not the land.

1465
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,880
I think the land is going to be smaller than the one in Japan.

1466
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,200
But the ride is small.

1467
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,400
Well, the land is the land is not going to have Yoshi. Right.

1468
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:43,320
It's not going to have like the Yoshi Omnimover type. Right. Right.

1469
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:47,120
So you've been seeing those going to be the one ride in Hollywood.

1470
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:52,200
Have you been seeing those like what people can see over the fences in Japan?

1471
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,960
The Yoshi's and the coins and the plants. Oh, my God.

1472
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,520
It looks cool. It looks really cool.

1473
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:01,280
I'm excited to see it when when it's totally done with the Donkey Kong of it all.

1474
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:05,800
Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, the Yoshi ride, it doesn't look like it's for me.

1475
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,400
But I think for the people that it'll be for, aka kids,

1476
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,720
I think it'll be really fun.

1477
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:10,760
The Mario Kart ride.

1478
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:14,160
I'm really excited to see what it's going to be, because they're talking a huge game

1479
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:17,760
like about this one, too, almost reminding me of the way they talked about the mummy

1480
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,040
before it opened.

1481
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,800
Like they're saying it's going to be like unlike anything they've seen,

1482
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:26,160
like the state of the art, like now new gold standard of theme park attractions.

1483
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:30,080
And so I guess I would say like they talked about that with mummy.

1484
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,520
They talked about that with Harry Potter.

1485
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,800
The Forbidden Journey, anyway.

1486
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,600
And then they're talking about that again now with Mario Kart.

1487
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,160
And I feel like they were right the first two times.

1488
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,600
So, yeah, yeah.

1489
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,760
I think it's the main thing we all have to look forward to in our lives

1490
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,040
is the Mario Kart.

1491
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:46,160
This is like for me, it's the Jurassic Coaster.

1492
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,960
But yeah, the Mario Kart thing is for sure.

1493
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:49,320
Yeah.

1494
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:54,040
The one other thing about the Hollywood ride that kind of set it apart

1495
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,960
when you would exit the Hollywood ride, there was a long hallway

1496
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,800
with statues of mummies.

1497
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,760
And for I don't know how long they did this,

1498
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:05,080
but it happened to be multiple times.

1499
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:07,560
One of those mummies was a guy

1500
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:11,680
and he would jump down off his pedestal or like move around.

1501
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:15,640
Like it was a scare actor who would like swipe at you.

1502
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,680
And people always fell for it.

1503
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:20,280
Really?

1504
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:21,960
That's I mean, I love when they do shit like that.

1505
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:22,720
It's fun.

1506
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,120
Yeah, I appreciate it.

1507
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:27,640
Now, at the time, I didn't know it was coming and it scared the hell out of me.

1508
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:31,360
At the time when it was intended to be scary, it did scare you.

1509
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:31,840
It worked.

1510
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,920
Therefore, it was not a pleasant emotion.

1511
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:36,520
I'm impressed, but I am glad it is God.

1512
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:41,920
Tony Baxter said that there was a period of time

1513
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:45,040
where they did that on Haunted Mansion.

1514
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:48,280
There was like a one actor in the hallway or something,

1515
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:50,400
and he would just jump out in front of the car.

1516
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,520
I wonder if they still do that at Skull Island.

1517
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,400
That was a big in the marketing for for Kong Skull Island

1518
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:01,240
is that there were going to be scare actors roaming the queue.

1519
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:02,000
Yeah.

1520
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,680
And there were the last time I last time I did the main queue anyway, there was.

1521
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,960
Like I said, I'm always getting the express because I don't

1522
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:12,200
now that I've seen the things once, I don't need to see them again and again

1523
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,400
in terms of the queue experience.

1524
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:18,560
But there's a lot of cool stuff in the in the Kong Skull Island queue.

1525
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,600
And one of them was a very scary live actor.

1526
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:22,240
Yeah.

1527
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:23,160
Thanks.

1528
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:27,000
I think I missed that when I I think I did the pass.

1529
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,560
Yeah, he would like poke out of holes like that were in the queue.

1530
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,160
Like it was like he would just go, you know, it's just like a scary,

1531
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,160
like problematic native.

1532
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:38,840
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

1533
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:40,880
That's I will say I would have been scared.

1534
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:45,600
But Matt, when you were last here, I was not doing fright fests and horror nights.

1535
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,160
But now I'm into haunts.

1536
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,200
So that's happened, too.

1537
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:50,640
So I think I like the idea of that.

1538
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,000
But I think you got you.

1539
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,400
Boys are growing up.

1540
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,680
That is what is happening.

1541
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,160
Really are. Tell us we're good.

1542
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:57,240
Tell us we've done good.

1543
01:18:57,240 --> 01:18:58,520
You're doing so good.

1544
01:18:58,520 --> 01:18:59,920
You're doing such a great jobs.

1545
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,800
And I'm so proud of you guys.

1546
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,200
This is what I needed.

1547
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:08,120
And yeah, but Jason, have you bucked up and gotten over anything like that?

1548
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,840
I think I've had some breakthroughs in therapy, but other than that,

1549
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,160
I think my theme park going hasn't really changed that much.

1550
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,800
Great. OK, well, at least emotionally, things are on the up.

1551
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:20,280
You know, I'm trying my best.

1552
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:21,960
Oh, good.

1553
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,040
What are we what are we missed here?

1554
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,040
We're talking.

1555
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:28,120
Yeah, we were talking about

1556
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,520
Rise of the Resistance.

1557
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,640
Scott Trowbridge was the lead on this ride as well,

1558
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:36,600
in addition to being the lead on Rise of the Resistance.

1559
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:37,040
Genius.

1560
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:37,360
Whole.

1561
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,120
Giles's Edge.

1562
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,160
I stand.

1563
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:44,560
The only thing about Galaxy's Edge is I think that Laniam Falcon is a fucking flop.

1564
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,680
But but Rise of the Resistance, he did an amazing job.

1565
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:49,520
Yeah, it was.

1566
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:54,880
I think it was hard for me to say or hear phrases like that at the time.

1567
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:58,200
And now just as the months go on, I don't it.

1568
01:19:58,440 --> 01:19:59,520
You have to.

1569
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,200
It's a flop. It's OK.

1570
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,040
It's I don't know if I can even say it.

1571
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,480
It's still so I can't I almost can't accept it.

1572
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:09,440
Something I was looking forward to so much is a flop.

1573
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:11,680
Maybe I was a little relieved to hear you say it.

1574
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,760
It was a really ambitious idea,

1575
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,840
but it was not.

1576
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,720
Executed well.

1577
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:23,160
We need new levels, we need new places.

1578
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,000
I don't want to do no more of these crates.

1579
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:25,680
I don't want to crash.

1580
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:26,560
All of that.

1581
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,360
It also should just be, you know what?

1582
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:30,280
Just give people the Star Wars.

1583
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:31,600
You know what I mean?

1584
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,720
Like we don't know this character.

1585
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:36,440
Like we don't really have a lot of time to get to know him.

1586
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:39,520
The jobs for a lot of people in that cockpit.

1587
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,280
The jobs are really stupid.

1588
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:44,440
Like if you happen to be in the last row and you're like, what, the engineer?

1589
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,960
Like it's so lame.

1590
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,920
I think Gunner is worse than engineer, though, because Gunner is just like,

1591
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,440
what am I even doing here?

1592
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:54,960
And I have to work very hard.

1593
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,520
It's hard to see.

1594
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:57,120
You know what I mean?

1595
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:00,520
Like it's just like visually not appealing.

1596
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,960
The worlds don't seem super different from each other.

1597
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:08,040
At the end, something I really hate is when you you stop the ride and he says,

1598
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:11,040
it appears there's something you've brought back with you on the ship.

1599
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:12,960
And then it's nothing.

1600
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,080
And you don't even see anything.

1601
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,040
Nothing happens.

1602
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,800
It's just like blue balls the entire time.

1603
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,600
There's nothing in the queue.

1604
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:22,640
It's not interesting to look at.

1605
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:26,080
It's there's no characters that we enjoy or appreciate.

1606
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:32,240
And for that to be the lead of the entire land that was launching the land,

1607
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,560
it was really, really, really whack.

1608
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,760
And then thank God the rise of the resistance kind of capitalized on all the promise

1609
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:42,360
because it really tied the land together in every way which it needed

1610
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:47,320
because the Millennium Force, sorry, Millennium Falcon Ride was.

1611
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:52,800
I yes, I feel like, though, I do feel like it may be not impossible

1612
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,800
to at least take it up a letter grade.

1613
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:58,280
I do think you could probably make some tweaks

1614
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:02,600
and it won't be perfect, but it will maybe be a more consistent experience

1615
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:04,520
because because and we don't need to get off.

1616
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:05,640
I think we've said this before.

1617
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:09,960
Like Star Tours has moments that you remember.

1618
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:10,960
There's drama.

1619
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,560
There's like there's something happening.

1620
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,680
There's a compelling reason for you to be there.

1621
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:18,040
You're in a giant monster's mouth and you remember it getting off the ride.

1622
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,320
That was crazy. The tongue hit the windshield.

1623
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:24,400
There's like comedy and like Star Wars is a wacky kids adventure movie.

1624
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:28,720
Let's not forget what Star Wars is, which is their sci fi action

1625
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:31,720
adventure soap operas for kids. So.

1626
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:36,920
Why are we taking ourselves so fucking seriously with this Millennium Falcon Ride?

1627
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:39,560
Like it just feels like not fun.

1628
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:44,360
Yeah, yeah, it might be a lot of the Rex appeal for me is that Rex is a pure

1629
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:47,600
comedy character and it's not ponderous like

1630
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:52,440
some of the elements of Star Wars I vibe with less.

1631
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,720
But it's also like.

1632
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:58,800
The scoring of it all, what to compare to what?

1633
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,560
You know what I mean? Like, I don't know what this what this score means.

1634
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,560
They never tell you what's a good score.

1635
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,400
Absolutely. What did I do correctly?

1636
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:09,320
You know what I mean? Like what was it that got me this point score that did it?

1637
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,480
And it's like you'd have to do it a bunch of times, like I guess.

1638
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:14,280
It's like the men in black of it all.

1639
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:17,600
Yeah, but I get the men in black of it all because you've told me how to shoot

1640
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,240
these aliens. I know what I'm doing. I'm killing aliens.

1641
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:24,000
I know what happens at the end because you get like Galaxy, the vendor, cosmic,

1642
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,640
whatever, blah, blah, blah. Yeah.

1643
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:30,080
On this, it's like they put a number in front of you in a weird font

1644
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:31,800
and then you leave.

1645
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:35,560
And like, there's the one cool touch of like the Millennium Falcon is obviously

1646
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,960
beat up and like technically failing as you leave.

1647
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:42,560
But other than that, it's like this was really garbage, like

1648
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,760
because I don't understand what's happening.

1649
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:47,800
Men in black simple hit the red button.

1650
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:51,720
Rip-torn screams that you hit the red button like you could simplify

1651
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:55,640
the Millennium Falcon down to everyone hits a button once

1652
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,800
and then everyone gets it is satisfying to touch the buttons.

1653
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,280
Yeah. You have to dumb it down for me.

1654
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:07,520
I think kind of smart 30 year old who's invested in theme parks and this IP.

1655
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:09,640
What the fuck is anyone else getting from it?

1656
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:12,480
You know what I mean? I'm just like, who is leaving that park saying,

1657
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:17,080
a highlight for me in Disneyland was Millennium Falcon.

1658
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:21,600
I don't think any as a six year old flying, like doing the actual flying

1659
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,800
and getting to go work.

1660
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,800
I guess, I guess.

1661
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:28,120
I think that's the probably the best thing you can do in it.

1662
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:32,160
I mean, I spent a lot of time on BATU last year

1663
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:36,560
and I rode this single rider with so many families

1664
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,360
and the confusion.

1665
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,320
Yeah. Every time Grandma was.

1666
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,600
I was always next to Grandma in the engineer's seat

1667
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,160
and she did not know what was going on.

1668
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:48,840
Oh, and it's like, I think they had a lot.

1669
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,000
They had a meeting early on.

1670
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,080
They were like, well, everybody's going to be fighting to do something in the cockpit.

1671
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,520
False. Not true.

1672
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:56,360
That is not going to happen.

1673
01:24:56,360 --> 01:25:00,000
Also, like what what does happen is like your experiences

1674
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:03,240
are dictated by what everyone else does.

1675
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:06,760
And it's like if you're in there with like another family of three,

1676
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:10,040
if you're like in a three and you get with another three, it's like

1677
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:12,520
that's like conflict.

1678
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:15,880
Yeah. And I wanted I want to deal with conflict with people

1679
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:18,920
that are like at Walt Disney World's Hollywood Studios.

1680
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:20,240
Like, I really don't.

1681
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:23,800
You're like at a Thanksgiving dinner of people you don't know who are

1682
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,120
just having a real rough year.

1683
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,600
The ball dropped completely, completely.

1684
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,440
Boy, boy. Yeah, I was.

1685
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,040
There were kids I was trying to gun effectively,

1686
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:36,200
and there were kids who just driving the Falcon into the dirt.

1687
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,840
Yeah, because again, like they have no incentive to not.

1688
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:42,080
Yeah. Anyway.

1689
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,040
Boy, I think they can fix.

1690
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:46,120
I think it can be fixed slightly.

1691
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:48,320
I like America, right?

1692
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:50,320
So that's a different story.

1693
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,640
I hate these video game rides.

1694
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:55,520
Like unless it's really clear, like Midway Mania or

1695
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:01,440
like Men in Black, I don't like I'm not super psyched

1696
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:04,000
about this Spider-Man thing that's going to happen in California.

1697
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,160
I'm worried. Yeah.

1698
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,560
I don't I don't know why is why is it not just a ride?

1699
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:09,600
I don't understand.

1700
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:10,560
I don't care.

1701
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:14,200
I don't need to be actively involved in it with a gun in my hands.

1702
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,840
Like, in fact, I reject it.

1703
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,720
Just put me give me take me on the journey.

1704
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:23,200
Well, we've said or I've said, I think I'm a little worried about the new

1705
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:28,040
the new version of you are the thing that's apparently coming to Avengers

1706
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:30,560
because it's like you train, you suit up.

1707
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:33,240
And I'm like, I as a kid, I wanted to be Iron Man,

1708
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:36,400
I wanted to be Iron Man, but I don't want to be me as a superhero.

1709
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:38,440
Why are you making me do work?

1710
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:39,760
Yeah, I don't.

1711
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:43,160
I've heard somebody claims that it's going to be cool.

1712
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:45,040
You're going to lose somebody. Who is that?

1713
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,320
Oh, we have inside. We have some insiders.

1714
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:49,200
Got our people to, you know.

1715
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:50,920
OK, so what are they saying?

1716
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:53,800
They said that it's going to be very cool how the web

1717
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:57,520
when you do your little Spider-Man motion, that it's going to be very cool

1718
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:01,320
and it works really well when you're shooting webs at whatever the nanobots

1719
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:02,480
or whatever they are.

1720
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:06,280
OK, but I also think like do this for 30 seconds and go,

1721
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:08,600
oh, I'm a little tired.

1722
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,360
Yeah, anybody with carpal tunnel.

1723
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:13,840
I get so exhausted on Midway Mania, I get my wrist.

1724
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:14,440
Oh, yeah.

1725
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:15,480
Rounds.

1726
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:18,520
It's like that thing when like the web part of your thumb

1727
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:22,200
and your your pointer finger start like stinging, you know that?

1728
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,280
Yeah, yes.

1729
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,800
I it's and I like me when we may allow, but I am by the end

1730
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,520
when you're doing the thing where you're supposed to when they're flying off

1731
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,080
the little mine cart section, I am dead.

1732
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,800
My my arm is dead.

1733
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:36,160
Yeah. And in between the scenes, I get so like,

1734
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:38,160
OK, got to stretch, got to limber up.

1735
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:41,520
Wait, you do do like hand yoga here.

1736
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:45,400
Speaking of that area of the park, like when I when I went at truly six

1737
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:48,680
in the morning to do Rise of the Resistance, because I was one of those people

1738
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,920
that did, I'm sure you guys were as well.

1739
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:53,960
Like, yeah, early, early as crack of dawn by myself.

1740
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:59,960
I was I literally was in group 10.

1741
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:05,000
I was like, I went on right away, but I had enough time to go do the slinky dog,

1742
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,760
which also gets a crazy line and it wasn't one of my fast pass elections.

1743
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:11,240
I liked it. Oh, yeah.

1744
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:13,680
Yes. Yeah. It's really fun.

1745
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:16,760
It's such a lot. It is so charming.

1746
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:21,720
It's so, you know, it's not like it's thrilling, but like it's fun.

1747
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:24,480
There's so much scenery to go through that second launch.

1748
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,600
I mean, like, it's really cute.

1749
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:28,000
I love the spinning rings.

1750
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,320
Like, I like that slinky dog. You can hear him talk.

1751
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:34,960
Yeah, it felt like like, again, like a really good, well executed idea.

1752
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:36,960
And I'm not surprised that it's so popular.

1753
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:41,440
So relaxing to be on, like maybe the one of the smoothest roller coasters ever.

1754
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:45,360
Yeah, definitely. Like in the same way, Big Thunder is like I could see it being

1755
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:50,360
like a scared nine year old who's tall enough will go on it and love it.

1756
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,080
And it'll be the first coaster.

1757
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:55,320
So it's like really the age range is high.

1758
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:58,160
Yeah, it feels classic. Yeah. Yeah.

1759
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,920
Or or a, you know,

1760
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:05,800
34 year old was still one of his first launch coasters ever,

1761
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:08,240
as it was at the time.

1762
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:11,120
I got brave enough to do slinky dog. Can you believe it?

1763
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:14,320
I mean, we got to get you on the Jurassic coaster when it opens, though.

1764
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:17,240
That sounds great. And I don't have to be afraid of these.

1765
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:21,240
I used to when this podcast started, I was like, well, we'd talk about a ride.

1766
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:25,040
And I'd say, but that's off limits to me because I cannot launch.

1767
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,680
And I got over. Take off your shackles.

1768
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:29,640
You got to be brave enough to do this.

1769
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:33,120
I mean, this Jurassic coaster, I think it's going to be really good.

1770
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:35,480
Sounds fantastic. Yeah.

1771
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:37,560
Yeah. Possibly.

1772
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:41,040
Do you do you think it could take the title from Hagrid's

1773
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,480
as Hagrid's took you think?

1774
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:45,240
I think it will. I think it will. Wow.

1775
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,520
Yeah, I don't think I'm giving it no thought.

1776
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,720
It's been like a sleeper to me.

1777
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:51,320
I haven't been looking at the updates like you guys.

1778
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:55,080
And so I'm amazed to hear it's like what's great about Hagrid's is it's like,

1779
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:58,080
yes, it has seven launches, but it's a family coaster.

1780
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:03,920
This is like an adult coaster, which is themed to an adult popcorn movie,

1781
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:08,680
which I which I, you know, like the threat of dinosaurs ripping you to pieces.

1782
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:12,200
Like, of course, kids can enjoy it and like it, but I like it.

1783
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:17,560
I like that they, you know, matched a type of ride to a type of film.

1784
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:19,360
And I feel like that is universal.

1785
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:22,720
You know what I mean? Like that is something that Disney would never do.

1786
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,720
Like Disney is never going to make you feel like,

1787
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:28,160
um, you know, a dinosaur is going to kill you.

1788
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:32,960
And in fact, when they did do that, they backed off of it and made that ride so much more tame.

1789
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:38,520
Like, but but I was really respecting them for Countdown to Extinction because it was so chaotic

1790
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:45,600
and so rough and so dark and so scary that when they backed off of it, I was like, this is why.

1791
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:48,960
And when they backed off Alien Encounter, you know what I mean?

1792
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,560
Like, just like they they they they've like really.

1793
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:56,040
And maybe they're going to go back to it now that they have, like, you know,

1794
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:59,000
the IP that they have in there, like so into that.

1795
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
But I don't know. I just felt like they were

1796
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,240
a little lame, a little lame when Universal wasn't.

1797
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:10,440
And so I think that, like, I mean, the fact that we're getting a launch into a top hat,

1798
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:12,320
like that's great to me.

1799
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:18,520
And that inversion that's right out of the top hat, it's like a like a it's like a serious airtime,

1800
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:21,280
like a corkscrew or whatever.

1801
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,960
It looks really, really, really, really, really, really.

1802
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:26,320
Since you brought that can't tend to extinction, can I just get your eyes on something?

1803
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:27,560
I'm going to screen share here.

1804
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:30,560
Do you think that baby Aladar is cute?

1805
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,920
I think that's so cute.

1806
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:34,720
Yes. I'll never win.

1807
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,400
I'll never win.

1808
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:40,560
Nothing invested in this bit.

1809
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,480
This is a fight has been going on.

1810
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:43,560
We've been fighting about this.

1811
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:44,760
I think it's so cute.

1812
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:47,760
Like, if I saw it in my apartment, I'd probably be like, I'd kill it.

1813
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:50,280
But I do think that it's so cute.

1814
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:51,560
Now that I know what it is.

1815
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:52,480
Understandable.

1816
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:56,280
Scott, I do appreciate you, you bringing up something cute.

1817
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:59,280
Of course, Imhotep the mummy.

1818
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,680
Yeah, I appreciate you.

1819
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:04,960
I don't know why. I think he's cute in the window shatterer, too.

1820
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:06,920
I like that he's like miniature.

1821
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:10,560
I think it's the fact that he's like a little he's a he's like a miniature pony.

1822
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:13,120
I think that's that's exactly how I feel about him.

1823
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:17,280
Can I give you a little a little piece of information about the animatronic?

1824
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:21,680
Yes. Universal claims Imhotep is the most sophisticated animatronic robot ever

1825
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:25,080
developed. This is obviously at the time for a theme park capable of lifting

1826
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:27,760
two thousand five hundred pounds.

1827
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,560
His arms are hollowed out stainless steel that can be programmed

1828
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:34,280
to perform motions four times faster than any other theme park robot.

1829
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,480
Wow. And that are six times cuter.

1830
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:41,760
Which is why it's literally frozen in time, not working,

1831
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:44,080
because they probably bit off way more they could chew.

1832
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,400
It doesn't matter that it can do any of those things.

1833
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,440
It doesn't work.

1834
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:50,400
So it's like that's the only thing about it is I do wish they could like

1835
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:53,080
go back in there and refurb the audio animatronics.

1836
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:55,320
But I actually think they'll.

1837
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,880
This is controversial, but I think that they'll re theme

1838
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:00,040
and do a new attraction before they do that.

1839
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:01,400
That's what I was going to ask.

1840
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:04,880
Do you think would you be upset about this or would you feel like

1841
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:08,440
I it's had its time and I trust Universal to bring us something better?

1842
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:10,640
I think it has less than 10 years.

1843
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:12,600
Well, yeah, yeah.

1844
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:15,720
I could see them, you know,

1845
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:19,920
I think it could use a little fresh coat paint, a facelift.

1846
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:23,720
But I do think it's it's pretty popular.

1847
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:26,080
And I don't quite know.

1848
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:31,160
I mean, Fast and the Furious, a Fast and the Furious ride done like this,

1849
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:33,280
I think would have been a big hit.

1850
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:37,040
I think that they just they just fucked up with Fast and the Furious.

1851
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,640
And it was because they were trying to save money.

1852
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:40,600
But because they already had the Hollywood

1853
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:44,280
well, the footage sets and yeah.

1854
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:47,080
Yeah. And I think that they were they got such a bad response to that,

1855
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:50,880
which is I think what actually was the idea behind Hagrid's

1856
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:54,080
is they were like, we need something big that's practical.

1857
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:57,160
That is going to, you know, really give

1858
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:01,880
classic energy, because when the Tonight Show

1859
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:05,880
ride happened and the Fast and the Furious ride happened

1860
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:08,560
and they happened so close together, it was just like,

1861
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:10,280
what are we doing this for?

1862
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:13,800
Like you you carbon copied Transformers from Spider-Man.

1863
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:15,880
That system already.

1864
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:19,680
And you're now doing this with King Kong and Fast and the Furious.

1865
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,520
And you're you're doing a Tonight Show IP.

1866
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:25,440
Like there's something wrong.

1867
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:26,880
There's just something off.

1868
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,800
And it didn't feel like the same park anymore.

1869
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:32,320
And there's also so much Harry Potter that it kind of felt like.

1870
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:36,480
And their IPs are getting old, like they still had Terminator at the time,

1871
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:40,320
which was an older IP, and they had like, you know, Shrek,

1872
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,120
which is like something that I think over time,

1873
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:44,200
people are caring less and less about.

1874
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:48,200
So they were really in like a tough spot, I think just in terms of IP.

1875
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:51,560
So I think that I would agree with you that the ride will stay there

1876
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:57,360
as long as they don't create new IP or find a way to make existing IP fresh.

1877
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:59,640
And that's going to be an improvement on the ride.

1878
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:03,600
But they do seem like they want to do this thing of every single year

1879
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:06,480
something gets new put in the park. Yeah.

1880
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:09,240
Which they've been pretty good about doing.

1881
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:14,440
And I think that the thing about ET is they've got a problem with Spielberg

1882
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:18,040
because he says don't take it down.

1883
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:20,960
They have like a relationship with him where he where he doesn't want that ride

1884
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:22,040
taken down.

1885
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:26,920
And I also think it does give you the classic universal movie energy,

1886
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:31,840
whereas like, you know, the Simpsons doesn't.

1887
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:36,000
Men in Black, that movie's aging,

1888
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,920
but it moves it moves crowds.

1889
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:40,920
And then like, what else do you have?

1890
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:43,800
I mean, they're not going to they're not going to take the Fast and Furious ride

1891
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:46,840
out, even if it's bad, while that franchise is still going.

1892
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,680
The Mummy franchise is not still going. Yeah.

1893
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:54,480
You know, tonight show ride, like as shitty as it is, it feeds the tonight show brand.

1894
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,320
So they'll keep that.

1895
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:58,640
Born Identity is new.

1896
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:02,200
Shrek, that 3D space is is is going to be a 3D show for whatever.

1897
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:04,600
It'll probably be like Kung Fu Panda, whatever is doing well.

1898
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:07,560
And then you have Despicable Me, which is like, you know,

1899
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:10,200
you can't do much with that space besides that.

1900
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:15,080
So it's like, what else is there in the park really to replace?

1901
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:18,320
Which they said they were committed to doing.

1902
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:21,120
So this is not something I want to happen,

1903
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:24,320
but it's something that I think we need to get used to the idea of.

1904
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:27,760
What do they have? It's like

1905
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:30,400
Peacock Saved by the Bell reboot.

1906
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:32,800
Can that become a coaster?

1907
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:36,960
Well, yeah, I mean, they do have other Nintendo stuff.

1908
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:40,960
Right. Which will become its own little mini lands.

1909
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,600
And I've also heard a rumor that they might have to dump

1910
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,080
Nintendo land in one of the existing parks.

1911
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:49,280
Yeah, because there's a contract.

1912
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:53,200
So they like that like Barney and Fievel, like Yank Barney and five.

1913
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:55,600
Well, that was the original plan. Yeah.

1914
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:57,520
So that might still happen.

1915
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:00,760
You're no that could be my dead body in.

1916
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:04,240
Woody Woodpecker's Barnstormer.

1917
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:05,720
What's the no, that's goofy.

1918
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:08,920
That area is so large, like I'm never back there

1919
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:11,000
because I'm never going to see Barney.

1920
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,640
But like that entire the entire Curious George area

1921
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:18,760
and the Barney like stage is huge.

1922
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:21,080
Like I went back that back there for Halloween Horror Nights.

1923
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:24,160
And I was like, there's like a whole maze back there and the Barney thing

1924
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:26,000
and the Curious George and Fievel's playground.

1925
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,760
And I'm like, oh, there's a ton of space here.

1926
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:30,920
So it made sense that that was going to be

1927
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:33,480
Super Nintendo land.

1928
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:36,400
But then when they were moving Super Nintendo land to the new park,

1929
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:40,200
that was ultimately going to be a Pokemon thing. Right.

1930
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:43,880
So you guys know about the rumors that that was going to be Pokemon.

1931
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:46,600
Super Nintendo land was going to be in the new park

1932
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:49,080
and that they were going to phase out Poseidon's Fury

1933
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:52,080
and the Lost Continent area to be a Zelda thing.

1934
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:55,360
Yeah. Oh, interesting.

1935
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:57,000
But now I don't think so.

1936
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,560
Yeah, I think that's all.

1937
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,720
But I think, yeah, they think they just have to have some sort of Nintendo

1938
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:03,000
presence in Orlando by a certain day.

1939
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:07,320
But obviously, that time frame is all different.

1940
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:10,720
But I don't know. Yeah, because of money, will they like cram

1941
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:14,920
some Nintendo things somewhere and not do a full themed like Zelda land,

1942
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:18,960
which is my prediction is that what will happen is.

1943
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:22,960
By the by the early next year,

1944
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,440
it'll be announced that Epic Universe is not happening

1945
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:28,320
or it's postponed indefinitely, and they're going to do

1946
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:33,600
Nintendo land in universal in Universal Studios.

1947
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:37,120
And I think they might try to find a way to repurpose something

1948
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:40,720
that they were going to do in the new park with Harry Potter,

1949
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:41,920
a fantastic beast or whatever.

1950
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:44,760
I think they'll try to do something in the Fear Factor area, maybe. Right.

1951
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:48,280
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's got to be.

1952
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:52,160
Yeah, that was one of the most unpleasant theme park live shows

1953
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:54,560
I have ever seen.

1954
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:58,040
Is that relevant, though, because the host of Fear Factor

1955
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:01,240
is the biggest figure in all of media?

1956
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:05,280
Well, now, when you go to see that Fear Factor show, just a guy

1957
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:10,160
sits on the stage and tells you about DMT and like

1958
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,240
mixed martial arts and all of that.

1959
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,680
Move to Texas, bro.

1960
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:17,200
I'm out of here. Texas.

1961
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:22,120
And he also he actually the big finale of the show is he says a lot of transphobics.

1962
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:24,680
Yeah. Yeah.

1963
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:28,320
And the Florida crowd, they go wild, wild.

1964
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:32,480
Not the people listening to this who are good.

1965
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:35,000
And we know that. So just to say that.

1966
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:37,840
Yeah. But if you're saying transphobic slurs, you're not good.

1967
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,560
Oh, no. Then you're then you're not.

1968
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:41,440
These are just all right. These are different people.

1969
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,760
I'm just going to keep I'm just going to keep spinning holes if I don't

1970
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:46,120
stop talking at some point in time.

1971
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:48,560
Do we make it our way at the end, Jason?

1972
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:52,680
Well, I have a very odd that this has not come up yet.

1973
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:56,240
But since the you know, the setup of the Florida ride is that there's a,

1974
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:59,160
you know, the there's a curse, the curse.

1975
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:00,800
Everyone's worried about the curse.

1976
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:03,120
They're all wearing Magi medallions.

1977
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:06,720
And then, of course, poor Reggie learns the curse is real.

1978
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:09,000
Do you guys know the story?

1979
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:11,120
I read about this years ago.

1980
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:14,200
I could not find the original article, but I found out the facts about it.

1981
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:18,280
Do you know the story about Stephen Summers cursed house he bought?

1982
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:22,480
What director of the mummy, Stephen Summers, the director, cursed house?

1983
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:24,400
Yes. Now bear with me.

1984
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:25,400
There's a bit of a leak.

1985
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:31,920
So in 2007, he, Stephen Summers and his family bought a house

1986
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:35,320
in Malibu for 10 million dollars.

1987
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:39,320
The previous occupants of this house were the newly

1988
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:42,520
read's Britney Spears and Kevin Federline.

1989
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:46,280
Mr. Popo's Al himself, Kevin.

1990
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:48,880
Oh, yeah, of course. Wow.

1991
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:53,280
They put a lot of money into fixing up this house

1992
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:59,960
and put it on the market, asking for he paid 10 million initially.

1993
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:04,120
They were trying they were asking for it for 15.95 million

1994
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:06,080
because they had put so much work into it.

1995
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:11,920
It sat on the market for three years and eventually sold for 11.45 million.

1996
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:16,200
And simultaneously with that, Stephen Summers career

1997
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:18,520
as a director was really slowing down.

1998
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:24,640
He did the G.I. Joe movie and then the adaptation of the Stephen

1999
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:26,920
Coons books, Odd Thomas.

2000
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:29,920
And that was kind of the last we've heard of Stephen Summers.

2001
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:34,480
So I remember coming across this years ago and the writer chronicling

2002
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:38,920
the foibles of this house was like, this house might be cursed.

2003
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:41,680
Britney Spears and Kevin Federline, Stephen Summers,

2004
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:45,920
like, it's not good energy at this house.

2005
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:49,520
Wait, he's blaming the house on the career falling apart.

2006
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:55,040
Like that, just like if you're superstitious, like I wouldn't buy this house.

2007
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:58,120
There's no way you're a white man in Hollywood who fails.

2008
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:00,000
It can't possibly be you.

2009
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,400
It's got to be. It's got to be your home that's cursed.

2010
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:05,120
It's got to be your eleven point ninety five million dollar home.

2011
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:07,240
There's not even a ghost story.

2012
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:10,960
No, it's just a very weird connection between Kevin Federline

2013
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:14,040
and Stephen Summers and his directed career kind of slowing down.

2014
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:16,400
But his career was bright.

2015
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,480
She had the whole world ahead of him.

2016
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:21,640
And then this house, this cursed house, cursed house.

2017
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:23,480
The curse was real.

2018
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:28,560
Well, Britney Spears, like in the early 2000s, her career also kind of getting weird.

2019
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:31,640
So like the poor woman was through the ringer.

2020
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:35,560
Her plan. She was saying this house is fine.

2021
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,680
All right. Let's just let me as the gay here just get on record by saying

2022
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:43,280
she actually hit her creative peak in the early aughts.

2023
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:47,560
OK, because the Blackout album was a piece of art.

2024
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:52,000
And never forget in the zone and also never forget that she

2025
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:56,160
revitalized what it meant to be a pop star in Vegas. OK.

2026
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:59,160
People before her were like, it's the sunset of my career.

2027
01:42:59,160 --> 01:43:00,120
I'm going to Vegas.

2028
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:01,920
Britney Spears said, I'm Britney Spears.

2029
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:03,960
I'm like 35. I'm going to Vegas.

2030
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:07,760
And now you see all the girls in the peaks of their careers going to Vegas.

2031
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:09,840
I'm not saying the work is bad.

2032
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:11,800
You know, I'm not saying the words are good.

2033
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,360
When does Perfume come out?

2034
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:16,640
Oh, bitch, that's been out.

2035
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:18,040
No, I know. But when is that? When is it?

2036
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:19,920
When did it come out? When does when did it come out?

2037
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:23,680
That was on Britney Jean, which was like 2000.

2038
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:27,840
Third. So that's even later.

2039
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:29,360
Perfume is even later.

2040
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:31,680
I'm such a big fan of I know Sia wrote it.

2041
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:35,120
Yes, I really respect you for knowing Perfume.

2042
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:38,720
I think Perfume is one of the best pop songs. I'm not even kidding.

2043
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:41,840
And she famously sounds a thousand years old on it.

2044
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:44,000
She sounds like she sounds in Motep's age.

2045
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,720
It's like the track Perfume is like Jolene.

2046
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:49,560
Like it's like the same like the feeling.

2047
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:54,440
Yeah, it's like you feel the say you feel the emotion

2048
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:56,320
very strongly in both those songs.

2049
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:58,760
And you do it as you can.

2050
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,880
Can anyone? I don't know the song well enough.

2051
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:05,640
I could do it myself, but so I wait for

2052
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:10,480
a call and I try to act natural.

2053
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:13,880
Have you been thinking about her?

2054
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:16,120
About me?

2055
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:18,920
Work, bitch, for all eternity.

2056
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:22,480
There's your title of that.

2057
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:24,080
Yeah, there it is.

2058
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:26,520
Awesome. Well, I think I think on that note,

2059
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:30,560
on the note that the curse is real of the house, at least.

2060
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:33,160
Matt Rogers survived.

2061
01:44:33,160 --> 01:44:35,640
Podcasts the ride.

2062
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:39,080
There is no escape, but we'll try to get out through the gift shop.

2063
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:41,400
Is there anything you would like to put?

2064
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:43,720
Oh, I just put my podcast, Last Culture East,

2065
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:46,160
that's where I sometimes I'm allowed to talk about things like this,

2066
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:49,320
although when I do, it's it gets real insular.

2067
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,960
So but you can listen to that.

2068
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:54,160
I co-host it with my best friend, Bowen Yang.

2069
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:58,120
Is he is he anti theme park or is it just you know, very pro, very pro.

2070
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:00,800
It's just that once I get going, I can take up a lot of space with that stuff.

2071
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:02,320
So I have to check myself.

2072
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:05,400
And then I have plenty of space here, plenty of expansion pads.

2073
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:08,720
So I want to go at the end of the month in September.

2074
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:11,520
I have a show coming out on HBO Max that I'm hosting called Hot Dog,

2075
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:14,200
which you mentioned before, which is a dog grooming competition show.

2076
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:16,600
So I'm really excited about that.

2077
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:19,520
Wow. Wow. And I have my show on Quibi called Game Show.

2078
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:21,880

Yes. Yeah.

01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:44,360
And I think I speak for all of us when I say we would have enjoyed this podcast

2085

a lot more if we'd all gotten our cups of coffee.
