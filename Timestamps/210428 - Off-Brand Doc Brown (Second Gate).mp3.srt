1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,300
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,600
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate,

3
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,160
where today we discuss a true pillar

4
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,780
of the Universal Studios experience,

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,080
the possibility of seeing a guy

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,340
who kind of resembles Doc Brown.

7
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,080
I'm Scott Gardner, I'm Great Scott Gardner, right?

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,640
Sure, and Mike Carlson joins us as always.

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,220
Yes, I was, we were just discussing

10
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,220
how we're gonna start this episode.

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,120
I would have just been like,

12
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,600
Great Scott, this is the best I can do.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,000
And then we would have segued into that, so.

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,220
Bernie Sanders showed up on the record.

15
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,700
Jeff Garland.

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,800
You know, it's a hard impression to do

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,700
was gonna be my teaching moment out of trying to do that.

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,180
It's a hard character to play, I think,

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,580
exactly how the original person did.

20
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,680
Anyway, Jason Sheridan.

21
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,620
It is, and I think that's good to know at the beginning

22
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,000
as we discuss, you know, I guess in general,

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,100
like walk around Doc Brown's at Universal Studios,

24
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,300
because the temptation will certainly be

25
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,660
to make fun of the lack of accuracy.

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,100
However, like, could any of us do it?

27
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,560
I don't think we could.

28
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,260
I think we would not pass that audition.

29
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,500
We should try a few lines here and there on this episode,

30
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,080
but I don't think, I mean, I didn't spend weeks on this,

31
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,720
but yeah, I think that it's a very tough thing to do.

32
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,440
I also think there's a problem

33
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,880
when you're doing a character

34
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,580
that's been so, you know, burned in people's minds.

35
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,620
It's so iconic.

36
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,780
Rarely do you get like a Carl Urban,

37
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,580
McCoy Bones from Star Trek, where you go,

38
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,060
oh my God, he's doing the exact voice

39
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,560
and the exact attitude, and that's perfect.

40
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,380
Wow.

41
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,480
What to, Carl Urban?

42
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,500
Carl Urban plays Dr.

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,780
McCoy in the J.

44
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:13,940
J.

45
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,600
Abrams Star Trek.

46
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,160
Oh.

47
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,100
And I think widely regarded as like,

48
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,880
whoa, he really got the essence of the original character

49
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,240
of DeForest Kelly's iconic performance

50
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,280
as Dr.

51
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,460
McCoy on Star Trek, but it's hard.

52
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,580
It's very hard and often impossible, I would think.

53
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,160
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

54
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,940
Yeah, it's very specific.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,920
And I think that's sort of why we landed on doing this

56
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,280
as an episode is just that it's funny

57
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,940
when Universal Studios has had things

58
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,440
where, you know, you do associate this part

59
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,560
with a specific person, the person who played the part,

60
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,760
that's why, because a person played it,

61
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,040
and how willing Universal has been to just have like,

62
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,160
I don't know, a guy, which is a wig, yeah, sure.

63
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,500
Of course, yeah, a wig.

64
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,660
Could it should be a nice wig?

65
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,880
No, I don't know, that doesn't matter.

66
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,320
That's fine.

67
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,100
So it's like white hair.

68
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,860
That's like the easiest kind of wig to do.

69
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,840
So just grab whatever you can find

70
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,020
and throw somebody out there.

71
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,420
Should be tall, doesn't have to be, it would help,

72
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,340
but old, young, doesn't matter.

73
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,380
They should be older than 20.

74
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,600
If we have a 20-year-old working here,

75
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,700
put him in a Shrek suit or a bob, a minion.

76
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,900
But, you know, so like a little bit of, yeah,

77
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,440
they should be, you know, older, north of 21.

78
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,720
Yeah.

79
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,880
That's, yeah, so the book, yeah,

80
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,180
there must be so many different bullet points in the book,

81
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,200
in the Universal book about Doc Brown,

82
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,520
and they're all what Scott just said,

83
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,420
plus five more pages of just what, yeah.

84
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,480
And if this is, and if any of that stuff doesn't apply,

85
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,520
that doesn't matter.

86
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,820
Let a child do it, we don't care.

87
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,900
Yeah.

88
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,160
Let a seven-year-old do it.

89
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,400
We kept throwing back and forth between us

90
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,180
the phrase off-brand Doc Brown,

91
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,940
but like technically on-brand in terms of this

92
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,440
is the corporate intellectual property holder

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
doing this and giving the okay and paying for the materials

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,940
and hiring the person to do it.

95
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,300
But off-brand and like this execution seems off

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,380
in a way that like, you know,

97
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,740
kind of Jack Sparrow wandering around Hollywood studios.

98
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,740
It's like, well, anyone can kind of do the like,

99
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,780
oh, hello, lovely, you know, whoever can do that.

100
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,260
But with Jack Sparrow,

101
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,980
anytime I've seen him or most of the times I've seen him,

102
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,820
and it's not a lot, it hasn't been in Disneyland in a while,

103
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,420
the Jack Sparrow costume they give the performer is good.

104
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,000
And the makeup.

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,500
That does a lot of the heavy lifting.

106
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:48,040
Yeah.

107
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,980
The makeup is pretty good.

108
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,360
As Scott was saying, the difference here is it really feels

109
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,040
like the Doc Brown just went to the Dollar General

110
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,120
and found a lab coat and they like spray painted

111
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,760
like the shades, the sunglasses.

112
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,480
And then they're like, all right,

113
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,540
did you work on the impression?

114
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,160
And the performer said, a little bit.

115
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,020
And they go, ah, fine.

116
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,900
He's loud, right?

117
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,060
Yes, you're right.

118
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,320
He does not speak softly.

119
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,680
This just don't be like Steven Wright

120
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,020
and this should go great.

121
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,640
Yeah.

122
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,640
I think there's a, I think that, I mean, it is harder too,

123
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,540
because Jack Sparrow obviously has like a butt

124
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,600
and beard mustache, headband.

125
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,280
There's a lot of stuff on the face.

126
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,640
So there is something funny just seeing Doc Brown

127
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,360
and you like squinch and you go, oh, it's Doc Brown.

128
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,580
And then you get closer and you go, ooh,

129
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,880
that's not Doc Brown.

130
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,240
Like, is this guy, did this guy wander over

131
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,940
from Hollywood Boulevard perhaps?

132
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,660
You don't know.

133
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,580
There's something funny about it.

134
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,100
Now it's tough because Disney has cartoon characters

135
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,200
and then they have human beings play them.

136
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,820
And that's an easier thing, I think,

137
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,140
for our brains to handle.

138
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,660
It's easier when you see a fun performer

139
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,560
who's playing Gaston.

140
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,760
He doesn't look anything like him.

141
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,160
He doesn't sound like him, but he's got the attitude.

142
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:03,860
He's got the vibe.

143
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,280
And he's having fun with, and he's got the vibe.

144
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,600
That's a lot easier because if, you know,

145
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,080
if Doc Brown was initially just a cartoon,

146
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,100
I think maybe we wouldn't be doing this episode.

147
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,600
I don't know.

148
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,940
Sure, sure.

149
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,620
And it's why we landed on this as opposed to,

150
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,780
Mike, you threw out like,

151
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,480
is there a universal walk around character

152
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,480
who might be worthy of an episode?

153
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,920
Because this is a thing we haven't talked about a lot

154
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,540
is the presence of, the perennial presence of,

155
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,820
your W.

156
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,100
C.

157
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,860
Fieldses and your Groucho Marxes

158
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,360
and your Lucies.

159
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,860
I guess we've discussed Lucy a little bit.

160
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,360
But, you know, this is a fun part about Universal Studios

161
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,060
that classic characters of yore who now,

162
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,900
if you're a child in 2021,

163
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,760
these are probably 100% unrecognizable to you.

164
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,000
You like, undoubtedly have never seen W.

165
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,220
C.

166
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:02,860
Fields

167
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,780
on here, not even like in a documentary about old things.

168
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,840
Cause a documentary about old things now

169
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,120
would be about less old things than that.

170
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,200
Yes.

171
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,900
I can't even imagine being a kid and like going,

172
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,400
who is that performer dressed in a suit?

173
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,500
And you're like, oh, it's W.

174
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:23,680
C.

175
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,640
Fields, son.

176
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,120
And then like, you have to explain that.

177
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,140
I mean, that doesn't even happen.

178
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,880
I probably doesn't even register to a kid

179
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,600
that that's like somebody I should be excited about.

180
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:35,920
C.

181
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,480
Fields also seemed like would be a lot of work

182
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,560
because I'm sure there's lots of weird stuff we would find.

183
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,660
No, he was perfect.

184
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,400
He was perfect, Jason.

185
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,400
I'm sure, you know, don't look into it.

186
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,700
Oh no, I'm not even concerned about scandals

187
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,700
and that sort of thing.

188
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,660
It's just like, no, there's gonna be some fun oddities.

189
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,560
Like there's gotta be a movie where it's like,

190
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,900
oh yeah, remember he was like the King of the Pigeons.

191
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,060
Remember that movie?

192
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,500
It was like the biggest movie of 1931

193
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,760
and now we don't remember it at all.

194
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,580
More along those lines.

195
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,420
I see, I see.

196
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:07,940
What I was thinking of.

197
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,220
Well, you will, whenever you have children,

198
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,060
you will definitely teach them about King of the Pigeons

199
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,820
as one of the first lessons

200
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,900
when the kids are able to absorb.

201
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,160
I would show the kids,

202
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,300
I think a lot of the Marx Brothers stuff does hold up.

203
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,640
And other than that, I think you have to go

204
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,540
for like physical stuff.

205
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,700
Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton.

206
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,340
Don't look into that either.

207
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,800
Don't look into that history either.

208
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,080
Anyway, yes, I hear what you're saying.

209
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,700
The equivalent now,

210
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,040
like let's look at some old entertainment.

211
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,620
Let's watch the Friends, I think,

212
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,700
is like what Universal should have now

213
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,520
is Joey and Chandler walking around.

214
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,640
I mean, that's now like, oh yeah, remember the past?

215
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,840
Even some of the office is old enough you could do.

216
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,780
Like by the time my kid is seven,

217
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,520
the first year of the office is gonna be a little old.

218
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,440
So to have a Michael Scott stroll in.

219
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,280
I still want everybody to have a cane and twirl it around.

220
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,160
Like, is that okay?

221
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,920
I know that's not what Michael Scott did,

222
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,280
but I would like to retain that

223
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,280
from the old studio characters.

224
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,260
Yeah.

225
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,660
Well, and here comes Emily from Emily's Reasons Why Not.

226
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,420
And she's got a little cane.

227
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,580
Samantha who?

228
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,740
Bumbling down the street.

229
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,400
Oh man, Michael Scott walk around is really,

230
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,160
I don't know why they haven't done that.

231
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,780
I guess, I'm trying to think like,

232
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,860
would Michael Scott or Chandler and Joey,

233
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,280
would that actually be better than Doc Brown in some way?

234
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,100
Cause they would just like,

235
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,420
Chandler would have to wear like a weird bowling shirt,

236
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,140
like a late nineties bowling shirt or something.

237
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,600
And you go, well, that's Chandler.

238
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,660
He looks exactly like him.

239
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,740
And then Doc Brown was next to you.

240
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,000
You go, who the hell is this white lab coat weirdo?

241
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,760
I don't get it.

242
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,060
I don't know.

243
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,680
Maybe it's easier to pull up.

244
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,720
If you like really lather,

245
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,820
remember how Michael Scott initially was less

246
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,320
of a human being and had like, jet back,

247
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,100
like he'd a lot of grease in his hair.

248
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,380
If you went really far with that,

249
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,560
and then like, again, let's just keep,

250
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,400
let's stick with the rules of WC Fields.

251
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,200
And he has like caked on pale face makeup.

252
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,500
He's just, he's kind of like a,

253
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,880
he's a Kabuki of Michael Scott.

254
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,420
Maybe that way you just have to like push it really far.

255
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,760
It might, you might be able to pull it off.

256
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,920
Well, what if it's like the fairy godmother,

257
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,160
which I know they just updated the face

258
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,820
where a fairy godmother in Disney has like a plastic face.

259
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,640
Even though she's a human-ish looking character,

260
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,720
they have like a plastic scary face for her.

261
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,060
What if there was just a plastic Michael Scott

262
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,700
Halloween mask that the performer could wear?

263
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,400
Maybe that solves the problem of even Doc Brown.

264
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,260
Maybe they should switch completely to plastic

265
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,720
Halloween masks for everyone.

266
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,100
I mean, that fairy godmother, yeah,

267
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,700
the Cinderella fairy godmother,

268
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,400
it's really insane that what they were doing

269
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,480
in the park for so long,

270
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,120
that is a truly ghoulish character.

271
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,960
You would see it and think,

272
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,120
oh my God, it's Cinderella's wicked fairy godmother.

273
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,280
You would immediately reclassify the character as evil

274
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,920
based on the walk around.

275
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:24,980
Like some-

276
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,300
The fairy godmother of the purge.

277
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,200
The doll-faced fairy godmother,

278
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,680
the lifeless doll-faced fairy godmother.

279
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,200
Oh no, she's been cursed again.

280
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,280
She Adrena-chromes, so that's why she looks like,

281
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,160
from all the Adrena-chrome,

282
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,480
she absorbs the power of little doll-faced children

283
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,200
and that's why she looks doll-faced.

284
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,120
Yes, so Universal has not gone the doll-faced route.

285
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,020
It is funny, because I kept trying to crack this exactly.

286
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,080
Lucy, I have a video, my mother and my sister

287
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,660
and I went to Universal five-ish years ago, six years ago,

288
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,640
and Lucy was sitting in the performer playing Lucille Ball,

289
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,320
was sitting in a director's chair.

290
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,080
We made my mom go over and sit next to her

291
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,000
in the seat and talk to Lucy.

292
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,080
And I was like, this woman's pretty good.

293
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,340
She's playing Lucy.

294
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,840
It's really like, it's working for me.

295
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,460
Obviously I know what Lucy looks like.

296
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,200
I know this isn't the voice, but I was like,

297
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,620
I don't know, pretty close, pretty good.

298
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,700
But with Doc Brown, it's just never quite there.

299
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,620
It's definitely, yeah, it's always iffy.

300
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,620
And I might vote if you guys are cool with this

301
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,120
with diving into one of the things

302
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,200
that inspired this episode,

303
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,440
which is that we, so we just did this episode

304
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,920
about Nickelodeon Studios, which was a lot of fun.

305
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,700
And one of the things about Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando

306
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,540
was this time capsule that moved.

307
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,060
It now is in Burbank, kind of close to us.

308
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:02,240
We got no leads, not a lead was gathered from the episode.

309
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,060
Unless do you have, was there a lead?

310
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,700
We had someone message us actually.

311
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,000
Really?

312
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,280
Oh wait, I missed this.

313
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,280
Oh, wow.

314
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:11,900
Okay.

315
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,220
I forgot even to mention it.

316
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:13,800
Yes, we do.

317
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,640
We have a little bit of a lead, I think.

318
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,760
There's a way that we could go see this lid in the ground

319
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,600
that I'm so excited to see.

320
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,680
I get to see this lid.

321
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,500
In an office building, no one has stepped foot in

322
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,640
in one year over one year possibly.

323
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,200
Yeah, it's not like an immediate thing or not a guarantee,

324
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,680
but there's one person that seems to think it's possible.

325
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,140
There's a possibility for making it happen.

326
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,520
So we have one lead, yeah.

327
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,220
This is unrelated, but something I like.

328
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,140
Did you guys see this on Twitter that we, from that episode,

329
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,740
got a shout out from Moe from Guts,

330
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,080
whose daughter listens to Podcast The Ride evidently?

331
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,320
Yes, fantastic.

332
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,660
That's great news.

333
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,300
Love Moe.

334
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,580
We love Moe.

335
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,060
We didn't talk about Guts enough.

336
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,260
I mean, Guts really loomed large,

337
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,400
but it's a theme park podcast,

338
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,560
so we're trying to hit all the things.

339
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,160
I was listening back and I was like,

340
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,640
oh, we didn't talk about any of the shows enough.

341
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,900
We didn't even mention about, my brother and me,

342
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,820
we didn't even mention Goo Punch, which is a fantastic.

343
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,540
Oh my God, do you remember Goo Punch?

344
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,380
You don't remember Goo Punch?

345
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,500
It was when Goo was fantasizing about having his own drink.

346
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,860
This is like Ivan Ooze when he was selling the Ooze.

347
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,740
Oh my God, I have to do this.

348
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,100
I just want to see if it brings your memory back of Goo Punch,

349
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,920
because I was bringing it up to a couple people

350
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,780
and they reminded me of Goo Punch.

351
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,300
And then I said it to my sister and she goes,

352
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,380
oh, Goo Punch.

353
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,060
I mentioned that we talked about my brother and me

354
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,280
and she goes, oh, Goo Punch.

355
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,440
And I was like, why didn't we say Goo Punch?

356
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,380
And here is Goo Punch.

357
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,680
Here's Goo imagining if he had a drink.

358
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,920
He's on a sparkly R&B stage now.

359
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:55,640
Yes.

360
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,620
A big top hat.

361
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,300
One plus one is always two.

362
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,680
I'm a goo with a drink for you.

363
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,820
My Goo Punch goes with any snack.

364
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,360
So get back to check, because it's a goo attack.

365
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,120
Goo!

366
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,240
Goo!

367
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,480
Oh, Goo, you're all that.

368
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,420
I am and I am.

369
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,200
And so is my Goo Punch.

370
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,340
Come on, everybody.

371
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,060
It's a big can, like the old Juicy Juice cans.

372
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,720
It's a massive can.

373
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,040
Bright king.

374
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,560
Goo Punch.

375
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,100
Goo Punch.

376
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,260
I mean, Goo Punch, fantastic.

377
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,940
Probably the best moment in the whole series.

378
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:50,980
Goo!

379
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,120
I, boy, yeah, again, what happened to Goo?

380
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,800
Why didn't Hollywood embrace Goo the way they were supposed to?

381
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
I don't know, Goo was so funny.

382
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,300
So yeah, we should have talked more about all the shows,

383
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,260
including Guts and Thank You Mo for that shout out.

384
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,520
That means a lot.

385
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,740
Honestly, that would have, as a kid, you'd be like,

386
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,080
Mo is gonna like say something nice about me?

387
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,720
Or just even say I exist?

388
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,580
Mo is gonna acknowledge I exist?

389
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,380
She, the integrity that Mo lends to Guts,

390
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,240
where you suddenly, just by virtue of Mo's accent,

391
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,220
you're like, well, this is a global event.

392
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,820
This is an international, I know what the Olympics are like.

393
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,200
I've seen one of those on TV at this age.

394
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,060
They have British accents, there's accents.

395
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,820
So clearly, this is like, there are stakes to Guts.

396
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:38,760
Right.

397
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,340
This is not just like something happening in a soundstage.

398
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,200
This is gonna change lives.

399
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,840
This is gonna go in an almanac.

400
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,020
It legitimized hooking a kid up to a bungee cord

401
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,460
and making him jump off of a two story set of stairs

402
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,180
and throwing a basketball in a hoop.

403
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,780
Yeah, no, it was very, very exciting.

404
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,760
Yes, it felt like important.

405
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,720
Guts felt important, for sure,

406
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,360
when we were watching it, I think.

407
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,620
Yeah, it felt the same as the Olympics.

408
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,180
Yes.

409
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,140
I saw Barcelona and like, okay, and now Guts.

410
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,660
All right, so these are as crucial.

411
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,380
Yes, 100%.

412
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,840
Yeah, yeah.

413
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,360
So anyway, love all the Nickelodeon stuff.

414
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,600
Excited about this lead.

415
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,440
But the burial of the Nick Studios time capsules,

416
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,840
we're here to talk about a reminder.

417
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,500
It was buried in 1992 to be opened in 2042.

418
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,380
And the ceremony was overseen by host of Guts, Mike O'Malley,

419
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,900
sudden appearance from Joey Lawrence,

420
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,700
who showed up to put in a hat that says, whoa, 92.

421
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,980
And then they're about to bury the big orange time capsule.

422
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,480
They're about to put it in the ground.

423
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,740
And then a familiar face shows up.

424
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,040
I'm gonna play maybe a little more of this

425
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,540
than often we would play as a clip.

426
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,160
You guys just raise your hands if you wanna stop it

427
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,280
and talk about something.

428
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,660
And I'll stop it as well.

429
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,540
But I think this is a wonderful scene.

430
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,300
And maybe one of the best examples

431
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,240
of what an off-brand Doc Brown can get themselves up to.

432
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,960
So here is this very crucial moment.

433
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,500
Yeah, put that on right there.

434
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,080
I want you to do the honors of pressing the button

435
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,140
and lowering our time capsule into the ground.

436
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,240
Crane man, are you ready?

437
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,540
Okay, beautiful.

438
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:22,960
All right, Mike, we go.

439
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,840
Go ahead, press the button, man.

440
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,640
We're all set.

441
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,260
Whoa, who's that?

442
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,180
I have no idea, Mike.

443
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,120
It's a DeLorean.

444
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:28,840
A DeLorean.

445
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,520
Who is that?

446
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,260
Is it Michael Tate Fox?

447
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,140
I don't know who it is.

448
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,100
He's driving around here.

449
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,920
This guy looks familiar.

450
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,800
Actually, ladies and gentlemen,

451
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:36,860
it's Dr.

452
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,880
Emmett Brown from the Future Institute

453
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,900
of Technology here at Universal Studios in Florida.

454
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,420
It's kind of wrong.

455
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,720
It's not the right name.

456
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:44,740
Dr.

457
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:45,300
Brown!

458
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,200
Told everything!

459
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,600
Go bury that time capsule!

460
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,040
Doc, what's the problem?

461
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,640
What is it?

462
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,140
Michael, joy, thank goodness I got here in time.

463
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,760
Terrible news, just terrible.

464
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,660
What is it?

465
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,340
Well, I was working on one of my new DeLorean prototypes.

466
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,920
When I actually crossed-

467
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,400
That, by the way, felt like,

468
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:08,120
that we were like worried that if we were cross paths

469
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,600
with Michael Malley, that he would yell at us.

470
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,960
That's how that, I felt like he was yelling at the actor.

471
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,600
He was like, get it out!

472
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,320
Spit it!

473
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,320
Now that he's out, let's just say,

474
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,100
today you still see Doc Brown's in the park.

475
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,940
The wigs are not this bad.

476
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,780
This is an Albert Einstein wig.

477
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,380
This is not even what Doc's hair is like.

478
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,640
This is like early Mickey in Disneyland

479
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,300
where there were holes in his face for no reason,

480
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,600
or seemingly no reason.

481
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,520
He was all carved up, yes.

482
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,000
Okay, so Doc's here.

483
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,640
Shot 50 years into the future,

484
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,440
and that's when I made the discovery

485
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,140
of catastrophic proportions.

486
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,100
What's the problem, what's the discovery?

487
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,640
By the year 2042, there'll be no more GAC in the world.

488
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,360
No more GAC?

489
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,020
Exactly, so for the sake of future-

490
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,580
Kind of like forgetting stuff as he goes.

491
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,320
I got the liners, it's all right.

492
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,840
Okay, we have real Joey Lawrence,

493
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,700
like recognizable celebrity, good get for this thing,

494
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,580
and then Doc Brown comes out,

495
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,220
and it's just a guy we've never seen,

496
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,220
and probably will never see again.

497
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,740
What else was I gonna say?

498
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,820
Oh, and also the GAC, the fact that now we know,

499
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,080
now everything's so siloed by corporation,

500
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,960
and we know that, all right,

501
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,560
and Peacock's over here, and Paramount Plus is over here,

502
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,920
and like never shall they meet,

503
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,420
but that Doc Brown, a universal property,

504
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,560
is dealing with GAC, a Viacom property,

505
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,840
it's all just like, nobody's keeping track of who owns what,

506
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,700
nobody cares, there were no lawsuits,

507
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,380
none of this mattered at the time.

508
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,020
It's very interesting, yeah,

509
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,140
that Doc Brown was just treated as like,

510
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,220
if you wanna use him and you're in universal, go for it.

511
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,540
It doesn't matter, well, you don't have to,

512
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,560
I mean, Bob Gale signs off on literally anything

513
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,740
that comes across his desk,

514
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,660
but it doesn't have to even go through him.

515
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,200
Just use Doc Brown however you'd like,

516
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,800
and who, anyone, pick anyone to play him,

517
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,160
it doesn't, go for it.

518
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,100
Yeah, do you wanna look it over,

519
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,280
make sure we got her now, okay, that's fine.

520
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,440
Only two years after the last movie,

521
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,380
not even two full years after the last movie.

522
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,000
Right, and do we talk about on the Back to the Future

523
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,720
episode, the actual Christopher Lloyd special

524
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,000
with Universal Florida?

525
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:29,960
I can't remember.

526
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,420
We didn't really touch on it,

527
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,560
but that's pretty fun, that special.

528
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,420
Where he goes there before the park is open,

529
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,780
he's like, it's for potential investors to like,

530
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,280
Doc Brown goes forward into the future

531
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,540
where the park is now open.

532
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,680
Right, so like, yeah, it was like, Doc Brown,

533
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,300
the real Doc Brown, Christopher Lloyd,

534
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,920
had been involved in the park as well before, yeah,

535
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,240
I don't know how many, was it a year before it was open?

536
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,400
I don't know, something like that.

537
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,740
Something like that, I mean, in 1989,

538
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,520
I think they were filming like Double Dare or something,

539
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,360
some Nickelodeon game shows were shooting

540
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,440
in Finnish sound stages next to a massive,

541
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,320
empty construction site, which is funny to think about,

542
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,100
that that is like, you were driving through

543
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,980
a construction site, like, no, I'm not working

544
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,640
construction, I'm going to the Finnish game show

545
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,440
sound stage, that's where I work.

546
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,480
Yeah, two years of filming Double Dare

547
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,060
with nothing else around it.

548
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,740
Yeah, something like that, yeah.

549
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,000
Okay, so.

550
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,480
Some gack into that time capsule,

551
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,920
otherwise the future is fucked.

552
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,520
Doc, I understand what you're saying,

553
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,760
but you know, I mean, I don't know if I can get some

554
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,980
on such short notice, I mean, these things take time.

555
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,200
Wait a minute.

556
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,340
I have a suggestion, I think it's time for the Gackmeister.

557
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,500
That's a good idea, Joey.

558
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,260
Gackmeister!

559
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:46,920
Gackmeister!

560
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,200
Gackmeister, right here!

561
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,040
You got the Gackmeister.

562
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,620
Then this guy runs out with a bunch of splats on his jacket,

563
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,600
that's how you know he's the Gackmeister.

564
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,400
Now, I think this is more interesting, appearing to me,

565
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,560
like, I want to see the Godzilla versus Kong,

566
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,700
Gackmeister versus Doc Brown.

567
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,060
Oh yeah, do you think they get along?

568
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:11,300
Is Doc, does he believe that Gack is a pseudoscience?

569
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,420
Yeah, that's possible.

570
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,960
Does he need the Gack to power the fusion,

571
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,160
whatever it is on the top of the future,

572
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,880
the future DeLorean, like when he dumps trash in

573
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,720
at the end of the first, back to the future?

574
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,020
Runs on Gack now!

575
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,860
I have a Gackgeiser that's for my private use.

576
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,340
I thought it was Hocum, I was wrong, I was wrong.

577
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,560
Now that's your Doc Brown,

578
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,700
that sounds a little like your Dompardo.

579
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:48,320
Oh yeah, I mean, any sort of like, this guy is really,

580
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,360
he's, when you're doing an impression,

581
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,200
you hone in on like one sentence or one thing

582
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,340
to try and turn it on, and he's really going for the nasal.

583
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:03,080
The nasal kind of twang, like, nobilians.

584
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,960
There's, I found in every Doc Brown, there is like,

585
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,280
yes, a couple words where I go, oh good, that's it.

586
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,140
And then it's gone for a couple sentences,

587
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,660
and then it comes back, and that's including me.

588
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,880
That's including me, probably with even less good,

589
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,940
like less accuracy on one word or one phrase.

590
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,840
The longer you have to talk and perform a full scene

591
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,500
with Joey Lawrence, it goes in and out.

592
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,140
Right, exactly.

593
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,220
Hey, we forgot to talk about Joey Lawrence

594
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,560
on the Nickelodeon episode.

595
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,900
I did a what's he up to now search,

596
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,520
and the answer is he is more willingly

597
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,100
in the Roe versus Wade movie that Jamie Kennedy

598
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,680
did not bother to read the script for when he signed on.

599
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,240
Oh no.

600
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,820
Man, of course, God, they all go that way.

601
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,840
Yeah.

602
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,040
Joey, you're gonna be in a movie.

603
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:05,280
It's gonna be very bad, and try to set society back.

604
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,420
Many years.

605
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,100
Yeah, he runs out here and said like,

606
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,980
we have to stop Roe versus Wade.

607
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,500
Yeah, you're right.

608
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,440
Stop the signing of that awful legislation

609
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,140
that destroys all the, kills all these babies.

610
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,940
No, the making of the film.

611
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,260
Whoa.

612
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,560
The film that has holds a record

613
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,140
for being the quickest to be free on Hoopla

614
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,760
and every other streaming platform available.

615
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,620
You're gonna work with Jamie Kennedy, Joey.

616
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,840
We have to stop it.

617
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,880
He's an up and comer, right?

618
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,300
No, he's like, he's in for good.

619
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,640
No, he's weird now.

620
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,720
He's weird and sweaty.

621
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,560
Okay, everybody's in the scene.

622
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,440
We're gonna need that, and this Gax has got to last 50 years,

623
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,840
so make sure, get it in there.

624
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,980
Okay, thanks Gax Meisner, we can always count on you.

625
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,620
Always count on the gate cluster.

626
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,420
Make sure that thing is sealed tight.

627
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,480
We don't want Gax all over those CDs and stuff like that.

628
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,160
Okay, get that thing back on there.

629
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,920
Well, we have averted future catastrophe once again.

630
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,240
Thanks a lot, Doc, appreciate it.

631
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,640
No problem, Michael, don't mention it.

632
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,080
Hey, actually, while we have you here,

633
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,520
could you possibly tell me

634
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,780
who's gonna win the World Series this year?

635
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,420
Great Scott, I'm not gonna get into a mess like that again.

636
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,980
You know what happened the last time?

637
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,740
I'm just kidding you, Doc.

638
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,320
Oh look, I'm gonna get back to the Institute

639
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,840
of Future Technology and more time travel volunteers

640
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,380
here at Universal Studio waiting

641
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,120
to try temporal displacement.

642
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,140
Michael, good luck with your time.

643
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:26,620
Doc, thanks again, man.

644
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,120
Take care.

645
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,000
You always say hello to Blossom for me.

646
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,600
All right, thanks Doc.

647
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,340
We'll see you all in the future.

648
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,260
Bye bye.

649
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,000
Doc Brown, everybody, Doc Brown.

650
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,760
See you later, Doc.

651
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,460
He's a crazy cookie man, man.

652
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,360
He is a cookie guy.

653
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,280
Okay, hey, Vicki, did you get all that on camera?

654
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,260
Then they cut to the most upset girl.

655
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,560
I think I did.

656
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,560
I feel so much pressure having to film this.

657
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,560
Why does Doc Brown know Blossom?

658
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,420
Why does he have so many friends who are minors?

659
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,020
This is all pop culture, we're friends.

660
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,380
They all knew each other back then.

661
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,280
Now we think it's a big deal

662
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,760
when things are gonna cross over.

663
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,000
Everything was just crossing over always when we were kids

664
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,140
and it was not a big deal.

665
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,060
It was due to writer laziness.

666
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,000
Yes, and in that Doc Brown special from Universal,

667
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,340
and I don't know, that might be a different episode

668
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,740
at this point, but Doc Brown goes

669
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,980
and sees Ghostbusters and he gets a proton pack

670
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,520
and he goes, Ghostbusters.

671
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,360
And I'm like, holy shit, this is fantastic.

672
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,660
As a kid, because I think I've said this before,

673
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,080
and it's partly fueled by the fact that I have these toys

674
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,840
made by this company, NECA, that are all on the same scale

675
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,200
and I have them here to demonstrate.

676
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,020
You have your Marty McFly in the same scale as Toca

677
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,740
from Secret of the U's.

678
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,460
And as the two toys are sitting on the shelf,

679
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,860
my little brain, my little kid brain now is going,

680
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,900
man, you know what, that would have been good

681
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,040
if they made a bad Back to the Future

682
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,540
Ninja Turtle crossover with Toca and Razor.

683
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,660
I go, man, that would have been fantastic.

684
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,540
And then this Doc Brown clip

685
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,020
where he puts on the proton pack and he shoots Stay Puft,

686
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,320
I go, that's a piece of it.

687
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,620
That's a part of my fantasy imagined at the time.

688
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,940
And you go, yeah, wouldn't it be great

689
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,820
if you know how they make,

690
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,580
everything's just like IP garbage now

691
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,960
and it's all mashed up and we like some of it

692
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,940
and don't like some of it?

693
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,540
Wouldn't it be great if there was all of that in the past

694
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,320
and there were 10 Back to the Futures

695
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,580
and half of them were crossing over?

696
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,780
Like, and it was mostly trash,

697
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,920
but you look back and you go,

698
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,220
yeah, there was that one fun scene where like Doc Brown

699
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,060
had to try to like help Toca and Razor

700
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,120
mutate into something else or like make different Toca

701
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,100
and Razors to fight Toca and Razor.

702
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,460
Wouldn't that be great if now we could watch those?

703
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,480
I think yes, it would be great.

704
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,360
He goes back to the 30s or whatever

705
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,880
and helps the League of their own.

706
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,180
He helps them win the game.

707
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:55,480
Fantastic.

708
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,040
He makes a new bat for them.

709
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,360
He invents a new bat that helps the League of their own win.

710
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,800
Yes, wouldn't that be fantastic if we could see that?

711
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,240
And you go, did you know there's a weird

712
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,980
Back to the Future movie where he goes

713
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,860
and meets a League of their own and you go, really?

714
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,720
And you go, yeah, yeah, it's NHBMX, you should watch it.

715
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,200
And then we all like post about it and think it's crazy.

716
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,800
What a dream.

717
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,120
What a dream that would be.

718
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,280
They should, you know, if it didn't interrupt

719
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,940
the original continuity, if they were made kind of

720
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,960
of the scale of like that weird last,

721
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,260
Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves.

722
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,040
Ourselves, yeah.

723
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,020
Actors could change, like, you know,

724
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,640
that movie doesn't like invade or ruin the experience

725
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,980
of the first two, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.

726
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,040
It's its own thing.

727
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,060
Yeah, there should have been 10 weird

728
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,340
straight to video Back to the Futures.

729
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,780
Rory works with people from other movies.

730
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,480
Yeah, it's like, oh no, the Gremlin's stowed away.

731
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,420
Yes, any, it doesn't matter what the movie is

732
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,020
they cross over with, it's just the idea

733
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,080
that they're crossing over is good.

734
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,540
But it does have to be the old, it has to be in the past

735
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,180
because the next 10 Back to the Futures that will happen

736
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,100
when Zemeckis and Gale are dead,

737
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,700
those aren't gonna be the fun we want.

738
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,720
Those are gonna be a different thing.

739
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,020
It'll be like that total recall remake with Colin Farrell.

740
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,540
And it's just like, oh, this is really dry and serious.

741
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,720
Again, we're talking about a devil-may-care attitude.

742
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,420
They're like, yeah, we gotta film this thing for Universal.

743
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:32,160
And it'll be a preview on NBC at 9 p.

744
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,260
m.

745
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:32,960
on a Friday.

746
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,440
And then we're gonna put it on tapes for investors.

747
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,120
And so, yeah, have Doc Brown with the Ghostbusters.

748
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,540
And now it would be like, okay,

749
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,920
if Doc Brown's gonna meet the Ghostbusters,

750
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,200
we have to get some writers rooms together.

751
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,100
We have to get different teams of lawyers together.

752
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,520
The marketing people and the merchandising people

753
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,220
have to get on a call.

754
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,580
It's just so complicated.

755
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,380
Yeah, it's dry.

756
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,380
In the past, it would have just been like,

757
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:01,120
Marty, the little giants are stuck in ancient Rome.

758
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,580
We need to rescue the little giants.

759
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,680
Come quick!

760
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,980
We got to make sure Gomez and Morticia meet.

761
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,660
The Addams family will be destroyed.

762
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,140
Can you imagine that the two Lloyds meet in the movie?

763
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,840
Oh my God, Fester and Brown eating up.

764
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:27,920
Two of the most legitimate best characters of all time.

765
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,560
I'm not even being funny when I say it.

766
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,520
Big time.

767
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,300
Christopher Lloyd is a fucking genius who deserves,

768
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,620
give Christopher Lloyd an Oscar, first of all.

769
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,140
I've said this before.

770
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,520
The guy has been in enough movies

771
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,500
with playing wildly different characters that are perfect.

772
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,040
And it's unbelievable.

773
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,900
Anyway, yes, imagine this.

774
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,840
Let's ask it to the listener.

775
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,380
What movie from 30 years ago do you want

776
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,360
Back to the Future to cross over with?

777
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,780
And give us a little piece of dialogue from the movie

778
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,900
and we'll retweet some of the fun ones.

779
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

780
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,640
That's a great idea.

781
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,240
And it's a weird request.

782
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,720
We don't want them to happen now.

783
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:09,400
Not now.

784
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,460
The way things are remade now, no, no, no.

785
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,960
I don't wanna see a poster with like a really,

786
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,220
oh, the huge brawny humorless Australian playing American,

787
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,420
big grizzled guy as the new Marty.

788
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,580
This is, I don't want this.

789
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,260
I want, yeah, let's imagine these all happen.

790
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,320
We're banged out haphazardly in 1993.

791
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,200
Right, like, let's see.

792
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:33,940
What was the-

793
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:37,540
Three men and a baby need our help with the baby.

794
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,200
What's the Michael J.

795
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,400
Fox weird presidents movie

796
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,940
or like he's like like Mike.

797
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,580
What is that?

798
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,380
What am I thinking?

799
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,060
No, you're-

800
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,480
Life with Mikey.

801
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,780
Life with Mikey.

802
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,760
We have to find, we have to help life with Mikey.

803
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,040
Mikey's life will be destroyed.

804
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,680
We have to fix.

805
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,540
No, it's not about your life, Mikey.

806
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,620
It's about life with Mikey's children.

807
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,980
We have to make sure Clifford gets on that plane

808
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,680
or he'll never meet uncle Martin.

809
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,000
And uncle Martin will never, after some travails,

810
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,580
prove to his fiance who looks like my fiance

811
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:25,200
that he can handle children in his life.

812
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,860
Yes, these are perfect.

813
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,840
All these are perfect.

814
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,340
And you give us your version of perfect, please.

815
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,620
So with that, you have to like the sort of devil

816
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,000
may care spirit of the, you know, yeah,

817
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,620
some guy who doesn't really look like Doc Brown

818
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,720
makes Blossom part of Back to the Future canon,

819
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,700
makes Gack part of canon.

820
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,880
And yeah, I don't know, you know, it's good.

821
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,900
I think that I've quickly landed on it's good.

822
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,640
It's good that they did this.

823
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,600
And I don't know, I hope that actor, you know,

824
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,640
hey, maybe there was a part for him in Roe versus Wade also.

825
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,240
I hope that's true.

826
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,140
I assume was produced in Orlando probably.

827
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,940
One of the rare movie sets that are taking walk-ins.

828
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,820
You're willing to, we can film you

829
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,280
and you know what this is, right?

830
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,560
We've got scripts.

831
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,020
This is the fourth lead.

832
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,560
Are you sure you want this?

833
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,540
All right.

834
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:30,260
Now, can I play it sort of like as a Doc Brown type?

835
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,400
Yeah, sure.

836
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,100
We don't care.

837
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,700
This just has to get these words have to get filmed.

838
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,200
Look, the Mercer's just want it done, okay?

839
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,480
You know, I wanna, I was being a little negative.

840
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,720
I do like that this is how they've,

841
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,240
Doc Brown exists in the parks.

842
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,480
I've been a little bit negative and I'm, you know,

843
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,540
I'm trying to be, I guess funny here,

844
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:54,900
but I do think the way they're doing Doc Brown now is good.

845
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,680
And I like it.

846
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,340
I just wanna say that on the record

847
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,120
before we go forward with more.

848
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,660
Yeah, yeah.

849
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,200
I agree.

850
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,320
I mean, so this is the most fun one, I think,

851
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,580
that they just like, they had Doc Brown's hired.

852
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,440
Oh, we have to do this.

853
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,880
We had this idea for this beat in the Nickelodeon special

854
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,620
and this guy has the costume already.

855
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,840
He fits in the costume.

856
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,240
So we give him an hour to prep, kind of look at a script,

857
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,120
but you know, they'll wing it too.

858
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,460
And then it happens.

859
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,740
But there's, yeah, there's been this, you know,

860
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,200
in the park since the nineties.

861
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,200
I mean, I have various clips.

862
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,980
here's one guy, this is from, you know, I mean,

863
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:38,400
the big day for these people was October 21st.

864
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,640
Was it the, is that the day?

865
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,500
2015, which was the day depicted in Back to the Future 2.

866
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,400
That is the future that they went to.

867
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,580
So there was a lot of videos from that day.

868
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,880
That's Back to the Future Day.

869
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,240
So everybody wants a moment with Doc Brown on that day.

870
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,380
And this guy, this is like one way,

871
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,360
we're talking about how do you do this voice.

872
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,240
And here's, this guy gave it a shot.

873
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,220
He has an interesting angle on it.

874
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,960
I don't know if it is the angle, but let's just,

875
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,800
let's hear him.

876
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,600
There's a lot of competing sound, but here we go.

877
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,900
Quite how we predicted, but not to look.

878
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,880
Because of course, your future has been written.

879
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,200
But the best advice I can give you is,

880
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,360
your future's what you make it.

881
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,580
So they get a good one, okay?

882
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,180
Thank you.

883
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:23,980
Okay.

884
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,860
He like, his key is like a little wobble, okay?

885
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,400
Ha ha ha ha.

886
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,540
Which is, what does that remind me of?

887
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,980
That's like Jimmy Fallon doing Barry Gibb.

888
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,760
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

889
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,100
It's a little bit high pitched.

890
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,740
It's a little more high pitched.

891
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,320
I can see.

892
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,620
From the state of Sydney, okay?

893
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,040
I could see where he got there from.

894
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,040
I could see where he's get, I can see it.

895
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,560
But I don't know that I would have heard that and gone

896
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,780
without the context and I don't know that I would have

897
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,240
heard it and said, oh, Doc Brown.

898
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,100
He was saying different lines.

899
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,040
He wasn't already saying the future's what you make of it

900
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,060
to make it a good one.

901
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:58,580
Right.

902
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,300
Yeah.

903
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,460
If he was saying park over here, $20, 30 for valet.

904
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,660
And you were just thinking.

905
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,240
Here's your coffee token.

906
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,000
Here's your token for your free coffee.

907
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,000
The machine doesn't work today.

908
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,040
The machine is out of order.

909
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,080
Bonnie, the machine is out of order.

910
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,900
Bonnie.

911
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,440
A warning from the future.

912
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,360
The coffee token does not work.

913
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,920
That was the day that in another part of the country

914
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,160
at an out of town series of Jimmy Kimmel tapings,

915
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,860
the actual Marty McFly and Doc Brown,

916
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,380
Michael J.

917
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,380
Fox and Christopher Lloyd showed up in a Delorean

918
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,880
for that episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live.

919
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,560
For a segment that I watched a minute of

920
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,640
and then I saw it was nine minutes long.

921
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,640
And I was like, I'm not, I don't need to watch all of this.

922
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,040
I watched all of that at the time.

923
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,120
Yeah.

924
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,000
You know, yeah.

925
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,240
I roll my eyes at like viral talk show moments,

926
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,640
but I love it back as a future enough, but I'm like, yeah,

927
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,260
yeah, it's long.

928
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,540
There's probably some trims.

929
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,260
It's a little long.

930
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,360
I don't disagree with that.

931
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,460
You know what was great though is that he had,

932
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,460
Jimmy had like Letterman people for that week

933
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,480
cause it was in New York.

934
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,740
So there was a line about like,

935
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,180
I have to warn you about Biff.

936
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,560
And then they cut it was Biff Henderson,

937
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,440
Letterman's stage manager.

938
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,700
What a good tie together.

939
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,800
They have the second most famous Biff,

940
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,360
Letterman stage manager.

941
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,040
Yeah.

942
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,640
So I liked that.

943
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,540
Now I'm not saying, look,

944
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,780
the times when Christopher Lloyd is on some show

945
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,700
next to a DeLorean,

946
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,220
I feel like it happens about three times a year.

947
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:30,700
I don't know.

948
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,520
Like he's on some discovery show now where they're like

949
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,840
trying to find a DeLorean.

950
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,100
I'm not sure what it is.

951
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,980
I just saw an ad for it.

952
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,520
So I'm not saying I necessarily watch all

953
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,180
of the DeLorean content.

954
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,480
But I do think that one was at least,

955
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,960
that was at least fun in a different way.

956
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,320
Sort of an elevation.

957
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,720
Better than when he came out in the,

958
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,660
I mean, we all think about it and talk about it.

959
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,520
The Funny or Die, Art of the Deal,

960
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,380
the film that they made where Johnny Depp is Trump member.

961
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,140
We all, you know, you know,

962
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,820
and you know that Christopher Lloyd is in it

963
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,940
as a pseudo Doc Brown.

964
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,300
He's like an off-brand Doc Brown in the movie.

965
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,040
They'd never say what he is.

966
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,580
The wig isn't very good.

967
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,920
He has weird goggles that are not the spray painted goggles.

968
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,080
Although as I say all this,

969
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,000
I'm reminded of a better Funny or Die Doc Brown thing.

970
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,080
Did I already say this in the Back to the Future episode

971
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,580
that I, there was this video that they did.

972
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,960
I didn't make it, but I was there when it happened.

973
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,820
This video that was like an ad for hover boards are real

974
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,640
and they're cool now.

975
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,820
And I was invited down to the set.

976
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,880
Like Christopher Lloyd's going to be there.

977
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,300
And I got to go watch him get out of a DeLorean,

978
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,840
which my heart stopped.

979
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,760
And then he hit his head on the door.

980
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:51,620
Oh no.

981
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,540
Oh man.

982
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,520
Oh no.

983
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,660
I mean, but also that was cool.

984
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,240
I mean, what a weird moment to see.

985
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,320
I bet it happened on the set of the films all the time.

986
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,700
That's a very difficult.

987
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,980
He had to like run in and out of the car.

988
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,400
So that felt like, I like that little slice of life

989
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,120
and like puncturing the childhood heroism of these people.

990
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,000
He seemed cool.

991
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,180
I didn't meet him, but he seemed cool.

992
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,060
There's a number of those.

993
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,240
He cameos in a million ways to die in the West.

994
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,080
Oh yeah.

995
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,460
Doc Brown in that, right?

996
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,360
Where he's Doc Brown, like don't worry about,

997
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,520
don't look at this.

998
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,460
Like when Seth MacFarlane walks into a barn.

999
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,260
And then there's a commercial

1000
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:35,140
for an Argentinian electronic store chain

1001
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,020
where it's like 2011.

1002
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:43,280
Everyone's got smartphones with decent video around there

1003
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,240
starting to get them.

1004
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,700
And it's like a found footage kind of like

1005
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,320
people are walking along the street

1006
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,940
and a DeLorean crashes into the front

1007
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,360
of this electronic store.

1008
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,640
And he pops out and he's like, what year is it?

1009
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,460
Where am I?

1010
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:57,940
God.

1011
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,720
Yeah, he's done it a lot.

1012
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,180
There is a lot of other media where he's Doc.

1013
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,400
I mean, it's related to the film,

1014
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,200
but I really liked the music video for the power of love,

1015
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,300
the Huey Lewis song that has like so much extra stuff

1016
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,300
before the song starts.

1017
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,760
Just like two minutes of rambling documentary

1018
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,300
paced dialogue of Huey talking like,

1019
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,640
hey, we haven't been around in a while, but here we are.

1020
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,080
And it's a new song from the movie.

1021
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,680
Like, why is all this in the cut?

1022
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,920
And then Doc is improvising with a bunch of like,

1023
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,380
he shows up at the cool rock club

1024
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,440
and a bunch of rock rats all show up

1025
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,820
that are poking around the vehicle

1026
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,840
and he's clearly improvising.

1027
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,880
And some guys like, what's that?

1028
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,360
What's this?

1029
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,640
Like pointing at some doodad and he says,

1030
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,620
it is what it is.

1031
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,460
Just a weird little Doc Bratt.

1032
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,100
He like clearly could not invent in the moment

1033
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,300
what the actual item is.

1034
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,360
I like it though.

1035
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,820
That's a good, that's an oddly eight minute music video.

1036
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,720
Yeah.

1037
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,040
I'm trying to think there's, he's like kind of Doc Brown

1038
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,560
in Piranha 3D.

1039
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,360
He's like kind of an old, like a crazy old scientist guy.

1040
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:08,520
Wow.

1041
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,280
He's been playing Doc Brown a lot.

1042
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:14,260
So maybe really just like pay his day rate

1043
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,400
and get him in the parks.

1044
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,060
You know?

1045
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,600
We could, oh, just have him, you just Christopher

1046
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,900
and Christopher Lloyd is here always.

1047
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,880
Like if he's not doing anything,

1048
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,740
pay him his day rate and have him play Doc Brown

1049
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,960
in the park for a couple hours.

1050
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:27,600
Why not?

1051
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,640
Like Wally Bogue, you're saying.

1052
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,600
Like Wally Bogue would actually perform

1053
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,580
at Disneyland quite a bit.

1054
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,200
Yeah.

1055
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,300
At the Golden Horseshoe.

1056
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,100
Yeah, of course.

1057
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,360
He seems down.

1058
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,600
He's just like, he's a workhorse actor.

1059
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,040
So point me to a place and I'll go.

1060
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:42,960
Yeah.

1061
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,280
A Doc Brown residency.

1062
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,860
Yeah, they should do that with a.

1063
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,360
Like Joe's pub, yeah.

1064
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,460
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

1065
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,620
And you can have other like newer characters too.

1066
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,560
You know, you could have your Steve Carell residency

1067
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,220
at Universal Hollywood, you know?

1068
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:58,720
Yeah.

1069
00:42:59,180 --> 00:42:59,760
Great idea.

1070
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,820
They'll do some hits and you know they're gonna wanna sing

1071
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,860
some standards or they're gonna wanna croon or something.

1072
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:06,760
You know?

1073
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,820
Well, you're just, you have McFarlane on the brain.

1074
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,540
I got McFarlane on the brain.

1075
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,860
Yeah, get him in the mix for sure.

1076
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,980
I don't wanna tell a story out of school,

1077
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,500
but in this, when I alluded to meeting Mark Summers,

1078
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,980
he, and I don't remember the details,

1079
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,280
but he seemed to imply that,

1080
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,760
cause I asked like, was it like being down in Orlando

1081
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,040
and being at the theme park?

1082
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,340
And he was like, yeah, they kinda like wanted me

1083
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,500
to be there always.

1084
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,300
I think they wanted me to do Double Dare in the park.

1085
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,360
And I'm like, guys, that would require a fight.

1086
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,220
You don't have to pay King Kong and Jaws.

1087
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,640
You would have to pay me to do the same thing over and over.

1088
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,400
That's outside of the TV contract.

1089
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,040
But don't quote me on that.

1090
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,720
I think there was something like that.

1091
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,300
Sure.

1092
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,840
I have a series of just like photos here real quick.

1093
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,100
I have some clips too.

1094
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,020
So yeah, this is another Doc Brown wearing,

1095
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,740
I guess, big khaki pants.

1096
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,860
And he's holding Christopher Lloyd's arm in the air,

1097
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:12,980
the real Christopher Lloyd,

1098
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,000
who's just sort of in a polo shirt.

1099
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,220
And that's pretty fun.

1100
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,040
Christopher Lloyd looks pretty happy-ish.

1101
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,680
You know, he amused by that.

1102
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,560
I feel like anytime I've seen him like interacting,

1103
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,260
he seems to honestly like not be that cynical

1104
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,780
about anything, cause certain people, you know,

1105
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:34,000
kind of are like, I don't want to be this character.

1106
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,500
I don't want to be remembered just for this one thing I did.

1107
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,900
He seems like he's cool and like, yeah, this is great.

1108
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,600
You like me because of this?

1109
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:41,760
Yeah, I'm good in that.

1110
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,840
I'll show up to this day and let this Doc Brown.

1111
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:46,720
Yeah.

1112
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,460
Well, that was the closing of the ride.

1113
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,420
They did a big ceremony where they had to wear,

1114
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,220
and Bob Gale was there, if you can imagine.

1115
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,240
They got Bob Gale.

1116
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,480
Somehow they got some of Bob Gale's time.

1117
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:02,120
And they like, it's a weird ceremony where like Doc makes

1118
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,280
them connect the wires, you know,

1119
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,540
like in the climax of the movie and like,

1120
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,760
I think you know what to do with these.

1121
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,480
And then they have, they connect them.

1122
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,640
And then a bunch of fireworks go off.

1123
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,940
And then there's a countdown clock that says

1124
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,400
when the ride's going to close.

1125
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:20,340
And then a really sleepy guy, the universal executive,

1126
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,740
like now begins the final month.

1127
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,240
Now we can send this attraction out in style.

1128
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,360
Come one last time to say goodbye to our fair moments.

1129
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,200
But it's just a weird like, hurry, Christopher Lloyd,

1130
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,840
help me, Doc, close this.

1131
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,480
There's, this happens a lot.

1132
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,060
And we're going to, we have to do more special,

1133
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,360
like episodes about specials where opening and closings,

1134
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,100
because we've talked about the Benicio del Toro appearance

1135
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:49,080
for the opening of Guardians, where he's not the collector,

1136
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,700
even though he plays the collector,

1137
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,700
he's there as Benicio del Toro.

1138
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:57,280
And it feels like they wanted,

1139
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,080
like they probably wanted Christopher Lloyd to be Doc Brown,

1140
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,400
but he ends up being Christopher Lloyd,

1141
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,440
which the reality I'm not sure of.

1142
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,800
And like saying with Benicio del Toro, it's like,

1143
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,580
he's here, but he's not, to put him in an outfit,

1144
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,920
make him the collector and say, welcome to my collection.

1145
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,680
Why, like why not?

1146
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:19,400
But these, I think all these actors play it right

1147
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,640
with their half commitment,

1148
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,980
because there are technical errors like every time.

1149
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,540
You're timing out pyro, like clearly these are not plays

1150
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:31,020
that are rehearsed for weeks and weeks.

1151
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,440
It's like, oh, well, I hope for the best.

1152
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,380
I mean, remember the Galaxy's Edge one,

1153
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,000
where it's like what's intended to be a huge soaring moment

1154
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,780
where Harrison Ford says, this is for Peter,

1155
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,800
for, and I have this right, for Peter Mayhew,

1156
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,500
for like he's dedicating it to,

1157
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,680
Chewbacca just passed away.

1158
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,200
And it's interrupted by like,

1159
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,840
the thing goes off at the wrong time

1160
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,440
and he bangs it at the wrong time.

1161
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:57,120
It's like, they're so fraught with errors always.

1162
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,240
I feel like, if some of these,

1163
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:02,660
some of the greatest actors ever committed more,

1164
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,740
I think they would end up looking the fool.

1165
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,320
Wouldn't it be funny though,

1166
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,860
if he was dressed as Han Solo when he said that?

1167
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,800
I would know, of course, for me, yes,

1168
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,960
but we'd be laughing at him, you see.

1169
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,760
I think he's, they're all smart to not.

1170
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:19,680
the actors are smart to not,

1171
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,100
but I would prefer if they forced,

1172
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:25,180
an 80 year old Harrison Ford into the outfit one more time.

1173
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,720
Put it on, we've got the prototype of the real lightsaber.

1174
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,200
It does hurt people, we will hurt you.

1175
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,360
Put on the outfit.

1176
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:35,060
This is how they're making Indy five happen by the way.

1177
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,200
Yeah, Josh Demaro has the saber,

1178
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,160
he will slice your arm off Harrison.

1179
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,580
You don't wanna make Josh Demaro mad,

1180
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:44,660
Disneyland president.

1181
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,760
Do not want to cross him.

1182
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:54,020
Yeah, so this is, yeah, the video is fun.

1183
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,640
I did, I watched a little bit of the video.

1184
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,780
This Doc Brown also looks a little like Darryl Hammondish.

1185
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,120
Sure, there's a Hammond-esque look to him.

1186
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,480
He does look older though,

1187
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,760
the Doc Brown from the Nickelodeon time capsule one

1188
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,500
was so like lean and lanky.

1189
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:14,640
Like it kind of, yeah, he definitely-

1190
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,260
Like a younger mad scientist for sure,

1191
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,600
but like not quite Doc Brown.

1192
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,500
That guy was like Beakman.

1193
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,900
He was like a different color haired Beakman.

1194
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,120
Yeah, I liked Beakman as a child.

1195
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:30,840
I will be on record as saying I was a big Beakman guy.

1196
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,120
Oh yeah, but Beakman isn't Doc Brown.

1197
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,640
Right, there's a younger, I found a guy who looks younger

1198
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,040
too in the 1997 Doc Brown.

1199
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:43,320
I don't know if you guys saw a 1997 Doc Brown,

1200
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,540
but he's different.

1201
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,640
I do have that in my search.

1202
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:48,340
You have this guy?

1203
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1204
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:50,600
Should we get a taste of him?

1205
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,220
Is he audible?

1206
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,380
I've seen him about five years.

1207
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,240
Keep those dancing.

1208
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:56,980
Hello there.

1209
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:59,700
Oh hi, Doc Brown coming live from University of Florida.

1210
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,320
Of course I'm coming live.

1211
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:02,560
And that's like, okay-

1212
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,040
This guy's got like a drifter vibe.

1213
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,360
He's got like a five o'clock shadow.

1214
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,300
He looks like he's like in his thirties.

1215
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,000
Yeah, he looks like he's been hitchhiking.

1216
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,920
He's got the voice part,

1217
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,440
Dr.

1218
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:13,520
Brown, da da da da.

1219
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,180
He has like that cadence.

1220
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:17,300
And then it sort of like goes away.

1221
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,000
Oh, you've got the pattern.

1222
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,620
You're from Scotland.

1223
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:20,920
I've been there.

1224
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,320
I just got a head start.

1225
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,280
I was there about three and a half weeks ago.

1226
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,040
And then he kind of just like,

1227
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,480
it just starts talking to like this guy.

1228
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:30,620
He's like kind of a little bit more like this.

1229
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,620
I learned on the age when he hit about six times.

1230
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,680
I'll never drive in Scotland again.

1231
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,480
Next time I'll take a train.

1232
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:39,480
Take care.

1233
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,580
I don't know if he does have the pattern.

1234
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,520
I know, yeah, driving in Scotland is a tough-

1235
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,040
The first time, the first thing is Jason saying,

1236
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:51,020
I feel like he has his way in with the cadence at the top

1237
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,080
and then it sort of goes away.

1238
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,040
Then he sort of loses it.

1239
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:55,800
Yeah.

1240
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,780
I think they need to,

1241
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,080
one thing I think they could do

1242
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,960
is switch up the outfit sometimes

1243
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,080
because Ian Park, Doc Brown,

1244
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:09,400
always has the pseudo graphic printed button-up,

1245
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,100
aloha shirt with the, is it the train?

1246
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,700
Is it the time train on it?

1247
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,420
I think so.

1248
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,480
There's a couple different shirts,

1249
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,660
but it's, yeah, the ones I have here are the time train.

1250
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:20,040
Yeah.

1251
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,200
It's like a, if John Lasseter had a

1252
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,820
back to the future time train shirt,

1253
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,000
that's what it would look like.

1254
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:26,880
Which he probably does.

1255
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,900
He probably bought one of them.

1256
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,460
Which a hundred percent he has one of these train shirts.

1257
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,060
Yeah, I know what you're saying.

1258
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:36,680
Cause it's like, why don't we have just like full

1259
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,840
kind of like white jumpsuit,

1260
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,760
like shopping mall back to the future one doc ever.

1261
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,040
Why is it this?

1262
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,740
I guess he's at the Institute

1263
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,340
cause he works at the Institute.

1264
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,500
So it's connecting to that mythology.

1265
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,560
But the Institute is gone now.

1266
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,860
So he can wear whatever he wants.

1267
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,700
He could wear whatever he wants from any time.

1268
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:56,960
He could have the red and yellow, you know,

1269
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:57,880
from the future.

1270
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,460
Well, I mean, Jason brings,

1271
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,200
you do bring up a good point

1272
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,980
because when we went to the eighties night at Disneyland,

1273
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,920
a big draw was Mickey in his jazzer size,

1274
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,960
like mouse, excuse me, mouse her size costume,

1275
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,860
which is just like yellow sweats.

1276
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,600
And everyone is flipping out.

1277
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,960
And the same thing with totally Minnie.

1278
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:16,580
Minnie was in her eighties outfit.

1279
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,660
And that was such a big draw.

1280
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,080
So I do feel like, you know,

1281
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,340
Doc Brown has several iconic outfits.

1282
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:25,740
The cowboy outfit, he has the future yellow outfit

1283
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,640
with the jacket and the tie,

1284
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,800
which that toy is coming out in a few months,

1285
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,260
very excited about it.

1286
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,740
But if Doc got in different outfits,

1287
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:36,420
I feel like that would be a draw for the audience.

1288
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:37,500
If you know like, oh, you know,

1289
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,520
Doc Brown's got a new outfit today.

1290
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,440
Let's go find him.

1291
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,300
Let's go take a photo.

1292
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,120
Do you think that,

1293
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,140
or do you think that most of the people

1294
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:47,400
at Universal Studios are like in a haze

1295
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,900
of like three massive beers

1296
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:52,880
and barely remember what the movie was?

1297
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,080
Well, okay.

1298
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,300
Well, I think.

1299
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,200
There's us, but then there, you know what I mean.

1300
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,080
It depends how big the audience of us is.

1301
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,500
And it's specifically Universal.

1302
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,500
Cause I would say almost any Disney night,

1303
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:05,880
yes, a hundred percent.

1304
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,280
That 80s night was sold out or close sold out.

1305
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,000
And I'm sure a lot of people in there

1306
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,360
were very excited to see Mickey wearing a sweatsuit.

1307
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,320
So if-

1308
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:21,040
You're combining us and back to the future fans.

1309
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,600
That like, there is a rabbit fan base.

1310
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,240
Back to the future fans are out of their minds.

1311
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:25,920
Yeah.

1312
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,800
So I do think, and again, it's not dad.

1313
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,220
It's not your average dad going down there.

1314
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,480
That's like, oh, we're going to go see Doc

1315
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,900
wearing a different shirt, huh?

1316
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,300
I spent this much money to go see Doc in a different shirt.

1317
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,740
Like that's, yes, you're right, of course.

1318
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,800
And is it 90% of people like that?

1319
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,620
You may be, but that 10% still a nice chunk of people

1320
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,780
and they're going to be very excited.

1321
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,380
Do you think that there's,

1322
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,220
Universal is going to make a profit

1323
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:58,200
that would even pay for the new clothing to be made?

1324
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:59,100
Do you think enough?

1325
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,240
Like, are you going to make a trip up that you hear

1326
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:07,140
that Doc Brown has a new shirt or new type of goggles

1327
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,880
and you're going to go, you will go just for that.

1328
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,560
Hook me to the lie detector.

1329
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:14,960
If they said Doc Brown was wearing his

1330
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,080
back to the future two yellow outfit,

1331
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,960
I would be excited and absolutely go up there

1332
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,800
and go see him just for that.

1333
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,740
Obviously he'd go on another ride, have something to eat,

1334
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,360
but absolutely I would go up there just for that.

1335
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:32,500
And I swear on whatever you'd like me to swear on.

1336
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:33,760
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1337
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,380
If it was old West stuff, would you like that?

1338
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:37,920
Or is that like the,

1339
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,320
I like that.

1340
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:38,800
Well, we don't care

1341
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,820
about the old West as much.

1342
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,800
We don't care about the old West as much.

1343
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:42,700
I like that.

1344
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,920
And if I was going up there,

1345
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,700
I absolutely make a point to do it.

1346
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,800
But if Doc was wearing his back to the future two outfit,

1347
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,440
I will make a trip.

1348
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,640
I will plan a day around it.

1349
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:56,120
And if Doc was wearing Mickey's

1350
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:56,520
jumpsuit.

1351
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:56,860
Jumpsuit.

1352
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,880
Sweatsuit, that I would think definitely you would go.

1353
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:01,840
Definitely I would go,

1354
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,100
cause it would be very confusing.

1355
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,120
The marketing would be interesting too.

1356
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,060
I would be like, gotta see what this is all about.

1357
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,180
Is this like a shots fired at Disney thing?

1358
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:10,840
I don't know.

1359
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:11,700
Yeah.

1360
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:14,140
So yes, I absolutely would go up to see that.

1361
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:16,160
Is there, I mean, is there a Doc Brown outfit

1362
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,220
you guys would want to see him in at the parks?

1363
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,720
And you could be not in the movies either.

1364
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,880
It could be in one of those fantasy crossovers.

1365
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,320
He could be wearing a Ninja Turtle outfit.

1366
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,900
You could be wearing Splinter's robe.

1367
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,680
That's pretty good.

1368
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:33,540
Pretty good.

1369
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,420
How about just like a full like,

1370
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,600
how about like vanilla ices jumpsuit

1371
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,380
from the ice ice baby video.

1372
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:44,400
Ice ice baby or, yeah, that would be good.

1373
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,320
You would absolutely go up if you, if they said,

1374
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:50,540
oh yeah, Doc Brown's wearing vanilla ices clothes today.

1375
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,060
You go, what the hell?

1376
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:52,520
Why?

1377
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,820
Clearly this is, I think now we've opened a straight.

1378
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,660
Universal, obviously what you have to do

1379
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:01,260
is put Doc Brown in other people's clothes.

1380
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:03,560
It's right there.

1381
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,160
Why aren't you doing it?

1382
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,280
You know, Disney is smarter.

1383
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,920
Disney is smarter about a lot of this stuff.

1384
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,240
And we've talked about the marketing from the merchandise

1385
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,580
to certain events.

1386
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,960
And yeah, Universal's got to listen to this and take this.

1387
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:16,500
They're catching up.

1388
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,500
They've got walls of retro merchandise.

1389
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,000
I did see this.

1390
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,240
I did see this and they're getting there.

1391
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,460
They're definitely getting there.

1392
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:26,120
But again, until they make Scott's genius idea

1393
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,720
for a drink for the sugar, Mr.

1394
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,880
DNA in a drink,

1395
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,880
I'm not going to think they've arrived.

1396
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,200
I think that's still the greatest idea.

1397
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:40,100
No, they got to up the drink game, as I said.

1398
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,540
I, yeah.

1399
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:45,540
Giant gigantic sleepy beers is what I associate with them.

1400
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,520
Yeah, they should have.

1401
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,180
They gotta space it up.

1402
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:51,600
Like they have the Tiki, the Nautilus Tiki thing,

1403
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,560
Tiki drink that I have.

1404
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,400
What if there's a DeLorean Tiki,

1405
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,020
or a DeLorean thing you drink a bunch of rum out of,

1406
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,100
a DeLorean cup of some kind?

1407
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:03,820
Well, you know what, like, you know,

1408
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:04,920
being that the Mr.

1409
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:05,780
Fusion is something

1410
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,620
that you just throw a bunch of stuff in and mix it up

1411
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:09,980
and somehow it makes fuel,

1412
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,500
if there was a bar that you could go to

1413
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:13,180
where there was a Mr.

1414
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,060
Fusion and that was the blender,

1415
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:17,500
and it was a bunch of disparate ingredients,

1416
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,620
but somehow it works and makes a great drink.

1417
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,020
There you go.

1418
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,000
Another million dollar idea.

1419
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,480
If the Institute of Future Technology had to go away,

1420
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:31,760
but it became the Institute of Future Mixology.

1421
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,900
Oh, come on.

1422
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,160
Yes, that make a little,

1423
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,760
like we just scaled back our efforts,

1424
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,580
we got in too much trouble with time travel,

1425
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,060
so we're going to a less risky science.

1426
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,900
And then there's a little, it's Doc Brown's bar.

1427
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,180
This is free money.

1428
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,860
This is free money for them.

1429
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,560
You know who founds it?

1430
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,900
The kids, Doc Brown's children.

1431
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:54,820
Oh, Jules and Lur, yeah.

1432
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:55,860
Jules and Byrne.

1433
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,320
Are there going to be scumbags?

1434
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,600
You know from how they are and when you see them quickly.

1435
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:03,660
No, they got into apothecare,

1436
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,960
they got into like, you know, the old west,

1437
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:08,760
there was all this sort of a, you know, snake oil

1438
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:13,020
and pharmacy, early pharmacies where soda fountains were,

1439
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,600
and then they traveled to the future

1440
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,460
and found out about craft cocktails

1441
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:20,580
and the explosion in tiki culture in America in the 50s.

1442
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:23,640
And they're like, we're opening a bar in a theme park

1443
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,420
with tiki drinks based on our father's like cool stuff.

1444
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,420
So they got, I'm sorry,

1445
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,420
they got the best ingredients from all across time

1446
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:36,680
and we're going to blend things like weird old,

1447
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,340
like things that would make you go blind in 1870

1448
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:41,880
with drinks that haven't even been invented yet.

1449
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,040
This is a great bar idea.

1450
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,000
Oh man.

1451
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,100
This would be perfect.

1452
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,580
And I like the idea that the bar is run by like a 10

1453
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:49,920
and a 12 year old too.

1454
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:50,860
That's pretty good.

1455
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,980
That's a fun angle.

1456
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:55,200
Constantly pointing at his crotch.

1457
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:56,440
Yeah, right.

1458
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,520
Yes, the iconic scene.

1459
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:03,880
Truly, sometimes we stumble into legitimately good ideas.

1460
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,780
That one's, that's really good.

1461
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,620
Yeah, that's a fantastic idea.

1462
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:11,280
And Doc Brown would wear different clothes

1463
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,600
in the bar sometimes.

1464
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,860
Yes, you'd cycle through outfits.

1465
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,560
You can run it all like a food trail.

1466
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,900
Like it's all like made out of a Deloria.

1467
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,340
Like you do make the drinks up on top of it.

1468
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:23,600
That's great too.

1469
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:24,460
Yeah.

1470
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,200
That's kind of cool.

1471
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,100
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot, I mean, yes, there's that way.

1472
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:32,260
There's the making it look like future Hill Valley

1473
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,540
or whatever, or whatever.

1474
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:36,360
Look, when the contract for Simpsons is up

1475
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:41,480
and Disney pulls the plug and somehow the fan obsession

1476
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,980
of like, bring it back.

1477
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,220
Yeah, we are actually going to do it this time.

1478
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,760
We're gonna do a Hill Valley street

1479
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,460
and then we'll do a Back to the Future ride.

1480
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:51,980
The Doc Brown Tiki Bar, you know,

1481
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,560
the Brown family Tiki Bar.

1482
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,200
Sure.

1483
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:55,760
Yeah.

1484
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:57,400
Well, we're talking about an area

1485
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,640
where there was a Doc Brown dining establishment.

1486
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,180
And we talked about this a little bit

1487
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,420
when we did Back to the Future a couple of years ago.

1488
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,740
But this is also is one of the most prominent uses

1489
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:09,800
of off-brand Doc Brown,

1490
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,860
that you would go to Doc Brown's chicken,

1491
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,940
which in general, why did, we talked about it last time,

1492
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:20,560
but once again, why did Doc Brown have a fried chicken place?

1493
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,160
I think the theory may have been that he has white hair

1494
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:27,040
like Colonel Sanders, so therefore they are similar figures.

1495
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:29,900
And so why not throw these things together?

1496
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,080
Doesn't quite add up, but I don't know.

1497
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,860
A lot of people, I think, like Doc Brown's chicken.

1498
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,820
I can remember a time when it was good.

1499
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:40,220
I feel like maybe not the last time I went,

1500
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,040
but maybe like when they opened it

1501
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,860
and they were like actually paying attention to the food.

1502
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,600
I think I remember thinking,

1503
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:49,940
I like Doc Brown's fried chicken, that's worth a trip.

1504
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,400
But it's gone, not there anymore.

1505
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,860
Yeah, it's the same though.

1506
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:57,960
Apparently there was a restaurant real close to there.

1507
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,120
They've been serving chicken there,

1508
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:03,640
well, I have it 1915.

1509
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,660
There was a chicken restaurant there.

1510
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,780
So there's a long history of chicken in that location,

1511
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:10,800
which I assume is why they were like, well, I don't know,

1512
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:14,100
Doc Brown has a chicken restaurant, I guess.

1513
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,460
And then now they're still serving the same chicken,

1514
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,540
but it's Cletus's Chicken Shack

1515
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:22,300
in vaguely the same location at the Simpsons land.

1516
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,840
So the chicken, the line runs through the chicken there

1517
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:29,220
for about a hundred years at Universal.

1518
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:34,020
And I've never loved the chicken.

1519
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:37,640
My memory of it was like, okay, all right.

1520
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,440
It was funny to go through the line.

1521
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:42,000
I like that line to see the pictures.

1522
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:46,340
Well, which that, so we talked about this and this again,

1523
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:50,880
sort of the bizarre lack of attention to detail

1524
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:54,980
that Universal's lately they're more on their game,

1525
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,620
but in the 90s again, I don't know, whatever,

1526
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:00,560
to go get a guy who fits the Doc Brown costume

1527
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,620
and go take a bunch of pictures with him.

1528
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,680
And there were all these great photos of him

1529
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,760
visiting world landmarks, but clearly just,

1530
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:09,960
and you're like, this is a pretty narrow hallway.

1531
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:11,620
So you're right next to these photos.

1532
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:15,160
So there is no question that this is some guy

1533
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,840
and not Christopher Lloyd.

1534
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,760
Do you guys have some of these photos?

1535
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,320
I have them, I could bring them up.

1536
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,220
Oh yeah, you go for it.

1537
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:25,520
I have a video of a person taking the picture

1538
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,060
or taking a photo or video,

1539
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:27,920
but yeah, you go for it.

1540
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:29,180
Yeah, it's better if it's photos.

1541
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:30,600
Let's see.

1542
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:35,260
So this is, let's just like meditate

1543
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:36,660
on a couple of these photos.

1544
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:40,860
So we got, here's one big tableau.

1545
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:42,840
Here's, all right.

1546
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,420
So it's Doc Brown.

1547
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:48,940
He always has fried chicken in the photos somewhere.

1548
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,980
He's holding it up or he's pointing with it.

1549
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:56,240
So here he is, time traveling to the Eiffel Tower

1550
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:00,020
and Stonehenge and next to the British guards

1551
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,140
at Buckingham Palace.

1552
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:04,620
But like, you could go to all these now.

1553
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,000
This isn't time travel.

1554
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,660
That's most of these.

1555
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,120
Do we know that he actually time traveled

1556
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,840
or did he just travel, did he get on a plane?

1557
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:13,500
Do we know?

1558
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,240
We don't necessarily know.

1559
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:17,160
I guess they don't establish that.

1560
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:20,620
I would just think like, why not put him in,

1561
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:25,380
you know, what's clearly the Roman Empire

1562
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:29,180
or some crazy future place we don't recognize.

1563
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,540
Like marching in the French Revolution

1564
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:33,340
or something in Paris.

1565
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:36,760
To make you know it was a different time.

1566
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:39,140
This isn't quite time travel so much

1567
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:41,100
as just international travel.

1568
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:42,620
Yes, yeah.

1569
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:44,660
Plenty possible.

1570
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:48,000
That's not special about Doc Brown, except right now.

1571
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,020
Nobody can do it right now.

1572
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,640
You know, here is the Taj Mahal.

1573
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,920
That's not, you could go there now.

1574
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,860
Statue of Liberty, yes, yeah.

1575
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:56,200
Like what?

1576
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,240
I kind of hadn't thought about it before.

1577
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,760
But then you jump way ahead to the moon.

1578
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:06,640
Now he's on the moon giving an astronaut

1579
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,420
a piece of fried chicken outside of the suit.

1580
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,680
Except wait a minute, oh, this is a little joke.

1581
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:12,600
If you, I didn't catch this.

1582
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:13,900
If you look in the reflection,

1583
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,600
this is I think a faked moon landing

1584
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:17,440
is what they're implying.

1585
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:19,680
Is there's a bunch of stuff in his helmet.

1586
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:20,480
Oh yes, right.

1587
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:22,960
So Doc helped fake the moon landing.

1588
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,640
Doc was part of the conspiracy to fake the moon landing

1589
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,340
and he fed the crew too in addition to helping fake.

1590
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:34,300
He helped, he was like doing, he was crafty.

1591
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:35,580
He was doing catering.

1592
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,540
He catered for Stanley Kubrick's shooting

1593
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:39,620
of the moon landing.

1594
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:40,880
Right, so.

1595
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:41,560
They were friends.

1596
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,680
I do like, by the way, I do like what that says.

1597
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:46,820
I like that addition of canon there.

1598
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:48,720
Yeah, yeah, that's pretty good.

1599
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,740
But then you start getting into, well like now he's showing

1600
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:54,180
up in, here's a little more of what I want.

1601
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:56,840
Cause here he is with Gerald Ford.

1602
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:58,840
Who is Gerald Ford with?

1603
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,460
Does anybody know better than me?

1604
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:02,840
They Russian.

1605
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,460
What is he doing wearing like Russian hats?

1606
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,100
So I'm not sure.

1607
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,600
Is that Khrushchev?

1608
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:08,300
Could be.

1609
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:10,120
Much smarter people would know.

1610
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:15,400
Here he is storming the Capitol.

1611
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:21,440
He was there a day early.

1612
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,480
Dang, I missed it.

1613
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:26,960
Oh well, just enjoy a drumstick then.

1614
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,360
Holding up his chicken.

1615
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:33,200
But then a couple of them are just a real decrease in stakes.

1616
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:34,680
You know, if you're going to all the best places

1617
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,700
in the world, you gotta go to the Hard Rock Cafe

1618
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:38,840
at City Walk.

1619
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:43,180
He's pretending to rock out in front of the big guitar.

1620
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,040
He's, okay, real quick, a quick note about some

1621
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,500
of the portrayals I would find on YouTube and these pictures.

1622
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:54,480
They make Doc Brown like a real like goofy, fun, loving guy,

1623
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:58,100
which is not the right character.

1624
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,880
Like he's dancing in Universal.

1625
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,400
He's not like a cut loose kind of guy here and there,

1626
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,460
but he was pretty uptight in the movies.

1627
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:07,600
I know that's-

1628
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:07,920
He's pretty neurotic.

1629
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:14,640
to City Walk, he would play air guitar.

1630
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:15,660
No.

1631
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:16,600
It's a bit out of character.

1632
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:17,140
It looks foolish.

1633
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:18,120
Yeah, absolutely.

1634
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:23,700
Would he go in front of the 3D Hulk that was long

1635
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:27,620
on the theater marquee of the movie theater up there

1636
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:31,100
and make a face like Hulk?

1637
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:33,840
It doesn't feel, that doesn't seem right.

1638
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,900
That doesn't seem like the Doc Brown I know.

1639
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:37,380
Yeah, yeah.

1640
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,760
And again, why are we just, well, I was going to say,

1641
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,240
like when you can go anywhere in the world,

1642
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:43,740
why are we just going to City Walk?

1643
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:47,800
And yet that's a mistake we've made for many episodes

1644
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:51,960
in a row and we'll continue to make outside of the podcast.

1645
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:52,700
That's true.

1646
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:58,820
He wanted to travel to what, like 2002 era City Walk

1647
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:02,280
to meet Eric Bana at the premiere.

1648
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,140
Is that, does that line up?

1649
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,720
That's the hope we're looking at, I think.

1650
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:07,940
Maybe, yeah.

1651
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:10,840
Yeah, he wanted to, as would, I mean, God,

1652
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,160
if we had a time machine, if we had a DeLorean,

1653
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:16,400
we would certainly go to the greatest moments

1654
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,560
in City Walk history.

1655
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:21,240
We'd go see Kevin Sorbo riding a horse around

1656
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:24,240
to the premiere of Crull the Conqueror.

1657
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,260
Boys, boys, we have to go back.

1658
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:30,220
We have to go to the third story of wizards.

1659
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:35,840
We must see all the flaws of wizards.

1660
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:37,340
Boys, boys.

1661
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:38,760
There's no wizards in the future.

1662
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,520
The future has no wizards.

1663
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,640
Well, yeah, that makes sense.

1664
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,700
Kind of a weird business model.

1665
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,740
Seems like kind of the product of its time

1666
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:46,740
and probably wouldn't make it.

1667
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:49,320
Boys, boys, I'm getting weak.

1668
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,400
I'm getting weak.

1669
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,820
We've got to stop the restaurant group behind Country Star

1670
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:56,680
from stealing my chicken recipe.

1671
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:02,700
Let's see, so, and then just,

1672
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,000
we got Doc Brown's beverages.

1673
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,000
Oh, yes.

1674
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,540
Really scary, like,

1675
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:10,340
I mean, that looks like the CGI Orville Redenbacher.

1676
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:10,980
Yes, it does.

1677
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:11,580
Yes.

1678
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:12,520
Holding a Coke.

1679
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,460
That's really, that's very frightening.

1680
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,740
I also just, while I have this open,

1681
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,840
I, you know, in terms of other off-brand Doc Brown moments,

1682
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:24,420
here's, apparently, there was crossover.

1683
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:28,840
I think after there was all the accident on the tram route

1684
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:32,260
and King Kong burn up, then they had a big event to say,

1685
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,980
when they rebuilt all the New York sets,

1686
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,000
say the trams back, it's better than ever.

1687
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:38,120
And they had Doc Brown handing out balloons,

1688
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:42,840
tying them to the tram and who else but Clump.

1689
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:43,880
Oh, wow.

1690
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:44,440
What's his name?

1691
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,720
Sherman Clump?

1692
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,020
Sherman Clump?

1693
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:49,380
Yeah, yeah, Sherman Clump, yeah, the Nutty Professor.

1694
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:52,720
I've never seen that walk around.

1695
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:53,100
Never.

1696
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:54,280
That's a good walk around.

1697
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:54,720
Yeah.

1698
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,620
I have never seen a Sherman Clump walk around.

1699
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:57,060
Wow.

1700
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:57,580
No.

1701
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,980
I'm not sure they ever did it again.

1702
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,240
That might've just been that day, but what a mistake.

1703
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:06,700
And of course, Doc Brown is also a Nutty Professor.

1704
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,880
So it makes sense to pair these guys up.

1705
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,940
And here they are, giving each other a big chest pound.

1706
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:14,100
How great is this?

1707
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:14,720
Wow.

1708
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,920
This is another perfect crossover

1709
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:19,800
that we should have gotten.

1710
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:20,560
Yes, another.

1711
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:21,400
Absolutely.

1712
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,600
Right, and this is what?

1713
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:25,680
What is Nutty Professor, 98, 99?

1714
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:29,000
You're still a few years before the cutoff.

1715
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:33,740
Yeah, this would've been perfect.

1716
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:37,840
I mean, yeah, Doc Brown and Robin Williams' Flubber.

1717
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:40,900
The doctors, like a league of extraordinary gentlemen

1718
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:41,840
of doctors.

1719
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:42,580
Dr.

1720
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:43,800
T and the women?

1721
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,720
All the doctors from the 90s.

1722
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:52,340
Cinema's best doctors.

1723
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:54,520
I mean, that's the C, yeah.

1724
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:56,680
Get all of the, what isn't possible

1725
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:59,200
when you get all the crazy doctors working in one bit?

1726
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,880
Maybe working, well, or what if the Institute

1727
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:04,700
of Future Technology is one outpost

1728
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:08,840
and they are enemies of the thing that kind of rips it off

1729
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,980
in Epcot lore with Eric Idle?

1730
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:13,120
What is that?

1731
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,820
It's the Inventors Institute.

1732
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:16,820
Imagination Institute.

1733
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:18,300
The Imagination Institute, yeah,

1734
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,300
the Imagination Institute and the Institute

1735
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,840
of Future Technology are in a bitter war

1736
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:25,980
and they engage in chemical warfare.

1737
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,140
They attack each other.

1738
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:34,060
They try to like, all right, Einstein invented the bomb.

1739
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,420
So he's on ours, Einstein's gonna help us out.

1740
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:38,300
He's gonna build a bomb to blow up

1741
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,560
the Imagination Institute.

1742
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:45,220
Well, we got the guy who made the hydrogen bomb,

1743
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,280
whatever else it did.

1744
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:50,800
They're like deploying history's greatest weapons

1745
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,720
manufacturers to hurt each other.

1746
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:54,020
That's great, yeah.

1747
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:57,720
There is a chance we almost could have gotten

1748
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:01,340
something like that because the Dark Universe movies,

1749
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:06,940
in the Mummy movie, Russell Crowe's Mr.

1750
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:07,840
High, Dr.

1751
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:08,600
Jekyll,

1752
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:11,020
was the head of a secret organization

1753
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:13,500
and in the Godzilla Kong movies,

1754
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:15,240
there's this organization, Monarch,

1755
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:17,280
that ties them all together.

1756
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,480
So like Monarch versus Dark Universe,

1757
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,380
you could have had Kong versus Godzilla

1758
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:25,180
versus Dracula versus Mummy.

1759
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:26,820
Oh man.

1760
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:27,720
That's good.

1761
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:30,520
I mean, I would have preferred it in the early 90s,

1762
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,120
but yes, you're right.

1763
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,100
That would have been, I would have been happy with that

1764
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,820
and we'll probably still try to get there.

1765
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,740
Versus Abbott, Abbott and Costello meet Dracula

1766
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:45,220
and Frankenstein and Doc Brown and Dark Universe and Monarch.

1767
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,700
And they tie together because they're all like

1768
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:49,760
theme park walk around type character.

1769
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:52,700
I guess it's Laurel and Hardy in Universal, but whatever.

1770
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:55,420
They're all friends, they hang out.

1771
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:58,940
TikTok Laurel, like Laurel and Hardy 2.

1772
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:00,120
0,

1773
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:01,960
there's a couple of TikTokers,

1774
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:05,260
have a couple of TikTokers have tried to license

1775
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:06,840
like Laurel and Hardy.

1776
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:11,040
That's the plan with all these old IP.

1777
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,780
We're just gonna have a new Laurel and Hardy

1778
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:17,700
and they live, they do their physical comedy routines

1779
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,940
fully licensed on TikTok now.

1780
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,520
Well, look, I mean, I don't want,

1781
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:23,860
this is a whole nother episode,

1782
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:25,400
but as you gentlemen know,

1783
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:29,120
I accidentally stumbled on the owner of Laurel and Hardy.

1784
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:34,220
Oh yeah, wait, and who's that and why again?

1785
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,000
Well, it is Larry Harmon Productions.

1786
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:40,780
Larry Harmon owns Bozo and Laurel and Hardy.

1787
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,820
And I am very intrigued by it.

1788
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:48,760
And there's like one phone number and like one fax number

1789
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,780
you can call to contact about licensing

1790
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:53,580
for both of these properties.

1791
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:55,780
The Laurel and Hardy property,

1792
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:57,800
which of course were two real men.

1793
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:58,680
That's right.

1794
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,860
Two men that existed.

1795
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,580
But if you wanna license them,

1796
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:04,060
you have to call Larry Harmon Productions, I guess.

1797
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:07,380
And also, oh, of course, Bozo was the,

1798
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,520
I forgot it already.

1799
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:12,740
They also own a property about like Bozo's like clown babies,

1800
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:16,620
which is something I think Scott would be a big fan of.

1801
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:19,280
Oh God, clown babies.

1802
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:22,840
I'd have to find the exact wording of the property.

1803
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,280
Oh yeah, I was correct.

1804
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,160
It's Bozo's Clown Babies,

1805
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,000
which is something that you cannot find

1806
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,960
a lot of information about on the internet,

1807
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,780
but here's like a rattle you could buy

1808
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:35,120
that says Bozo's Clown Babies on it.

1809
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:38,200
And here's one of the clown babies right there.

1810
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,340
Jesus, awful, awful.

1811
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:43,580
Why would, okay, there's two options here.

1812
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:47,160
Either these are babies who are made to be made up

1813
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,900
like clowns, which you can't do.

1814
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,780
I've got a baby, he wouldn't sit still

1815
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:54,280
to put a bunch of makeup on, and it probably would be toxic.

1816
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:56,240
I can't glue a wig to his head.

1817
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:57,920
That would be awful, it'd be torture.

1818
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:02,100
So the other option is that like clowns are freaks.

1819
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:04,580
So they're like born that way.

1820
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,020
And so if these are like,

1821
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:09,120
if these babies are genetic clowns

1822
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:11,480
who came out of the womb looking like that,

1823
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:14,440
then that's too horrifying of a thought to even get into.

1824
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:16,600
Whatever the episode we were talking about,

1825
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,240
Cliffy the Clown, the what, Smacks mascot?

1826
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,200
Was that the cereal?

1827
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:21,760
Yeah, one time Smacks mascot.

1828
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:22,160
That's right.

1829
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,020
Cliffy the Clown.

1830
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,120
I believe we sort of figured out at the end

1831
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:28,080
that perhaps some of these clowns hatch out of clown eggs.

1832
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:34,740
So maybe Bozo's Clown Babies did hatch out of clown eggs.

1833
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,320
And again, this is gonna be, I'm gonna dive into this.

1834
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,680
We haven't done Bozo, I'm a big Bozo fan.

1835
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:42,660
We of course, we'll get to Billy Corgan appearing

1836
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:44,120
on the last Bozo show.

1837
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:48,960
I watch Bozo a lot as a kid.

1838
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,400
So we'll get to the Bozo's Clown Babies in Bozo

1839
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:52,480
and Mr.

1840
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:54,780
Professor Andy, his musical director

1841
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:57,980
and Whizzo the Magician, all of the cast of characters

1842
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,380
that I love so much as a child.

1843
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:01,980
I could really use an off-brand Doc Brown

1844
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:04,560
to run in and rescue.

1845
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,480
You've got to come with me.

1846
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,180
There's gonna be a terrible episode

1847
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:12,120
all about scary clowns and being hatched out of clown eggs.

1848
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:13,860
We have to stop it.

1849
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:17,720
2016 Doc, or 2017 Doc Brown shows up at your door.

1850
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,920
It's like, Scott, you're gonna get an offer

1851
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,700
to do a podcast, don't do it.

1852
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:24,800
You will be.

1853
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:26,800
Talks about rides and theme parks and stuff.

1854
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:27,840
That's all stuff I like.

1855
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,020
No, but it's gonna be about all these other things.

1856
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,280
Horrible clowns and creatures that aren't cute who pee.

1857
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:37,220
And a name you'll never forget, Randy Kerber.

1858
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:41,440
There's gonna be so much about this tequila company.

1859
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:43,040
Is there anything like inherently funny

1860
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:43,860
about the tequila company?

1861
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:45,740
No, there's nothing funny about it.

1862
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:47,660
It just keeps coming up for some reason.

1863
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,940
And you'll be like, oh my God.

1864
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:53,600
And you get in the car with him and I guess you kill us?

1865
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:54,140
I don't know.

1866
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:55,920
You think you might murder us?

1867
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,280
I think that that's gonna be the plan.

1868
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,660
And then like, okay, there you are.

1869
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:00,660
Here's the gun.

1870
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:01,320
What?

1871
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:03,460
I have to kill myself?

1872
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:04,480
That's the only one way.

1873
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,440
How am I here now?

1874
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,820
If I did, if I killed my past self,

1875
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:10,440
I don't know, we'll go find another one.

1876
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:13,700
We'll find another juncture in the space time continuum.

1877
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:17,440
But here's the gun and get to it or else I'll do it.

1878
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,160
No, I guess I should.

1879
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:20,420
It is me.

1880
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,480
Sorry, boy.

1881
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:27,160
Turn around, think of a good place.

1882
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:28,260
Think of a field.

1883
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:29,880
And then after you're done, he's like,

1884
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:32,020
but now we are going to see the little giants.

1885
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,260
Okay, now next plan.

1886
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:39,320
Okay, the mystery, man.

1887
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,060
We have to take the little giants,

1888
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,220
put them in a DeLorean and have them go play

1889
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:44,020
against the rookie of the year team.

1890
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:49,260
I'm gonna go combine all of the 90 sports teams

1891
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:50,260
into one thing.

1892
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:52,940
The small soldiers need your help.

1893
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:58,880
All very good, all movies perfect.

1894
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,260
They would be perfect movies.

1895
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:02,100
Yeah, yeah.

1896
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:05,240
But the star of them could only be not the best.

1897
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:08,500
Not Christopher Lloyd, but just some guy.

1898
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:12,900
Which now I'm immediately convinced that,

1899
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,300
like early in the episode was I convinced

1900
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:16,400
that this is a good thing.

1901
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,100
They shouldn't be more accurate.

1902
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:20,000
I like that they're weird and off.

1903
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:23,920
May this always be part of the fabric of Universal.

1904
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,420
Get Klump up there too.

1905
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:26,540
Oh yeah.

1906
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:28,940
This photo I'm looking at where they're chest bumping,

1907
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:30,220
this is immediately iconic.

1908
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:34,420
Get Doc Brown and Klump chest bumping every day in the park.

1909
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:36,100
Then I'll be back up there.

1910
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:38,240
Get everybody wearing different shirts all the time

1911
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,360
and then Mike will be back up there.

1912
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,180
Jason, do you have a specific request

1913
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:45,800
of what you want from Doc Brown in the future?

1914
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:51,340
I want him to assemble all of the old,

1915
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:57,360
yes, the old big comedians we were talking about

1916
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,500
that maybe young people have forgotten about

1917
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:02,860
to hold an in-park Algonquin red table

1918
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:06,380
where Groucho is there, Lucille Ball is there,

1919
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,480
Stan, Laurel Hardee.

1920
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:09,120
The Grinch.

1921
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,660
You know what, we can start adding anyone.

1922
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,100
Walk around Grinch.

1923
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,440
Let's get a walk around Dorothy Parker in there.

1924
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,420
Just everyone in there.

1925
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,120
Okay, so do what?

1926
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:24,340
To discuss their work?

1927
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:29,700
They just, they just, yeah, talk about their work.

1928
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:31,900
Maybe people toss them topics.

1929
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,820
They're like, what do you want to hear us talk about?

1930
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,900
It's just gonna rip a panel.

1931
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:38,980
Like Donkey.

1932
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,140
They're gonna riff on the news maybe?

1933
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:44,660
Yeah, it's like, yeah, riffing on the,

1934
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:47,500
yeah, a little more Saul, but it's each one.

1935
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,320
Maybe they're all kind of puppety.

1936
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:53,840
Maybe it's like 12 of those Donkey Shacks in a row.

1937
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:56,120
Whoa, whoa, you've introduced a different element

1938
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:57,280
to this now all of a sudden.

1939
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,100
So they're like robots or?

1940
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:02,780
Well, they're, no, I guess they would still be

1941
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:03,860
like face characters.

1942
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,120
They would still be impressions,

1943
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:08,680
but they can, they just open the curtains around the table

1944
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:11,460
and then they'll interact with you.

1945
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:12,720
They'll take pictures.

1946
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:16,420
So it's wagons around a table now.

1947
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:19,160
A bunch of waffle carts.

1948
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:22,080
12 wagons, there's 12 wagons around a table

1949
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,380
on a Charlie, around a Charlie Rose table.

1950
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:28,500
And then you shout out headlines in the news

1951
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:31,160
and then they just give you their thoughts on it.

1952
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:33,020
And where does it take place again?

1953
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:37,660
Maybe, I guess you'd have to build like,

1954
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,060
well, you'd have to build the table.

1955
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:42,260
You'd have to build the Algonquin round table

1956
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:45,400
and some recreation of the Algonquin Hotel.

1957
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,220
Like not the whole thing, but a little bit.

1958
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:49,440
The budget keeps growing on this project.

1959
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:52,180
But people want immersion, okay?

1960
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:53,860
People are gonna be hungry for immersion

1961
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:55,600
as the world gets back up to speed.

1962
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:57,740
I just want Doc to wear a yellow jacket.

1963
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:00,080
That's all I'm looking for.

1964
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:00,640
Seems easier.

1965
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:01,540
Yeah.

1966
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:02,540
You set the bar high

1967
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:04,640
and then, cause you know, the budget's gonna get cut.

1968
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:05,860
You're gonna have to scale back.

1969
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,260
So I'm going big to start.

1970
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,460
All right, I feel that's fair.

1971
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:09,740
Hey, I'd like to see it.

1972
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,680
I'll go see it if they, again, I will,

1973
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:14,460
if they say we're doing the wagon thing with the table,

1974
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,500
I'll go up there tomorrow.

1975
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:18,060
I wanna see it.

1976
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:23,100
Like a kind of austere, like Dick Cavett-esque setting

1977
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:26,400
where all of history's greatest actors

1978
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:31,720
discuss their lives out of conjoining

1979
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:35,420
or next to each other while at a table.

1980
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:39,780
And maybe like, oh, this isn't sort of meshing well.

1981
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,120
Like just have them all say it, like, you know,

1982
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:44,620
I wouldn't wanna be in any club

1983
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:45,740
that would have me as a member.

1984
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:48,180
You know, they all just start doing the hits, you know.

1985
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,740
Well, you don't want the guy who says that line.

1986
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:53,360
No, that is Groucho.

1987
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,160
That's misattributed to Woody Allen.

1988
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:56,220
Oh, okay.

1989
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:57,300
Oh, that's good.

1990
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:59,540
All right, well, I'm happy to salvage that one.

1991
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:00,840
That's nice information.

1992
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,100
Yeah, that actually, actually,

1993
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:04,800
and there may have been someone who said it,

1994
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:05,260
like H.

1995
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:05,380
L.

1996
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:06,660
Menken may have beat Groucho.

1997
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,900
There's a million people it's credited to,

1998
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:12,880
but I think Groucho is the one that's pointed to most often.

1999
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:14,980
Okay, well, these events are gonna,

2000
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:18,400
this waffle round table is gonna set the record straight

2001
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,440
on all of this.

2002
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:21,680
You just want waffles involved, Jason.

2003
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:22,700
Come on, let's be honest.

2004
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,380
I mean, that is the disappointing thing

2005
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:26,380
is that donkey's not,

2006
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:30,240
his waffle setup is not a full service waffle stand.

2007
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:31,080
Right.

2008
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:32,100
You know, you're right.

2009
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:34,280
If that would make that thing 10 times better, I agree.

2010
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:37,040
Yeah, he should take your order also.

2011
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:37,800
Yes.

2012
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:42,320
Well, I guess we covered all that there is to cover

2013
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:43,940
about people who aren't Doc Brown,

2014
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:46,540
who aren't Christopher Lloyd playing Doc Brown.

2015
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,560
You Survive podcast, The Ride,

2016
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:51,960
off-brand Doc Brown edition.

2017
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:55,520
Keep it tuned here for three episodes every month

2018
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,920
here on the second gate.

2019
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:03,800
And hey, the future's what you make of it, I guess.

2020
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:05,320
Yes.

2021
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:06,660
Yeah, great.

2022
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:07,440
That works.

2023
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:10,380
And I said it with about as much commitment

2024
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:12,040
to some of these Doc Browns.

2025
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,940
Hire us to play Doc Brown.

2026
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,360
That's my last request.

2027
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,100
We're not gonna put any work into it.

2028
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:18,720
We just wanna do it for a day, please.

2029
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:19,860
Hey.

2030
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:20,080
Yeah.

2031
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:22,880
There, that was my audition.

2032
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:25,540
Yes, so just hire us.

2033
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,960
We'll each do a couple hours on the same day.

2034
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:30,460
And it'll be fun.

2035
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:33,700
If we all, yeah, we all trade a part all day in the part,

2036
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:34,920
that sounds pretty fun.

2037
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:35,500
Tag.

2038
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:36,720
Now you're in.

2039
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:38,440
What if we all switched off?

2040
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,680
So like one, I'm playing Lucy for a couple hours.

2041
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:42,540
I'm playing Doc Brown for a couple hours.

2042
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:43,940
I play Grinch for a couple hours.

2043
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,700
I guess the makeup on Grinch is maybe not easy in and out.

2044
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:49,940
But I think that would be great.

2045
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:51,760
We just, yeah, tag off, tag out.

2046
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:55,400
That would really tune up the performing skills.

2047
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:56,980
Like to be able to,

2048
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,660
and you'd have moments where you'd screw up

2049
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:01,440
and you'd be dressed as Lucy, but talk like the Grinch.

2050
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:03,940
But you'd learn from those moments.

2051
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:05,600
Those would be teachable moments.

2052
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:07,260
Teachable moments.

2053
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:09,000
And yeah, you'd just say like,

2054
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,900
oh, I got a frog in my throat or something.

2055
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:13,240
Mr.

2056
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:13,720
Mooney.

2057
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:15,120
And then you just call me back Mr.

2058
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:16,060
Booney.

2059
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:17,640
