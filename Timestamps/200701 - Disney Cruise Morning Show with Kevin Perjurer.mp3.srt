1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:25,880
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate, a podcast that, unlike today's topic, is available

3
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,120
on both land and sea.

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,680
I'm Scott Gardner, joined as somewhere else far away by Mike Carlson.

5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,920
Pretty far, I mean not far away from you really, but far away from the listener perhaps.

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,880
Far away possibly from the listener and from our guest who will introduce us in a second,

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,280
but first Jason Sheridan.

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,920
Ahoy, permission to come aboard.

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,920
Oh God.

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:55,160
We're excited, we're hitting the water, we're blasting off to sea.

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,960
This is an episode, I mean, I think we'll cover some general stuff about the Disney

12
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,360
Cruises, but specifically it is an episode about the in-room entertainment on one of

13
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,560
the Disney cruise ships, or maybe all of them, I don't know, we're gonna get some clarification.

14
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,120
This is a topic that was conceived over a year ago on the main feed by today's guest.

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,560
He's the creator of the very popular YouTube series, Defunct Land.

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,480
Please welcome back Kevin Perjurer.

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,040
Thank you, I'm broadcasting from the worst and longest Carnival cruise in the history.

18
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,040
I'm stuck on the ship, they didn't care about us.

19
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,040
No, since March, no.

20
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,040
Yeah, yeah, I'm just waiting off the coast of San Diego, just going in circles.

21
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,040
Re-catching COVID from each other?

22
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,880
Yeah, yeah, people say you can get it twice, that's not accurate.

23
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,880
You can get it four times, five times.

24
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,600
How many are you up to?

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
How many are you up to?

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,800
I got my fourth badge the other day, but some of my suitemates are going up to five or six.

27
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,200
It's pretty incredible, it's like a two week refresh.

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,640
They keep adding to the numbers, you now have COVID-25.

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,360
But they never close the buffet, so I can't really complain.

30
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,600
Yes, the good thing is if you like your dinner entree, you can just ask for a second dinner

31
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,360
entree, so there's pluses and minuses, you know?

32
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,200
Oh, I love cruises so much, I'm so glad we get to talk about them.

33
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,280
I was supposed to go on one, it was canceled.

34
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,600
Oh, did you have one ready to go before the ship went down?

35
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,600
Yeah, yeah, I mean, I guess this would be good to mention because I brought this topic

36
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,040
up is I'm a huge Disney Cruise Line fan.

37
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,400
That's our family trip.

38
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,840
My family does not go to Disney World, we go on Disney Cruises.

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,840
Interesting.

40
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,960
And so we were in denial pretty hardcore.

41
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,600
We were like, oh, ours is in May, we'll be fine.

42
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,680
And then we moved it to December and now we're not going.

43
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,840
Even if it's open in December, we don't want to be on that.

44
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,120
Yeah, that seems like the correct move.

45
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,880
But they're building three new ships.

46
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,880
They are, really?

47
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,880
Yeah.

48
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,480
Well, they were going to build two and then the rumor is backstage at D23, two years ago,

49
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,920
Bob Iger's like, I'm going to announce three.

50
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,680
And the shipyard had no idea.

51
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,520
And then he walked on stage and said, we're building three new ships.

52
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,840
Have they announced the names of these?

53
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,720
I love the names of the ships.

54
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,080
I love the Disney simplification naming system.

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,840
Because they are what currently the video that we saw that we'll talk about is from

56
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,240
the Disney fantasy.

57
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,200
And then what are the other existing ones?

58
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,840
The first one was the magic, then the wonder, then the dream and the fantasy.

59
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,920
The fifth one is going to be called the wish.

60
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,960
And I know they've run out of abstract nouns, so there's no sixth or seventh name.

61
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,440
It's just the because that's what's great about them is they're not verbs, then they're

62
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,680
abstract nouns, fantasy wish.

63
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,200
It's not the Disney wishes or the wished.

64
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,480
I have a pitch.

65
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,680
The Disney yearn.

66
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,280
Yes, that's too.

67
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,160
I feel like that word is too complicated.

68
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,720
I feel like there's too many.

69
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,400
Yeah.

70
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,760
How about the Disney longing?

71
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,280
The Disney adventure.

72
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,320
The Disney adventure is adventure is good.

73
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,480
Longing has a tinge of melancholy to it.

74
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,760
So it's from when you wish upon a star.

75
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,720
Secret. The Disney secret longing.

76
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,960
Yeah. The Disney secret longing is good.

77
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,120
Disney star.

78
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,640
Wait, what was that on Kevin's?

79
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,360
The Disney obey.

80
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,040
I don't know. I feel like.

81
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,680
I mean, that gets their message across.

82
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,080
Well, that's domineering in a way.

83
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,480
I think that's that's the subtext of all the ships.

84
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,280
Sure. Yeah.

85
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,160
That's the Dismaland cruises.

86
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,280
The Banksy cruises.

87
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,560
Oh, yeah. When's he going to brand?

88
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,320
When's Banksy going to branch into parody cruise ships, too?

89
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,000
Also, regional entertainment, regional Banksy, like

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
our regional.

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,920
Banksy restaurant, Banksy quest, like.

92
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,040
Yeah.

93
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,680
Jason should be. Club Banksy.

94
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,240
Club Banksy.

95
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,360
Jason, you could be the San Fernando Valley Banksy.

96
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,960
Oh, I could be. Yeah.

97
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,160
Just really subverting like the Chili John's restaurant.

98
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,800
Yeah. Send up Chili John's in Burbank.

99
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,480
Send up send up the multiple BJ's.

100
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,680
That's the worst restaurant ever.

101
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,760
Hmm. I don't know.

102
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,960
I don't want to get off and I think the Pazuki is very good.

103
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,320
No, they're not good enough.

104
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,560
They are.

105
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,600
Kevin, they are good enough.

106
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,840
I think they're good enough.

107
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,560
That's a cut to a warm cookie with ice cream.

108
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,640
Jason, Jason, back me up here.

109
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,720
I mean, a lot of quarantine Pazuki.

110
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,960
Have you really?

111
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,760
Yeah, because for a while they were just including it

112
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,640
free with your meal with like any order.

113
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,760
Wait, and then you're also on top of it, doing a lot of BJ's.

114
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,400
Well, you get what you do.

115
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,400
You get you get the BJ's dinner and then you get a cold entree

116
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,360
that you can heat up the next day.

117
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,320
That was like five or six bucks.

118
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,680
And then you get either a free you get a free Pazuki.

119
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,280
I went to steal.

120
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,320
How many Pazuki's have you eaten since we've been in quarantine in March?

121
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,440
Well, I've shared them, but the answer is still three to four.

122
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,600
To yourself or is that Tota?

123
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,280
Do you think just your halves?

124
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,120
I've had like half of each one.

125
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,720
OK, OK, OK.

126
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,280
But there's time.

127
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,320
This this curve, much like the real one, is not necessarily going down.

128
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,360
No, it might spike again any day now.

129
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,360
No, but they do have a big banner saying the dining room is now open.

130
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,520
So they've scaled back on their delivery and takeout options.

131
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,320
So so the deal isn't as good.

132
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,160
Yeah, the deal isn't as good.

133
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,560
Oh, bummer. So they're so it could diminish.

134
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,960
Yeah, how's that?

135
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,160
OK, I'm BJ's just like trying to race to beat

136
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,600
Cheesecake Factory to every town in America.

137
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,520
Is that what you say?

138
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,400
Well, BJ's has like a very large menu, like a thick hundred

139
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,960
hundred page menu, it feels like.

140
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,480
So but it's not as good as Cheesecake Factory. Right.

141
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,800
But I assume I don't know anything about the corporate structure.

142
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,680
I don't know what their business plans are.

143
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,920
Which in and of itself, I Cheesecake Factory, I've done takeout

144
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,560
during the quarantine, and I think it's made me aware that Cheesecake

145
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,440
Factory is not good.

146
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,520
I think you like the atmosphere.

147
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,400
I think it's fun to go to one and you're just lost in that cheesecake magic.

148
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,600
And then when you just bring it home and it's just in a tin, it's not there.

149
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,720
I disagree.

150
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,880
Have you have you been to quarantine cheese cake?

151
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,240
No, I just have never been in Cheesecake Factory and been like,

152
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,760
hell, yeah, this food's whatever. But look at this place.

153
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,680
Wait, so how would you wait?

154
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,000
You have not been to know you've been to one.

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,680
You just haven't been in raptured by it.

156
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,440
I haven't. I haven't. Yeah.

157
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,800
Right. I have not been raptured by the enraptured enraptured.

158
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,760
Yeah, not raptured as if it killed you, if you were killed.

159
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,320
Well, it's being brought to heaven.

160
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,960
Yeah. And enraptured as you're getting on the boat and de-raptured

161
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
is when you're getting off the boat. Is that right?

162
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,560
The Disney Rapture is a good name.

163
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,960
Disrapture. That's what it would be if you went on one currently.

164
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,480
You well, yeah.

165
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,120
It's the Disney Cruise is the place I would at least want to be in the world.

166
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,840
And I think that might be my statement before the pandemic.

167
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,040
It's not my deal.

168
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,240
So maybe Kevin, it's a good and we haven't really talked about them

169
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,400
on the show at all.

170
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,840
So is what I don't know what if you could sell us on the

171
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,360
Disney Cruise experience, what's what appeals to you and your family?

172
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,480
So there's something for everybody.

173
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,920
So I'm not going to sell you that hard.

174
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:36,280
But the Disney Cruise Line, in short, is the last place

175
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,280
where the Disney difference exists.

176
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,040
That idea that Disney is superior in their service and their quality,

177
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,040
that still exists on the cruise.

178
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,600
It does not exist in the parks anymore.

179
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,640
I mean, ignore this whole quarantine thing, but it does not exist in the parks

180
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,120
because they're just too crowded.

181
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,560
It's there's too many people to be able to create those special moments

182
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,560
and to really interact with people.

183
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,040
And the Disney cruise ships only have a certain number of staterooms, obviously.

184
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,520
And so even on the largest cruises, it is still extremely personal.

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,960
The Disney I like Disney cruises.

186
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,920
They do things that other cruises don't do.

187
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,080
The rotational dining is pretty genius

188
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,720
where every night you like rotate through the main restaurants,

189
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,640
but your waiter moves with you so you get to know them. Whoa.

190
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,880
That's bizarre. That's how do you get?

191
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,440
So like on every ship, there's three signature dining.

192
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,440
And every night you have like there's two there's two different reservations.

193
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,480
You can either have the early dinner or the late dinner.

194
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,080
And then you just rotate.

195
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,680
And so and then your servers move with you and you get to talk to them

196
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,400
and you get to know them.

197
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,760
And if you're lucky, they're great.

198
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,440
And they usually are because they they you have to work your way up

199
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,920
to get to that position anyways.

200
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,600
The diversity is great.

201
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,640
They get a lot of people from all over the world.

202
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,160
So you get to ask them about their experiences.

203
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,200
So that's always fun.

204
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,040
Oh, as in this in this video that we'll talk about.

205
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,280
Yeah, it's like it's very international.

206
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,640
Everybody. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

207
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,240
And suspiciously,

208
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,960
well, you're wondering if there's a loophole somewhere in some of the like,

209
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,560
yeah, let's talk about loopholes and cruises.

210
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,800
So cruise ships tend to be

211
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:19,160
registered in countries with very flexible legal systems,

212
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,480
either the Bahamas or

213
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,800
different ports in Africa.

214
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,000
You don't see a lot of cruises like cruise ships that are registered

215
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,080
like their home port is Newark or New York City or Port Canaveral.

216
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,760
Right. Because then you have to abide by the home country's laws.

217
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,760
And if there's more wiggle room in that country's laws,

218
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,640
I it gets complicated.

219
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,680
If you've seen succession, this comes up.

220
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,400
That's why I mentioned suspiciously when I referred to how the the employees,

221
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,720
the cast members are awesome and they get them from all over the world.

222
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,280
But I just wonder if certain American ideas of work periods,

223
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,360
you know, because there are a lot of Americans on the ship, obviously,

224
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,760
that are working.

225
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,000
But yeah, it's in countries that tend to not have the strictest labor laws.

226
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,920
I think that's one of the reasons.

227
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,720
Oh, that's what there I was wondering where you guys were going with this,

228
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,200
what they're trying to get away with.

229
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,600
So I don't want to sound like we're like, what's with all these,

230
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,920
you know, people from Australia on these cruise ships?

231
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,480
Saying suspicious about that.

232
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,600
Yeah, that's not what we're saying.

233
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,080
What's up? What's up with all these Australians?

234
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,520
No, but it's that's that's what that's what I think.

235
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,000
It's like if you're here, if you're on the boat, you should be working 24-7.

236
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,720
That's what they're trying to get away with.

237
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,160
And this is across cruise lines like this isn't exclusive to Disney, I should say.

238
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,520
Right. No, no, it's not.

239
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,440
But it does run into some issues.

240
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,360
It's going to get really dark.

241
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,880
You can you can cut this out if you want.

242
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,080
I guess we're on the second gate.

243
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,720
There are things is the Villains Park of podcast.

244
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,840
All right. Oh, I like that.

245
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,520
That's what I'm describing that way before.

246
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,280
So are you bringing up the simple art of murder, Kevin?

247
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,160
Murder at sea?

248
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,800
Yes, I am.

249
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,240
If you have a murder at sea or just a death at sea, as the Disney wonder did

250
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,960
with one of its cast members tragically falling off the boat, supposedly to their death.

251
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,240
It has it will be investigated by the governments of the home port.

252
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,120
So the American family of the cast member,

253
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,280
it would cause this whole thing where they could not get NASA to properly investigate it

254
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,880
or something or other. I didn't research this very well.

255
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,040
Do not take what I'm saying verbatim.

256
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,080
I just remember it was something with it gets complicated

257
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,080
when there's something of that nature.

258
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,680
But yeah, that was the biggest.

259
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah, sorry. I probably should have brought that up.

260
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Oh, no, no, this is very intriguing.

261
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,200
Well, so is Disney or the Disney Cruises registered in some other city

262
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,640
so that they can all bodies as much as it's all NASA?

263
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,120
Well, well, well, well, well, well, I feel like this is going to be like

264
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,640
you called Australian suspicious and you said NASA is the best place for murders.

265
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,800
I'm going to get super not good feedback.

266
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,000
All our listeners in NASA are going to be curious.

267
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,880
I'm not trying to be weird about this.

268
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,440
Well, can I bring up another thing I know about cruises?

269
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,360
I think I've talked about this on the show.

270
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,880
Does everyone know about the lifeboat guns?

271
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,520
Hmm. I don't. This doesn't ring a bell.

272
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,520
So feel free. Yes. OK.

273
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,080
So when you are on a cruise, you are assigned to a lifeboat.

274
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,640
There's a couple of things to know about the lifeboat.

275
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,640
So this is your day of embark.

276
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,680
Embarkation is getting on the ship.

277
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,480
Debarcation is leaving the ship.

278
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,400
The first day you get on a ship.

279
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,800
I went on a Norwegian cruise line once with my family when I was 12.

280
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,120
One of the very first things you do after lunch is find out where your lifeboat

281
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,760
and your life vests are.

282
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,800
And and in case of an emergency, this is the lifeboat you would have to get on.

283
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,360
A thing I learned later on as an adult, I knew someone who was in the entertainment

284
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,040
staff and they are usually on cruise ships, the ones trained to man

285
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,640
the lifeboats because they're, you know, they have a presence

286
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,440
and they're good with people.

287
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,960
And that means they're also some of them trained to use the handguns

288
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,360
that are on every lifeboat because you have to.

289
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,440
If a lifeboat is like launched, you have to abide by the rules of maritime

290
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,200
like nautical law.

291
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,920
And if a passenger says like, no, I can do this better.

292
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,520
I should be in charge of this ship.

293
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,640
They can legally shoot that passenger.

294
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,720
So you could be shot by someone who was just playing

295
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,480
Lumiere, the singing candle, potentially just leading a limbo contest.

296
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,800
And now that doesn't happen in all the studios.

297
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,000
No, it doesn't.

298
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,480
Whoa. I see.

299
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,840
Can you play?

300
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,560
Can you play Russian roulette with the gun, too, if you're at sea for a while?

301
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:07,360
Well, I mean, I guess that that's how cool your lifeboat captain is.

302
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,600
Depends on that.

303
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,080
If Lumiere is cool, he'll allow it.

304
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,560
Huh? Well, that's a that's a real dark start for this.

305
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,800
Can you tell us about the macaroni and cheese at the buffet?

306
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,760
What kind of macaroni and cheese is the buffet?

307
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,480
Or jello's, please. Let's get into jello's.

308
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,240
It's the cheese kind.

309
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,840
No. Yeah. Anyway, so there's this great rotational dining system

310
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,880
where your server follows you and if they go missing, it has to be investigated.

311
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,360
Yes. No, wait. No, no.

312
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,520
Our diving. No, too dark.

313
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,080
It's a great rotational system with a waiter who follows you

314
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,720
and he will shoot you if he needs to.

315
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,400
My podcast GPS is messing up.

316
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,680
No. Can you tell us the name of it?

317
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,760
Because you you get some names of restaurants and stuff.

318
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,840
Is there was there a restaurant you were especially fond of?

319
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,880
Oh, well, no. No.

320
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,640
I think there's no.

321
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,800
We're remaining dark.

322
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,920
They're all very good food, but it's there.

323
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,440
I'm pretty sure. And again, I I this is I'm a very researched individual.

324
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,760
I go into every all my videos, very scripted.

325
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,440
So I really don't like to be like I just looked up the Disney

326
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,920
Wonder thing and it was had it did have to be investigated by the Royal

327
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,120
Bahamas Police Force, so I wasn't completely off on that.

328
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,720
But with it, but I think all the kitchens are pretty centrally located on the ship.

329
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,640
So on the wonder and no, sorry, on the dream and the fantasy,

330
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,960
which are the two newest ships, there's animators, palettes,

331
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,000
Roy, which is their big Disney one.

332
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,520
That's the one that slaps you in the face with Disney.

333
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,200
And it's the animation one.

334
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,560
So one night if on a fantasy, the first night you are in that rotational dining

335
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,360
on a seven day cruise because you'll go into each one multiple times.

336
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,320
The first night is Turtle Talk with Crush, which is an Epcot.

337
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,960
And I believe it's also a DCA.

338
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,120
And it happens this little show or to crush the turtle talks to you

339
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,520
happens at the restaurant.

340
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,360
Yeah, happens. There's screens everywhere and it's actually really cool.

341
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,720
And the lighting is really fun.

342
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,200
And it totally ruins the experience if you've ever done it at the parks,

343
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,520
because that one's way better.

344
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,360
But yeah, it's super cute.

345
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,640
The crush will, you know, go up to kids and it'd be like nautical

346
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,600
and they'll be like crazy.

347
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,200
And, you know, I don't know what happens, but it's it's very cute.

348
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,600
Crush goes table to table like at a wedding.

349
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,040
Yeah, yeah, he does. He does.

350
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,920
There's only one crush.

351
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,760
And if there's two, then they really far apart in the restaurant.

352
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,040
So you can't see them. But he does go.

353
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,400
That's exactly that's a great way to explain. Wow. Wow.

354
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,360
And he did.

355
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,760
He keeps some of the conversations quick if it's, you know,

356
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,280
you know, somebody's aunt, he doesn't really want to do it.

357
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,360
It's sort of a black sheep of the family.

358
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,640
Yeah. And there's it's obviously some poor cast member

359
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,400
that has a good impersonation of Crush wedged between one of the walls

360
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,440
looking at monitors.

361
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,040
But it's weird. It's it's it's super fun.

362
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,960
And then the second night you're at animators palette,

363
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,120
which also has tons of Disney, you know, like

364
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,480
film strips and different things.

365
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,840
The second night you're there, you are

366
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,760
doing a draw your own animation.

367
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,520
So they bring to your table like a a blank person

368
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,440
that is like kind of like the Da Vinci man with giant spaces.

369
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,720
And you draw in the arms separately and they put it through a computer

370
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,000
and it comes together and then it superimposes them in a big Disney montage

371
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
at the end of dinner. And it's awesome.

372
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,320
I know I know I'm very I like Disney.

373
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,880
It's fine. Like I like to make fun of it a lot.

374
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,720
But that one was I was like, I'm into this.

375
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,800
That's pretty wild.

376
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,040
That's it. While you eat your you draw some weird little character,

377
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,360
you really a forky, if you will.

378
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,680
You invent a little wonky thing and then it's put into a movie.

379
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,720
Yeah. Unless it's something that looks inappropriate,

380
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,800
then they just take it off, which has happened to me.

381
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,720
But whatever. What are you going to do?

382
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,560
There's like a quality control person or there's a sensor.

383
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,640
There's a there's like a boat sensor.

384
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,680
Yeah. Yeah. It goes through the sensor board.

385
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,520
You have to explain why you think it's appropriate and don't listen.

386
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,800
Bob Iger has to click yes or no on a computer remotely.

387
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,560
Give me another ship. I love this.

388
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,760
Is this there's other there's other restaurants like I think

389
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,800
a enchanted garden or royal palace and enchanted garden is the one

390
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,240
where it starts at night and then the flowers bloom while you eat.

391
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,120
And it's day, I think, by the time you leave.

392
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,200
Wow. And then Royal Garden is the one that's like, OK, this is

393
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,400
there's no gimmick, really.

394
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,160
It's just kind of it's somewhat themed to Cinderella.

395
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,600
But they really want you to feel like that's a very nice dining restaurant.

396
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,800
And there are two fine dining restaurants on every ship that you can.

397
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,160
You have to pay an upcharge to go.

398
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,680
But kids can't go in those. But yeah. So anyways.

399
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,720
Sure. Do with that what you will. That sounds nice.

400
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,680
It all it all it all sounds really nice.

401
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,200
And maybe if we could dovetail, I mean, some of these things,

402
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,240
a couple of them now I know about because I watch the very informative video

403
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,480
that is really the basis of this thing that you brought up when you were on

404
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,520
and when you talked to us about Tarzan Rocks a while ago.

405
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,960
It was quite an obscure proposal.

406
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,160
And we love obscure proposals,

407
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,880
specifically the morning show that plays

408
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,440
in in your cabin on the ship that is hosted by the cruise director.

409
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,480
That's really what we're here to get into.

410
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,080
Can you describe for us your discovery of this broadcast?

411
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,760
I turned it on while I was on one of the ships accidentally.

412
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,400
And I love looking at hotel media, the state room media.

413
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,680
It's fascinating.

414
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,800
Yeah, at the parks, it's usually very well produced, but very old.

415
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,320
On the ships, it's very new and terribly produced.

416
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,360
Disney's creative control does not like make its way into international waters.

417
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,000
Like their quality control measures are out the window.

418
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,520
And so their cruzicles, which are the cruise musicals.

419
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,120
Yes. Are are weird as hell.

420
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,120
Yeah.

421
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,760
And the weirdest one is not actually filmed.

422
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,560
But they are. But anyway, so the the cruise musical, the cruzicles

423
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,720
and are on the state rooms.

424
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,560
And so are these morning shows, which I kind of just stumbled across.

425
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,400
And you all watched the one that I sent you.

426
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,760
I think it's the only one that got recorded.

427
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,800
Yeah. If you want to follow along, listener,

428
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,440
go to YouTube and type in Disney fantasy cruise director's show.

429
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,200
It is from the user Puckfly, who has posted a lot of high res,

430
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,000
you know, materials from Disney cruises.

431
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,080
And so I'm glad that there was a very like coherent one of these to watch.

432
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,360
But, you know, of course, this isn't the same thing that you saw, Kevin.

433
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,480
You saw one that was tailored to your specific cruise.

434
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,120
Well, it could have definitely been this one because I was on the fantasy

435
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,200
this year of the year this was recorded.

436
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,920
So, OK, OK, this one.

437
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,080
But I've seen there's very there's variations of these.

438
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,760
I think every time a cruise director,

439
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,880
I was going to say, goes missing.

440
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,440
I'm that's every time a cruise director.

441
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,840
What are you accusing Disney of? Oh, my God. Sorry.

442
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,960
Every one of them is dumped off the ship.

443
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,440
Yeah, everyone. Well, it's the one segment was hosted by Agatha

444
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,520
Christie's Hercule Poirot, the consulting detective.

445
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,680
He seemed like he was trying to get to the bottom of something.

446
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,520
He didn't really tell us about activities on the cruise that day.

447
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,360
Y'all were waiting for the Hercule Poirot

448
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,480
reference that was inevitable on the show.

449
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,360
Look, Kenneth Branagh's he's doing round two.

450
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,960
He did murder on the Orient Express.

451
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,920
He's doing death on a Nile next year.

452
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,080
You know, everyone's wild for Jason is hype for it.

453
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,040
I'm hype. And then death on the Disney fantasy the year after that.

454
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,080
The big mustache.

455
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,000
That's handguns from the lifeboat.

456
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,320
Yeah, that was the murder weapon. Yeah.

457
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,480
So OK. OK, wait.

458
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,400
So yeah, when you go on to one of these things,

459
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,720
the cruise director is a person who that's like the concierge.

460
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,080
That's somebody who's, you know, helping you out.

461
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,920
And if you see them walking around the ship, they can give you recommendations.

462
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,400
They can tell you stuff to do.

463
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,920
And they put this person front and center by having them talk to you

464
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,680
in a show you can pull up anytime all day in your in your room on the ship.

465
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,080
I don't I think the cruise

466
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,320
director's job is a bit more elevated than that.

467
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,120
I think they're doing they're in charge of all of the activities.

468
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,920
So like you could see them maybe walking around, but they're really

469
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,280
I think they're planning and producing all sorts of different things.

470
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,840
But they are the face for the big events.

471
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,280
So they you will see them at the start of every cruisical.

472
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,440
They'll do the whole welcome to our show.

473
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,920
We're so glad you're here, by the way, your seats, functions,

474
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,880
flotation devices in the case of a disaster.

475
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,520
And they're told that before a play starts.

476
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,800
Well, obviously not that, but that's the same place

477
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,560
you have your safety demonstration on, because, you know, every cruise,

478
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,960
they have to be like, look, this thing is not going to sink.

479
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,080
But if it does, here's what we're going to do.

480
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,560
We're all going to rush to the theater, which is in the center of the ship.

481
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,080
We're going to give you a debriefing and then we're going to rush back out.

482
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,520
That's actually the plan.

483
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,960
Well, that's that's how it would win this like ornate Disney movie theater.

484
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,080
You have to run in there to tell you how to save your life.

485
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,480
Yeah, because and then they're going to be like, all right.

486
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,920
You know, that's where say if you there is that you are in group C or 13

487
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,520
or whatever, rush to the theater and then we'll give you your debriefing

488
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,960
on what to do next.

489
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,360
And then there's some people by the lifeboats, but I'm sure that's

490
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,920
you have to pay more for that.

491
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,920
Donald Duck will give you a presentation.

492
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,760
Why we choose that character?

493
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,720
Why we choose the least discernible character?

494
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,920
I wish I could do an act of his voice.

495
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,760
We all just learned that we cannot.

496
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,080
We just ended an episode with the worst impressions you've ever heard.

497
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,960
But yes, so this director is the very there's the captain

498
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,760
who's not steering the ship, by the way.

499
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,280
Oh, sorry. You've unlocked my brain.

500
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,520
I'm super bad at this now that my brain's unlocked.

501
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,320
You'll find this interesting, though.

502
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,160
There are like five different captains

503
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,600
legally or at least promoted on each Disney ship.

504
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,600
There's the real captain, the human being Captain Mickey.

505
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,720
Mickey, he counts.

506
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,080
Yeah, he counts Captain Hook, Captain Jack Sparrow.

507
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,440
I they Disney likes to say, like, you know, our ship has like five captains.

508
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,960
We have Captain, you know, Stewart.

509
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,960
And we have we have Captain Mickey and they go through the whole thing.

510
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,480
I don't want to Jack Sparrow in charge of anything.

511
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,760
That's not a trustworthy figure.

512
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,560
Yeah. So this is the cruise director every morning.

513
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,840
She gives a debriefing and it's I'm pretty sure it's the same one every morning.

514
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,440
But I just wonder.

515
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,160
And I've also had this cruise director multiple times.

516
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,760
So. I can't really say, but I feel as though

517
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,680
I think they would have to switch out the whole video if it's not her.

518
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,640
So the video that we all watch, the like 40 minute video, that video plays

519
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,400
every day because I was trying to figure out, like, wait, does each five

520
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,080
minute segment is each one from a different day or that just loops forever?

521
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,760
It is very hard to answer that question.

522
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,280
OK, I do not know, because I found I found a video with that same

523
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,120
cruise director that was just debarkation procedures.

524
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,200
That's just because you have to check so many boxes.

525
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,120
You have to do so much to get off the ship.

526
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,440
You have to get your luggage picked up.

527
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,400
Breck, you get off the ship at like 7 a.m., right?

528
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,560
Depending on how many how long your cruise is.

529
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,120
That was shocking. That was ghastly information to learn in this video.

530
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,440
And even she is defensive, like, well, there's reasons we do this.

531
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,280
OK, there's reasons to get you to the airport and customs.

532
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,800
They pretty much tell you how to fill out your customs thing,

533
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,960
which that I think was helpful.

534
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,640
So keep looking on the Puckfly channel if you want to watch a customs form

535
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,600
readily informational video produced by Disney.

536
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,120
So I just checked this video is the one, the 41 minute one that we watched.

537
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:13,840
That is the video specifically for Kazumel on, I think, the Eastern Caribbean itinerary.

538
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,280
So there are there's one of these for every day.

539
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,840
Well, it'd be like, welcome to Nassau again.

540
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,680
And like, welcome, welcome to Castaway Key.

541
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,240
You know, welcome to Tortuga or Tortola or whatever it is.

542
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,520
So, yeah, so they do.

543
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,480
I'm not sure if they keep some segments, if there's some sort of like

544
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,200
this is segment C and we can play segment A every day because the coffee shops

545
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,040
always open, but we can also play segment.

546
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,040
We have to change out segment C, you know what I mean?

547
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,360
So it's like, well, because there's like a goofy guy who works on the ship

548
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,040
also, who is bothering the mainly the host is just this pleasant lady.

549
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,440
In this case, Natalie is her name, and she's giving you information

550
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,320
about all this fun stuff you could do on the ship.

551
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,880
But then sometimes there's like this there's this doof who bothers her

552
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,760
and like, you know, waves a fake sword in her face.

553
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,120
There's these little skits.

554
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,640
But so do they have to refilm the skit every time?

555
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,360
Or do these people have to redo this skit every time that this cruise embarks?

556
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,720
That might be best answered by the audience.

557
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,280
Have you been on a Disney cruise and have you seen this man holding the sword?

558
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,040
Or was it a different man holding a different sword?

559
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,160
Yeah. And did you film it off the TV?

560
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,000
And can you send us a copy so that we can check it with the puck fly version?

561
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,960
We need to cross reference some versions here.

562
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,000
This is like the David Copperfield question where like we had to talk

563
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,960
to other people who did the show to see who was a plant and who was right.

564
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,080
Who was a repeat? Right.

565
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,960
So we'll have to. Yeah, we'll have to get other people who saw this.

566
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,480
Well, the we should also mention that this cruise

567
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,440
director show is horribly shot.

568
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,320
Yeah. Yes, yes.

569
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,120
This is not well produced.

570
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:57,520
A large portion of it filmed in a starkly empty and frighteningly lit cafe

571
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:02,160
that is like the cafe in the Black Lodge from Twin Peaks.

572
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,760
I give you panned over for the lounge chairs.

573
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,440
There's a coffee bar that poor Kyle McLaughlin can sit at.

574
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,160
There's a it's a very odd composition

575
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,320
with a very prominently featured trash can.

576
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,960
That's like it.

577
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,040
I just saw everything you were talking about, Kevin.

578
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,320
I was like, oh, I get it right away from this first shot because, yeah,

579
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,280
Disney things when you watch the video in the Disney World Hotel room,

580
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,400
it's so polished, it's so super edited.

581
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,400
And this thing is just this flat shot for 10 minutes

582
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,520
of this lady talking to you in front of a trash can.

583
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,680
It looks like it was made in like I movie in 2008.

584
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,640
It's like so basic seeming.

585
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,320
I just so I'm scrolling through this video again.

586
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:52,600
And this is it seems that this is a compilation of the multiple messages.

587
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,600
So this is multi day that we're seeing.

588
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,960
Because she's also in later on doing a Star Wars Day at Sea.

589
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,120
Interesting note about that.

590
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:05,880
The Star Wars Day at Sea is a huge hazard for the cruise activities of the day

591
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,440
because and so is the Marvel Day at Sea,

592
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,200
because they market it so heavily and it's at sea.

593
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,800
Everything that happens on the ship that day has to be Star Wars themed

594
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,320
to the point that once you become friendly enough with like the bartenders

595
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,880
and your waitresses, they'll be like, yeah, that drink today

596
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,120
is an R2D2 Coke and rum.

597
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,400
And they're like, what?

598
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,800
And it's like, it has to be that today.

599
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,600
If it's not, you know, we don't fulfill Star Wars Day at Sea and we're in trouble.

600
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,680
I'm like, what?

601
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,240
And yes, so they're like everything they do like it's like, hey,

602
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,760
can you stop playing Star Wars music if you're like in a like a very small

603
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,160
environment, like take requests?

604
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,880
No, we can only play the Cantina band song today.

605
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,360
That's all we can do. I'm sorry.

606
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,920
Just in a loop for 13 hours. Dear God.

607
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,560
And it's a fun song, but there's a limit.

608
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,200
Is there a new Star Wars related name for every drink that day then?

609
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,120
Like, do they have to completely overhaul the menu with names?

610
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,880
I don't recall.

611
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,200
I don't know if they change up the actual menu items like at dinner,

612
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,120
but it is pretty exhaustive.

613
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,400
All of the kids clubs, which is another thing about the cruise,

614
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,360
if you're traveling with a big family like I do, you know,

615
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,760
they have different age levels like some of the kids, they have their own clubs.

616
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,720
And they have a teen club and they have a preteen club and they have a kids club

617
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,160
and they all their own activities.

618
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,560
And those on that day are even Star Wars themed.

619
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,080
And so you like see you'll see a bunch of kids with lightsabers

620
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,160
like marching around and, you know, all sorts of different things.

621
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,360
So it's it's very exhaustive on those Star Wars is see.

622
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,440
But anyways, yeah, so this is multiple days.

623
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,160
This television loop. Wow.

624
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,480
Do you ever find it ever like over structured?

625
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,120
It seems like a lot of like every hour is planned out to me.

626
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,240
The Disney bed. Yeah.

627
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,560
Is that essentially like I know most people go on cruises and they like, well,

628
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,920
I mean, I can see like, OK, dinners, it's five or six every night, whatever it is.

629
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,000
And then in the one video, they're like, well, the dinner

630
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,400
and the movie are at five and eight and whichever one you didn't go to,

631
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,800
you go to that like so you don't miss out on anything.

632
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,840
But it really does seem very heavily scheduled.

633
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,840
It it's all optional.

634
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,400
The only real things that impede your schedule are dinner.

635
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,000
And people will line up the day of if they don't get the dinner reservation they want.

636
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,200
There's only two. It's like five fifteen and eight fifteen.

637
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,000
And if some people got eight fifteen and like, I want to eat early, you know, they'll

638
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,120
you can go and ask.

639
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,880
And there's a line of people wanting to change their dinner reservations.

640
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,680
But other than that, and that also affects when you watch the show

641
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,120
and you don't have to go to dinner, there's other dinner options every night.

642
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,960
But it's expected somewhat of you like to go to dinner for sure.

643
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,160
Yeah, I remember there was some flexibility on like where you could go for breakfast

644
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,440
and lunch when I went on a cruise.

645
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,840
But the big food thing I remember is the midnight buffets every night.

646
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,320
Just a full service buffet at midnight.

647
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,720
They don't have that. They don't do that.

648
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,720
They don't do. And one one of them was a midnight chocolate buffet

649
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,840
of all treats it eats.

650
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,800
You know, we haven't recorded an episode in a while where we can see each other.

651
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
We've been doing just audio.

652
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,600
And I'm glad we're on video now because I got to see Jason twiddle his fingers.

653
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,320
Made chocolate to buffet.

654
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:22,120
As if he was about to like just pluck a little piece from one of the plates at the buffet.

655
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,360
No very who's the Popeye hamburger guy?

656
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,760
He was extremely wimpy.

657
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,920
He was very, very wimpy move of you just now.

658
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,600
Not wimpy as in wimpy.

659
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,800
Wimpy is in character. Yeah, yeah.

660
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,000
Capital. I get it.

661
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,080
Wimpy is Jason's favorite character in fiction.

662
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,000
Sure. So they do that one night on one night.

663
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,040
And it's a pirate night.

664
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:46,080
Pirate night is is very greatly called night because the thing with the Star Wars

665
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,320
Cruise and I should mention that when I was hearing all this like, hey,

666
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,200
we got to do this, this and this, that was when they first introduced them.

667
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,040
And all they really had planned was a few kids activities and like a

668
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,800
like a nighttime kind of like Star Wars esque thing.

669
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,120
And so when they said when they pitched it as Star Wars Day at Sea,

670
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,200
they did not have enough plans, so they were overcompensating.

671
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:11,480
But Pirate Night has this brilliant Jack Sparrow stage show, which they changed it up.

672
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,960
But he used to jump off the top of the ship and like propel down and like bungee

673
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,400
cord stop himself.

674
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,800
And then he would like fight for a gauntlet and then he'd shoot out the fireworks.

675
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,240
And that's the fireworks at sea night, which is beautiful.

676
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,240
And you can see in the distance all of the Royal Caribbean and Carnival

677
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:31,400
Cruises purposefully circling around you because they want to watch the

678
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,040
fireworks show because. Wow.

679
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,840
So that makes you feel special.

680
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,040
Wow. The leech in their firework leeches.

681
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,400
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's bad.

682
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,360
I mean, Universal Studios would do that, too, if it was if they can move.

683
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,040
But there's no Universal Cruise someday.

684
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,680
I think I'd rather go on the Universal Cruise for whatever reason.

685
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,800
Universal Studios closes at 4 p.m.

686
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,840
anyways, but the as with their ship.

687
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,520
Yeah, we don't have dinner service.

688
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,000
No dinner service.

689
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,160
But yes, so they have after they have that big fireworks show, they have Club

690
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,600
Pirate, which is this really awkward dance night where all the families get out

691
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
there and dance.

692
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,720
And there was one fantastic night.

693
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:14,440
And I've been on many of these where there was one dad who was so into it

694
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,760
that it made it all worth it because they have these cameras around the area

695
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,440
to show on the big screen of the people dancing.

696
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,680
And he the entire time was just like going hard as heck,

697
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,880
just in the middle of the dance floor.

698
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,800
And it was it was spectacular.

699
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,840
But anyways, you just did a robot move.

700
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,960
That's not what a pirate would do.

701
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,840
I disagree with this guy's dance move.

702
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,520
I think you mean integrity.

703
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,960
And then they have the pirate buffet after that, which is really bad,

704
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,600
which is just the only night they serve Mexican food. So.

705
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,000
So that's the only difference with the pirate.

706
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,280
Does that name pirate things or anything?

707
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,000
Do you remember?

708
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,000
They have I don't know if they have drinks at the bars that are pirate themed.

709
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,200
They usually have a good drink of the day.

710
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,160
Maybe it's pirate themed, but everybody gets dressed up.

711
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,680
Everybody's dressed in pirate regalia.

712
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,920
Except for me, this is where you're losing me, Kevin.

713
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,760
I don't love this either.

714
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,240
It's all waggered figures.

715
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,440
Dressing like a pirate is a tough one for me.

716
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,280
I don't do that.

717
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,360
OK, you didn't bring pirate.

718
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,920
So they don't throw you overboard if you don't dress like a pirate.

719
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,880
Yeah, no, they don't.

720
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,680
They don't coerce you into saying you're planning on taking over the ship

721
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,560
so they could use a handgun on you. Right.

722
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,080
Would it count if you dressed like the pirates from Captain Phillips?

723
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,320
Oh, my God. Would that count as dressing like a pirate?

724
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,920
Or just just an I am the captain now shirt with that suffice?

725
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,040
That would be enough, I think.

726
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,880
Yeah, I have another question about the pirate day, which is.

727
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,080
Yeah. All right.

728
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,680
A Star Wars dance party, I understand, because

729
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,240
you know, you get your disco version of the side.

730
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,160
I get this. I mean, maybe sort of vaguely.

731
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:58,160
The I just don't know how you flesh out a pirate dance party

732
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:03,000
because there are not very many songs about pirates and piracy.

733
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,080
Does it just become whatever music?

734
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,400
Do they just bail on the theme at some point?

735
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:12,480
So it starts out with like a he's a pirate cause but that remix.

736
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,000
So it'll be like, did it done?

737
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,960
Don't did it done?

738
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,400
Dada done. And then after that, it's just flow right up.

739
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,800
This is just a Kylie Minogue really quickly.

740
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,360
Yeah. So they run out really quickly.

741
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,480
And so, yeah, you're right. You're right.

742
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,680
They don't even try.

743
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,400
Honestly, they don't get like a pirate.

744
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,440
I mean, maybe they have like a they have like a really bowling for soup

745
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:43,320
ask a pirate's life for me was like, yo, yo, yo, a pirate's life for me.

746
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,560
Oh, this I do not care for.

747
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,000
It's a very classy cruise besides this one night.

748
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,680
Like it's you can totally have an adult time

749
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,360
and just, yeah, it's fine.

750
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:03,600
Now there is the level of adult bars that that like, you know, the district 18 and up.

751
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,400
Yeah, the district that does how.

752
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,760
I know you said they push the drinks, but like, can you escape like

753
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,640
a pirate doing the floss dance?

754
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,440
Can you like, I'm just going to go downstairs to the bar to get away from this?

755
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,320
So, you know, that's that's when you like enter your typical cruise life

756
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,280
where they're going to be like, all right, we're doing the whatever that couples

757
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,960
game show is. And it's like, where do you have, you know,

758
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,240
where did you have love?

759
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,200
Make love for the first time and like newlywed games.

760
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,520
Yeah, the newlywed game.

761
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,200
Like, where did you make love for the first time?

762
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,160
That's where your whoopee tacos.

763
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,720
This is this is like me, like I'm having every moment in this podcast.

764
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:48,280
I'm having this ratatouille flashback or like I take a bite of the ratatouille

765
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,840
and I go back to my childhood.

766
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,040
Oh, my gosh.

767
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,360
Wait, because how long were you when did you go on on one of these ships

768
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,000
for the first time? I've been on like seven.

769
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,280
So, oh, my God. So, yeah, it's been a bit.

770
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,280
Have you ever decade?

771
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,400
Did you go on the big red boat, the precursor to Disney's own fleet?

772
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,040
No, I wish I wish I could have been on a cruise ship and gone on to the

773
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,640
that's the big red boat.

774
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,760
I did not get to.

775
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,520
And I've yeah, if only that was for listeners,

776
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,080
if you don't know what I'm talking about, that was when like Disney

777
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:26,600
contracted with another cruise line to kind of have Disney asked cruises.

778
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,840
But it was before they owned their own fleet of ships.

779
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,560
And there was also that weird, that whole weird thing

780
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,280
where they were going to build a Disneyland on a ship

781
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,000
and pull it around to places as Disney.

782
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:44,360
Whoa. That's Disney, which I'm sure would not have worked,

783
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,640
but also might have.

784
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,520
I don't know.

785
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,520
I wonder if it would have still been, you know, had a port of call in Nassau.

786
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,200
Just to just like laws.

787
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,680
Just laws.

788
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,000
It would have been taken over by pirates at this point.

789
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,600
These are ours.

790
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,640
A stronghold somewhere down in the Caribbean.

791
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,400
This mini haunted mansion be ours now.

792
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,080
So so so Kevin, they have the new like they have a newlywed game,

793
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,680
so they will get a little body around these ships.

794
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,560
Oh, Disney like once theme park experience.

795
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,920
And they're and so that's when again, you walk into the world

796
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,080
of your typical carnival, Royal Caribbean cruise.

797
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,640
And then they you know, they they do recognize that they're on a Disney ship.

798
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,600
And so you'll have to put up with one or two like,

799
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,680
oh, that's not very Mickey from the host.

800
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,760
Yeah, that's great.

801
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,920
So you get a little you get a laugh from that.

802
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,320
But other than that, it's like my favorite.

803
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,800
I had the flashback, my favorite moment on any of those newlywed games.

804
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,960
And I go to all of them because they're they really are fun.

805
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,760
Like they're unapologetically a really fun time was

806
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,320
was when they're like, what's the craziest place you've ever made love?

807
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,520
And they were like in the spa on the cruise ship.

808
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,160
Jesus Christ.

809
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,280
No, no.

810
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,600
This is why I don't go.

811
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,040
And it was just like, I mean, it's just it made me very happy.

812
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:16,360
Just because I have to look at the people in the eye who spread

813
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,640
their fluids where I said I just know there's one person

814
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,680
that's like, I saw you in the spa today.

815
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,360
I was there.

816
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,520
I do want to mention, I wrote down what I think is the family

817
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,560
friendly version of like that newlywed style game.

818
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,640
It has a very unfortunate name and it's called

819
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,120
Do You Think You Know Your Family?

820
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,600
And that that seems like a recipe of disaster.

821
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,040
Like I had to rewind that segment of the video where I was like,

822
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,480
I don't know that I want to play.

823
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,520
Do you think you know your family?

824
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,840
I may want to see the where is it?

825
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,120
The comedy and magic of Dale Kane.

826
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,280
I don't know why that would count to me.

827
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:05,960
After the crusades against comedy magicians in the late 90s and early 2000s,

828
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,720
they were all banished to sea where they still live happily.

829
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,360
They're only allowed in the Bahamas.

830
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,280
That's what the NASA.

831
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,680
After we outlawed them.

832
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,920
Comedy magic is still still illegal here.

833
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,040
It's a lawless land.

834
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,960
Yeah, it was.

835
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,120
But yeah, there there was there was one magician one night.

836
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,800
And I go to all the shows because they're garbage.

837
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,400
Except for like one or two.

838
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,760
They're garbage fires.

839
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,080
There was one show.

840
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,000
This magician has a slideshow going behind him.

841
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,480
And it's kind of like that.

842
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,440
You know, when you set up your slideshow really poorly to our pictures

843
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,800
just kind of fly from one screen to the other.

844
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,400
And what he didn't tell us is he's both a juggler or no,

845
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,040
he was both a magician and a motivational speaker.

846
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,680
And so he's like, you can have this life.

847
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,520
You can have this kid.

848
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,840
The kid would fly by and you could have this wife and unexplained

849
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,560
this woman with two ninja swords and a sports bra and like complete

850
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,520
like camo outfit, like camo sportswear with two like ninja swords

851
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,280
flew by the screen unexplained.

852
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,320
And I'm dying of laughter.

853
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,800
And then the end trick was I'm so going to spoil this if any, if this magician.

854
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,000
So if this magician is listening to this, I apologize.

855
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,840
Dale Kane or someone else?

856
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,240
I don't know. We don't have a name.

857
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,880
His big thing was like Charlie's trick

858
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,600
because there was like this little girl named Charlie and she was

859
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,640
dying of something or or she was just not feeling good about herself

860
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,480
or she was bullied or something like that.

861
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,560
And she was like, she always wanted me to make it snow

862
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,440
because she lives in California or something.

863
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,760
And so while he's doing this, he's unsubtly ripping up a

864
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,040
thing of paper in his hands and then

865
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,400
very clearly, very clearly

866
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,440
I'm at it.

867
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,040
Ripping up the paper, he's folded and he keeps ripping it up and he's like.

868
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,680
And so I said, I'm going to make it snow for this girl.

869
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,520
And I'd like to make it snow for you.

870
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,520
And then he takes out a fan, like one of those like foldable fans.

871
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:15,240
He throws up the crumpled up paper and then he just fans it

872
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,240
for like a minute.

873
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,240
What?

874
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,240
It's not magic.

875
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,360
It's not magic at all.

876
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,240
Is it a laugh? Is like he wanting a laugh from it or is this?

877
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,600
No, this is the emotional climax.

878
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,280
He's shown us how to get the wife.

879
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,560
He's shown us how to get a child.

880
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,640
And now he's showing us how you can make it snow.

881
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,720
And this is the emotional climax of the piece.

882
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,040
And the music is like, you know, like almost Jobe from Arrested

883
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,840
Development, like final countdown-esque, like, oh,

884
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,040
and he's just fanning the snow up in the air and he keeps throwing up

885
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,160
more of the paper from his hand.

886
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,160
And I guess the impressive part was how much there was, but that wasn't

887
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,440
that impressive either.

888
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,440
And he just kept throwing it up and just kept and it was

889
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,520
spinning paper around.

890
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,800
Yeah. Yeah. So that might have been him.

891
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,360
The framing device was it was like a sick child.

892
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,160
That's what I remember.

893
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,320
And he's that like wanted it to snow.

894
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,360
He wanted to see snow before he passed or before because he was bullied at school.

895
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,040
It was either something as drastic as death or as dumb as like

896
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,360
he was picked on.

897
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:19,360
Also very similar to the David Copperfield show where every show

898
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,440
he does like a tribute to someone whose sister

899
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,080
someone's sister dies of cancer in the show.

900
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,240
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

901
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,360
I think so. That's a repeated moment.

902
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:33,440
He every every day, there's a new person whose sibling died

903
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:38,400
that he's now going to do a trick with them in tribute, which is clearly cast.

904
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,840
Yeah. Like, yeah, it's not real.

905
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:46,040
Well, maybe that is Angel does a lot of like dying children based magic.

906
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,000
I think this guy went to the Chris Angel School of Magic. Yeah.

907
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,680
I get him on board if you mention somebody who's sick.

908
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,760
Yeah, I think there's I think there's some sort of old old magician play.

909
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:01,840
Like, did Houdini ever do a show where he was trying to inspire you?

910
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,080
He's locked up with a sick child that he was going to get.

911
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,280
He's going to get out of these these chains

912
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,600
in honor of a child with an illness.

913
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,440
This bike chain belonged to Suzy. Right.

914
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:20,320
The real magic trick is convincing people that there is there is a real dying person.

915
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,040
That's the trick Copperfield pulls every night.

916
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,920
Nobody expected this to be as dark as it is.

917
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:31,760
Also, just to back up the he's he it's an aspirational inspirational thing

918
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,760
where you cannot you can have a wife wearing camo with ninja swords.

919
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,320
And also you can have a kid like my kid.

920
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,320
I mean, of course, anyone can have a kid.

921
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,200
What do you mean? Like, why do you have to be inspired to do that?

922
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,840
It was just like it was like a I I don't know.

923
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,760
I don't know. I don't know.

924
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,120
It was a very odd thing.

925
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,360
And you got to remember on these cruises, at least the fantasy and the dream,

926
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,360
the newest ships, the biggest ships there, they're, you know,

927
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,640
on their little cruise itineraries in the same location, the magic and the wonder.

928
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,000
They're going to Europe and Alaska and everywhere.

929
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,960
But these ships are going Caribbean back and Bahamas and back. That's all.

930
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,400
And the dream is a three to four night cruise.

931
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,440
So the first night embarkation day, they have a musical

932
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,120
showing you what you can do on the cruise. It is.

933
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:29,800
It is. It is the biggest garbage fire of a production

934
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,480
I've ever seen in my life, and they didn't record it.

935
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,920
No one's recorded it yet.

936
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,640
It is incredible to the point where like they'll show you like

937
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,040
the big water slide, they'll have a loop.

938
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,640
And the graphics are terrible.

939
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,800
And they have this loop of the water slide going and then up from the trap door.

940
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:50,480
Like because it's a family of like, you know, it's like a mom, a dad and a two,

941
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,400
a daughter and a son.

942
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,600
And they're like, we're going to have a great Disney cruise.

943
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,760
And the girl's like, I sure hope I find a guy.

944
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,120
And then the guy's like, I don't want to be here. It's Disney.

945
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,960
And then he gets up on the water slide and they have this terrible sequence

946
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,200
where they're all fake going down the water slide with the PowerPoint

947
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,080
water slide graphic in the back.

948
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:14,320
Oh, yeah. They wait. They're theatrically replicating the water slide experience.

949
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,160
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

950
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,960
So like it's supposed to give you the illusion that you have been transported

951
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,360
just in front of him on the aqueduct.

952
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,280
Wow. Very, very odd.

953
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,160
They're trying to sell you on this boat.

954
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,600
You are trapped on like, OK, you're here.

955
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,720
Like, I don't know that you need to keep selling.

956
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

957
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,680
It just take the win. But yeah, so they have that.

958
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:40,720
And then they have three musical productions, one of which is always a big number

959
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:45,280
that's either Tangled, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin or Frozen,

960
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,880
depending on what ship you're on.

961
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,720
And then there's two others which are musical review shows.

962
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:54,080
Also, complete garbage fires, because if they just came out and been like,

963
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,160
hey, everybody, we're going to sing a bunch of Disney songs, have fun.

964
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,480
Then it'd be like, great.

965
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,520
And then you get to be like, oh, they're very good singers.

966
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,880
They're very talented performers.

967
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,280
But what they don't they they don't do that.

968
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,440
They say, you know, we need to connect these random

969
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:14,080
Disney songs together based off of some sort of conflict.

970
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,760
So I think Wishes is that's a great one.

971
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:23,080
You want to watch it again? These words, there are only seven words in Disney.

972
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,960
Wishes is a show, and I think this is the right one,

973
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,360
where the three best friends at Disneyland growing up,

974
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,840
it's a brother and sister and a girl he likes.

975
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,720
And they have a bunch of Disneyland graphics

976
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,840
that they project behind them, so that looks like they're at Disneyland.

977
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,880
And that's a garbage fire, too.

978
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,360
I watched this. I think the same channel might have this show.

979
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:47,080
It's about they are it's three youngish people

980
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,040
who are going to graduate from high school soon.

981
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,120
And they're, you know, forgetting about their graduation stress

982
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,960
by going to Disneyland.

983
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,160
There is a virtual, as we just said, again, a staged version

984
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,280
of both Splash Mountain and Space Mountain.

985
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:05,560
So there's like vehicles that come up and they kind of like, whoa.

986
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:09,000
And then it is I think it seems like all of them, yeah, are just excuses

987
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,840
to tie together, you know, Beauty and the Beast and the whole new world.

988
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,760
And you'll be in my heart or whatever.

989
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,960
And this one I skipped.

990
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,240
I only watched scenes involving the teens.

991
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,920
I like I know what the Snow White sequence is going to be.

992
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,640
I've seen that before, so I only wanted to see, like,

993
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,280
what is the story of these guys?

994
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,760
And it ends with their graduation ceremony,

995
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,200
where one of the protagonists we've been following gives a speech

996
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,440
where she says, it's just it's just like my hero.

997
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:43,000
Walt Disney once said, oh, man, they like deify at a fake graduation.

998
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
She's deifying wall.

999
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,320
Walt Disney. Very bizarre.

1000
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,560
Well, they don't set up in that until it's way too late

1001
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,280
that these are not three siblings.

1002
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,200
Oh, so when there's like a love story between them, you're like, oh, what?

1003
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,160
What's going on? What's going on?

1004
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,760
And they're like, yeah, no, ever since we met at Disneyland with my sister,

1005
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,880
I was like, oh, I felt the same thing skimming through.

1006
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,000
I saw a kiss and like, wait a second.

1007
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,560
Don't worry. International waters.

1008
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:13,200
Anything goes. You know.

1009
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,280
We're registered in Alabama.

1010
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,480
Yeah. Now head up to deck seven for the big sibling kiss.

1011
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,520
There's another one where it's like some old gardener dad that like

1012
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,800
gets cats in the cradle with his child,

1013
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,160
and he can only learn that he's ruined his life by like the genie going like,

1014
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,360
well, you sure don't know anything about the bare necessities.

1015
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,600
Oh, come on.

1016
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,600
So if that guy had to do the game, do you know your family?

1017
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,800
He would he would fail.

1018
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,680
No, you'd fail.

1019
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,040
The reason I mention this is because that's it.

1020
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,920
You have the embarkation day one.

1021
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:54,120
You have the two musical reviews and you have the one big showstopper

1022
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,920
on the five nights on the dream, which is the max for the dream.

1023
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,600
They'll show the big showstopper twice.

1024
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,400
But with the fantasy, their minimum is six to seven days usually.

1025
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,840
So they have to fill two nights that were not planned by the production schedule.

1026
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:12,600
And they do that with motivational speakers, comedian jugglers

1027
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,200
and all sorts of screening of Rogue One.

1028
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:22,000
Right. The one thing I saw like dinner at five, a screening of Rogue One,

1029
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,760
the most depressing Star Wars movie at eight.

1030
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,040
And yeah, so and sometimes they'll show if there's a premiere at sea.

1031
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,920
And yes, premiere is spelled with EAR.

1032
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,080
Oh, yeah.

1033
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:40,360
Oh, yeah. They'll show that in the main theater that night.

1034
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,000
Oh, my gosh.

1035
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,320
Well, that's that's a ton.

1036
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,640
And, you know, we're jumping all around.

1037
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,800
We'll give I'll get back to this this morning.

1038
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,640
But since we brought up the musicals is another thing.

1039
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,480
And we might just need to do a whole episode about cruzicles.

1040
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,760
The phrase you made me aware of via DM.

1041
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,800
I didn't know there was this term.

1042
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,400
There wasn't. I made it up.

1043
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,800
You invented cruzicles.

1044
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,080
Yeah. So what I did is I took Cruz.

1045
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:03,840
Uh huh. Yes.

1046
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,240
Musical. And I put it together.

1047
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,280
It was between that and cruzicle, but spelled differently.

1048
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,840
But why don't they say cruz?

1049
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,040
Disney should use that. That seems so Disney.

1050
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,720
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

1051
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,760
Yeah. Very 90s Eisner Disney.

1052
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,040
Extremely well.

1053
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,920
And that segues into my next point.

1054
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,520
I saw a different show that's yeah, I guess you didn't get on your ship.

1055
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,800
And that show is called The Golden Mickey's.

1056
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:34,160
Yes. And the Golden Mickey's and Mike Jason, you can listeners.

1057
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,160
You can watch this, too.

1058
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,760
I was so delighted to discover The Golden Mickey's is an award show

1059
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,720
that's like for Disney stuff in general, like they're given an award to Pluto

1060
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,040
or whatever the best dog goes to.

1061
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,720
And like all the other shows, it's just an excuse to string together

1062
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,000
songs. But this one is very special because there's I don't know why,

1063
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,240
but a host has to drop out of the host isn't there.

1064
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,640
The host got shot by a lifeboat guy dumped to sea.

1065
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,760
So there's somebody who's like scrambling around with a clipboard

1066
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,120
and she suddenly has to host the show and she's very nervous.

1067
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,160
And then she gets a check in from somebody who heard that

1068
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,920
she might need his help.

1069
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:13,720
And who is that? But the big cheese himself, not Mickey Bob Iger.

1070
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:17,160
Bob Iger filmed original sketches

1071
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,960
that you can only see on this cruise ship thing.

1072
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:24,080
And he's like looking down, he has an eyeline sort of down into the left,

1073
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,360
like where the actress would be.

1074
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,320
And he doesn't call her by name so you could shuffle anybody in there.

1075
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:33,640
But yeah, in a very Eisner fashion, Iger does bits.

1076
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,400
It's it's great. And then introduces an award.

1077
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,120
He's like, you know, the next award goes to the

1078
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:45,280
the, you know, fantastic short that brought sound to the cartoons

1079
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,680
for the first time, a steamboat willy.

1080
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:52,280
It's I honestly seeing him do some Eisner isms made me so happy.

1081
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,520
This is what we demanded from him for years.

1082
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,640
And we didn't know he's been fulfilling it, but only at sea.

1083
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,320
Wow. He only does it at sea.

1084
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:05,600
Where you think it's like when actors used to go to Japan to film commercials

1085
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:09,200
because they were embarrassed before actors just made commercials

1086
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,920
nonstop all the time.

1087
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,680
They should really go.

1088
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:13,960
Oh, you go ahead, Kevin.

1089
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,080
No. OK.

1090
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,280
What's interesting about the Golden Mickeys is that this is the last

1091
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,240
bit, I think, of the contractual obligation that trapped Whoopi Goldberg

1092
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:27,560
and Tim Allen and all of these like 90s era Disney superstar limo stars.

1093
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,080
The superstar limo cast.

1094
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,680
This is the last thing.

1095
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,520
They show up to to present awards.

1096
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,720
Oh, I didn't see Whoopi.

1097
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,960
I see Tim Allen.

1098
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,280
There is a bit for Tim Allen.

1099
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,360
You only want from Tim Allen.

1100
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,800
You only watch on the cruise ship.

1101
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,960
Maybe there isn't Whoopi, but I see.

1102
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,760
I see Whoopi. I'm looking at it right now.

1103
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,280
She's in here. OK. Great.

1104
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,520
Angela Lansbury is in here.

1105
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,680
Wait, I missed her, too. Yeah.

1106
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,360
Yeah. It's a fan.

1107
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,280
It's a fantastic show.

1108
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,800
And what they do, which is actually very clever, give them props outside

1109
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,960
the theater, they have a little red carpet.

1110
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,040
And while you're walking in, they have some there.

1111
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,000
They're the camera with a live feed to the theater.

1112
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,400
So as people are walking in, little kids can go, Hi, where are you from?

1113
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,400
I'm from Tennessee. Like, that's great.

1114
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,280
Enjoy the show.

1115
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,000
And you'll see him on the screen, they'll walk in and it's it's fine.

1116
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,120
It's cute. That's nice.

1117
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,720
It's very nice.

1118
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,480
We should maybe we can cover Golden Mickey separately.

1119
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,880
I think that might require reviewing.

1120
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,480
Let's bring it back to this thing.

1121
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,840
Unless we don't want to.

1122
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,680
Unless this is too limiting of a thing.

1123
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:27,200
But I feel like we should do the topic that the problem is, is this thing

1124
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,880
is just a thing about everything on the cruise.

1125
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,480
That's the yes, it leads you into it.

1126
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,080
Well, that's it. That shows that it's doing its job.

1127
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,160
Its job is to tell you about all the fun things you can do on the cruise.

1128
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,480
And it does it.

1129
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,000
But I enjoyed just watching this in and of itself.

1130
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,880
Natalie, the cruise director, was very charming.

1131
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,680
She is British when and it's a delightful British accent.

1132
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:52,000
And it leads to wonderful things like when she tells you about the like adults

1133
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,680
only district, which is at least in this case is called the tube.

1134
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,680
But in her very British way, it becomes the tube.

1135
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,400
It's the tube.

1136
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,160
And I really liked when she would refer to C Club host

1137
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,760
Joshi to find out what you can do on the tube.

1138
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,560
Meet Joshi in the tube.

1139
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,240
Got like a Robin Leach style.

1140
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,600
It is a very female.

1141
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,120
Unless that's just my only default British accent.

1142
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,360
That's possible. Yes. Yeah.

1143
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:21,800
Oh, there's also the one bar becomes adults only after a certain hour.

1144
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,880
It's called the D Lounge.

1145
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,680
And that's disgusting.

1146
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,360
You sick cruise fucks.

1147
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,520
It's no we know what you're all getting up to.

1148
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,640
You're disgustingly named.

1149
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,160
It could be it could be the big D Lounge.

1150
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,160
It's got pulsating lights.

1151
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,840
That's why we call it the throbbing D Lounge.

1152
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,600
Well, you're going to love this.

1153
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,800
The the teen club is named the Vibe.

1154
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,080
I am the tea.

1155
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:55,440
Even hearing teen and tween clubs made me uncomfortable.

1156
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:01,480
But it's then she says now, now for all of you, tweens, for tweens, it's Vibe.

1157
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,560
And for teens, it's the edge.

1158
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,440
It's not comfortable with hearing about tween clubs.

1159
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,880
Yeah, the oh, here's it's just I don't know.

1160
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,360
Are you SCA fans, society's explorers of adventures?

1161
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,720
Oh, sure. Yes.

1162
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,480
The organization that binds together all of the Disney explorers. Yes.

1163
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,920
The Ocean Ears Club is Mary Ocean here.

1164
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,080
She runs it.

1165
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:27,000
And there's a bunch of SCA references in the Ocean Ears Club.

1166
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,640
Oh, is that her main where she lives?

1167
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,640
That's like where that character exists.

1168
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,800
Yeah, only there, only in a sign on a cruise ship.

1169
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,400
Everyone else gets their own attraction.

1170
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,760
Well, wait, doesn't she have the water slide now?

1171
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,280
And didn't they add yet?

1172
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,840
They added something. Yeah, they added something for her.

1173
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:45,960
Because I think she's right.

1174
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,800
She is she possibly the only female member of C.

1175
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,480
No, now the the Soren, the Soren Japan character.

1176
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,800
Yeah, I forget the name of her, but they were like,

1177
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,400
maybe we should have more female characters and not just one on a plaque on a boat

1178
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,640
who has no, yeah, no represent.

1179
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,200
It doesn't do anything fun.

1180
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,640
Yeah, she doesn't like a cool ride.

1181
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,040
So let's give her a slide and a plaque.

1182
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,400
Well, they should also give her the Tween Club vibe

1183
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,120
presented by Mary Ocean. Yeah.

1184
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,480
I think it's funny, though, we got to get good representation

1185
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,760
in our colonial cast of artifact stealers.

1186
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,760
Yeah, it's a horrible, horrible tyrants.

1187
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,000
Yes.

1188
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,040
Pith helmet wearing more female criminals.

1189
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,160
Hire more female tyrants.

1190
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:38,160
I'm flipping through notes just to find others like little bits.

1191
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:38,760
Oh, you know what?

1192
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,600
Also, another thing, we missed the very beginning of this.

1193
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,840
I also saw exactly what you were seeing in this whole show

1194
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:45,680
right at the beginning.

1195
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:49,040
The opening graphic is also extremely rudimentary.

1196
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,440
It's like a it's a shot of the ocean.

1197
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:55,840
And there's titles coming up that say our courses set second star to the right.

1198
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,920
What is your Disney dream?

1199
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,160
And there's a ship slowly rising the whole time,

1200
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:04,160
but not in the way that animation needs perspective to change.

1201
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:09,360
It's just they took a little ship clip art from zero percent to 100 percent.

1202
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,240
Keyframe here, keyframe here.

1203
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,240
And it just moves up very evenly.

1204
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,400
And then more mundane copy.

1205
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:20,520
Remember, all it takes is faith and trust and a little bit of pixie dust,

1206
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,280
which that's another one faith.

1207
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:26,000
And I found that odd to hear the word faith said in a Disney setting.

1208
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,600
It seems oddly religious, which maybe that's again allowed.

1209
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,080
It's yeah.

1210
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,720
Oh, Scott, you're talking about the text on screen at the very beginning.

1211
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,480
Yes, the opening graphics of this, which is it's a paragraph.

1212
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,640
It's a lot.

1213
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,920
They got a lot to go through.

1214
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,640
Is this I'm is this part of the show?

1215
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,440
It's what I saw is this puck fly.

1216
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,000
Yeah, this is the puck.

1217
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,160
Oh, no, I don't know.

1218
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:51,560
I don't know.

1219
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,760
This might be what played in the room because it is all a little Orent.

1220
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:59,280
Our course is set first, start of the right and straight on till morning.

1221
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:01,040
What is your Disney dream?

1222
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,840
Remember, all it takes is faith and trust and just a little of pixie dust.

1223
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:05,840
Let your dream begin.

1224
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:06,960
It's just so long.

1225
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,960
Each one of those has its own thing.

1226
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,920
It's and you know, it's weird about it.

1227
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,520
And I don't know if this is just the recording.

1228
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,640
And I don't know if they play this on the fantasy, but this is clearly a graphic

1229
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,120
that should only be shown on the Disney dream.

1230
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:20,960
Oh, right.

1231
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,440
Is it the wrong boat?

1232
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,080
Yeah, it's on the wrong ship.

1233
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,200
What? Which I am not putting the past in that they play it on that ship.

1234
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,920
Geez, get your act together.

1235
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,680
Well, because then very clearly right after it says the official,

1236
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,080
what I guess is really the name of what we're talking about.

1237
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,400
Good morning, Disney fantasy.

1238
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,680
That's like actually, I think we'll still call this episode

1239
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,240
the clunky title Disney Cruise morning show.

1240
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,080
But let's be official here.

1241
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,240
It's good morning, Disney fantasy.

1242
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:52,000
They also tell you to make sure to have your key to the world card.

1243
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,640
Yeah, the room key.

1244
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,400
But that name doesn't make sense unless you're at Disney World.

1245
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,520
Like, well, it means the real world.

1246
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,920
That's the that's the that's the card you use to get on and off the ship as well.

1247
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,000
So they can identify. Right. Yeah.

1248
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,520
So that's so like which they really should call it the key to a few ports

1249
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,520
in the Caribbean and also our private island.

1250
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,800
And also the tube.

1251
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,400
That's too good vibe and edge.

1252
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:25,200
Right. But only for tweens.

1253
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:28,240
Don't be sneaking into vibe if you ain't a tween.

1254
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:31,320
He's becoming a little more Mary Poppins.

1255
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,400
I there's one that I there's one stint that I like where she

1256
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,880
describes the day's entertainment.

1257
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,200
And she says that today is a big day

1258
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:48,800
because we're getting ready for Jack Jack's Incredible Diaper Dash,

1259
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,400
which made Erin ask, did she mean to say Jack Jack's Incredible Diaper

1260
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,800
Rash? But I guess I guess not.

1261
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:59,840
It was not. They did mean dash because what this is and she says in a great line,

1262
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:03,720
what we're going to do, you're going to bring your babies to cabin 15

1263
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,720
and we're going to race them.

1264
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,880
It's in the it's in the it's in the main part of the ship.

1265
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:17,720
It's in the atrium. It's not like, you know, like a back area of a cabin.

1266
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:22,560
It's not somewhere where the babies could fall off the ship.

1267
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,400
Bring your babies. It's not a plank.

1268
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,600
Your babies are going to walk the plank.

1269
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:31,400
The one place on the ship you can smoke.

1270
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,120
Are you tired of your baby?

1271
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,680
You it's legal to get rid of them here at sea.

1272
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,800
We're gambling on babies.

1273
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,720
Throw your cash on the ground.

1274
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:45,440
Five thousand dollars on the three month old.

1275
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,520
Winning baby take all.

1276
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,880
Well, now hold on a second.

1277
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,840
That's the thing that I saw on one of the other information loops.

1278
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:56,240
There are no ATMs on the ship.

1279
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:00,400
You have to bring cash and every guest may cash

1280
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,480
a one hundred dollar personal check once per cruise.

1281
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,080
What? Yeah.

1282
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,280
I bitterly regret it.

1283
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,120
Yeah. I bitterly quickly writing a check

1284
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,440
made out for the Collins baby.

1285
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,400
Kevin, are there casinos on this ship?

1286
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,000
Because most cruise ship have casinos.

1287
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,320
There are no casinos.

1288
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,280
And that's that's the main difference.

1289
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:34,160
And I like that because I'm not I'm not a big casino guy,

1290
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:37,680
which I know is going to upset a lot of my fans.

1291
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,520
They want a real sleaze bag, isn't they?

1292
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,000
I'm not a big casino guy.

1293
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,600
But yeah, so no, there's no I don't know what this like what the space is

1294
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:50,160
replaced by, because those are pretty big on some ships.

1295
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:53,320
Yeah, probably the kids clubs now that I say that out loud.

1296
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,080
Or maybe the D lounge.

1297
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,800
The D lounge is where they play all the game shows

1298
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:02,560
and it's where the high stakes bingo is and where and all those kind of games.

1299
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:05,960
Well, then what are the stakes of the bingo if not cash money?

1300
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,280
Wait, what? Wait, that's an X gambling.

1301
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,240
Oh, what?

1302
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,960
So there is no gambling.

1303
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,440
Yes, there's no casinos.

1304
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,640
Oh, different questions.

1305
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,440
So you can gamble on these things.

1306
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,360
Yeah, I'm like I'm like a bridge troll.

1307
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:21,960
You have to ask me exactly what what it is to give you the information.

1308
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,360
Monkey's paw wishes like we phrased it wrong.

1309
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,040
Now the wish is weird.

1310
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:29,800
He doesn't like slot machines, but he loves high gal poker.

1311
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,280
OK, got it.

1312
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,480
Do you have to pay into the bingo or is that just something you can do?

1313
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:38,360
You do. If I remember correctly, you have to buy every card.

1314
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,680
Really? Yeah.

1315
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,640
So that is gambling.

1316
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,440
That's like standard bingo, though.

1317
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,000
That's like standard bingo rules, which is gambling.

1318
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,720
That's just a cuter Disney way to gamble.

1319
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,040
Yeah, right. Wow. Interesting.

1320
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,000
This is how much you can do at sea.

1321
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,000
How much do you think you win?

1322
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,360
Ten grand, maybe? I don't know.

1323
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,680
Wow. Really?

1324
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,640
I guess I'm guessing maybe.

1325
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,960
If somebody showed up and just oddly put down like

1326
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,200
two hundred thousand dollars on this Disney bingo.

1327
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,280
When my numbers come in

1328
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,640
and letter and corresponding letter.

1329
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,000
Yeah, bingo is a bad one.

1330
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:17,920
Bingo is too random.

1331
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,600
That's kind of a bad one to do.

1332
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,000
High stakes bingo is definitely a bad idea.

1333
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,040
Yeah. I already lost so much money on the baby racing.

1334
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,920
Trying to make a back on the make up.

1335
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:28,960
Dumbass baby.

1336
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,040
Just turn around, just spun around and

1337
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,360
birthed.

1338
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,240
That's what happens during the baby races.

1339
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,480
I love the baby races.

1340
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:38,960
You know, I enjoyed it.

1341
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:39,720
Then I watched.

1342
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:43,200
I will say then I watched video of Jack Jack's incredible diaper dash.

1343
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,680
I laughed a lot.

1344
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,680
It's really funny.

1345
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:50,480
And I but it did disturb me how many videos were available

1346
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,880
to watch of Jack Jack's incredible diaper dash, because if you're available,

1347
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:57,960
if you're able to take video of this, that implies that it's not your baby down there.

1348
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:01,720
So why are we filming and posting to YouTube the baby race?

1349
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:06,880
There are so many different diaper dash videos from just looking right now.

1350
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:11,000
And then there's also other non Disney diaper dashes

1351
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:15,760
from different like from men's basketball, college basketball games.

1352
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:20,120
Oh, I watched one on the floor of a of an NBA game.

1353
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:23,080
Like that was pretty exciting to watch babies like.

1354
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,280
Yeah, like being on the floor of an arena

1355
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,240
and with the whole crowd cheering them.

1356
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,200
I don't maybe I'm a fan of this genre.

1357
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:30,880
There's a.

1358
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,600
Corrin's. Yeah.

1359
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,960
Diaper Derby also.

1360
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,880
Diaper Derby is there anything different about the rules of a diaper derby

1361
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:39,360
or is it essentially a dash?

1362
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:42,120
I'm assuming there's a lap.

1363
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,760
Yeah, there's got to be a lap system.

1364
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:45,600
Yeah. Wow.

1365
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,200
I didn't realize that baby racing was so popular.

1366
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,880
And there's diaper decathelons where you have to do others.

1367
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:54,080
You have to then get on a bike and fire a bow and arrow.

1368
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,120
Shoot a gun.

1369
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:59,200
Since quarantine, they've just been replaying the top tens of the

1370
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,800
the diaper races on ESPN.

1371
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,200
Yeah, yeah, I'm sick of watching star

1372
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,840
diaper dashes from 2004.

1373
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,520
The 2000 babies aren't going to be babies anymore

1374
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:13,240
by the time that we need to reopen the diaper dashes.

1375
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,800
There's zoom calling like, what was going through your mind during that race?

1376
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,200
They're like 18 now.

1377
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:22,240
Seems like you didn't have it today, would you?

1378
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,920
They're going to put all the babies up at Disney World and keep them

1379
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:30,040
quarantined so we can get diaper dashes back on TV.

1380
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,440
Their families will not be able to visit them.

1381
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:35,120
Unfortunately, that is the sacrifice that they're making.

1382
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,680
The higher seated babies will get better resorts.

1383
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:44,600
A machine will will just spray milk into their Grand Floridian room.

1384
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,960
And that's how they will get fed.

1385
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,600
Little rings they wear to monitor their health

1386
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,040
or keep falling off their little baby fingers.

1387
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,360
Too big to put them on their wrists.

1388
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:56,600
Too big. Yeah.

1389
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:01,400
Are we starting these diaper dashes too soon?

1390
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,520
But America needs to be entertained.

1391
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,480
America needs them.

1392
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,360
You have to think about all of the commentators for the diaper

1393
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,680
dashes and all of the the crew.

1394
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,880
Like, it's not just about starting the sport, it's about really

1395
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,320
simulating the economy.

1396
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:19,160
The diaper dancers, you got to put them to work, the cheerleaders.

1397
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,560
Yeah, it's a whole economy.

1398
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,440
They're very good.

1399
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,840
Surprisingly coordinated, the diaper dancers.

1400
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:28,640
Go to the sport.

1401
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,520
We'll go to the sports book in Vegas and start betting on them again.

1402
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,760
That's a whole other part of the economy.

1403
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,560
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1404
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:36,800
It's got to come back.

1405
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,240
We can't do this forever.

1406
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:38,840
No. Yeah.

1407
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:39,840
And what do you think?

1408
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,280
What do you think my plan was as we head into a depression?

1409
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:47,520
My I need to get my baby racing and making me sweet dollars.

1410
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,680
Well, Vegas is open, Scott.

1411
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,960
So hey, you're right.

1412
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,320
We're going to your babies.

1413
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:54,360
Can't get it. That's fine.

1414
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,320
We're yeah, we're heading to the cosmopolitan.

1415
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:00,240
They have a small there's a small shelf life for a baby in diaper dashing.

1416
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:01,720
So, yeah, you got to get him started.

1417
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:03,640
Yeah, I know. God, clocks tick even right now.

1418
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:04,920
Why am I even recording this thing?

1419
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,680
I should be on my way to Vegas.

1420
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:07,920
Yeah, come on, kid.

1421
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,440
And they just do it on roulette tables.

1422
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:12,680
Go.

1423
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:16,280
The diaper dashing prepares them to have the winner's mindset

1424
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:19,400
when they roll over to become professional gamers, like when they go

1425
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,920
from diaper dash to Fortnite.

1426
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:22,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1427
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:25,600
We knew we were missing that pre step just to make sure.

1428
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,200
Yeah.

1429
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,440
Did you all happen to see what I sent you?

1430
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,960
The zombified.

1431
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:35,040
Oh, no. Yeah, let's let's talk about this.

1432
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:40,760
So this is a tween activity that you made us aware of on the ships.

1433
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:46,320
And this is a thing where tweens cannot just hang out and watch movies.

1434
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:49,240
They can hang out in and be in a movie.

1435
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:53,560
So, I mean, feel free to jump in and explain any of this.

1436
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:58,600
But it seems to me as though there is a there is a preset film

1437
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:02,160
and it is a zombie film is called zombified.

1438
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:05,240
And half of the movie has been shot before.

1439
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:11,080
And the other half is remade on every voyage starring your tweens.

1440
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:15,800
Yeah. So I've been dragged to these by like, you know, family members

1441
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,880
have been like because they show them for the whole families.

1442
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,200
And everybody goes to the movie theater and they play the seven

1443
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,120
or 11 minute thing for everybody.

1444
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:26,400
I've seen multiple versions of this and they're all insanely bad.

1445
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:32,520
But it's this weird like it's it's almost it's very 80s

1446
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,200
in a way where it's kind of like you can be in the movies

1447
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:39,000
and the pre recorded character will be like, look, there's a zombie behind you.

1448
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,480
And then it'll cut to a very different location of you turning around

1449
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,840
and a zombie will be coming at you.

1450
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:49,920
And a lot of the movie is just the pre recorded tape after rewatching it.

1451
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:53,240
It's most of it is there's just a few shots of the kids.

1452
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,400
There's there's two main characters.

1453
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:58,720
There's there's like there's a young guy and a girl in a science lab.

1454
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,720
And most of the movies about them running from zombies and your kids

1455
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:08,120
are the zombies in the relatively unchallenging dialogue free role of a zombie.

1456
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:13,160
So yeah, I guess they didn't want to put a lot of dramatic weight onto the kids.

1457
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:17,640
And the thing I recognize most about this is how weird the high school

1458
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:20,120
and the pre recorded tape looks.

1459
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:24,240
It looks like they shot it at the Walt Disney, like around the offices

1460
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,120
at the studios in Burbank.

1461
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,240
Like if you go back, it does not look like a high school.

1462
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:31,280
No, it's a very officey high school. Absolutely.

1463
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,840
It's strange. And I was like, is this on the ship or did they build like

1464
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,400
pseudo sets on the ship?

1465
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,040
They know that was not on the ship.

1466
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,240
I don't know what the story is there.

1467
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:46,880
The Cruiser Coal Training Center, which I saw some clips of, is in Toronto.

1468
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:53,120
I think I think that's where they practice and recruit actors in Toronto.

1469
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:56,280
So maybe because it looks the most like New York. Yes.

1470
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:00,960
It looks like it looks like all the great cities of the world.

1471
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,320
You can learn in theater.

1472
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,760
Generic. You can learn in theater.

1473
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:08,160
Yeah, I really liked I'm so glad you made me aware of zombified

1474
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,560
and you can watch performances of zombified on YouTube.

1475
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:13,200
One of my favorite things about it is the little the preamble,

1476
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:17,600
maybe with a cruise director typers and who says, you know, it's been so great

1477
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,840
hanging out with your kids, your amazing kids all week.

1478
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,720
And now we're going to debut the film that they made.

1479
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:24,680
Ladies and gentlemen, here it is zombified.

1480
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:28,720
And then it starts and the lights go down and then there's a bunch of murmuring still.

1481
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:34,080
And then you can in the version I watch, you can hear one one kid go, shut up.

1482
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,320
Which is something I haven't that really that ratatouille

1483
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:41,240
flashed me back to high school because I feel like middle school.

1484
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:44,800
That's like what every day was people needing to hush.

1485
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,800
And then somebody say, shut up.

1486
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:51,800
Yeah, it's a very it's the way I would describe it.

1487
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:57,200
If there's hundreds of versions of this online, hundreds of versions of zombified.

1488
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,760
I would just describe it as sweaty.

1489
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,960
Yeah, it's just uncomfortable.

1490
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,560
Both the prerecorded tape and the tape they shoot on the ships.

1491
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,960
Yeah, yeah. You know what I like a lot?

1492
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,960
This genuinely got kind of a laugh out of me is that you're following

1493
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:16,520
these two prerecorded characters and then they decide, well, to get away from the zombies,

1494
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,240
we have to put on some makeup because they know what we look like.

1495
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,280
And then they put on makeup and then there's a reveal

1496
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:24,600
of just two people you've never seen before.

1497
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:26,680
And they go, did it work? Do we look different?

1498
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:31,640
And that's the way they weave in the people who like the two, the new people on this.

1499
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:33,400
And I'm like, this this I like.

1500
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,640
That's like an aware meta joke. That's a lot of fun.

1501
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,560
Yeah, the I've watched a lot.

1502
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,520
I watched it not a lot, maybe four clips of him.

1503
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,720
And this is a huge hit.

1504
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:47,360
You can tell because all the videos are just people in the audience

1505
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,400
taping them because they're in it.

1506
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,640
And every time they show up, there's just glee.

1507
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,120
It's just pure glee from the audience and people around.

1508
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,440
There you are. There you are.

1509
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,400
Like just this must be the most exciting thing.

1510
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:02,640
This is probably I guess like the that Star Trek thing they did at Universal.

1511
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:05,280
It's exactly the same thing. Yeah. Right. Yeah.

1512
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,680
But there there are so many.

1513
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:12,200
It reminds me of how if you type in any musical, if you type in like guys

1514
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:15,800
and dolls, high school, you will just find dozens and dozens,

1515
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,840
if not hundreds of different productions.

1516
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,480
And yet never one starring Jason Sheridan.

1517
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:23,040
We got to find out. We got to digitize them.

1518
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:27,480
I, you know, that you're in guys and dolls.

1519
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,320
No, unfortunately, no, I was in a lot of like

1520
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,680
the good videos I have copies of are all like

1521
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:39,000
from this one drama company that makes these plays that are cookie cutter

1522
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,040
plays with a set number of songs and like 30 characters.

1523
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,640
So everyone can have a line.

1524
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,720
Just for a recap, I know a lot of those there's no just a recap.

1525
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,160
List some of your roles real quick. What have I played?

1526
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:52,920
I played a Nazi saboteur

1527
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:56,440
who is masquerading as a British hypnotist at a USO.

1528
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,160
I played an island of Dr.

1529
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,560
Moreau creature. I played.

1530
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,400
Oh, I played a small town southern sheriff

1531
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:08,000
who did not like this 60s music festival coming to town. What?

1532
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,280
Is that a new one?

1533
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,520
There you there's so many reveals of these. There's so many reveals.

1534
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:16,960
And then I played an ascot wearing beret wearing film director.

1535
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,760
Yeah, that's right. Please.

1536
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:22,080
It's time. It's time.

1537
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,040
You were an adult.

1538
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:26,520
Or was this when you were a kid? No, this was like 10 to 13.

1539
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:30,320
So like that's a hunk range.

1540
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,080
What's that? What?

1541
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,720
That's like that's like honk range.

1542
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,640
That's like prime honk time.

1543
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,840
I don't think I know what you're drift.

1544
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,840
What word are you saying?

1545
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:41,080
Honk? I know honk.

1546
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:42,800
Like you guys seen the musical honk?

1547
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,800
I've seen like seven versions of it. No, no.

1548
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:48,680
Honk is probably well, maybe it was just the easiest

1549
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,400
musical to license in Kansas City when I lived there,

1550
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:55,000
because every time I was dragged to some like, oh, hey, my sister's cousins

1551
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,360
in a musical and we have to go watch it.

1552
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:57,320
It was always honk.

1553
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:00,400
It was the musical version of the Ugly Dunkling.

1554
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:04,760
Oh, I still wasn't sure if you were saying honk or hawk,

1555
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,640
like the bird or hawk.

1556
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,920
I was just saying honk weird, like I couldn't say it like.

1557
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,400
Or honk. Have you seen honk?

1558
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,320
It was honk with a bizarre accent.

1559
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,600
The tubes. And honk.

1560
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:18,280
Have you seen it going in the theater? Catch honk in the tubes?

1561
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,800
He has a real honk.

1562
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,840
Yeah, it's about a honky man.

1563
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,160
OK, clearly this isn't as universal as I thought it was.

1564
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,360
This happens a lot.

1565
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,880
There's a lot of regional things in the Midwest that did not translate well.

1566
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:33,760
You just thought honk was like maybe honk is huge in a certain region.

1567
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:36,120
Honk did play the West End,

1568
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,520
London's version of Broadway.

1569
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,000
It doesn't look like it ever had any Broadway runs,

1570
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
but it did have a lot of regional runs.

1571
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,080
So, yeah, I guess so.

1572
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,480
They probably made a fortune licensing it to it.

1573
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:51,120
But yeah, did you say this was your sister or who was in honk?

1574
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:58,320
I saw it was always like my girlfriend's sister or my cousin's daughter

1575
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,920
is in some version of honk.

1576
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,320
And do you remember if any of them played, you know,

1577
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:09,080
Dot's husband, Greylag, or the domesticated chicken, Low Butt?

1578
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,080
Well, no.

1579
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:13,720
No, no.

1580
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:16,560
I remember that it was always the reason I remembered it

1581
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,960
is because there was that kind of role that you were talking about of like,

1582
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:23,440
I'm the news reporter in this one scene and the ensemble in every other scene.

1583
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,440
And so that's it was always like something like that.

1584
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:29,480
Like, I really like this sentence from the Wikipedia also.

1585
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,160
The US version is called J.

1586
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,240
Bird rather than Jack Daw.

1587
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:37,000
And the TV show is renamed America's Most Feathered.

1588
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:39,720
I'm into honk.

1589
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,680
I like honk already. Yeah, yeah.

1590
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,720
Sorry. That's really off track.

1591
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,640
But yeah, so honk on the tubes.

1592
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,160
I do. I do really wish Jason had been honk. Yes, I do.

1593
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:53,440
Yeah, I wish I had been in honk or the kids version of honk.

1594
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,680
Honk, Junior, honk, Junior.

1595
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,000
We found it at the same time.

1596
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,160
Jinx and a lot of characters do not appear on Junior.

1597
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,400
Wow. Low butt.

1598
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,680
They get a low butt in honk, Junior.

1599
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:07,560
Now, that is a very common thing for musical licensing.

1600
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:10,040
There's like junior versions of musicals.

1601
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:14,560
The most famous one I know is the Into the Woods, Junior,

1602
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:18,760
which stops at the end of Act One, where everyone ends happily

1603
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,520
and no one has died yet.

1604
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:24,080
Like the second half of Into the Woods, everything goes to shit.

1605
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,440
And if you are like doing a middle school production,

1606
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,920
you just do the nice stuff.

1607
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,960
Sweeney Todd, Junior.

1608
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:34,080
Sweeney Todd, Junior is just a regular barber.

1609
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:35,520
Yeah, he's just cutting hair.

1610
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,880
He's just really good at his job.

1611
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,960
Man, I'm looking sharp. Thanks, Sweeney.

1612
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,240
This is the age range where when I went on the cruise,

1613
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:47,920
I was so excited to see a scaled down production of 42nd Street at Sea

1614
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:52,840
and very upset that the other nights of entertainment were just kind of standards

1615
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:58,800
or like, yeah, standard, different musical numbers and stuff.

1616
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,000
And I was like, I want to go see 42nd Street again,

1617
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,720
which I have seen productions of multiple times.

1618
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:07,560
In fact, Mike, I think I drove you to 42nd Street at the Pantages once.

1619
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:11,000
We definitely did see 42nd Street at the Pantages a few years ago.

1620
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,240
Yeah. Wow.

1621
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:16,200
Why? How come? Why do you love it?

1622
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:21,000
It's just about a bunch of people putting on a show and it's got a lot of great songs.

1623
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,400
There's not much to it.

1624
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:27,440
It's just sort of like it's sort of like kick lines and like dancing and showbiz.

1625
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,200
Kick lines.

1626
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:33,640
The in the original Jerry Urbach, very famously, was the director in the original cast.

1627
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:35,320
Hey, Lumiere.

1628
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,240
Yeah, that's right. Neat.

1629
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,080
Well, that's cool.

1630
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,840
We need to get Jason back on the stage.

1631
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:43,600
You're telling me we got to re what's that?

1632
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,000
What do you re stage honk?

1633
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,560
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1634
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:48,640
License honk.

1635
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:53,920
Yes. The Jason Sheridan led reprieve reference when that reference was so much different in my mind.

1636
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:57,200
I thought I was just going to be like honk and you were going to be like, holy crap.

1637
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,480
Are you serious? I'll be like, yeah, we're going to become best friends.

1638
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,880
But no, or we or we just take honk.

1639
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,880
So for granted, like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Honk.

1640
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,520
Ever look, that's an obvious reference. Yeah. Yeah.

1641
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,840
Oh, man. No, hang on.

1642
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:11,840
But that did happen.

1643
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,680
I think we're all very excited about honk.

1644
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:16,320
So don't sell your honk reference short. Yeah. Yeah.

1645
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,680
OK, back to the ship.

1646
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:22,360
I mean, I'm just I'm just giving through random things that happen in this.

1647
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:25,280
I want one quote that I like a lot.

1648
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,800
And speaking of adult versions and junior versions, there is a bibbidi

1649
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,440
bobbidi boutique on the ship.

1650
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:35,280
The like the what is mainly a princess and pirate,

1651
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:39,720
you know, makeover place that is at the parks as well.

1652
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,560
And in the video, there's a moment that I like where

1653
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:48,280
the guy in charge of it clarifies that for the most part,

1654
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:52,880
you can only get your pirate makeovers if you're under 12.

1655
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:58,480
But on Pirates Day, as you mentioned, Kevin, the rules change and quote,

1656
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,880
that is when we can take anybody from three to dead.

1657
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:09,440
And it's said with about that much mustard on it, like the nothing that I just did.

1658
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:15,040
And then and ignored by British Natalie, who just says, wow,

1659
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:18,360
like there's no he doesn't emphasize it as a joke.

1660
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:19,680
And you're just like, what?

1661
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,560
Three three to dead.

1662
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:23,440
What a disturbing phrase.

1663
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:27,760
I think they also said they could make you up to be sailors or captains

1664
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,240
at this bibbidi bobbidi boutique.

1665
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:34,120
So you could look like seagoing Mickey, who Mickey

1666
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:37,920
in his captain's outfit looks a little like Elron Hubbard.

1667
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:43,560
Can I say Captain's Mickey is maybe my favorite Mickey

1668
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,560
next to that 80s polo shirt Mickey?

1669
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:47,760
Yeah, that's true.

1670
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,920
Captain Mini. Oh, yeah.

1671
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,000
Maybe his first mate, Mini.

1672
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,800
Yeah, what are their position? Yeah, I'm not sure.

1673
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:58,360
On the ship, do you get to do you get a lot of Mickey and Minnie time?

1674
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,320
Yeah, no, there's it's great.

1675
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,720
And the lines are short because there's not as they're everywhere.

1676
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:07,800
They do meet and greets pretty frequently and they have a good variety of characters.

1677
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:12,320
So, yeah, there is a Donald seat sticking out of the one

1678
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,160
the one part of the ship.

1679
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:16,080
The port. Yeah.

1680
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:20,120
Is there is it a regular size Donald seat or is it a giant one?

1681
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,760
You seen Donald's like Donald Butt? His butt.

1682
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:23,600
Yeah, yeah.

1683
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,280
That's the thing we say seat.

1684
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,600
We call it a seat. Oh, sorry.

1685
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:28,640
Yeah, it's yeah.

1686
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:31,320
Let me go to my podcast, the right second gate show Bible.

1687
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,240
Yeah, I got it. Sorry.

1688
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:36,920
It's when I guess by that logic, then because they're birds,

1689
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:39,320
then all the characters in honk would also have seats.

1690
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,600
Yeah, that's right.

1691
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,800
Low, low seat. It would be low seat.

1692
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,720
Oh, yeah. Let's get butt out of there. That's offensive.

1693
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,160
Yeah, low seat.

1694
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:50,280
Um, the that's the aqueduct.

1695
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:54,040
You see his seat, similar to how Mickey's fill our magic ends with him

1696
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,440
with his his seat.

1697
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,280
The seat. Yes. Now you're doing it. Great.

1698
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:00,520
The aqueduct is supposed to be like that part where you're

1699
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:04,320
it's he was supposed to fly out and then you it's actually like a post

1700
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,800
show with a water slide.

1701
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,920
There's a pre show which you see all the little duck feet going up

1702
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:12,560
into the slide and there's a little pre show comics panel

1703
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,520
explaining the story of the aqueduct.

1704
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:17,800
The main show is you riding the ride and the post show is you seen

1705
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:21,080
where Donald ended up is that because you get off and you walk around

1706
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:23,120
and you see the post show, which is just Donald's seat.

1707
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,320
It's a very interesting narrative structure.

1708
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:26,760
Oh, the aqueduct.

1709
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,920
Oh, there's a plot to it. Essential.

1710
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:31,280
There's a plot to this water slide.

1711
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,760
And the pre show rhymes.

1712
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:34,240
So, yeah, go for that.

1713
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:37,160
Geez. Oh, that's cool.

1714
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:39,640
What else? What have we missed about this?

1715
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:41,200
This this show?

1716
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:46,440
I I'll say it made me a little uncomfortable anytime that they

1717
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:50,600
I think the constant use of the word adult is bothersome to me.

1718
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:53,560
I guess they know they need to clarify that some of these things are adults

1719
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:57,680
only when you hear phrases like adults crazy karaoke.

1720
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:04,560
Adult just implies doesn't it sound seem like it's going to be pornographic?

1721
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:07,080
Like, put your keys in the bowl.

1722
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:14,480
Yes, the nightly swing.

1723
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:19,920
These keys to the world open up a whole new world for you at sea.

1724
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:22,000
Oh, that's what they're for.

1725
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:22,960
That is fantastic.

1726
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:27,560
So what every newlywed game, that's their big Disney joke, is they say,

1727
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:30,600
will you describe your sex life?

1728
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:34,320
And then they say, is it this Disney song?

1729
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,640
And it's like a whole new world.

1730
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:39,600
Oh, gosh, what is it? It's like a whole new world.

1731
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,400
What even would be applicable in this?

1732
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,360
Yeah, it's like it's like it's a whole new world.

1733
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:47,400
Like, it's good.

1734
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:48,960
There's one that's like it's fine.

1735
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:53,440
And it's a small world is the one that's like, oh, yeah.

1736
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,280
Do you get it? Yeah.

1737
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,480
Do you get it? Yeah, no.

1738
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:00,200
That is the kill. That is the kill every night.

1739
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:03,640
Yeah, it does every night.

1740
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:07,200
And then about the morning show, the one thing that's very jarring

1741
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:12,040
is the morning in which she is in the spa, because it is not immediately

1742
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:14,240
recognizable as the spa.

1743
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:17,560
So it kind of just looks like she's coming to you from her stateroom in a robe.

1744
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,200
Yes, I did notice this.

1745
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:22,040
It looks just like, yeah, she's in her bedroom. Yeah. Yeah.

1746
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:26,120
The way it's framed is a very small looking space with just a mirror.

1747
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:28,680
And there's nothing that would you would just look at it and go,

1748
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:32,360
oh, it looks like they have shitty twin beds in all the cabins. Yeah.

1749
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,040
So this is how it begins.

1750
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:38,080
And then a couple of Russian women appear on screen

1751
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:41,120
and talk about freezing your fat and analyzing your skin.

1752
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:47,720
And the best part, the ship is rocking while that's happening.

1753
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:49,760
We saw we caught this when we were watching it.

1754
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,680
You can see the like curtains in the background start to wave.

1755
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:58,600
And like everyone kind of like trying to get their footing

1756
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:02,120
because they are clearly at sea. Weird.

1757
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:03,880
It's amazing.

1758
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:06,840
There are more problems inherent in the production of Good Morning

1759
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:11,320
Disney fantasy, just constant tripods tipping over and boom,

1760
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:13,520
like operators barfing.

1761
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:17,320
Well, there are in so many rooms that have echoes that are just it's like

1762
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:20,880
there's there's some rooms where it's just like there's like three echoes.

1763
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,880
Hello.

1764
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:26,520
You know what I was thinking, though, is that, yes, this is so unpolished

1765
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:30,160
and we're watching kind of this badly shot thing that's just in rooms

1766
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:32,440
and boring rooms where the sound is bad.

1767
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:35,000
But it's July 20, 20.

1768
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:37,280
This is what everything looks like.

1769
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:40,720
All TV is good morning Disney fantasy.

1770
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:45,880
Now I'm so used to blown out sound and tired looking people

1771
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:48,640
and shots not changing and no editing.

1772
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:53,280
This would the Disney Cruise Morning Show predicted the entire virus world.

1773
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,600
Yes, it really prepared a lot of people for it.

1774
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:00,000
It was a slow easing.

1775
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,200
Yeah, Natalie really with Natalie, the cruise director

1776
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:07,040
could have given some tips to your Seth Meyers is and your James

1777
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:10,600
Corden's about how to keep things engaging in an unmoving,

1778
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:14,360
badly composed shot for 15 minutes with the headroom.

1779
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:17,120
I think Colbert to just watch this

1780
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,440
when he was learning how to use a camera a few weeks ago.

1781
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:24,160
He's like, oh, well, every shot needs about half the screen of headroom.

1782
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:28,560
That's very true. And if everybody's been zoomed, I always like.

1783
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:32,400
Meanwhile, he's he's he's far he's way, way, way in the corner.

1784
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,960
I guess nobody's going to see that visual gag that I just know.

1785
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:38,120
You see, you know, you see you had about like 60 percent up at the top.

1786
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:40,360
It's like you were hiding from your own shot.

1787
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:41,120
That's the whole thing.

1788
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:43,600
There's people who never figure out Zoom headroom.

1789
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:46,240
I guess those people are called parents.

1790
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:50,360
I also this we were probably, you know, in the last section of this episode.

1791
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:53,520
But Jon Stewart just did a round of press for this movie he released.

1792
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,560
They didn't send him a USB mic.

1793
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:01,040
Yeah, like I keep clicking on interviews and it's the same as just this computer

1794
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:04,280
audio and you'd think like to do like a press on major shows.

1795
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:06,360
They would have sent him an 80 dollar mic.

1796
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:10,360
If you're going to be on every television show, yes, perhaps

1797
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:12,360
you should think about a microphone.

1798
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:15,400
It's crazy. Amazon Prime him a mic, for God's sake.

1799
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:17,960
And he was I think he was too close to the camera.

1800
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:21,320
I think he we're all learning zoom camera etiquette.

1801
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:21,960
I don't think no.

1802
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:25,000
I think no one knows where to be, like what plays.

1803
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,640
I don't know how to make jokes land anymore.

1804
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:29,720
It's all we're all trapped in this box.

1805
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:30,400
It's crazy.

1806
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,520
This is something I know for sure.

1807
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:35,480
That's a movie I will be able to resist.

1808
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:40,320
Applause from me.

1809
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:46,000
I was learning to work remotely with like, you know, pitching ideas to people.

1810
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:50,520
Yeah. And you learn very quickly that your social cues about like

1811
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:55,280
when someone wants you to stop talking is not immediate over Zoom.

1812
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:59,320
So, you know, I'd be like, and here's the idea and here's who I am and a lot of

1813
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:00,560
a lot and I love this.

1814
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:03,520
And then after a while, I'm like, oh, wait, by now I would have checked

1815
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,160
to see if they were zoning out.

1816
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:07,080
They've been zoning out for a while.

1817
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:08,440
So, yes. Yeah.

1818
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,440
Everybody looks very small.

1819
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:14,760
None of it. None of it makes any sense.

1820
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:18,920
I don't I was thinking how I've felt for months and months, honestly,

1821
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:22,360
like I'm trapped in a cabin on a Disney cruise with like

1822
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:27,280
mild entertainment offerings being put in front of me tonight.

1823
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:32,440
The cast of Ghostbusters will be reuniting with your host, Joshi Gad.

1824
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:36,720
Join us on Deck 7.

1825
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:39,320
Don't get coronavirus.

1826
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:41,960
Did anyone encounter the digital portholes?

1827
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,160
Kevin, did you have this in your room?

1828
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:46,720
OK, so this is interesting.

1829
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:47,840
Yeah. As with everything.

1830
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:51,200
So digital portholes, for those that don't know, are TV screens

1831
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:54,280
shaped in a circle that give the illusion that an interior room

1832
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:57,880
with no windows or a deck is has a window to the outside.

1833
01:30:57,880 --> 01:30:59,600
And Disney characters come through.

1834
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:02,680
It was their way of adding a bit of magic and a bit of actual, like,

1835
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:06,720
you know, life to the staterooms that are on the interior of the ship.

1836
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,520
It had a adverse effect.

1837
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:11,760
And those rooms are often more expensive and more heavily booked

1838
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,880
because of the porthole room, because of that porthole.

1839
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:17,040
Kids are like, I want the magic porthole.

1840
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:21,000
And so it's this weird reverse effect where in order to compensate

1841
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,920
for the problem, they actually overcompensated.

1842
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,400
And now those rooms are in demand.

1843
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:29,960
Wow. So have you experienced have you seen it?

1844
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,400
No, I haven't experienced it up front.

1845
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:36,040
Up close, I would like I like to see the real world when I

1846
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:40,040
and not and not like Stitch going by on his little rocket ship.

1847
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:43,400
Well, you're not going to like this Star Wars hotel

1848
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:46,440
then that they're building in Florida.

1849
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:49,760
But that's another I don't want to get us off.

1850
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:53,960
I'm only going to be I'm now realizing I'm only going to be on board with it

1851
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:58,920
if there is a British lady telling you what you can do on the ship every day.

1852
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:00,640
What's it called?

1853
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,360
What's the what's the ship called?

1854
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:03,880
The Galactic Star Cruiser.

1855
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:06,280
Good morning, Galactic Star Cruiser.

1856
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:12,280
There will be lightsaber training and some comedy magic provided by

1857
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:15,760
Dave Willis.

1858
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:18,480
I think there's a cantina for tweens.

1859
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:21,080
The Star Wars.

1860
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:24,760
The Sabre.

1861
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:28,720
A wretched hive of scum and tween villainy.

1862
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:34,600
The Star Wars series does have a fine history of British character actors,

1863
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:37,880
so they're going to have to like shoot footage with them and go like,

1864
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:39,320
no, you got to be stiffer.

1865
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:40,400
You got to be stiffer.

1866
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:41,960
Like we want this to be real.

1867
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:43,960
So it's like a real cruise ship.

1868
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:46,200
So this should be Fesmer.

1869
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:47,520
That's the British one.

1870
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,400
Yes.

1871
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,080
Oh, yeah.

1872
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,800
Cruise director Fesmer.

1873
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,000
I'm good now.

1874
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,120
Just a jolly host.

1875
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:58,080
Well, that's the interesting thing of the Galactic Star Cruiser

1876
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:02,080
is it is a cruise ship in the world of Star Wars.

1877
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:06,240
And Batuu is like one of your ports of call.

1878
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:07,480
Right, right.

1879
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:09,840
Which is odd, but it makes sense.

1880
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:13,120
But my most interesting thing about the Galactic Star Cruiser and Batuu

1881
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:18,040
is Batuu is already like this weird like cruise port,

1882
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:19,880
because every time if you've ever been on a cruise, you know,

1883
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:23,120
when you land on that port, the entire economy that surrounds

1884
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:26,200
the dock of the cruise is based off of you.

1885
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:30,320
You are made to go buy this, get in this van, you know, buy this,

1886
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:31,800
buy this merchandise.

1887
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,000
And Batuu is like that.

1888
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,320
It's like you like what are these cruise guests like that are coming to Batuu?

1889
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:40,120
They like Luke Skywalker and Sleight Sabers and we'll make them build a fake one.

1890
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:42,160
And it just it comes in my head.

1891
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:45,280
Cannon, everything you do in Batuu is not canon.

1892
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:48,960
It is just put on by the people of Batuu to make you feel like you're getting

1893
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:51,200
an authentic Star Wars experience.

1894
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:55,160
Interesting. Oh, you mean like so they don't even eat Bronto wraps there.

1895
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:56,800
That's just like touristy food.

1896
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,240
Yeah, they eat it up.

1897
01:33:58,240 --> 01:33:59,520
Those lightsabers aren't real.

1898
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,640
They're toys, but you just tell the kids they're real.

1899
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:06,040
Like that's why Rey looks so different is because it's just some actress

1900
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:08,360
on the planet. They're pandering.

1901
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:10,720
They're pandering to idiot tourists.

1902
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:11,920
Yeah, that's what Batuu is.

1903
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:17,160
Yeah. Oh, Batuu is a crappy port town where you buy a T-shirt and there's like

1904
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:21,680
there's weird like class structure that's kind of unsettling.

1905
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:24,920
And oh, man, I'm not going to be able to look at it.

1906
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:26,480
The same way when we go.

1907
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:29,360
Literally everything like you even the rides are like,

1908
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,600
oh, they want to ride the Millennium Falcon.

1909
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:35,240
Yeah, there was that time that they wanted to do a shitty music festival

1910
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:38,800
on Batuu and then it fell apart because the guy was a scam.

1911
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,080
Well, it was Hondo Anaka.

1912
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:42,040
Hondo Anaka tried to start a festival.

1913
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:45,840
But Max Rebo dropped out.

1914
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:49,080
It wasn't. He was never really on board.

1915
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:51,400
Yeah, they never. Yeah, they never actually.

1916
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:54,840
The Star Wars influencers scammed everybody.

1917
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:58,440
All as I know is, if I'm paying that much for that galactic star

1918
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:02,800
cruiser, I better get some death sticks like they're better via death stick area

1919
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:06,640
where I can just like light up like Obi Wan.

1920
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:08,120
That's what I want.

1921
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:12,320
Death sticks is the very on the nose name of cigarettes and the prequels.

1922
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:13,320
Correct. Yes.

1923
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:17,960
Yeah. In Dexter Jeksters, is he lighten up inside Dexter Jeksters?

1924
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:21,000
In the diner? No, no, they're in the they're in the club at the start of

1925
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:23,040
the clones. Yeah, OK.

1926
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,280
Isn't that like club?

1927
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:26,600
No, Indiana Jones.

1928
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:28,600
Obi Wan is in Temple of Doom.

1929
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:30,960
You know exactly where I know where you're going with it.

1930
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:33,920
I just want I honestly, I just watch the scene like two weeks ago

1931
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:36,840
and attack of the clones.

1932
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:39,480
They're they're trying to find Zam Wessel, I believe.

1933
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:42,000
Obi Wan and Anakin. Yes.

1934
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,200
But I can't think of the name of the club.

1935
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:49,600
Oh, well, vibe in the tube, in the in the space tube.

1936
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:55,280
The cruises are an entirely different world of fun,

1937
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:57,440
like the Star Wars stuff they do on there.

1938
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:01,000
It's just everything is backwards from Walt Disney World. Everything.

1939
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:03,240
It's every Walt Disney World.

1940
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:06,800
Nobody goes to the live shows at the cruise line.

1941
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,880
Everyone does. At Walt Disney World, it is all designed.

1942
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:13,840
So you are in the center of an experience and all the the warehouses

1943
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:17,800
and the facades are facing inward and on the cruise are facing outward,

1944
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,240
which changes the flow of traffic.

1945
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,880
Because everywhere you're going, the interior of the ship

1946
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:26,080
is the guts of the organization versus when you're at the theme parks.

1947
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:27,560
Those are on the outside.

1948
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:29,600
So the way it's designed is backwards. It's just.

1949
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:32,200
It's weird. Interesting.

1950
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:33,400
It's like a whole paradigm.

1951
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:36,920
It's like a completely inverted way to do themed entertainment.

1952
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:40,000
And what is your opinion of Castaway Key?

1953
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:44,160
I love Castaway Key.

1954
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:45,680
Is that what they don't have Walt's playing there?

1955
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:46,360
No, they have some.

1956
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:51,200
So what Castaway Key is a really fun, fun place.

1957
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:55,120
There's not a ton to do, but it is nice to have beaches to yourself.

1958
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:57,920
Serenity Bay, which is the adult beach, which they like design.

1959
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:00,960
So it's like a walk in pool so you can just keep walking.

1960
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:04,760
And so you'll see adults like it takes probably like, you know,

1961
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:07,680
100 yards before it even gets up to your to your thighs.

1962
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:10,680
So you'll just see people way on the distance with standing up.

1963
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:13,720
And that's when they have barbecue, which is terrible.

1964
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:16,200
But I'm from KC, so all barbecues terrible.

1965
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:18,200
But that's not there.

1966
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:20,000
But yeah, so it's it's fun.

1967
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,720
And yeah, it's it's very bare bones, though.

1968
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:26,360
I'm hoping with this new island, they do something to give a little bit more.

1969
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:30,720
Because if you're not into generic sports type activities,

1970
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:33,240
like if you're into snorkeling, congratulations, you're going to go

1971
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:36,280
see the 20,000 League sub that they sunk in the back.

1972
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,680
And you can see Mickey Underwater.

1973
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:43,720
If you are into bicycling, bicycling, there's the Castaway Key 5K,

1974
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:46,080
which always happens on the last day of the cruise.

1975
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:47,760
So that's awesome.

1976
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:53,080
But I believe I read, unfortunately, Castaway Key is prone to being

1977
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:56,680
in the path of tropical storms and hurricanes and that

1978
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:01,920
20,000 Leagues sub may have been washed out to see one of them.

1979
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:02,880
So there was one of them.

1980
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,280
And we lost one of them.

1981
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:06,720
OK, there's still one still there.

1982
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:08,640
One of them is gone.

1983
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:12,200
It was lost a video of like a couple who went and they're like,

1984
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,960
well, this was the island the last time we were here.

1985
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:19,240
And we just missed a storm by a week and all of the beaches were covered in like

1986
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:23,640
red tide, seaweed, dirt, like stuff.

1987
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:26,400
So it is susceptible to Mother Nature.

1988
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:30,000
Yeah, it is. And it also it doesn't dock a lot of times.

1989
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,880
I've likely never had a day where it doesn't dock, but they're very set.

1990
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:35,360
They are very open saying because of the way

1991
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:38,880
because it's only so deep.

1992
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:41,560
If the waters are too choppy, we can't dock and the very end.

1993
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:44,120
So they have a they have a backup day of activities.

1994
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:47,080
If that happens, I've never that's never been triggered for me.

1995
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,480
Like it's never like, oh, here's my backup day.

1996
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:51,720
So that's never happened. But yeah, that's the case.

1997
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:54,280
But, you know, they're doing what is the new one called Lighthouse Point?

1998
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:55,800
They announced a D23.

1999
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:57,920
Is that the Joe Rowdy Island?

2000
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:00,640
Yes. And I've never been so.

2001
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:06,080
I don't want to upset people intrigued by a project

2002
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:11,480
because they were when they said a populated island,

2003
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:14,440
I was like, what?

2004
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:17,120
Wait, wait, what do you mean populated?

2005
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:19,240
Like there are people that live there.

2006
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:20,360
They they bought it.

2007
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:22,520
And they're then the people aren't leaving.

2008
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:27,040
They were they don't they didn't really give me the logistics of what's happening.

2009
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:29,680
But, you know, with with Castaway Key, it was an old pirate island

2010
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:33,760
that I'm assuming was then, you know, bought by some real estate developer.

2011
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,680
It was super wealthy and it was eventually given to Disney.

2012
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:36,440
It's very small.

2013
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:39,640
Nobody maybe a few people live there over the course of its history.

2014
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:43,840
You know, it's point I'm pretty sure is a populated island.

2015
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:46,680
That's very strange.

2016
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:48,400
Guess who bought your island?

2017
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:53,520
So this might be like the apcot dream come true.

2018
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:58,360
Yeah. Of an actual Disney owned island city.

2019
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:01,400
Yeah. Strange.

2020
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:03,800
I mean, should we move there, though?

2021
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:06,520
Maybe.

2022
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:07,800
I need to look this up.

2023
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:09,880
Perhaps I am.

2024
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:14,560
You know, I just I just googled this and let me just give you a little bit of warning.

2025
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:16,880
If you Google roadie island,

2026
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:23,400
Google is very confused because it is exactly a seems like a misspelling of Rhode Island.

2027
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:25,080
Oh, yeah.

2028
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:27,960
Did you mean Rhode Island?

2029
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:30,360
No, amazingly, I did not.

2030
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:33,200
Well, what the heck, Agluthora.

2031
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:37,760
Weird. Maybe it's just maybe like maybe it's similar to Castaway Key.

2032
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:41,440
Where there's a it's a smaller part of a bigger place.

2033
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:42,760
Does that make sense?

2034
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:45,880
So like Castaway Key, I think Castaway Key has another island where the cast

2035
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:49,760
members live and then they commute via boat every day to the island

2036
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:51,880
to get it ready for the cruise as they come.

2037
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:55,120
So maybe they bought an island off of a larger island.

2038
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:59,800
Hmm. What if, though, this has me thinking that what if the island

2039
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:04,240
that they bought is like full of these these kind people who live off the land

2040
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:06,600
and they work together and there's a lot of community?

2041
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:12,320
And then roadie, the maker of the Avatar ride, comes in to destroy the island,

2042
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:15,920
blow up the town square, like, get them off.

2043
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:16,920
I want them gone.

2044
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:20,480
And roadies marching around in a big robot suit firing bombs.

2045
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,680
Wow. Way to practice what you preach.

2046
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:30,760
Yeah. OK, I just I looked it up.

2047
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:35,560
They're buying a parcel of land on the Bahamian island of Aluthora,

2048
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:36,720
if I'm pronouncing that correctly.

2049
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:40,400
So they didn't buy the entire island just not yet.

2050
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:46,320
OK. But so then they're going to need some person to go into the body

2051
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:51,280
of an Aluthrin to stop meksut roadie from. Right.

2052
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,920
There's a there's 11000 people that live on this island.

2053
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:58,560
Wow. Really? Wow. Yeah. Wow.

2054
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:02,520
Which is which is too small to do this.

2055
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,960
You know, if it was bigger, if it was like this,

2056
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:08,040
they're buying a small beach on an island of 10 million people.

2057
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:08,600
You'd be like, whatever.

2058
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:12,200
But that's too small of a population to not be

2059
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:14,800
drastically affected by whatever Disney does.

2060
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:19,400
I've been told Ja Rule is consulting, so I'm assuming it's legitimate.

2061
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,960
Let's be legends.

2062
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:26,400
We're going to. I don't want to bring that up.

2063
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:27,400
That's roadie.

2064
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:34,800
Oh, no, Joe, don't get caught up in Ja Rule's magnetic personality.

2065
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:39,720
Joe and Ja are toasting champagne, riding pigs around.

2066
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:43,160
Yeah. Oh, my gosh.

2067
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:46,400
I was going to say I want to I want them to rebuild Fordlandia.

2068
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:48,800
Was that have you ever heard of that?

2069
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:53,960
No, Landia, the islands that Henry Ford like made people

2070
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:55,920
build cars or whatever or some.

2071
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:59,560
He built like a factory island where only men were allowed and all like women

2072
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:02,480
were banished and men row to another.

2073
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:04,720
Anyways, it was in Brazil.

2074
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:07,320
Oh, dear God, Fordlandia.

2075
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:09,920
Yeah, Fordlandia is like not a theme park, but it sounds like it.

2076
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:13,560
That's when I'm just ready to lose subscribers because I really want to tell

2077
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:15,680
tell this story.

2078
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:18,080
Well, as long as you're not pro Fordlandia,

2079
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:23,520
as I scan through and see phrases like anti-semitism and well.

2080
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:27,160
Well, I mean, people, people, you know, in my most recent episodes, I've been very

2081
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:30,320
they've been more dense and people have been like, get back to doing.

2082
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:31,960
Oh, the tea.

2083
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:34,960
Oh, they want to share the to give you.

2084
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:37,480
I thought the Coney Island episode was fascinating.

2085
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:40,320
I didn't know that whole epic story.

2086
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:46,160
Yeah. The elephant brothels and and anti-semit

2087
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:48,800
semitic beaches and yeah, yeah.

2088
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:53,560
Oh, no. So now, so well, here's another lengthy anti-semitism related topic.

2089
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:56,480
Well, yeah, it is not a theme park thing.

2090
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:59,760
But as we know here on the second gate, doing things that aren't theme park

2091
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:01,960
things can be very satisfying.

2092
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,440
And we land when if it's very long, we love it.

2093
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:07,160
Everybody loves it.

2094
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:11,200
Before this goes crazy longer, we should maybe begin the debarkation presentation.

2095
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:14,680
I have one quick I have one quick thing to point out from the video.

2096
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:19,240
I in the in the where she's sitting in what I assume is what you would call,

2097
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:20,400
I don't know, the cockpit.

2098
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:22,840
What would you say the control room for the boat?

2099
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:27,920
It looks like the technology on the 1960s Star Trek.

2100
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:33,680
Isn't it not look like control, like control panel with but like, you know,

2101
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:35,520
it looks simple, like very like 60s.

2102
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:37,600
Hi, sure. Like 60s high tech.

2103
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:42,120
Like I don't I feel like like cockpits of planes look more sophisticated.

2104
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:45,560
This is sort of just like big buttons and like a couple of levers.

2105
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:46,920
I was very interested.

2106
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:50,840
Well, the boat, like all Disney rides, is operated by teens. Right.

2107
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:54,040
It's got a four program up there.

2108
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:55,000
So it's got to be simple.

2109
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,640
Like when you see people, when you're on a ride

2110
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:58,960
and you see like they open the thing and they hit that button,

2111
01:44:58,960 --> 01:44:59,880
you don't know what it is.

2112
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:02,160
I assume it's just a go button.

2113
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:05,160
I imagine a lot of these are just dummy buttons like on

2114
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:07,280
Smugglers Run.

2115
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:09,120
Yeah, a lot of them are.

2116
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,720
They don't even push in. Right.

2117
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:12,720
There's they're just blink.

2118
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:16,800
Are there are there only six positions in that room that you can go on?

2119
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,080
Yes, yes. There's two.

2120
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:24,040
You know, engineers, two gunners that shoot the guns off the side of the boat.

2121
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:27,520
Yes, which two pilots.

2122
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:29,960
Firework night when there's lurkers in the in the distance.

2123
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:31,960
So they don't steal your fireworks for you.

2124
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:34,440
It's just fireworks. Don't worry, folks.

2125
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:38,120
We aren't using those guns to clear out that Rhode Island.

2126
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:43,960
That's that was the thing they said.

2127
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:47,440
Disney Cruise Line is the only one that shoots off fireworks at sea.

2128
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:49,640
That's why they're all like, you know,

2129
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:53,200
swimming around, you know, the other ships.

2130
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:56,760
It's pretty amazing. Yeah, yeah.

2131
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:59,280
Well, I want pilot next time. That's all I know.

2132
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:02,640
OK, I've been I've been engineer plenty of times.

2133
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:05,040
I don't want Gunner. It sucks.

2134
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:08,360
Barely. Closing thoughts.

2135
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:09,600
So last last minute things.

2136
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:12,960
This is this is fun to have a big free range conversation

2137
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:16,560
that's sort of stemming from a video you watch in your hotel room on a ship.

2138
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:18,680
But do we like that?

2139
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:20,440
Do we like the low rent nature of it?

2140
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:24,400
We always talk about how we want the specials to be more low rent.

2141
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:27,320
We want mistakes to happen. Why are they so overedited?

2142
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:30,040
And I'm very charmed by that.

2143
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:34,160
This is this is its own unique little, you know, sort of crapily done thing.

2144
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,160
Yeah, it's fun when you get to see because we've we've we've

2145
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:39,480
yeah, we've been talking about this where it's like the old stuff

2146
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:42,320
and old sitcoms where they don't like maybe what was it?

2147
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:45,240
What was the sitcom where they were saying they would spit off the skyway

2148
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:48,920
or throw ice cubes, throw ice, blossom, blossom,

2149
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:51,200
would slip by that they throw ice cubes off the skyway.

2150
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:52,920
And that would never fly in a shape.

2151
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:55,240
Iger world where you'd give people bad ideas.

2152
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:59,480
Yeah, it is. It's nice and charming that this is produced in house.

2153
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:03,000
And I mean, let's have more.

2154
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,480
Let's have more of it.

2155
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:07,520
Let's have this production value for some sort of ABC special

2156
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:10,280
promoting the Galactic Star Cruiser.

2157
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:15,600
Yeah, just some just some lady, which which with the current

2158
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:19,280
production possible that it's might be what it has to be.

2159
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:20,480
Yeah, that's true.

2160
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:23,840
So what's your name again?

2161
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,720
Cruise director Natalie, get ready.

2162
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:29,200
You're going to you're the face of Galactic Star Cruiser.

2163
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:32,720
Yeah, I love I mean, it does make it really fun.

2164
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:35,080
And there's been other I've seen another version of this

2165
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:37,320
where there's this really great joke that I forgot to mention earlier

2166
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:40,760
that like they poke fun at themselves more on the cruise ships,

2167
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:43,920
like they're like their quality control really can't reach international waters.

2168
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:47,200
Like there's one video it was on one of the days like Will,

2169
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:50,600
like, you know, we're we are Disney, but we can't control the weather yet.

2170
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:52,800
Oh, sure. Oh, yeah.

2171
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,200
Oh, yeah. So like that.

2172
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:55,680
Yeah. So that's the way.

2173
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:58,040
So we can't control the weather, but we're working on it.

2174
01:47:58,040 --> 01:48:01,040
And it was like, ah, and so, yeah, but like the it's like

2175
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:06,000
it's very home like you feel you feel like, you know, they produced it

2176
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:08,640
this morning. Right.

2177
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:10,720
And that's that personal touch that you're talking about.

2178
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:14,240
You have the waiter who takes you, you follow around from day to day.

2179
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:17,720
And you might see the host of this thing walking around the ship.

2180
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:19,880
It's all very personal.

2181
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:22,480
Yeah. You know, you know, they're making these videos fresh.

2182
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:25,160
They're baking them up fresh for you.

2183
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:29,280
And it is it is like, like I said, the last bastion of the Disney difference

2184
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:33,800
of just like it really they really do go the extra mile compared to other cruise

2185
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:36,320
lines because they really do have to compete with other cruise lines.

2186
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:37,760
It's not just enough to be the kid cruise.

2187
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:40,840
They do a really good job and they're really highly rated

2188
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:43,440
across the board as far as cruise lines go.

2189
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:47,360
But yeah, they do a great a great, great job.

2190
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:49,520
I like them a lot. Yeah.

2191
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:51,440
It's a very positive sentiment for me.

2192
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:55,360
Usually I remember our last podcast, it started with Mike

2193
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:59,200
reading to me a quote from Michael Eisner

2194
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:02,320
that I were like a quote that I said about Michael Eisner. Ah.

2195
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:06,440
And it was like it was like a breaking my knees before the

2196
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:07,720
the game.

2197
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:10,320
I was like, we had to defend our hero.

2198
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:12,120
Sure. Yeah.

2199
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:14,600
I've been stewing for a while, but now we've met.

2200
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:16,360
We're friends. We're getting more positive.

2201
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:18,760
We had fun thinking about a cruise for a little while.

2202
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:22,600
Kevin Perjury, you survived podcast, The Ride, the second gate.

2203
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:24,840
And thank you for this topic.

2204
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:26,560
This is a lot of fun.

2205
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:29,880
Let's exit through the let's disembark through the gift shop.

2206
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:33,080
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

2207
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:35,200
I make a show called Defunctland.

2208
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:36,840
Also, I you could go.

2209
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:39,040
I really should plug this themed alternative.

2210
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:40,440
You can look it up on YouTube.

2211
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:43,600
Themed alternative is a like avant garde

2212
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:47,480
random series, experimental theme park based series.

2213
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:51,760
We do. We watch old Disney specials and do commentary on them.

2214
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:54,280
We have a an audio drama type thing.

2215
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:58,600
So, yeah, it's a bunch of experimental theme park comedy adventure content.

2216
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:01,000
Oh, cool. I was not aware of that before.

2217
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:01,680
That's yeah. Yeah.

2218
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:03,880
I'll check that our listeners should too.

2219
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:06,320
And hey, what's up with this

2220
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:10,680
Halyx movie or you're producing a documentary that we appear in

2221
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:12,920
and that we we seemingly helped inspire?

2222
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:15,400
What's this? What's the status of it?

2223
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:18,680
Is this on the air? Yeah.

2224
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:20,440
Yeah. OK. OK.

2225
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:23,280
Oh, it's a reveal secrets because it doesn't matter

2226
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:24,880
because I would have said the same thing regardless.

2227
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:26,320
OK. No, no, no. I'm just kidding.

2228
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:29,080
But it's a it's going well right now.

2229
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:32,080
We are trying to fit the good boys into the week

2230
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:34,720
because there's so much of you watching in the interview

2231
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:37,760
that was done before quarantine many months ago.

2232
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:40,920
There's so much of you watching like almost a commentary track

2233
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:42,560
of the footage we found.

2234
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:43,920
So we're trying to fit that in.

2235
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:45,840
Well, you might be revealing that that with.

2236
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:49,720
Yeah, there's you know, we for listeners who don't recall or haven't heard it.

2237
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:53,920
There was this 80s space band at Disneyland called Halyx.

2238
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:56,920
We sort of discovered it and talked about it on the show.

2239
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:59,200
And now there's this whole documentary coming from Matt Serrano,

2240
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:01,440
this director, and you're producing it.

2241
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:04,640
And we were interviewed and they and Matt surprised us with.

2242
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:09,080
We found all the footage of a full concert by this Tomorrowland

2243
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:11,680
space band from 1981.

2244
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:13,280
And it's really well done.

2245
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:16,160
And I'm really happy with the documentary.

2246
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:20,280
I think it documentary filmmaking is always a crapshoot,

2247
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:22,680
for lack of a better word, as far as like, is there anything there?

2248
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:23,600
And there was a lot there.

2249
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:27,680
And we got almost all of the band members on camera.

2250
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:30,680
That's kind of a that's kind of a reveal, I guess.

2251
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:33,480
But they they're there and they're talking about it.

2252
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:38,720
And we also got like major people that were involved, execs at Disney, Mike Post,

2253
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:43,000
who every theme song you've ever heard in your life.

2254
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:45,200
I always forget what all of them are.

2255
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:48,000
But the one that always rings in my head is greatest American hero.

2256
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,360
Believe it or not.

2257
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:54,160
You talk to this guy, you worked on those songs and you for Disney a long time ago.

2258
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:56,440
And you interviewed him for this for this doc.

2259
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:58,200
Yeah. So it's a really fun doc.

2260
01:51:58,200 --> 01:52:02,360
As far as what I'm assuming your question was, was not casual as in when was it coming out?

2261
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,560
Oh, no, I'm just curious.

2262
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:07,080
I would just say I would be having fun editing and stuff.

2263
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:12,120
Yeah, it should be out in late July at latest early August.

2264
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:14,000
We were going to do festivals.

2265
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,040
We were going to do this.

2266
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:17,560
You were going to do a little theater tour, maybe.

2267
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:20,120
And then the world ended.

2268
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:24,480
And our dreams of making millions off of a documentary

2269
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:30,040
heavily tailored to one of the strongest copyright holders in the history of the world was diminished.

2270
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:32,440
So we're going to be millionaires.

2271
01:52:32,440 --> 01:52:35,200
Damn it. We're going to be millionaires if it wasn't for this one thing.

2272
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:38,960
You'd be as rich as if you had bet successfully on a diaper dash.

2273
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:43,360
So it'll be on YouTube.

2274
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:45,320
That's that's very exciting.

2275
01:52:45,320 --> 01:52:46,320
I you know what?

2276
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:52,320
And that knowing that we all are in this movie, I feel like the twins in zombified.

2277
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:54,080
This is going to be a big debut.

2278
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:55,840
And we're in the movie.

2279
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:59,360
Depending on where you're placed, you might feel exactly like the twins.

2280
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:02,560
Oh, no. All right.

2281
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:04,640
Oh, man.

2282
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:06,200
It might just be like, where are we?

2283
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:09,440
And then the hey, that's I know how it goes.

2284
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:13,320
Yeah, we're we're working our our darnedest to to fit in.

2285
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:15,680
So you're going to you're going to be in it.

2286
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:20,480
But I don't be surprised if it's like the credits move over and it's 10 minutes

2287
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:24,560
of you watching footage from statler and Waldorfing

2288
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:27,280
footage that appears to find.

2289
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:30,680
Well, if you recall, that's the majority of your interview.

2290
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:32,240
Yeah, pretty.

2291
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:35,440
The audience is going to be audience can be really upset because they're going to go,

2292
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:38,040
you know, we don't want to hear from the people in the band or the people

2293
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:41,360
who wrote the songs. We want to hear from those guys on that podcast.

2294
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:44,520
So I think they're going to unless you put us in a significant part,

2295
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:46,120
I think people are going to be very upset.

2296
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:48,640
Well, then I'll try to I'll try to work you closer to the climax.

2297
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:50,920
OK, thank you. Yes.

2298
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:57,280
Yes. It's a bit what bigger payoff could there be than us in a room of Funko Pops?

2299
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,760
We thought it was cool. We like the band.

2300
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:04,440
It looks good. They look the best part of any documentary about some

2301
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:08,200
culty thing is when the three dweeb show up and then I like it.

2302
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:11,360
Well, I'm glad you understand that.

2303
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:15,320
We want to make everyone look good.

2304
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,280
There is a it's a really

2305
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:21,080
take the rug out from it to be like, and we found it.

2306
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:23,960
Unless we put you at the very, very top.

2307
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:24,680
No way.

2308
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:28,160
Unfortunately, you you cannot control an audience going like,

2309
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:30,440
oh, that's how podcasters move.

2310
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:33,440
Yeah.

2311
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:38,360
So all of America said about the HBO pod, same America show.

2312
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:41,880
Anyway, moving on, wrapping up the show, disembarking.

2313
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:44,480
Kevin, thanks for being here.

2314
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:45,640
This is a blast.

2315
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:46,840
Come back any time.

2316
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:49,080
This you've set the bar high with bizarre topics.

2317
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:51,600
Tarzan rocks Disney Cruise morning show.

2318
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:54,080
I feel like now. Oh, I haven't even began.

2319
01:54:56,200 --> 01:55:00,680
Fordlandia, perhaps, if you don't feel like editing the documentary about it,

2320
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:04,560
whatever. Yeah. Come back any time.

2321
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:07,920
I feel like I should give you my next like the next topic in two years

2322
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:11,600
that I'll come on with if you have anything planned it, please.

2323
01:55:12,600 --> 01:55:15,040
I the the the cones.

2324
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:17,080
Do you remember those cones that used to have it up?

2325
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:19,400
Got the cones.

2326
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:21,960
Wait, maybe I don't like it was like a sandwich cone.

2327
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:25,840
It was like an ice cream cone, but it was like meatball marinara.

2328
01:55:26,640 --> 01:55:27,800
Well, did it have some name?

2329
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:31,320
I feel like I've read recently about some something that I've read about.

2330
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:33,280
Yeah. But yeah, what was the name of this?

2331
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:34,320
I know what you're exactly talking about.

2332
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:35,840
We've stumbled across the park.

2333
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:36,560
Before.

2334
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:40,160
Can we just do an episode of catch all that is all about all the cones?

2335
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:41,800
There's the cones at California Adventure.

2336
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:43,640
Cones. Yeah.

2337
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:48,800
Cones. A parking lot cones that create lanes for you to drive in.

2338
01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:51,360
Just cones. Exclamation point with Kevin.

2339
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:53,640
Oh, my gosh. This is going to drive me crazy.

2340
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:55,680
Not beaver tales.

2341
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:59,040
You're not talking about the Canadian delight beaver tales.

2342
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:03,520
And it's not a hand which it's a hand which.

2343
01:56:03,560 --> 01:56:05,120
Oh, that is it is a hand.

2344
01:56:05,120 --> 01:56:07,120
OK, that's what I just saw. Yes.

2345
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:11,800
Hmm. OK, we could do a hand which hand which is with Kevin Persger coming.

2346
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,720
Yeah. In a while.

2347
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:16,000
All right. In two years, boy.

2348
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,800
Yeah. Yeah. Looking forward to it.

2349
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:19,120
Everybody else, you know what to do.

2350
01:56:19,120 --> 01:56:22,880
Keep subscribing to the second gate as you already are.

2351
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:26,600
Be on the lookout for the Halyx documentary, which we play a giant, giant part in.

2352
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:31,600
And we're saying and well, we'll talk to you with some more bullshit soon.

2353
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:32,040
Bye, everybody.
