1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,200
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,840
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate.

3
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,860
My name is Michael Carlson and happy birthday to me, I want to say.

4
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:40,860
Very special day, very special birthday, I've decided, am I going to stop celebrating the number, much like a Leslie Mann character in a Judd Apatow movie, I'm not sure.

5
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,860
Which way, which movie?

6
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,860
I assume all of them is the same thing, right?

7
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,860
Uh huh, but are you referring to a specific movie, like with an age in the title?

8
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:58,860
Maybe I am, I don't want to say that one out loud, because I haven't decided how I'm going to address it, but Scott Garner is here.

9
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,860
Hi, hey, happy birthday to you.

10
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,860
Thank you very much, Jason Sharon here as well.

11
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,860
Hi.

12
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,860
How are you doing, Jason?

13
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,860
Oh, pretty good, how about you, big birthday boy?

14
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,860
Fine, fine.

15
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:21,860
I will admit, when we're talking about my birthday, I will admit that I was like always when I would see movie and TV where people would be like complaining about their birthday or like, oh, I'm getting so old or whatever, I was like, this is silly, this is ridiculous.

16
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:27,860
And I feel like worse, I feel the same way as all these people in like movies and TV historically.

17
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,860
Right, right.

18
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,860
Well, I mean, I mean, is it like, what is it about this one?

19
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,860
Is this a birthday that's like, I don't know, particularly notable?

20
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:45,860
Is it a birthday that, I don't know, changes more of the initial tagline and premise of the show?

21
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,860
Scott, you're trying to get me to say it and I don't want to say it.

22
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,860
I'm just asking questions.

23
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,860
That's all.

24
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,860
That's what this podcast is about, it's just asking questions.

25
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,860
So I understand and I appreciate what you're doing.

26
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,860
You're, Lindsay's brushing her teeth and you're sitting on the toilet with the iPad, like a poster.

27
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,860
Right, and she's like, why are you always hiding?

28
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,860
Some sort of poster, I don't know.

29
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,860
Well, you know what?

31
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,860
Maybe the end of this podcast, I'll reveal the number in case we haven't said it.

32
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,860
I think we have said it.

33
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,860
I mean, look, here's the thing.

34
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,860
If it's the number that I'm wondering about, I don't get what the problem would be.

35
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:25,860
Mike, everything that I know about you that I've experienced over years of doing this podcast leads me to believe that's a number you'll be fine to reach.

36
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,860
There's no, I can't imagine any complexes from you that would come from a certain...

37
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:40,860
I don't see you, I don't know, wearing your hats even more backwards to try to counter a certain number.

38
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,860
That backwards hat is not necessarily to make me look younger.

39
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,860
I will say that, but I have been doing that more, but that's more my...

40
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:53,860
I'm unhappy with my hair and not just the color of it, but that's more of that than it is me trying to appear younger.

41
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,860
You just need a full, maybe you need some makeover in general.

42
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:02,860
I've dressed like a child for a long time, so nothing has really changed as far as that's concerned.

43
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,860
But anyway...

44
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,860
And you know what else hasn't changed?

45
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:11,860
One day it hits midnight and it's another day, doesn't mean anything has to change.

46
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:22,860
It doesn't mean that your understanding of what teens like and the high probability of you being mistaken for a teen yourself, why would that happen just because it turned midnight one day?

47
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,860
Of course! It doesn't mean anything, Jason!

48
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,860
Jason!

49
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,860
Way in here!

50
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,860
Grabbing your wrist doesn't mean anything!

51
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,860
Al, you're hurting me!

52
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,860
Good! See, you agree with me.

53
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,860
So anyway, really, what this is not about me today, honestly. It's not about me.

54
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,860
It's about a thing I've chosen and it's about others.

55
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:56,860
Which is a surprise. This is for the first time, I think. I think previously we've announced what each other's birthday shots are going to be, but here is the second year of birthday shots. It is a true surprise to us.

56
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,860
And it's a true surprise mostly because I could not decide.

57
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,860
And I'll give you a quick look into what was happening.

58
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,860
Because even as of yesterday, I wasn't sure and I went through a lot of ideas.

59
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,860
There's things, and I'll give a couple examples of what I was thinking of.

60
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,860
First, I thought maybe we do an episode about Uncle Wiggly.

61
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,860
The Rabbit Gentleman.

62
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,860
Oh, yeah.

63
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,860
I don't know what you're talking about.

64
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,860
Well, there you go. So Uncle Wiggly was a game we had growing up, a little game.

65
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,860
And Uncle Wiggly is a rabbit gentleman.

66
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:31,860
And he was elderly. Specifically, they would say he was an elderly rabbit who suffered from rheumatism.

67
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,860
You need to know this to play the game?

68
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,860
You don't need to know what to play the game.

69
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,860
You don't need to know this. Uncle Wiggly goes back to newspapers when millions of people are reading.

70
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,860
Like 1900.

71
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,860
Yeah, it's early 1900s pop culture.

72
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,860
We took out Uncle Wiggly books from the library and then found them at a yard sale.

73
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,860
So it's one of these sorts of...

74
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,860
Did they steal them from the library?

75
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,860
Hopefully not.

76
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,860
I'm on to them. I'm on to these guys.

77
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,860
They're trying to turn a profit.

78
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,860
Well, maybe they fled town to do it.

79
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,860
Yeah, it's possible.

80
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,860
And Uncle Wiggly, there were many, many books, many things written.

81
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,860
So there's a lot of material there.

82
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,860
But I thought, I don't know, I'm not feeling Uncle Wiggly right now.

83
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,860
Certainly in the future, there will be more Uncle Wiggly content.

84
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,860
I thought, hey, maybe Zubili Zoo.

85
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,860
You know, I've talked about that before.

86
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,860
And I did a little look into that.

87
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,860
And that's, you know, that's interesting.

88
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,860
And again, something we should probably talk about one day.

89
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,860
And then I was like, I don't know, this feels like these episodes would be something we would probably do anyway.

90
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,860
And then I thought, well, what if I did something that would make people mad?

91
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,860
And I thought, what if we did?

92
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,860
What if I just rolled in here today and said, Indiana Jones 2 right now, let's go.

93
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,860
We're doing Indiana Jones the Ride 2.

94
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,860
Yes. Yeah. Oh, that'd be an interesting move.

95
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,860
And I think like, I was like, Jason, Jason would be like, I wanted to prepare for the like, everybody would be like, I want to listen to the first one.

96
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,860
I was going to say exactly that, yeah.

97
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,860
Yes. Like, so I go, that would make everybody mad.

98
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,860
And I go, do I really want to do that? Do I feel like that right now? At least no.

99
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,860
I said, that would be funny, though.

100
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,860
I thought maybe we do a Disneyland app episode just about the app and how using the app is like.

101
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,860
Oh God, oh God.

102
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,860
And I said, well, that's pretty indulgent.

103
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,860
But then like, Jason's probably on board with that too.

104
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,860
You know, he's interested in apps.

105
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,860
He likes to talk apps with me.

106
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,860
I mean, I'm not interested in holding my very hot phone.

107
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,860
That always occurs when I load up.

108
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,860
Is your phone very hot?

109
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,860
No, my phone is not, except when I run the Disney apps.

110
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,860
I know what you mean.

111
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,860
Because you're out there, maybe not, because maybe that Wi-Fi is not working.

112
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,860
And it's a complicated little animations.

113
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,860
You got to get through a freaking figure out what they'll time to do a thing.

114
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,860
Yeah. And also just having it out a lot means the sun is hitting it.

115
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,860
Yeah. So it's working hard.

116
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,860
It's heating up and then the sun is hitting it and it traps the heat as well.

117
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,860
So I see what you're saying.

118
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,860
Yeah. But I thought, I don't really want to.

119
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,860
I started I started trying to figure out, well, what do we talk about?

120
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,860
And I go, I don't know. This isn't this isn't that fun.

121
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,860
But maybe maybe there's an angle on in the future. Yeah.

122
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,860
So I just want to call shots for all four of those things in the future, I think.

123
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,860
But I didn't feel right.

124
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,860
And then I said, OK, well, what stuff we've talked about before that?

125
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,860
I'm like, I'm not sure where it slots in or if it's its own episode.

126
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,860
And I was like, you know what?

127
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,860
We always like touch on certain actors singing careers.

128
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:27,860
And I said, yeah, they're oh, yeah, there's a lot of stuff in this grab bag.

129
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,860
So I said, you know what?

130
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:36,860
Let's do a second gate on the Actors Attempted Music Careers grab grab bag edition.

131
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,860
Part one. That's what that's what it is.

132
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,860
This isn't a false tee up. Wow. OK.

133
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,860
Nice little grab bag of things.

134
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:50,860
Some things we've talked about them, some things we have not talked about in regards to when an actor takes a swing,

135
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,860
a couple swings maybe and tries to have a music career as well. Wow.

136
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,860
All right. OK.

137
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,860
So I thought I'm fully on board here.

138
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,860
You know, I had a book called Hollywood Hi-Fi.

139
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,860
Yeah. That went into probably maybe some of what you're even going to talk about,

140
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,860
but especially because it was really tracking like old movie stars and sitcom people in there.

141
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,860
And like this is what I'm doing this at 10, 11.

142
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,860
I'm into this kind of thing. Sure.

143
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,860
As an of course, as a child would do, because I'm very curious because I felt here too,

144
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,860
because I was like, OK, because like I wanted it to hit everything.

145
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,860
I wanted to have stuff where we all go, oh, we like that.

146
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,860
And then I do want to punish you two with a few things.

147
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,860
You know what I'm saying?

148
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,860
So we get a grab bag.

149
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,860
Exactly. Wow. All right.

150
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,860
So I finally, I think I decided to do this at 9 p.m. last night.

151
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,860
OK. Wow.

152
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,860
And that had been after hours of researching and looking through the other stuff.

153
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,860
And I just wasn't feeling it. It didn't feel right.

154
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,860
Wow. And then I went, oh, this feels more right.

155
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,860
So it's going to be a little messy. I have a lot of tabs.

156
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,860
I don't know if we'll get to everything.

157
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,860
There might be some stuff where you're like, I want to hear more off that album.

158
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,860
Sure. We get like bogged down in it.

159
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,860
So that I just want you to remain flexible.

160
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,860
And that's why I've said part one here, because there's obviously more

161
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,860
than we can cover in a whatever, however long this is going to be.

162
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:12,860
You call it, I think, I think as much as you you you declare the end to your party,

163
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,860
you know, yeah, just just like just like you declare, all right,

164
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,860
it's time for everyone to message Prince to get him to come to my birthday.

165
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,860
In the same regard, you have control over it. Yes.

166
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,860
You say when it's. Well, thank you.

167
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,860
But also, if you guys are like, oh, there's more to this.

168
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,860
What is this? Can we hear a few more?

169
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,860
Like, please step in and it'll be it'll be a little bit chaotic.

170
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,860
But I think I think that'll be better unless I don't want to just give a book report

171
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,860
is what I'm saying. Great.

172
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,860
So let's start with something that I think maybe we've played on the show before,

173
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,860
but not for a while.

174
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,860
You know, what I'm going to do really quick is I'm going to say if we want to keep going longer,

175
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,860
you know what I'll say is enhance. Oh, OK.

176
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,860
That'll be the word. Sorry, we're going to go deeper.

177
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,860
Yeah, that's fun. Yes.

178
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,860
That's a word said by someone we're going to talk about today.

179
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,860
I'm sure one of the people has said it on his TV show and movies.

180
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,860
Yes, I think that's correct.

181
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,860
You probably know what you know what we're talking about, I think. OK.

182
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,860
But let's start here with Emanuel Lewis. Oh, boy.

183
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,860
TV's Webster. Yeah.

184
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,860
Have we have we done this on the show? I can't remember.

185
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,860
No, I don't think so. No.

186
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,860
He has a song called City Connection, which was released in Japan.

187
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,860
And there was I think it was just a single.

188
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,860
He did not have a full album.

189
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,860
But there was a trend in Japan to bring like American stars and give them a singing career.

190
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,860
Obviously, it was a trend here, too.

191
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:41,860
But sometimes it was like it only landed on certain celebrities like Emanuel Lewis

192
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,860
when he was a child, like when he was young.

193
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,860
I remember that I feel like they tried this with all of the you know, I think maybe Gary Coleman did something.

194
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,860
I think I think Rodney Allen Rippy ever heard that name? Of course.

195
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,860
Yes, of course. He's a jack in the box kid.

196
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,860
I think he did music. Yep. Yep.

197
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,860
But Emanuel Lewis, I don't remember. I don't know if I ever heard this.

198
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:06,860
And so this and this also I I've saw some people trashing this, which I I kind of like this one, I'll say,

199
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,860
because it's like very I really like like 80s like Japanese city pop and stuff.

200
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,860
And it's very dancey and disco and stuff.

201
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,860
This isn't the greatest song ever.

202
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,860
But I'm starting with something that I would say I like more than don't like when you got to like this cover.

203
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,860
Oh, I should show you. Yeah. Yeah. This this cover.

204
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,860
Well, I love what you're showing me.

205
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,860
There's another there.

206
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,860
It's just a close up of his face with kind of cool 80s Japanese text.

207
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,860
But then this one has that, too.

208
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:38,860
But he's he's a giant windup toy is a giant winder screwed into his back.

209
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,860
Yeah, that's pretty wild.

210
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:49,860
Now, a theme you'll see is when you're a theme that I hopefully has gone more away is like kids singing as if they're like 25

211
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,860
and like hanging out in cities at night or like hanging out like that's really weird.

212
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,860
And that trend, I think, has stopped, although I don't know.

213
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,860
I don't know if there's any recent examples of like 10 year olds having singles recently.

214
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,860
Is this kind of considered legit city pop?

215
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,860
Because I think it is.

216
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,860
It's on your J-Pop Wiki.

217
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,860
It's written by legit like city pop guy, I believe.

218
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,860
So, yeah, yeah.

219
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,860
I think it's from 1981.

220
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,860
So that's in that era.

221
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,860
That's in that like plastic glove zone.

222
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,860
I forget if plastic gloves 81.

223
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,860
But yeah, so here we go.

224
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,860
Let's just play a little one.

225
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,860
Yeah.

226
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:41,860
Let's make a connection, baby.

227
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,860
Weird, weird.

228
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,860
Yeah.

229
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,860
But music pretty good.

230
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,860
Very off the wall.

231
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,860
Yes.

232
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:57,860
Ring it, ring it, ring it, ring it, ring it tonight.

233
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,860
Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance it tonight.

234
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,860
The telephone is gonna do, it's gonna do, it's gonna do.

235
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,860
I think I expected better singing than this.

236
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,860
Oh yeah.

237
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,860
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it tonight.

238
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,860
I mean, it's a child singing.

239
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,860
How old is he?

240
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,860
Yeah.

241
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,860
1981.

242
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,860
I don't have the age for it here.

243
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,860
He's 10.

244
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,860
I said 10.

245
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,860
Yeah.

246
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,860
Okay.

247
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,860
Wow.

248
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,860
No, he's not a good singer.

249
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,860
Oh my God.

250
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,860
It's a novelty song with cool music in it.

251
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,860
Yeah.

252
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,860
And background singers.

253
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,860
Wow.

254
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,860
Wow.

255
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,860
Really bizarre find whenever I, I don't remember how I found this a couple years ago.

256
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,860
A really fun, like, and not, obviously not like some polished little Michael Jackson,

257
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,860
who was like an amazing singer at 10.

258
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,860
Yeah.

259
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,860
So I just, yeah, I, I, this is a weird novelty song.

260
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,860
You know what it really, you know what it's a cousin of is, do you know the, the, the

261
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,860
French pop artist, Geordie?

262
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,860
Yes, I've heard, yes.

263
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,860
Geordie is a, was a seven year old.

264
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,860
Yeah.

265
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,860
Who had a hit song with the translation is it's tough to be a baby.

266
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:12,860
It's a little like dance, like, but it's, but a song about complaining about being a

267
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,860
baby.

268
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,860
And then a big choir of babies all come in at some point.

269
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,860
I have to be Geordie talk down the road.

270
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:27,860
It really, a lot of this feels just like there was a song lying around and they're like,

271
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,860
I don't know.

272
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,860
Nobody wants to record this one.

273
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,860
So like, let's give it to Emmanuel Lewis.

274
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,860
What a way.

275
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,860
Cause that you'd put a real singer on that and something could happen.

276
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,860
But yeah, for sure.

277
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,860
But yeah.

278
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,860
So city, also city connection is a good title for a song.

279
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,860
Really is.

280
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,860
Yeah.

281
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,860
I'm not saying I'm like, oh my God, he's a great singer or any of her, but getting

282
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,860
hyped.

283
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,860
And then I'm sorry.

284
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,860
I think I helped it up too much in that regard.

285
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,860
I would say maybe nothing on this episode is going to be like, I'm not, I'm not going

286
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,860
to champion anything as hard as I like McGruff, smart kids.

287
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,860
It's not happening on this episode.

288
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,860
If you're thinking, I find like an amazing gem, but there's going to be stuff in here.

289
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,860
I like at least, I mean, I like the novelty of it and I like the music, but yes, he, he's

290
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,860
not such a dynamic singer.

291
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,860
Wow.

292
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,860
You got a live performance of this seemingly.

293
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,860
Did you check that out?

294
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,860
Is that any good?

295
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,860
I, you know what?

296
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,860
Actually I didn't look at that.

297
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,860
But I mean, I guess we could.

298
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,860
So little.

299
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,860
It's reminding me.

300
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,860
There's a video game from 1985 called city connection.

301
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,860
I'm.

302
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,860
Oh really?

303
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,860
Why does that, that phrase was bugging me?

304
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,860
Uh, cause I was like, I feel like there's something now.

305
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,860
Oh, cool logo.

306
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,860
America, North America.

307
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,860
It's, it just came at us.

308
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,860
Yeah.

309
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,860
Yeah.

310
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,860
Yeah.

311
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,860
Yeah.

312
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,860
Yeah.

313
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,860
Yeah.

314
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,860
Yeah.

315
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,860
Yeah.

316
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,860
Yeah.

317
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,860
Yeah.

318
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,860
Yeah.

319
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,860
Yeah.

320
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,860
Yeah.

321
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,860
Yeah.

322
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,860
Yeah.

323
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,860
Yeah.

324
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,860
Yeah.

325
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,860
Yeah.

326
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,860
Yeah.

327
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,860
I mean, it's like, there's a video.

328
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:08,860
My parents have me singing the rainbow connection.

329
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,860
Oh, which I guess I, now that I think about it, I should've brought that out.

330
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,860
Really?

331
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,860
Yes.

332
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,860
A different connection.

333
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,860
Uh huh.

334
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,860
Actually I sing the whole Muppet movie.

335
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,860
There's a video of me and I might've been maybe a little younger, maybe like eight.

336
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,860
And I'm doing like, can you picture that?

337
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,860
I'm doing, can you picture that?

338
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,860
And I'm doing all of it pretty good.

339
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,860
Like I know all the lyrics.

340
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,860
Wow.

341
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,860
I didn't want to do the Miss Piggy song cause it was slow.

342
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,860
Boring.

343
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,860
Boring.

344
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,860
Yeah.

345
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,860
Yeah.

346
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,860
So.

347
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,860
Wow.

348
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,860
I'm going to jump around.

349
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:43,860
I'm already out of order of what I was going to do, but let me bring up a different artist.

350
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:50,860
And I didn't realize that, I didn't realize that this person had a career this young.

351
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:57,860
I knew she had a career later, but I didn't realize that Jennifer Love Hewitt had an album

352
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,860
that was released when she was 13.

353
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,860
Well, was she a kid incorporated?

354
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,860
Yes.

355
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,860
Okay.

356
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,860
But I didn't, I just either didn't know or didn't remember.

357
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:11,860
And she had some, but she was referred to, of course, as Love Hewitt and the album was

358
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,860
Love Songs.

359
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,860
And you're again, getting into the territory of like, were these songs written for like

360
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:21,860
a 13 year old to sing or were these lying around?

361
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,860
So there's a couple of things on here that's worth a little mention.

362
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:31,860
Let me play First Taste of Love, which is, I guess.

363
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,860
And this is where, again, you'll get into the music area where you go, hmm, some of

364
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,860
this music sounds like, I like some of it like, it's like Marauder or something.

365
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,860
Yeah.

366
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,860
Let's go.

367
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:49,860
It's like a big, rainy first song on 13 year old Jennifer Love Hewitt's album.

368
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,860
Oh, I like this.

369
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,860
Yeah, good.

370
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,860
I'm not scared anymore.

371
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,860
Little, little guitar there, little funk guitar there.

372
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,860
Can't be mad at that.

373
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,860
Not bad.

374
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,860
No, I think we're in the MMC zone.

375
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,860
I'm happy.

376
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,860
Yeah.

377
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,860
Yes.

378
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,860
So like, I don't know.

379
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,860
Good.

380
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,860
Good.

381
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,860
Pretty good.

382
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,860
Yes.

383
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,860
This instrument, like, and it's like, clearly like, you know, in the wake of Madonna and

384
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,860
there's a lot of like Janet Jackson, I feel like, influence on this album as well.

385
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,860
Sure.

386
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,860
And like, yeah, I don't know.

387
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,860
It's not, it's not like a revelation, but you're like, all right.

388
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,860
Yeah.

389
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,860
Yeah.

390
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,860
Things are all right.

391
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,860
Trying to track the producers of this.

392
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,860
Oh, yeah.

393
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,860
I'm not finding much.

394
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,860
Yeah.

395
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,860
Some of these, I have a couple, a couple of them, I have some credits that are interesting,

396
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,860
but I couldn't find anything that was so crazy here.

397
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,860
Let me.

398
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,860
This is, that's a Japan only also.

399
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,860
The single, there was a single released only in Japan, I believe.

400
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,860
Okay.

401
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:38,860
She has a 1995 album on Spotify called Let's Go Bang.

402
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,860
Is that from 95?

403
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,860
Yeah.

404
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,860
It says 95.

405
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,860
Whoa.

406
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,860
Okay.

407
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,860
Because I know she has like 2007, like there was that other like.

408
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,860
2002, Bare Naked.

409
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,860
That's 2002.

410
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,860
Okay.

411
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,860
1996 is just called Jennifer Love Hewitt.

412
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,860
And then in the, the video is very, I very much feel like they were trying to style her

413
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,860
after like an Avril.

414
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,860
Oh, sure.

415
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,860
In that Bare Naked period.

416
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,860
Because there's a couple of music videos there, but I was like, oh, maybe, maybe Jennifer Love

417
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,860
has to go back to sort of the retro, the retro vibe here, not chase the trends like in the

418
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,860
2000s, the 2000s, you know.

419
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,860
Let me put, let me play.

420
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:25,860
So this, this album seems to be a mix of songs, like just general love or infatuation songs

421
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,860
and then like calls to action for a better world.

422
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,860
Oh, great.

423
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,860
Good.

424
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,860
Yeah.

425
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,860
That's the world she's going to grow up in.

426
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,860
And there's a song called 90s Kids.

427
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,860
Oh, cool.

428
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:43,860
Which yes, that caught my eye and I don't want to over hype it, but yes, that is, it's probably

429
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,860
what you're thinking.

430
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,860
So I'll do a little 90s kids here.

431
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:53,860
Researchers say a newly discovered hole in the ozone layer is the cause of the world's

432
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,860
rainforest.

433
00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:01,860
Now conditions worsen in Ethiopia, the worst nuclear disaster.

434
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,860
It was like talking to the radio.

435
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,860
It was like, that was just like it was.

436
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:12,860
And who better to address than a 13 year old Jennifer Love you or any 13 year old.

437
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,860
I shouldn't even say it like that.

438
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,860
I mean, these are all sounds I really like.

439
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,860
Yeah.

440
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,860
She's looking to the future.

441
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,860
Optimist.

442
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,860
Now we're going to be peace centered.

443
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,860
Jennifer, you have no idea.

444
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:11,860
The short and tall.

445
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,860
Will there ever be peace between the short and tall?

446
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,860
Yeah, I don't know.

447
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,860
We try to forge on this podcast.

448
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,860
Jason and I can be friends.

449
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:27,860
Your differences aside, see eye to eye despite not seeing eye to eye.

450
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,860
I've got to get a couple apple boxes.

451
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,860
Here we go.

452
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,860
90s kids.

453
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:41,860
We're going to teach the kids the world right from wrong.

454
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,860
Great.

455
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,860
Yeah.

456
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,860
Yeah.

457
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,860
Do it.

458
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,860
Wait, one more part.

459
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:01,860
Remember, I think it's the end where she says 90s kids over and over again.

460
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:08,860
Well, and they're making good on it now with like, you know, like actresses who were on sitcoms and CW shows in the 90s.

461
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,860
You know, nagging on Twitter about where we got to vote Democrat.

462
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,860
Oh, well, that's yeah.

463
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,860
Not Jennifer, but other.

464
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,860
Not her.

465
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,860
That's just that's the 90s kids generally.

466
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,860
They're really doing it now.

467
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,860
That is the 90s.

468
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:29,860
We're all adults now and these same ancient ghouls are still death gripping.

469
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,860
They still have a death grip on power.

470
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,860
So they will not release it.

471
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,860
If you stop buying avocado toast, you could have a house.

472
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,860
Yeah.

473
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,860
So this yeah.

474
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,860
But like so like the album is full of stuff like this.

475
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,860
And I'm like, you know what?

476
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,860
This maybe this is maybe this is one of the closest ones to being like, oh, maybe I champion this.

477
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,860
Yeah, yeah.

478
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,860
Album from now on.

479
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:04,860
You got a producer on this, Greg Porey, who seems to be among the has a lot of very legit credits, but also did a lot maybe even.

480
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:10,860
Oh, he wrote a famous celebrity song, Mr. T's Be Somebody.

481
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,860
Oh, yeah.

482
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,860
I have me.

483
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,860
I mean, I think I have a Mr. T in here.

484
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,860
Oh, really?

485
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,860
Somebody. Yeah.

486
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,860
It might be another one by this guy, though.

487
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,860
We might have a shared credit.

488
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,860
So there's a and also and worked on Eddie Murphy's music as well.

489
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,860
Oh, wow.

490
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,860
Okay.

491
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,860
The hits, I assume.

492
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,860
I don't know.

493
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,860
Well, you know, what was the one I saw?

494
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,860
C.O.N.

495
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,860
Confused.

496
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,860
Oh, from 1985.

497
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,860
That's a fun.

498
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:41,860
You really think about getting how unstoppable Eddie Murphy was and just like, God, the funniest man on earth and the best SNL run every movie has been.

499
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,860
And then like, well, he was not totally unstoppable.

500
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:51,860
I would say no one can name more than two Eddie Murphy songs and the ones you can name are not good.

501
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,860
Still a big.

502
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,860
Well, what?

503
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,860
Party all the time.

504
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,860
Yeah.

505
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,860
All the times.

506
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,860
Okay.

507
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,860
Yeah, like that.

508
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,860
But fine.

509
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,860
But still pretty good.

510
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,860
I guess he did have a hit.

511
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,860
That's what I mean.

512
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,860
I know.

513
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,860
It's true.

514
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,860
Yeah.

515
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,860
Just one hit.

516
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,860
And in addition to a huge stand up career and a huge acting career.

517
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,860
That's true.

518
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:14,860
But there are like he put out like in his last star run, he put out an album every year that no one remembers anything from.

519
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,860
Sure.

520
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,860
I'm just giving I'm like he got enough points on the board there.

521
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,860
That's true.

522
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,860
Yeah.

523
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,860
Michael Jackson one is not that one's rough.

524
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,860
Sure.

525
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,860
Sure.

526
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,860
Yeah.

527
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:33,860
Now this I'm wondering if Scott, you have heard any of this because I did vaguely know this, but I hadn't actually listened to it before.

528
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,860
Now, most of the people on today's episode, I like.

529
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,860
Yeah.

530
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,860
In general.

531
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,860
Yeah.

532
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:47,860
This is maybe the guy I don't like as much personally, just from certain things he said and the way he is now.

533
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,860
But Scott Baio had a couple albums.

534
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,860
You know, I can't place anything from a Scott Baio album.

535
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:02,860
So first of all, there's two albums and the problem is there's going to be a couple songs I want to play.

536
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,860
Yeah.

537
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,860
Because again.

538
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,860
Do what we got to do.

539
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,860
Let me show you the cover of this.

540
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,860
Scott Baio, The Boys Are Out Tonight.

541
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,860
I mean, a great cover.

542
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,860
Do you have hits?

543
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,860
He feels like a guy who they would have gotten on American Bandstand and like.

544
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,860
He was on Dick Clark.

545
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,860
He was on Dick Clark.

546
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,860
Yes, he was on.

547
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,860
I don't know if they were.

548
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,860
I don't think they were like big hits or anything, but they definitely made a big push for it.

549
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,860
Yeah.

550
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,860
And this is from 1983.

551
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,860
OK.

552
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,860
It's in the zone again of like they're using sounds we like.

553
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,860
I think that.

554
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,860
Yeah, I know.

555
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,860
I'll forgive a lot just by what the equipment that's in the studio.

556
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,860
He has.

557
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,860
There was a self-titled, I believe, Scott Baio album as well.

558
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:44,860
And there's a song on there called How Do You Talk to Girls?

559
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,860
So let me just play.

560
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,860
Let me give you like a little bit here.

561
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,860
Let's play.

562
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,860
I'll Take You Back First.

563
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,860
I mean, very cars of the time.

564
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

565
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,860
It's fine.

566
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,860
It's serviceable.

567
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,860
He's going for that Rick Springfield money.

568
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

569
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,860
Not a great singer.

570
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,860
You can feel the difference.

571
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,860
You can feel like the step down.

572
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,860
There's stuff you can't even qualify or quantify.

573
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,860
Sometimes when you're listening to a song, you're like, it sounds like the cars.

574
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,860
But you can feel it's like a full letter grade or two letter grades down from the songwriting.

575
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,860
Less umph.

576
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,860
Less.

577
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,860
Yeah, like there's just like it's missing a couple interesting choices.

578
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,860
Yeah.

579
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:39,860
Like it's hard to sometimes articulate why one song is great and one song is OK.

580
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,860
And I was trying to determine it because like the cars, the best car stuff is great.

581
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:48,860
I mean, the music on all of these are clearly made by very technically good.

582
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,860
Well, of course, yeah.

583
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,860
Or more like instrumentalists and stuff.

584
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:57,860
But I think only the Jennifer Love Hewitt song so far seem like.

585
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,860
I feel like one or two of those I had heard before.

586
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,860
Oh, really?

587
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:06,860
Like I think she's probably the best singer out of the three so far.

588
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,860
Well, she's in Hunchback of Notre Dame 2.

589
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,860
Sure.

590
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,860
I'm going to let you in there unless you get some pipes.

591
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,860
Sure.

592
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,860
So, yeah, let me let's see here.

593
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,860
Let's do see how the love goes.

594
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:45,860
On my bedroom door.

595
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,860
It's very.

596
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,860
I find you rather shocking.

597
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,860
It's my best friend's girl.

598
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,860
Imagine my surprise.

599
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:04,860
There's a holy looking bride.

600
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,860
It's so generic.

601
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,860
A lot of like of the night, you know.

602
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,860
This is the real story.

603
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,860
The night in the night.

604
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:19,860
See how the love goes.

605
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,860
See how the love goes.

606
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,860
All this music where like nothing, nothing is happening.

607
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,860
Nothing wrong is happening.

608
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,860
But nothing right is happening.

609
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,860
Yeah.

610
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,860
A couple quick hits here and then we'll get digging a little more.

611
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,860
This is called some girls.

612
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:40,860
Maybe the best song on this album from the brief listen I did.

613
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,860
This sounds like.

614
00:29:42,860 --> 00:30:02,860
Lobster.

615
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,860
Some girls lie.

616
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:12,860
Hillary.

617
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,860
I turn away.

618
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,860
It's OK.

619
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,860
Yeah.

620
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,860
So, by the way, I'm not endorsing any of the messages in any of these songs.

621
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,860
I just want to let you know, listener.

622
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,860
You know, this is bad, but that his Wikipedia doesn't have a discography section.

623
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:33,860
Well, I was actually kind of surprised that there were two full albums because I feel like this one isn't ever talked about.

624
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,860
Yeah.

625
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,860
As far as his music.

626
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:44,860
Obviously, he's maybe not the most popular guy at the moment because he's a unpleasant idiot.

627
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,860
But, you know.

628
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,860
So let me hear.

629
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,860
Hold on.

630
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,860
Let me get to maybe we'll get to the second one real quick here.

631
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,860
I didn't know he was in super babies, baby geniuses, too.

632
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,860
I didn't know that either.

633
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,860
So this is this.

634
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,860
This is the cover of Scott Baio self-titled.

635
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,860
He's in like a yellow sweatshirt, which is very.

636
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,860
So I have this kind of similar sweatshirt, which I wore to Comic Con one year and Matt Cardona made fun of me.

637
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,860
Hey, Scott Baio over here.

638
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,860
Yeah.

639
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,860
He did not say Scott.

640
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,860
You love doing that diagonal lean.

641
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,860
Oh, I was leaning.

642
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,860
That's maybe why he was funny.

643
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,860
OK.

644
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,860
This is called.

645
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,860
How do you talk to girls?

646
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,860
I have no idea.

647
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:31,860
Still, which is the maybe the anthem anthem of podcast, the ride usually talk less.

648
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:35,860
Listen, there might be a little more juice in this one, I think.

649
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,860
No way.

650
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,860
Talk to them for hours and hours about theme parks.

651
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,860
That's what you do.

652
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,860
Just a little bit of heat.

653
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,860
We're all sick of hanging out on the street.

654
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,860
Saturday night with the boys.

655
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,860
The boys.

656
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,860
Listen to the radio with big feet.

657
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,860
We're cracking just to hear the noise.

658
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,860
And yeah, we're talking about the girls, girls, girls.

659
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,860
We're talking, talking, talking all night.

660
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,860
We're showing off all we own.

661
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:09,860
We're passing over stuff we can't seem to get it right.

662
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,860
It seems to make it harder and harder.

663
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,860
Springfield.

664
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,860
Yes, yes.

665
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,860
The river.

666
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,860
How do you talk to girls?

667
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,860
How do you talk to girls?

668
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,860
Springfield wrote them too.

669
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,860
Lake and Tarr.

670
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

671
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,860
Tell me how do you talk to girls?

672
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,860
How do you talk to girls?

673
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,860
That's what he's wondering now.

674
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,860
He wants to marry Marjorie Taylor Green.

675
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,860
How do you talk to red-pilled girls?

676
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:44,860
So this one, with a different singer, I think I would really like.

677
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,860
All of these, these are probably all songs that floated around on the song market.

678
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,860
And then like, good news, there was a sale.

679
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,860
Oh, good, who?

680
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,860
Scott Baio.

681
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,860
Oh, no.

682
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,860
Scott Baio.

683
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,860
Scott Baio.

684
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,860
Scott Baio.

685
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,860
Scott Baio.

686
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,860
Scott Baio.

687
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,860
Scott Baio.

688
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,860
Scott Baio.

689
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,860
Oh, good, who?

690
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,860
Scott Baio.

691
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,860
Oh, no.

692
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,860
Oh, no.

693
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:09,860
Like, the music itself was pretty good.

694
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,860
But those were the best takes they could get with him saying, how do you talk to girls?

695
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,860
Like, really?

696
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,860
They couldn't dress it up a little more?

697
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,860
Sorry.

698
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,860
Look, it's very, you know.

699
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,860
Like, this is the case of some.

700
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,860
Actually, she was OK singing-wise.

701
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:28,860
But Hilary Duff, you go later into, like, let's give the pop career to the actress.

702
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:33,860
But there were some early ones where it was just like, now entirely other women come in

703
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,860
and sing the chorus.

704
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

705
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,860
Well, that makes sense, at least.

706
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,860
They're trying to, like, if they're like, I don't know, the vocal isn't really strong

707
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,860
here.

708
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,860
At least prop.

709
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,860
Like, prop Baio up with some background singers.

710
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,860
Yeah.

711
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,860
A little more.

712
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,860
I got to watch out, though.

713
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,860
That's how Io got in trouble with JLo.

714
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,860
Oh, right.

715
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,860
I saw it on a podcast.

716
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,860
Here I am doing it.

717
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,860
That's what I heard.

718
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,860
It's my chance to work with Hilary Duff.

719
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,860
Oh, yeah.

720
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,860
It's behind the paywall.

721
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,860
Don't tell anyone.

722
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,860
Yeah, don't tell.

723
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,860
Don't tell on Scott.

724
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:06,860
I don't want to spend too much more time on Scott Baio.

725
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:11,860
But I did hear, I was like, I was re-listening to this on the car on the way over here, this

726
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,860
Scott Baio, the first one, actually.

727
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:18,860
And I was like, oh, maybe She's Trouble is good from the Boys Are Out Tonight album.

728
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,860
So let me just do She's Trouble and then we'll move on from Baio.

729
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,860
She believes in free health care.

730
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,860
Taylor Swift is a sire.

731
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,860
I was like, oh, I like that too.

732
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,860
Yeah.

733
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,860
Sleepy little dream, dreamy as you'd say, dreamy.

734
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,860
Again, the more we're singing we've had.

735
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,860
Yes.

736
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,860
Kind of whisper singing.

737
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,860
I'm embarrassed to be with Scott right now.

738
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:28,860
They are double tracking his voice, which that can sometimes hide a little bit of like a thin sound.

739
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,860
Sure.

740
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,860
And sometimes it's used, like Ozzy Osbourne does that a lot, but that's kind of a cool

741
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,860
effect that gives it kind of a scary sound.

742
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,860
That's not what's happening here.

743
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:41,860
I cannot get the image out of my mind of Eddie Murphy.

744
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:45,860
Is it the party all the time video where it's like he's in the studio at one point holding

745
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,860
the headphones, doing some great studio headphone acting.

746
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,860
Yeah.

747
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,860
A bit of rush that video out.

748
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,860
So MTV was like, yeah, we'll play it.

749
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,860
Do you have a video?

750
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,860
Yeah.

751
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:02,860
But I just imagine every one of these actors doing that.

752
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,860
Yeah.

753
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:08,860
Well, it's very it's all like actually he's a he's a lot like fucking Dirk Diggler.

754
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,860
Yeah.

755
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:14,860
So much like the Dirk Diggler music and Boogie Nights where it's like generic early 80s

756
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:18,860
like, yeah, it kind of has the attitude, but the singer just don't got it.

757
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,860
Yeah.

758
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,860
Yeah.

759
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,860
Yeah.

760
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,860
So I don't know.

761
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,860
Should we I don't know.

762
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,860
Should we record?

763
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,860
We record some of these.

764
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,860
How do you talk to girls podcast?

765
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,860
The ride version.

766
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,860
We could give it some.

767
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,860
Yeah.

768
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,860
If we could like bring I mean, I guess this is a good question.

769
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,860
If Bayo has like a writing credit, like I don't want to give Bayo any money.

770
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,860
But if the writers of it, yeah, if the writers of it would get, you know, when it becomes

771
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,860
a big hit, I mean, yeah.

772
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,860
Yeah.

773
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:45,860
When all the money we generate from our version of how do you talk to girls?

774
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,860
Yeah.

775
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:50,860
It's it's I don't mind giving money to Pat Robinson or Johnny Kid.

776
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,860
Yeah.

777
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,860
Johnny Kid.

778
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,860
Sue Schifrin.

779
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,860
Sue Schifrin.

780
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,860
I don't know any of these names.

781
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,860
Yeah.

782
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,860
So so that that's fine.

783
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,860
Yeah.

784
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,860
Randy Foot.

785
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,860
Randy Foot.

786
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,860
Randy Foot.

787
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,860
He backing vocals.

788
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,860
Randy Foot.

789
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,860
OK.

790
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,860
Got it.

791
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,860
Got it.

792
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,860
OK.

793
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,860
Here's a couple.

794
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,860
Let me do a couple of quick hits here.

795
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,860
I have so many thoughts about them.

796
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,860
Tina Yothers has a song.

797
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,860
Sorry.

798
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,860
Tina Yothers is Family Ties.

799
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,860
Yes.

800
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,860
From Family Ties.

801
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,860
Yes.

802
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,860
And she had a song called Baby I'm Back in Love Again.

803
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,860
And this is a great cover.

804
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,860
That like airbrushed like pastel.

805
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,860
What do you call this?

806
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,860
I got some weird treatment.

807
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,860
This is just a quick hit.

808
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,860
This is from 87.

809
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,860
I love you.

810
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,860
Boy.

811
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,860
Boy.

812
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,860
That's the main element to it.

813
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,860
It's all right.

814
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,860
Yeah.

815
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,860
This is plenty serviceable.

816
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,860
Yeah, I agree.

817
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:31,860
A lot of the choruses for these like celebrity songs seem like they just repeat the same

818
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,860
line over.

819
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:36,860
I don't always hate in a chorus, but it definitely seems like if this song was written maybe

820
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,860
specifically for them, the songwriter is like, I don't know, just write it or like say I'm

821
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:44,860
in love again over and over again or say, how do you talk to girls four times for the

822
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,860
chorus?

823
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,860
Like, I don't feel like writing a chorus here.

824
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,860
How do you talk to girls?

825
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,860
We only need to get one good take.

826
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:50,860
We can just repeat it.

827
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,860
How do you talk to girls?

828
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,860
Yeah.

829
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,860
And kind of seems similar here.

830
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,860
But yeah, a perfectly serviceable song.

831
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,860
This did not light up the charts.

832
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:02,860
I'm seeing that that one is written by a writer of a video killed the radio star.

833
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,860
Oh, wow.

834
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,860
Bruce Woolley.

835
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,860
Great song.

836
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:09,860
It does feel a little elevated as far as some of the other stuff I'm playing.

837
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,860
Yeah.

838
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,860
That's one of the best for sure.

839
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,860
Yeah.

840
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,860
So that is interesting.

841
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:19,860
OK, so now we're let's do Mr. T's commandments, I think.

842
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,860
Oh, Mr. T, there we go.

843
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,860
OK.

844
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,860
So we're on to Mr. T here.

845
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,860
Yeah.

846
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:31,860
And this is called Mr. T's command, commandments, even though it's listed as commandment singular

847
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,860
on YouTube.

848
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,860
OK.

849
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:40,860
So this is Mr. T. He is hanging out with a bunch of kids on a baseball field and he's

850
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,860
got commandments to make.

851
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,860
Yeah.

852
00:39:44,860 --> 00:40:10,860
How much time can we kill before he has to sing or rap or whatever?

853
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,860
But so far, so good.

854
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:23,860
Funny thing, listen and then along instrumentals.

855
00:40:53,860 --> 00:41:17,860
The Bible makes it clear.

856
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:23,360
OK, so the first part of this, the first commandment, Mr. T has is just like your parents are going

857
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,360
to help you out.

858
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,360
Yeah, your parents are friends.

859
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,360
Don't worry about it.

860
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,860
Make sure to clue them in on your life.

861
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,860
Right.

862
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:34,360
And the Bible says, he also says, so this is a religious song.

863
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,860
Mr. T is religious.

864
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:40,360
This does seem like I'm surprised McGruff never mentioned the Bible in any of his songs.

865
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,360
Yeah, yeah, true.

866
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,360
The Bible.

867
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,360
Your parents are your friends.

868
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,360
The Lord Jesus says it's so.

869
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:53,360
There's one power higher than law enforcement.

870
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,360
And that's the Christian God.

871
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,360
When he puts his cuffs on you, it's forever.

872
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,360
They send you straight down.

873
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:07,360
So yeah, so the commandment so far is just a long explanation of like your parents are

874
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,360
there to support you.

875
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,360
So let's keep going.

876
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,360
This song is five minutes long.

877
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,360
For a minute.

878
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,360
Again, a lot of music in this.

879
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:54,360
It's from you.

880
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:20,360
You've got Mr. T. So so far, the commandments are just to your parents, right?

881
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,360
Yeah, it's a lot of parents stuff.

882
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,360
Give your dad a kiss.

883
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,360
For me.

884
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,360
So it's from Mr. T. Now there's one for me.

885
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:35,360
Next one's Mr. T. On and on and back and forth.

886
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,360
It's interesting.

887
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:44,360
You know, I feel like a lot of the media that connects with kids, it's made by adults treating

888
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:48,360
them as intelligent human creatures.

889
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,360
Sure.

890
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,360
Yes, go ahead.

891
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,360
So much of the Mr. T. and Hulk Hogan stuff.

892
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,360
It's like, all right, it's aimed at children.

893
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,360
They're morons.

894
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,360
We've got to spoon feed these babies.

895
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,360
There's two different approaches.

896
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,360
Some could say one is more successful than the others.

897
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,360
Some kids need to get scared straight.

898
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:13,360
So when big muscle men say, believe in God or I'll beat you up, it works sometimes.

899
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:18,360
Jason, I know you were a fearful child, you know, so sometimes if you were yelled at by a celebrity.

900
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:24,360
I was very always confused by like the human cartoon characters like Mr. T.

901
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,360
I love Mr. T. though.

902
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,360
I like Mr. T. He was a little more ridiculous.

903
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:34,360
But every now and then, who would intro or outro GI Joe episodes?

904
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,360
Was it Sergeant Slaughter?

905
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,360
Sergeant Slaughter, yeah, yeah.

906
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,360
I would be like, what is this guy?

907
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,360
Where are the cartoons?

908
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,360
Who is this live action man?

909
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:47,360
Sergeant Slaughter looks like, I mean, he was drawn into GI Joe, but he looks like a cartoon.

910
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,360
His head is more cartoonish than Leno's head.

911
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,360
I don't know if you can think of Sergeant Slaughter off the top of your head.

912
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,360
No, I know.

913
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,360
I don't remember him.

914
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:02,360
I was at Starcast, the wrestling convention in 2018 and he was just had a table.

915
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:07,360
And he was trying to get people to come over to get, you know, buy a picture or buy whatever.

916
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,360
Take a picture, buy a picture, get an autograph.

917
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:17,360
And all of a sudden I hear, hey, recruit, come over here and I'll put you in the camel clutch.

918
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,360
Or wait, actually, it's a different move.

919
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,360
But I look over and Sergeant Slaughter is yelling at me.

920
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,360
It's you?

921
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,360
He wants you?

922
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,360
I didn't do it.

923
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:28,360
Now, in hindsight, it's crazy that I didn't just go over and pay him $40 for a picture.

924
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,360
But I was like, my goodness, this man is a cartoon.

925
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,360
Like, it's so crazy.

926
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,360
Yeah.

927
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,360
He looks, the photos of him look like they are AI generated.

928
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,360
Yeah.

929
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,360
Yeah.

930
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,360
So, yeah.

931
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:45,360
Then I remember some people being like, did they cast Sergeant Slaughter after they drew him in GI Joe?

932
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,360
And people were like, no.

933
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,360
What?

934
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,360
How would that be possible?

935
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:56,360
They didn't get like plastic surgery on his skull to do that.

936
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,360
All right.

937
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,360
So let's listen to Sergeant Slaughter, Max Martin single.

938
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:05,360
If that exists, if that exists, that's for part two.

939
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:10,360
This song, by the way, produced and written by a guy named Patrick Henderson, I kept looking up.

940
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,360
Co-writer of some Doobie Brothers songs that I love.

941
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,360
Oh, really?

942
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:21,360
It's a song called Real Love, a song from Michael McDonald's wife, maybe at the time, called How Do I Survive?

943
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,360
What's the other one?

944
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,360
What's his name?

945
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,360
Patrick Henderson.

946
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,360
Open Your Eyes, another dude.

947
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,360
It's songs I really like.

948
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,360
Oh, wow.

949
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,360
Yeah.

950
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,360
Mr. T went.

951
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,360
Let's do a little more.

952
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,360
Give me a Doobie.

953
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,360
I really like the chorus on this.

954
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,360
I know.

955
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,360
I mean, we've heard two choruses, so that's when he talks about God.

956
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,360
But it's just a catchy situation.

957
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,360
Let's just see a little more.

958
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,360
Back to the scratches.

959
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,360
Good way to excuse to repeat material.

960
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:17,360
Book goes on him.

961
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,360
Don't send him out naked.

962
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,360
I didn't understand.

963
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,360
What did he say?

964
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:48,360
I don't know why the name of this song is Mr. T's Commandments.

965
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,360
It's only about one thing.

966
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,360
Didn't you?

967
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,360
When I heard this, I was like, oh, it'll be a list of things he says.

968
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,360
You know, drink your milk.

969
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,360
Yeah.

970
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,360
Say prayers.

971
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,360
All that stuff.

972
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,360
But no, it seems to be about kids and parents.

973
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,360
And then he's yelling at the parents here.

974
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,360
I'm not sure.

975
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,360
They came up with the hook, maybe, on the chorus.

976
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,360
And then they're like, what is the?

977
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,360
He says he wants to just talk to kids' parents.

978
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,360
It also seems like the commandments are essentially the same as the Christian commandments.

979
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,360
He didn't really customize the commandments too much.

980
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,360
That's probably right.

981
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,360
Because it would be blasphemous to come up with your own commandments if you were Christian, right?

982
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,360
That's got to be.

983
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,360
Yeah, you're not really supposed to.

984
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,360
Because you could have other rule, but calling them commandments.

985
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:34,360
I have no false god before me, so false commandments definitely seems like you're getting into the false god territory.

986
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,360
But he didn't do it.

987
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:40,360
But he did put his name on the commandments, and he's selling them, and that seems like something Jesus wouldn't like.

988
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:44,360
Right. Does the Bible say, I pity the fool who worships a false god?

989
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:47,360
Pull up Bible.com, do a little search.

990
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,360
Pity fool.

991
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:53,360
You know, I think what happened is they wrote the one commandment, and then lunch arrived.

992
00:48:53,360 --> 00:49:02,360
And they forgot, and then they jumped to happy hour, and then the next day they're like, oh, shit, he's coming in.

993
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,360
All right, let's just stretch the one.

994
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:09,360
Scratch the record. That way we can have the same word said for 30 seconds.

995
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,360
Mr. T.

996
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:20,360
All right, look, he's coming in for recording, and then lunch is going to arrive, and then we'll just get him out of here afterwards.

997
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,360
We just got 40 minutes to worry about.

998
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:32,360
If we give him enough carbs, if we give him a big enough sub or enough rice as a side dish, he'll get sleepy and get out of here.

999
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:37,360
And we just mix whatever we get for the morning.

1000
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:41,360
Yeah, I wish there was more Mr. T. stuff. I don't know. It's just Mr. T. such a fun character.

1001
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:45,360
Yeah, well, I mean, as mentioned earlier, be somebody. Yeah, yeah.

1002
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,360
And there's like a Scott Bale level.

1003
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:56,360
Well, some of the songs maybe weren't released as records, but they're in some video because I also I have in my head the song like, treat your mother right.

1004
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,360
Right, right, right.

1005
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,360
Again, so much parents stuff.

1006
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,360
Yeah, a lot of parents stuff.

1007
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:09,360
I guess the generation of latchkey kids, they need to be reminded like other people live in the house.

1008
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,360
Yeah.

1009
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,360
You don't see them very often.

1010
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,360
Do you pay for this place? I don't think so.

1011
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,360
You got a rent check.

1012
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:22,360
Reimburse your parents later in their life.

1013
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,360
Add up all the food they bought.

1014
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,360
You can't be trusted to make hamburger helper.

1015
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:31,360
It's not safe.

1016
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,360
So OK, there's so much here.

1017
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,360
I think we have to get to this real quick because this has come up a couple of times.

1018
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,360
And it's Robert Downey Jr.

1019
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,360
OK, OK.

1020
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,360
It's Robert Downey Jr.'s album, The Futurist.

1021
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,360
Oh, no. Oh, we landed in it.

1022
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,360
We've got to do a little of it for this episode.

1023
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,360
I mean, I'm relieved it's not a full episode.

1024
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:55,360
I did contemplate full episode about The Futurist.

1025
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,360
Now, what is The Futurist? Just refresh me.

1026
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:04,360
He came out with just a straight ahead album in like, let me see, is it 2001, I think?

1027
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:11,360
And it was just mostly written by him and a couple other people.

1028
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:15,360
And a very completely very earnest stab at having a music career.

1029
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:21,360
This is around the time of his comeback on like Ally McBeal, is that right?

1030
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,360
Yeah, I mean, in that zone.

1031
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:32,360
But yeah, it's so it's not I've said this before where it's like I don't it's not like such a oh, I can't believe this or whatever.

1032
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,360
It's it's like absurd or whatever.

1033
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:42,360
But it is very much sounds like it's of its time, like sonically and vocally and everything.

1034
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,360
Released in 2004 on Sony Classical.

1035
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,360
Sony Classical.

1036
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,360
I don't know why it's on Sony Classical.

1037
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,360
I think his idea maybe was again, yeah, full music career.

1038
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:55,360
And then I think this just did not do well or didn't really spark.

1039
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,360
This is produced by a guy I saw on one of the other ones.

1040
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,360
Maybe Jennifer Loughue, his name is Mark Hudson.

1041
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,360
He's part of the Hudson family.

1042
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,360
He's like Kate Hudson is his niece.

1043
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,360
Oh, really?

1044
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,360
He's in that family lineage.

1045
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,360
He's a cook.

1046
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,360
He's a cook.

1047
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,360
I've seen this guy like at a concert or something.

1048
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,360
He's like a kooky guy with a dyed beard.

1049
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,360
Uh huh.

1050
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,360
He worked with Ringo and Cher and Aerosmith.

1051
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,360
He's a legend.

1052
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,360
And Nilsson.

1053
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,360
That's where I've seen him.

1054
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,360
And Nilsson died.

1055
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,360
The Baja Men.

1056
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,360
All the legends.

1057
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,360
Nilsson and Baja Men.

1058
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:28,360
And Robert Downey Jr. is the futurist.

1059
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,360
There's two covers on the album.

1060
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,360
Let me see here.

1061
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:37,360
One of them is a Charlie Chaplin composition, of course, because he played Chaplin.

1062
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,360
And then there's a song by Yes.

1063
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,360
Okay.

1064
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,360
The first half of the song, I've Seen All Good People by Yes.

1065
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,360
Oh, John Anderson of Yes plays on the album.

1066
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,360
Does background vocals on your move.

1067
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,360
It's his song.

1068
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,360
Yes.

1069
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:54,360
Oh, and then Smile, the Charlie, which Michael Jackson did too.

1070
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,360
Right.

1071
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,360
Right, right, right.

1072
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:00,360
So again, this isn't like, I don't think there's a ton of like haha or anything here.

1073
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:06,360
But just because I've mentioned it on the show before and because this song has a very funny title.

1074
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:11,360
And that's really all that's just scratching the itch of me playing it for everybody.

1075
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:16,360
And the song is called Little Clowns, C-L-O-W-N-Z.

1076
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,360
It's Clowns and G at once.

1077
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,360
Yeah.

1078
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,360
All of Scott's favorites today.

1079
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:26,360
Little Wind Up Children and Clowns and Little Clowns.

1080
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:30,360
It would only be better if it was like Little Clowns Boy or something.

1081
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,360
That would be the only so.

1082
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,360
I want to, parentheses, I want to be a.

1083
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,360
I want to.

1084
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,360
And so that's yeah, you saw the cover of it.

1085
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,360
And he's got like he's like using a coin.

1086
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,360
Working hard.

1087
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,360
Writing my lyrics.

1088
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,360
This is pre Tony Stark.

1089
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,360
I can't.

1090
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,360
I can't.

1091
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:51,360
Like if I couldn't paint an image of like, I don't know what music I'm going to hear.

1092
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,360
That's what I was about to ask.

1093
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,360
Can you even take a guess what it kind of sounds like?

1094
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,360
No.

1095
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,360
OK.

1096
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,360
No.

1097
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,360
It's kind of like like synthy.

1098
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,360
What do you think?

1099
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,360
Does it sound like late sting?

1100
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:07,360
Is he trying to be like later sting?

1101
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,360
Scott, you're.

1102
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,360
Wow.

1103
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,360
Is that a good guess?

1104
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,360
That might be.

1105
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,360
OK.

1106
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,360
I'm like, yeah, because we're like, what would he like?

1107
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,360
He'd probably like that.

1108
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,360
The mountains outlast the summer.

1109
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,360
A father gave us your number.

1110
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,360
Our very own.

1111
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,360
All of my friends.

1112
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,360
All of my friends.

1113
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,360
All of my so-called brothers.

1114
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:37,360
I can hear you holding the headphones.

1115
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:42,360
So when you're a star, that's how you sing.

1116
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:58,360
And if you think that a simple solution is retribution, please.

1117
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,360
The song is called Little Clowns.

1118
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,360
Little Clowns.

1119
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,360
Yes.

1120
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,360
Freeze job.

1121
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,360
Scarled in situations.

1122
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:15,360
Why am I standing?

1123
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:19,360
Is this my home?

1124
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:23,360
All of my tears.

1125
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,360
They're bound to be hurt.

1126
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,360
Tell them it should be called Robert Downey Jr.

1127
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,360
Sings Words Weird.

1128
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,360
Is this called Driven to Tears, you said?

1129
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,360
This is called Little Clowns.

1130
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,360
Oh, this is called Little Clowns.

1131
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,360
Jason.

1132
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:40,360
Driven to Tears, there is video of him singing with sting.

1133
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,360
Oh.

1134
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,360
He's a big sting guy.

1135
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,360
And I think that's a lot of.

1136
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,360
Yeah, wow.

1137
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,360
I get that from nowhere.

1138
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,360
Yeah.

1139
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,360
Seemed right around that time.

1140
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,360
The vibe is correct.

1141
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,360
Yeah, yeah, you were right about that vibe.

1142
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,360
Wow.

1143
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,360
So that's a little.

1144
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,360
This is why when we talked about this a couple of years ago and I was like, I don't, it's

1145
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,360
not.

1146
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,360
I at least give him credit.

1147
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:01,360
It's not like some like C, A minor, D minor, G like straight ahead.

1148
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,360
Like he's trying something.

1149
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,360
Yeah.

1150
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:08,360
It's like a little free form and it's not like, oh, I'm just writing like a simple.

1151
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,360
I bet he busted his ass making this.

1152
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,360
Sure.

1153
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,360
Yeah.

1154
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,360
Here's a compilation of him singing in Ally McPeel.

1155
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,360
Oh, okay.

1156
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,360
So he had some musical numbers in the show too.

1157
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,360
He seems like a guy who would jump up and play with that.

1158
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,360
You know, he's up with Mac or whatever.

1159
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,360
Yeah.

1160
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,360
Yeah.

1161
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,360
So.

1162
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,360
That's boring though.

1163
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,360
It is boring.

1164
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,360
It's boring.

1165
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,360
It's a boring song.

1166
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,360
He's a futurist.

1167
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,360
He imagines a world of boring music.

1168
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,360
Yeah.

1169
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,360
Yeah.

1170
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,360
Yeah.

1171
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,360
So there's that.

1172
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,360
That's a scratch.

1173
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,360
It's a niche again.

1174
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,360
There's not so much to.

1175
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,360
Does he ever say the words little clowns?

1176
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,360
He did.

1177
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,360
Hold on.

1178
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,360
Let me.

1179
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,360
There's the lyrics here.

1180
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,360
He says little clowns later.

1181
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,360
He says, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on little clowns.

1182
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,360
You might just turn the world around.

1183
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,360
These are just words.

1184
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,360
It's kind of the same idea as 90s kids.

1185
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,360
I think it's exactly the same because it's unfit for evolution.

1186
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,360
Silly and pure.

1187
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:02,360
I think somebody called some critic called these lyrics obtuse.

1188
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:06,360
I believe I read a nice way of saying it means nothing.

1189
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,360
Uh huh.

1190
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,360
So.

1191
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,360
But you know, again, if you have the right kind of sounding words, it doesn't matter

1192
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:18,360
if the music or the lyrics are so meaningful or they, they, they, the words take on other

1193
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,360
meanings.

1194
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,360
Sure.

1195
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,360
I'm just saying.

1196
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,360
They could.

1197
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,360
Hypothetically.

1198
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,360
In the history of music.

1199
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:28,360
I wouldn't be shocked though if after all this, then the, the cherry on top of this

1200
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:34,360
is that then you reveal and, uh, uh, uh, Robert Downey jr. is the futurist one best album

1201
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,360
at the Grammys that year.

1202
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:42,360
There is a world where, cause that, the Grammys always will throw, at least in the past we'll

1203
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,360
throw that at you.

1204
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,360
We're like, what?

1205
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,360
One best album?

1206
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,360
Yeah.

1207
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,360
Yeah.

1208
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,360
And it's like something that like.

1209
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:58,360
I feel like Sting won many Grammys for those albums that no one listens to.

1210
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,360
Yeah.

1211
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,360
Yes.

1212
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,360
Even though like one of them was a big hit.

1213
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:05,360
The one with like desert rose probably was a big hit, but I've never listened to it.

1214
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,360
Yeah.

1215
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,360
So maybe that maybe it's popular, maybe that's got its audience.

1216
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:14,360
Maybe people are yelling at the podcast right now and give desert rose a chance.

1217
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,360
But yeah, I don't know.

1218
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,360
Brand new days.

1219
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,360
Okay.

1220
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,360
I guess I'm getting older.

1221
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:24,040
I guess the biggest sign I'm getting older is that I now think brand new day is okay.

1222
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:27,360
That's the equivalent of the opinion equivalent of a gray hair.

1223
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,360
Yeah.

1224
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:29,360
Uh, uh, okay.

1225
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,360
Let's see.

1226
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,360
What are we doing here?

1227
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:40,360
Um, so many tabs to choose, which will mark decided to click on.

1228
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,360
Uh, okay.

1229
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,640
Okay.

1230
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:49,640
Let's get to one that I've said many times and just give it a little, give it a little,

1231
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,640
uh, attention.

1232
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:54,640
Uh, uh, my beloved Brent Spiner.

1233
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,640
Oh, finally.

1234
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,640
Lieutenant commander data from Star Trek.

1235
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,640
The next generation.

1236
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,640
Oh yeah.

1237
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,640
Oh, he's data, right?

1238
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,640
No, he's not data.

1239
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,640
Data is data from.

1240
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,640
I can't, I I've said it before.

1241
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,640
I can't explain why it drives me nuts.

1242
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,640
Cause you love it.

1243
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:17,640
There's other stuff that doesn't drive me that crazy, but for some reason data drives

1244
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,640
me nuts.

1245
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:22,640
I can't, I would have to go to therapy to understand why.

1246
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:27,640
But do you think that it's always, is it valid to call to use data at all?

1247
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,640
Is it like, like you could call data.

1248
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,640
You could use that for regular data, but when it's a character, it's gotta be data.

1249
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,640
Yeah, I guess so.

1250
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,640
Yeah.

1251
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,640
Yeah.

1252
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,640
Of course.

1253
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,640
I wouldn't be so upset.

1254
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:40,640
Unless that, unless that is wrong.

1255
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,640
Maybe somebody could tell me.

1256
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,640
I don't know.

1257
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:47,640
I'm reeling still from going to the George Lucas talk show where George said that it's

1258
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,640
pronounced, technically it should be short-lived.

1259
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:54,640
Everybody jumped down his throat and then he was like, look it up.

1260
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,640
And the audience was aghast.

1261
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,640
I'm aghast hearing that.

1262
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:01,640
Apparently, technically we should all be saying that things are not short-lived, but short-lived.

1263
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,640
Yeah.

1264
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:07,640
This shook me, I don't know, like finding out my dad had a secret wife.

1265
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,640
I didn't know.

1266
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,640
I'm really thrown by that.

1267
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,640
That is weird.

1268
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:12,640
I didn't know that.

1269
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,640
Yeah.

1270
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,640
So Brent Spiner, Brent Spiner did musical theater.

1271
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:21,640
I forget, he worked with Sondheim in like the seventies or eighties.

1272
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:22,640
He's had a lot of stuff.

1273
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:27,640
I found a clip of him in like 1776 playing John Adams and singing.

1274
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,640
Also in that is Pat Hingle who played Commissioner Gordon in the first four Batman movies.

1275
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:32,640
Oh, I like him.

1276
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,640
I'd like to see him in something else.

1277
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,640
He's in Talladega Nights too.

1278
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,640
I think that's one of his last roles.

1279
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,640
And then he like, he sings a lot.

1280
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:48,640
He's in Out to Sea, of course, the Walter Mathau Jack Lemmon movie where they're on a cruise ship.

1281
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,640
Oh, right.

1282
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:50,640
And he's pretty funny in it.

1283
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,640
He's like doing like a snooty character.

1284
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:57,640
And he does, I'll give you a little of the comedic singing of Brent Spiner here from Out to Sea.

1285
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:58,640
Have you ever seen Out to Sea?

1286
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,640
I'm trying to think.

1287
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:04,640
I think I've seen Grumpy Old Men or Grumpier Old Men.

1288
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,640
This could be a miniseries pitch to Griffin in Blank Check.

1289
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:14,640
I don't mean the entire filmography of Mathau and Lemmon, but the post-Grumpy Old Men Blank Check.

1290
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,640
Odd Couple 2.

1291
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:21,640
Yes, Odd Couple 2, Out to Sea, and I would count my fellow Americans in this.

1292
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,640
Suddenly America had Lemmon, Mathau comedy theaters.

1293
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,640
This is like the 90s revival.

1294
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,640
Grumpier, obviously.

1295
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:33,640
I wonder if Out to Sea would like, I would be like, this is the funniest movie of the last decade.

1296
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:34,640
If it came out now.

1297
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,640
Possibly. I don't know.

1298
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,640
I don't know anything about it.

1299
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,640
Well, this will be a test, won't it?

1300
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,640
Well, you're going to get a little Spiner.

1301
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:49,640
So he's a cruise ship director and he's had it up to here with these troublemakers, these 80 year old troublemakers.

1302
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,640
That's the premise of it.

1303
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,640
But here, this is just like 17 seconds of him doing singing.

1304
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:09,640
He does a little dance.

1305
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,640
A little dumb clap. That's funny.

1306
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,640
Yeah, silly version of Oye Como Va.

1307
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,640
He's got a sense of humor.

1308
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,640
He has two albums, I realized last night.

1309
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:20,640
Two albums.

1310
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:27,640
He has, of course, Old Yellow Eyes is back, which is, of course, like a parody.

1311
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:28,640
It's a cover. It's a great cover.

1312
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,640
And it's a good, yeah.

1313
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,640
And it's black and white and he's got, Data, of course, has yellow eyes.

1314
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,640
That's the joke there.

1315
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,640
And it's a play on Old Blue Eyes is back.

1316
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,640
Was that a Sinatra?

1317
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:48,640
Yes. And he also has an album that's newer that I, not newer, but like newer in the last 15 years, 20 years, called Dreamland, which is like old songs as well.

1318
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,640
But it's also got like skits in the middle.

1319
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:52,640
Ooh.

1320
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:57,640
And Mark Hamill is in it doing a voice that I would say he shouldn't be doing.

1321
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,640
Oh, no, no.

1322
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,640
So we'll see what we have time for.

1323
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,640
I still have a chunk at the end here.

1324
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:15,640
But let me do a little of Old Yellow Eyes is back that also has Jonathan Frakes, Michael Dorn and Patrick Stewart on it, which is, of course, the big boys.

1325
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:16,640
The boys are here.

1326
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,640
I don't know why LaVar's not on it.

1327
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:19,640
That feels wrong.

1328
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:24,640
That's his best friend in real life and on the show.

1329
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:27,640
More celebrity best friends to track.

1330
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,640
Best friends on the show.

1331
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,640
And then they seem to be best friends in real life.

1332
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:35,640
But I don't know why he's not on this.

1333
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:41,640
It's called It's a Sin to Tell a Lie.

1334
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,640
Be sure it's true.

1335
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:47,640
That's that boy singing in the background.

1336
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,640
Jason, does it do anything for you?

1337
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,640
I like this.

1338
01:03:50,640 --> 01:04:01,640
Have we finally gotten something you like on this episode?

1339
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:08,640
The spider sings the old ones.

1340
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:18,640
I'm playing because there's also something coming up that is worth listening to.

1341
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,640
It's a perfectly serviceable song.

1342
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,640
I don't even mean that to sound derogatory.

1343
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,640
You're like, oh, yeah, this guy.

1344
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,640
Good for him for going for it.

1345
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,640
I might take some of this fame.

1346
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:32,640
What is it for if not to do your own little project?

1347
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,640
Little standards.

1348
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:39,640
Like you'll be doing soon.

1349
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:53,640
Hello, baby, hello.

1350
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,640
Be sure it's true.

1351
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:01,640
When you say I love you, darling.

1352
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:10,640
Because you know it's a terrible sin to tell a lie.

1353
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,640
I wish he had known, though.

1354
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:16,640
Oh, so many hearts have been broken.

1355
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:17,640
Oh, you know what I should do?

1356
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:18,640
Hold on, let me cut him off here.

1357
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,640
Actually, now, again, I'm going to call this on the fly here.

1358
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:22,640
Enhance.

1359
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:27,640
There's a great, there is a funny, I don't know if you've ever seen this.

1360
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:32,640
He was they were doing like a birthday tribute to Gene Roddenberry before he had passed.

1361
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:33,640
Okay.

1362
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:34,640
And I don't know if you've ever seen this clip.

1363
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,640
Mr. Crusher set course for Starbase.

1364
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,640
He's on the set.

1365
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,640
He's in the uniform.

1366
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,640
Patrick Stewart, I'm talking about.

1367
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:43,640
Gene, you're adorable.

1368
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,640
B, you're so beautiful.

1369
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:46,640
Jason, have you ever seen this?

1370
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:51,640
C, you're a cutie full of charm.

1371
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,640
D, you're a darling.

1372
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,640
And E, you're exciting.

1373
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:56,640
This is just like a shot of for Gene.

1374
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:57,640
But what's the song?

1375
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,640
Oh, Jason, you tell me.

1376
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,640
G, you look good to me.

1377
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:02,640
Oh, he's got his hair.

1378
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,640
H, you're so heavenly.

1379
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,640
I, you're the one.

1380
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:06,640
Oh, he caught a cane.

1381
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,640
He's got a cane.

1382
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:08,640
Oh, he's got a bowder.

1383
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,640
He's got a straw bowder.

1384
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:10,640
He's got a cane.

1385
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,640
He's dancing like skipping off the bridge.

1386
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:13,640
A little bridge.

1387
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,640
L, is the love light in your eyes.

1388
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,640
M, N, O, P.

1389
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,640
He's going to slide down the rail.

1390
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,640
I could go on all day.

1391
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:33,640
Q, Q, R, S, T, alphabetically speaking, you're okay.

1392
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:35,640
You make my life complete.

1393
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,640
V means you're very sweet.

1394
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:41,640
Double V, X, Y, Z.

1395
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:45,640
It's fun to wander through the alphabet with you

1396
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:53,640
to tell you what you mean to engage.

1397
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:56,640
Jason, do you think we can get you doing this exact song

1398
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,640
in some context?

1399
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:01,640
I just wish there were more people on the bridge.

1400
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,640
Like, they should be looking at him, longing.

1401
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:06,640
Like, they should be bouncing a little.

1402
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,640
Yeah, it should be a number.

1403
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,640
It is very bare, isn't it?

1404
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,640
Very bare.

1405
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:11,640
It's like dead quiet.

1406
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:12,640
Yeah, yeah.

1407
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,640
Here's my question.

1408
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,640
If we're going to, if Jason's going to do this,

1409
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,640
who would Jason want to film a tribute,

1410
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:20,640
who would Jason want to sing that song to?

1411
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,640
And it can't be Jane.

1412
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,640
It can't be Jane.

1413
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:23,640
We got to take Jane out.

1414
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:24,640
It has to be.

1415
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,640
Whose birthday is it?

1416
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:26,640
Oh, wow.

1417
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,640
Sunny Eclipse?

1418
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,640
Oh, whose birthday is it?

1419
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,640
The Toppings Bar Innovation.

1420
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,640
The present you want is Jason singing that song.

1421
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,640
That song.

1422
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:38,640
The G.

1423
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,640
I think that you're okay.

1424
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:45,640
M is for Mike, and L is for like, and I like.

1425
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:46,640
Mike.

1426
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,640
Sure.

1427
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:48,640
That's what I want.

1428
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,640
That's my gift.

1429
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:53,640
I think I deserve it, quite frankly.

1430
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:54,640
I'll say that I've tried to,

1431
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:55,640
I've tried to say, Scott,

1432
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,640
that there's some Star Trek next gen that you would like.

1433
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,640
And that, even though that's not how the show is,

1434
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,640
it is also the energy of the show in a way.

1435
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,640
And when they do their little,

1436
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,640
their little like history side tracks.

1437
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:06,640
They go to the holodeck and they dress up

1438
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:07,640
like Robin Hood and stuff.

1439
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:08,640
Yeah.

1440
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,640
You get your like silly 80s, 90s.

1441
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,640
There's a little silliness to it.

1442
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:15,640
I think the Brent Spiner album, like that song,

1443
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:17,640
you can hear their smiling.

1444
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,640
He sings on the show too.

1445
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:20,640
I'm sure he does.

1446
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,640
As well.

1447
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:22,640
There's blue,

1448
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,640
he sings blue skies in one of the movies.

1449
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:25,640
And they sing,

1450
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,640
they all sing like a piece of like the HMS pinafore

1451
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:28,640
in one episode.

1452
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,640
Oh gosh.

1453
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:32,640
To jog data's memory,

1454
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:33,640
to get him to stop being evil,

1455
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:36,640
they sing old songs.

1456
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:37,640
Like that's the silliness.

1457
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,640
That's what we would have to do if Jason turned evil.

1458
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,640
Yeah.

1459
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:43,640
I am the very modern version.

1460
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:46,640
But that's Pirates of Penzance.

1461
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,640
Isn't that part of it?

1462
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,640
HMS Pinafore and Pirates of Penzance are different shows.

1463
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:52,640
Oh my God.

1464
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,640
Let's look into that.

1465
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:54,640
Let's make sure you're right about that.

1466
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,640
I do like very much.

1467
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,640
All right.

1468
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:58,640
I feel like, okay, I have to get a little of this.

1469
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,640
I'm going to not play.

1470
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:00,640
Well, all right.

1471
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,640
Can I use Samantha?

1472
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,640
No.

1473
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:04,640
No.

1474
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,640
Sit down.

1475
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,640
Sit down.

1476
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,640
It's his birthday.

1477
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,640
Sit down.

1478
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:12,640
So all right.

1479
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:13,640
Let's end part one here.

1480
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,640
And I wanted to end strong with something

1481
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:17,640
I think we can all agree on.

1482
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,640
Cast members of Batman 66.

1483
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:20,640
Great.

1484
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:21,640
Great.

1485
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,640
Again, I don't know if you guys have heard any of these.

1486
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:24,640
I might know some of this.

1487
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:25,640
Let's see.

1488
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,640
Yeah.

1489
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:27,640
So there's a couple things.

1490
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,640
There's a couple different things here that I like.

1491
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:30,640
Some of which was not recorded,

1492
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:34,640
but I think is maybe worth just playing little snippets of it.

1493
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,640
But it's funny because they did this,

1494
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,640
and I know I don't have everything,

1495
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,640
but they definitely were like, oh, this is a big hit.

1496
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:41,640
Big hit show.

1497
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,640
Let's spin off singing careers for many of the people.

1498
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:49,640
Some of the villains, I feel like, had musical theater careers.

1499
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,640
Absolutely.

1500
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,640
Absolutely.

1501
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,640
And I don't have all of it here.

1502
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:57,640
For now, I've left out the Burgess Meredith stuff.

1503
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,640
But I can't picture.

1504
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:00,640
Yeah.

1505
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,640
But it seems like they wanted to do singles

1506
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:08,640
that would reference Batman in a way,

1507
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,640
either really directly or a little bit directly.

1508
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,640
OK.

1509
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:13,640
OK.

1510
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:17,640
And then on the B side, you'd give a more straightforward song

1511
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,640
as sort of like a backdoor pilot to a career.

1512
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:21,640
Yeah.

1513
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:22,640
That's the way I read it.

1514
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:27,640
But so like, for instance, Frank Gorshin, who played the Riddler,

1515
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,640
who I feel like, you know, maybe doesn't even get his props

1516
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:34,640
for defining like how villains act in a lot of ways.

1517
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,640
Yeah.

1518
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:36,640
Like is the guy who kind of starts out,

1519
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,640
and everybody's sort of been doing an impression maybe

1520
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,640
of how he played the Riddler on Batman.

1521
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:42,640
And I am realizing.

1522
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,640
Yeah, that's the most consistent in a way that like nobody,

1523
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:48,640
you know, Jim Carrey just kind of like took it to space.

1524
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:49,640
Yes.

1525
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:53,640
So Frank Gorshin did this on a variety show,

1526
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,640
but also they released it as an album.

1527
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:56,640
And I don't know if you've seen this,

1528
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,640
or I showed this to you years ago, Scott.

1529
01:10:58,640 --> 01:10:59,640
I don't know.

1530
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:00,640
Jason, I probably showed this to you.

1531
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,640
He had a song just called The Riddler.

1532
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:03,640
Yeah.

1533
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,640
This was not subtle.

1534
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,640
They knew what this was.

1535
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:10,640
And the cover is fantastic.

1536
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,640
It's just him with the mask and the gloves and the outfit on.

1537
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,640
Not the suit, the full like body suit.

1538
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,640
It's like a Herb Albert album cover, but just, you know,

1539
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,640
basic good portrait.

1540
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:22,640
Riddle me this.

1541
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,640
What do you call a sleeping bull?

1542
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,640
Answer.

1543
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,640
A bulldozer.

1544
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:36,640
Riddle me this.

1545
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,640
What, tell me, what, tell me, what's the difference

1546
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:41,640
between an elephant and the fleas?

1547
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,640
Gee, we would sure like to know the difference

1548
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,640
between an elephant and a flea.

1549
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,640
Well, an elephant can have fleas,

1550
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:53,640
but a flea can't have elephants.

1551
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:56,640
Hey, can you tell us the home of the Riddler?

1552
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,640
It's the home of the Riddler.

1553
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:00,640
The Riddler.

1554
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,640
You know, it feels like Nancy Sinatra

1555
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,640
or like some, any of the cooler versions.

1556
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:08,640
I feel like I've walked into multiple of your apartment.

1557
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,920
apartment, multiple apartments you lived in

1558
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:13,120
and you're playing this, and we're like,

1559
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,400
hey, can I play you some?

1560
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,160
That feels right.

1561
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,360
So yeah, that's fun.

1562
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:21,440
And then there was a B-side that has nothing to do

1563
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,040
with the Riddler.

1564
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:26,120
So, and here I'll show you this cover.

1565
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,640
This is Frank, casual.

1566
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,440
He's got the cigarette.

1567
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:33,440
He's got sort of the, whatever, sport jacket on.

1568
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,280
Handsome, cool.

1569
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:36,220
Handsome, cool guy.

1570
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,060
Frank Ocean on that Sullivan show

1571
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:41,020
when the Beatles were on, I believe, same episode.

1572
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:42,420
Really?

1573
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,580
And this is, yes, and it like,

1574
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:47,420
let's see if we can sneak in a real song

1575
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:48,260
and see if it works.

1576
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:49,900
And I guess it didn't, it didn't work.

1577
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:52,700
But I feel like it's a pretty good song.

1578
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:56,540
["Ridin' by David Gaetz & Redd"]

1579
01:12:57,980 --> 01:12:58,980
Pretty legit.

1580
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:02,500
Written by David Gaetz and Redd.

1581
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:03,980
Oh.

1582
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:11,260
["Ridin' by David Gaetz & Redd"]

1583
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:15,060
This is not the Riddler song, this is Frank.

1584
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:15,900
It's okay.

1585
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:18,820
I'm gonna say it's great.

1586
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:22,820
["Ridin' by David Gaetz & Redd"]

1587
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:29,140
That's Scott Walker.

1588
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:36,500
["Ridin' by David Gaetz & Redd"]

1589
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:43,340
That's where you like, you put this on

1590
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:45,820
and you're paired for a little make-up sesh.

1591
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:46,660
Yeah.

1592
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:48,180
And it's like going, okay, once then the music starts

1593
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:49,540
and then you're deep into the vocals

1594
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:51,540
and then she kind of starts getting a little shifty

1595
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:52,900
and like, what is it?

1596
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,820
And then looks over your shoulder,

1597
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:57,540
goes past you like, sorry, do you have an album,

1598
01:13:57,540 --> 01:14:00,420
did you just put on an album by the Riddler?

1599
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:05,420
Oh, sorry, I thought I turned the album cover around.

1600
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:07,380
No, you had it on Riddler's side.

1601
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:09,020
I had it on Riddler's side.

1602
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:10,900
You're describing something that would have happened

1603
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:12,940
to us in the early, early 20s.

1604
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:18,420
Your idea of make-out music is Frank Gorshin.

1605
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:20,700
First of all, I don't know who that is.

1606
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:22,820
I saw the word Riddler, which I remember

1607
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:23,660
has something to do with Batman.

1608
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:24,780
You remember Batman the F-

1609
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:27,140
Yeah, I do, I don't, I didn't know the name of the guy.

1610
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:29,220
Jim Garry plays the character in the movie.

1611
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:30,500
My favorite movie.

1612
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:31,860
Jim Garry, yeah.

1613
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:34,620
The Riddler song reminds me of one of my favorite

1614
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:39,300
old TV clips, which is Tennessee Ernie Ford,

1615
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:41,540
who sang the song 16 Tons.

1616
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:43,660
He is on like a variety show and he's like,

1617
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:46,260
and you know, I thought this new music

1618
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:48,780
the kids are listening to, it's so great.

1619
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:51,660
And I thought I'd just, you know,

1620
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:53,660
gussy up a classic or whatever.

1621
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:55,660
And he just does 16 Tons,

1622
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:58,020
but there is like a go-go backing track

1623
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:01,060
and go-go dancers, but he's just going,

1624
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:04,540
oh, I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine.

1625
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:06,020
Well, we'll listen to that on your birthday.

1626
01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:07,900
Yeah, oh, cool.

1627
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,460
Tennessee Jason Sheridan.

1628
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:13,540
Pickled up my accent, I walked to the mine.

1629
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:18,100
Let's real brief, Burt Ward, who played Robin,

1630
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:20,700
a song written and produced by Frank Zappa.

1631
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:21,660
Have you heard this?

1632
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:23,020
Yeah, this I have heard.

1633
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:26,900
Frank Zappa before, right before.

1634
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:27,980
And he's still like, you know,

1635
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:29,940
he looked like a square still.

1636
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:33,020
So he could, you know, he could fit in with the normies.

1637
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:33,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1638
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:36,140
But what a weird, weird crossover.

1639
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:37,220
Weird crossover.

1640
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:38,980
And it says Burt Ward on the cover

1641
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:40,940
of the Boy Wonder Sessions,

1642
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:42,300
says produced by Frank Zappa.

1643
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:43,140
Oh, it's going to taste good.

1644
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:45,540
Boy Wonder, I love you.

1645
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:46,580
Oh, Boy Wonder, I love you.

1646
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:50,100
Boy Wonder, I love you.

1647
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:55,700
Hi, kids, it's me, your pal, the Boy Wonder.

1648
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:02,340
Taking this opportunity to catch up on my fan mail.

1649
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:05,460
Even as a boy wonder,

1650
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:08,660
it's really hard to read all the tons of mail I get.

1651
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:14,700
Here is a happy letter from someone just about your age.

1652
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:19,220
Dear cute, wonderful, fabulous, magnificent,

1653
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:21,500
exquisite boy wonder.

1654
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,820
A cold chill runs up my spine

1655
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:26,700
every time I see you sock a villain.

1656
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:30,100
And oh, how I cry when you're even scratching.

1657
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:33,660
Please don't send me a mimeograph copy

1658
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:36,060
of interesting facts about you.

1659
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:37,940
I want your handwriting.

1660
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:42,260
I have a whole wall of my room dedicated to you.

1661
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:46,500
Oh, Boy Wonder, I'm making a gum wrapper chain

1662
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:49,020
to symbolize my love for you.

1663
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:53,020
It's going to be as long as I am tall.

1664
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:56,020
I'm fighting for 10 inches in stocking feet.

1665
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:59,020
As long as I am tall, hick.

1666
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:04,020
Please come next Saturday and sleep for a week or two.

1667
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:07,020
I will feed you breakfast and bed.

1668
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:09,020
I will make your bed for you.

1669
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:11,780
I will make your bed for you.

1670
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:13,780
And I like you so much,

1671
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:16,780
but I want you to spend the whole summer with me.

1672
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:19,780
It's like misery.

1673
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:20,780
This is a girl's life.

1674
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:21,780
It's like Stan.

1675
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:22,780
Yeah, yeah.

1676
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:24,780
It's the original, so it's letters.

1677
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:25,780
You got the indifference.

1678
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:26,780
Yeah.

1679
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:29,780
Dear Boy Wonder is the original Stan.

1680
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:36,780
What's the fan club sketch on SNL about?

1681
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:37,780
Brock Toon?

1682
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:39,540
Oh, the Mr. Belvedere fan club.

1683
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:41,540
I do want to cook Mr. Belvedere a nice meal.

1684
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:44,540
I do not want to keep in a giant glass jar in my basin.

1685
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:48,540
He keeps saying Boy Wonder, which is funny.

1686
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:49,540
And so I feel like he clocked it.

1687
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,540
That's a funny way to describe Robin.

1688
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:53,540
I was thinking it's almost like they didn't.

1689
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:55,540
This is like a Super Bowl big game thing.

1690
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:57,540
Could he not say Robin?

1691
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:58,540
That's also possible, yes,

1692
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:02,540
because this does not feel as official as the other releases.

1693
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:03,540
Yes.

1694
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:04,540
Hi, kids.

1695
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:08,300
He's doing it with this reel.

1696
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:11,300
I don't know if Burt Ward had the ability to be sexy sultry

1697
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:12,300
and maybe be worse if it was,

1698
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:15,300
but then it all has that gee whiz.

1699
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:18,300
I made a gum wrapper chain.

1700
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:23,300
It's too pipsqueak, you know?

1701
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:27,300
I think, I mean, I don't know how much range Burt had.

1702
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:29,300
I don't want to say he didn't have range,

1703
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:32,300
but I feel like almost he got Robin

1704
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:34,300
because maybe he had one thing he was good at,

1705
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:36,300
you know, very specific energy.

1706
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:39,300
Holy smokes, Batman.

1707
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:43,300
So I think Frank Wisely wrote to his strength here.

1708
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:46,300
Did he write the song?

1709
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:47,300
That's what it says.

1710
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:49,300
Maybe I have bad information.

1711
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,300
Because that's kind of, now if you think of it

1712
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:55,300
as like a weird parody of fandom,

1713
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:57,300
it's kind of brilliant.

1714
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:01,300
If that's all like kind of subtly,

1715
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:03,300
there's a subversiveness to it.

1716
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:05,300
Yeah, for sure you think so.

1717
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:07,300
It's like he's playing a joke on,

1718
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:10,300
I'm going to trap you in this, Burt Ward.

1719
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:11,300
He's the villain.

1720
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:13,300
I've seen couples, right.

1721
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:14,300
He's in the Zappa's lair.

1722
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:17,300
I've seen a couple sources say he wrote it as well.

1723
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:18,300
Whoa.

1724
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,300
And I think, yeah, let me see if I can just double.

1725
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:22,300
Yeah, I mean, there's a couple places that say he wrote it,

1726
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:23,300
so I assume that's right.

1727
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,300
Is it worth finishing the song in this case?

1728
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:26,300
There's only a little left.

1729
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:27,300
Yeah, let's do it.

1730
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:28,300
I remember this whole thing being funny.

1731
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:29,300
25 seconds left.

1732
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,300
Okay, oh, yeah, great.

1733
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,300
What was the last statement?

1734
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,300
Does the letter like sign off?

1735
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:53,300
What's the last thing said?

1736
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:02,300
I like you so much that I want you to spend the whole summer.

1737
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:05,300
Make your bed so tight you won't be able to leave it.

1738
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:08,300
I hope you know this is a girl writing.

1739
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:10,300
That's right.

1740
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:11,300
That's what I was going for.

1741
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,300
I hope you know this is a girl writing.

1742
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:16,300
I hope you know this is a girl writing.

1743
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:20,300
Yeah, it's a really.

1744
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:22,300
That was written by Frank Zappa.

1745
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:23,300
For Burt Ward.

1746
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,300
It's really weird.

1747
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:28,300
I mean, yeah, as a real speak singy.

1748
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:29,300
Song.

1749
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,300
Yeah, I would say so.

1750
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,300
It's mostly dialogue.

1751
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:39,300
It seems like kind of like a little prologue to Frank Zappa's weirder stuff to come.

1752
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:42,300
I would say certainly this is not the weirdest thing Frank Zappa would make.

1753
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:43,300
No.

1754
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:50,300
That is like, I was not suspicious about it not being a girl writing until that line.

1755
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:51,300
Right.

1756
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:52,300
Right, which I guess is me.

1757
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:54,300
Maybe it is, I don't know.

1758
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:57,300
Now I think it is a 75-year-old man.

1759
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:58,300
Not for sure.

1760
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:01,300
Oh, I better say I'm a girl or else start to think.

1761
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:06,300
I don't know what Frank was thinking necessarily when he was writing this, but it seems to be some sort of mediation.

1762
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:07,300
Kind of good.

1763
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:08,300
I feel like he took a job.

1764
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:15,300
Either he could have just turned in something as boring as the Scott Baio music or he's like, I'm going to get one.

1765
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,300
I'm going to do a little prank.

1766
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:17,300
It is funny.

1767
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:22,300
Like, not that the monkey's movie head is amazing or anything, but it is interesting.

1768
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:23,300
I admittedly struggle.

1769
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:26,300
I know it's interesting, but I struggle with that.

1770
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:27,300
That's what I'm getting at.

1771
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:36,300
Because like Jack Nicholson is in there and they're like, they like sneak some weird counterculture stuff in like some of the most popular pop entertainment for teenagers.

1772
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:37,300
Yeah.

1773
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:42,300
I watched that when I was stuck inside with COVID and I'm like, what the fuck is this?

1774
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:43,300
It's insane.

1775
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:44,300
Yeah.

1776
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:45,300
It'd be cooler to like it.

1777
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:48,300
I'd rather that I like it, but I have to be honest with myself.

1778
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:50,300
The soundtrack is good though.

1779
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:51,300
The music is good.

1780
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:52,300
Yes.

1781
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:53,300
I think.

1782
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:54,300
Is there a song called Porpoise?

1783
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,300
Porpoise.

1784
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:56,300
Yeah.

1785
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:57,300
Yeah.

1786
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:58,300
And they, I saw them do that.

1787
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:00,300
I saw Mike Nesma's last concert.

1788
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:01,300
Oh yeah.

1789
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:02,300
That seemed kind of grim.

1790
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:04,300
And it seemed like it was at the time.

1791
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:05,300
Yeah.

1792
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:06,300
Yeah.

1793
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:07,300
Okay.

1794
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:08,300
Is there a flip side to that song?

1795
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:09,300
I don't think.

1796
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:15,300
In my head there's, he does, he does something called, it's like orange colored sky.

1797
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:16,300
Well.

1798
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:19,300
He does kind of a sincere, am I confusing that with something else?

1799
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:20,300
Batman Sings Orange Colored Sky.

1800
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:21,300
Oh!

1801
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:22,300
That's what I'm thinking.

1802
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:23,300
On Hollywood Palace.

1803
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:24,300
Is that what you're thinking of?

1804
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:25,300
I don't know.

1805
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:26,300
Maybe.

1806
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:27,300
Or did Burt do that too?

1807
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:28,300
Do we know the flip side of.

1808
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:29,300
Interesting.

1809
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:30,300
Boy Wonder, I Love You.

1810
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:31,300
Oh, he does.

1811
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:32,300
You're right.

1812
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:33,300
You're right.

1813
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:34,300
You're right.

1814
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:35,300
I remember there being kind of a bizarre, like.

1815
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:36,300
Yes, here it is.

1816
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:37,300
More of a standard song, but he can't handle it at all singing this.

1817
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:38,300
Here it is.

1818
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:39,300
Yes.

1819
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:40,300
Well, that's so weird that Adam doesn't.

1820
01:22:40,300 --> 01:23:01,660
I was walking alone, like in my business, out of that orange colored sky.

1821
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:02,660
That is really unpleasant.

1822
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:28,100
Well, I was going to say orange colored sky.

1823
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:31,740
Did they play this at a memorial for Tony Scott?

1824
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:35,660
But that dude is so, it's kind of a trademark in some of his 80's movies.

1825
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:39,860
You mean Tony Scott had an orange colored sky in a lot of his L.A. set.

1826
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:43,500
We'll look into songs that were played at celebrities' funerals.

1827
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,500
That'll be another, that'll be your episode.

1828
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:46,500
Oh boy.

1829
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:47,500
For your birthday.

1830
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:50,700
So that's a good transition to Adam West doing this same song.

1831
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:51,700
Whoa!

1832
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:52,700
In 1966.

1833
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:53,700
I didn't know that.

1834
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:55,700
On Hollywood Palace in full costume.

1835
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:56,700
Whoa, yes!

1836
01:23:56,700 --> 01:24:01,700
Here is your host, the famous star of television's most talked about show, Batman.

1837
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:02,700
Adam West!

1838
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:03,700
Great Adam West.

1839
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:04,700
And it's a big number with the playing out to the Batman theme.

1840
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:05,700
Shit!

1841
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:06,700
People are sliding, ladies are sliding down poles as if they were headed to the Batcave.

1842
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:07,700
Adam West couldn't fool off right now.

1843
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:08,700
You know what I'm saying?

1844
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:09,700
You know what I'm saying?

1845
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:10,700
You know what I'm saying?

1846
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:11,700
You know what I'm saying?

1847
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:12,700
You know what I'm saying?

1848
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:35,700
Have you seen any unusual looking people around here?

1849
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:56,700
I was walking along, minding my business, went out, of an orange colored sky, swam,

1850
01:24:56,700 --> 01:25:02,700
bam, zow in the land, more evil crooks came by.

1851
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:10,700
I was singing a song, raping in sunshine, acting as good as could be.

1852
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:17,700
Crunch, plop, crack, and plop, they threw their curves at me.

1853
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:24,700
Somebody yelled, hey Batman, what are you waiting for?

1854
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:28,700
With a zap and a crack, I began my attack.

1855
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:31,700
After that, they were lapped on the floor.

1856
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:38,700
So I'm walking along, carefully watching, in case they could make another try.

1857
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:45,700
Zonk, pow, here they are now, out of an orange colored sky.

1858
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:48,700
Sitting in the audience, this is a real theater audience.

1859
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:49,700
They're kind of quiet so you can see it.

1860
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:53,700
I'm in a nice, them dressed nice, I'm in a suit and I'm watching this.

1861
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:56,700
Christian Bale should have done this.

1862
01:25:56,700 --> 01:26:01,700
Get Pattinson, get Pattinson doing now, I feel like he's got a sensation.

1863
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:02,700
Absolutely.

1864
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:06,700
Yeah, so we're in the West territory here, we're in the home stretch of what we got.

1865
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:09,700
Adam West had a single, I don't know if you've heard this.

1866
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:13,700
Adam West, Miranda, with the B-side, you only see her.

1867
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:17,700
And again, Batman is on the cover just in case you forgot who this guy was.

1868
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:21,700
So you have to know that this is Batman as well as Adam West.

1869
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:23,700
And this is called Miranda.

1870
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:32,700
Will tonight be the night that Bruce reveals himself to the magnificent Miranda?

1871
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:33,700
What?

1872
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:34,700
Zonk, pow.

1873
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:39,700
I've never met a girl like you before, Miranda.

1874
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:41,700
Miranda.

1875
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:46,700
And I'd do anything for you if you'd just ask.

1876
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,700
Miranda.

1877
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:51,700
Ask me to do anything for you, Miranda.

1878
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:56,700
This is always meant to be a sweet, silly grandpa is what he ended up as.

1879
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:58,700
He was that at this age.

1880
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:00,700
Don't ask him to remove his mask.

1881
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:02,700
It's against the code of heroes.

1882
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:05,700
That cover looks like they're going to do a duet.

1883
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:11,700
What are you doing here?

1884
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:13,700
Bruce, come right away.

1885
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:14,700
There's a job to be done.

1886
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:17,700
A giant octopus has run amuck in Washington.

1887
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:18,700
My Lord.

1888
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,700
Boy, genius, this is one time you'll see.

1889
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:22,700
Boy, genius.

1890
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,700
Like a big game situation.

1891
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:27,700
An octopus isn't the kind of thing that happened on Batman.

1892
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:28,700
Right.

1893
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:29,700
Miranda.

1894
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:32,700
Or someone powerful as me.

1895
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:39,700
So again, it feels like they're not going to say the name specifically to try to get around some sort of thing.

1896
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:40,700
Copyright avoiding.

1897
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:42,700
I love him so much.

1898
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:43,700
Yes.

1899
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:48,700
Oh, I mean, my love for Adam West grows daily to this day.

1900
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:49,700
Yep.

1901
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:55,700
He's also, other than maybe Michelangelo, I think I have the most Adam West toys of any character.

1902
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:58,700
That's the most representations of a human in your hand.

1903
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:00,700
At least 10, I think.

1904
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:01,700
Wow.

1905
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:02,700
Adam West.

1906
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:04,700
And I don't have the family guy.

1907
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:06,700
I was going to ask, is there a family guy?

1908
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:07,700
Did they do a Simpsons one?

1909
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:08,700
Yes.

1910
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:09,700
Oh, yeah.

1911
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:10,700
Wow.

1912
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:11,700
That's my prize.

1913
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:12,700
Yeah.

1914
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:13,700
Wow.

1915
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:14,700
That was NECA made that like 10 years ago.

1916
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:15,700
Geez.

1917
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:16,700
Okay.

1918
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:17,700
Let's just go real quick beside.

1919
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:19,700
And here's what caught my eye.

1920
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:22,700
And I don't think I've ever told this story on the show before.

1921
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:28,700
Adam West's non-Batman part of the single was called You Only See Her.

1922
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:39,700
And it's arranged and conducted by Stu Phillips, a man whose 50th anniversary wedding party I videotaped and edited in his house next to him.

1923
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:42,700
Stu Phillips wrote the theme to Knight Rider.

1924
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:43,700
What?

1925
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:44,700
Whoa.

1926
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:46,700
He worked on The Monkeys, composed like The Monkeys.

1927
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:50,700
And just you look at the IMDB, it's nuts of how much TV and stuff he did.

1928
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:55,700
I was called one day and was like, do you want to videotape Stu Phillips's anniversary party?

1929
01:28:55,700 --> 01:28:57,700
Which was somewhere I think in Beverly Hills.

1930
01:28:57,700 --> 01:29:01,700
And so I like videotaped this with a family friend named Gary.

1931
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:04,700
And then it was like, well, he needs somebody to edit it.

1932
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:06,700
And I go, yeah, okay.

1933
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:12,700
So I went to his house for a few weeks, which was sort of off.

1934
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:14,700
You edited it there?

1935
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,700
I edited it sitting next to him.

1936
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:18,700
Whoa.

1937
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:20,700
And in his house.

1938
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:23,700
And he was very nice.

1939
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:27,700
And I only say this, and I have a copy of his book and he signed it to me.

1940
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:30,700
And I only say this just because I don't think he's right.

1941
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:35,700
He kept telling me that I was the best editor he ever worked with.

1942
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:37,700
And I was like, that cannot be true.

1943
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:39,700
I didn't say it to him, but I was like, oh, thank you, whatever.

1944
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:42,700
And he kept being like, you're so quick when you edit.

1945
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:44,700
And I'm like, yeah, I guess.

1946
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:45,700
Is this a digital thing?

1947
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:48,700
Just by virtue, sheer virtue of digital?

1948
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:49,700
I guess, yeah, right.

1949
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:52,700
I was like, I wonder if he just hasn't worked with an editor forever.

1950
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:54,700
He doesn't know what Final Cut can do.

1951
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:58,700
And he wasn't like, he's still around, but he was an old guy.

1952
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:00,700
But he wasn't like, I was like, oh, no, he's slipping away.

1953
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:02,700
He was with it and everything.

1954
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:04,700
But he kept saying, and I think he wrote it in the book.

1955
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:05,700
I should go, actually, you know what?

1956
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:06,700
I should have brought the book.

1957
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:07,700
Shoot.

1958
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:08,700
I'll do it.

1959
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:10,700
And he will post what he wrote to me in the book.

1960
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:12,700
I was like, one of the best editors I've ever worked with.

1961
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:17,700
And then he said, my son-in-law works for the NFL network.

1962
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:20,700
Do you want a job editing with the NFL network?

1963
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:23,700
And I said, no.

1964
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:25,700
I don't want to be an editor.

1965
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:30,700
I quickly learned that, yes, you were very fast at editing video

1966
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:33,700
because you usually didn't want to be doing it.

1967
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:35,700
Oh, it's to get it off your plate.

1968
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:39,700
I mean, I would go on to edit for a few more years here and there,

1969
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:43,700
but I would try to figure out ways to get it done in four hours

1970
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:48,700
and go over to UCB and go to Bird's and drink and see improv or do improv.

1971
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:52,700
I remember leaving Culver City for my editing job, not done,

1972
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:56,700
going to do an improv show at like 10 p.m. or 9 p.m.

1973
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:59,700
and then driving, like that's in Hollywood, driving back to Culver City

1974
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:02,700
and then finishing at like 4 a.m. or something.

1975
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:06,700
Like the weird, stupid stuff that was not worth it.

1976
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:10,700
So anyway, he, Stu, arranged and conducted this.

1977
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:13,700
You Only See Her by Adam West.

1978
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:16,700
Look at this guy. But yeah, look, his credits are nuts.

1979
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:17,700
Yeah, geez.

1980
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:30,700
Jason looks like he's being taken away.

1981
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:37,700
The day is almost through.

1982
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:47,700
What was the last time that you noticed that her eyes were blue?

1983
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:50,700
It's so weird, that beat and then the snaps.

1984
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:51,700
Yeah.

1985
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:52,700
It's unsettling.

1986
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:55,700
Have you forgotten?

1987
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:56,700
It's kind of drunken.

1988
01:31:56,700 --> 01:32:02,700
Laurie, I was going to say, I have a bottle of Seagram 7 whiskey,

1989
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:04,700
seven grand whiskey in it.

1990
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:07,700
This was recorded, just the recorded line down.

1991
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:08,700
Yeah.

1992
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:14,700
Sounds like Barney.

1993
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:18,700
I mean, that's the gist of it.

1994
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:22,700
So yeah, they did kind of ballads for Gorshin and for West here.

1995
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:23,700
Wow.

1996
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:27,700
This formula that they kept, like, let's sneak in kind of a real one.

1997
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:28,700
Right, right.

1998
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:29,700
Wow.

1999
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:33,700
You know, I do wish that I could give him more credit as just a great,

2000
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:34,700
sincere singer.

2001
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:36,700
Maybe that's not one of the top tools in his arsenal,

2002
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:39,700
but I think he figured out what he was good at.

2003
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:40,700
Yes.

2004
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:42,700
Did it better than anybody.

2005
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:45,700
Yeah. And you wanted Miranda is a little more jaunty and you don't have to

2006
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:50,700
maybe be as good of a singer for that type of music.

2007
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:54,700
I think that, look, I didn't even touch Shatner on this episode.

2008
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:55,700
Oh, yeah.

2009
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:59,700
He's made 20 plus albums and I feel like that's, it's somewhat well-worn territory.

2010
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:02,700
I would want to really dig in and find the obscure ones there.

2011
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:06,700
Some of it's because, I mean, of course I love Tambourine Man and like the,

2012
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:10,700
I think it's going to be a long, long, but it's sort of done a little.

2013
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:12,700
There's got to be more.

2014
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:13,700
There's so much.

2015
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:16,700
I mean, there's like Shatner claws and like there's new Christmas.

2016
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:19,700
He's made multiple Christmas albums.

2017
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:22,700
Has been the Ben Folds one, which I do really like.

2018
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:24,700
I think there's a lot of good stuff on has been.

2019
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:25,700
Yeah.

2020
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:27,700
I remember when that came out.

2021
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:28,700
And it's interesting.

2022
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:32,700
And he, Ben, I feel like you figured out exactly what to do with him.

2023
01:33:32,700 --> 01:33:33,700
Yeah.

2024
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:36,700
And I feel like nobody got to now, but nobody got to do that with an Adam West album.

2025
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:40,700
Another one where it was before the full has been album and it was just that

2026
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:43,700
where it was that would, there was like a monologue through it,

2027
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:45,700
like what we've listened to now.

2028
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:47,700
I forget the name of this, but there's that song.

2029
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:52,700
There's a monologue of this like an awful man confessing how he ruined the relationship.

2030
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:54,700
And they did it live on Conan.

2031
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:55,700
Yes, yes.

2032
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:59,700
And he said, it's kind of cool on the album, but live, he just does it full Shatner.

2033
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:01,700
And he says, it builds his story.

2034
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:03,700
And he says, you say, I can't commit.

2035
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:04,700
You're right.

2036
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:05,700
I can't commit to you.

2037
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:06,700
To you.

2038
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:07,700
And the audience laughs.

2039
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:11,700
They laugh during a completely sincere, because what else are you supposed to do?

2040
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:14,700
It's William Shatner yelling, I can't commit to you.

2041
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:15,700
Yes, it is.

2042
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:16,700
And I like that song.

2043
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:17,700
Yeah.

2044
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:18,700
It's really good.

2045
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:24,700
And it's really like, but yes, he, I, there's a live on Len, a live on tonight show performance

2046
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:27,700
of him doing common people with Joe Jackson.

2047
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:30,700
It's like, it's kind of a cool version of it.

2048
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:31,700
Yeah.

2049
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:36,700
And he is definitely, he's not on time to do whatever common people do.

2050
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:37,700
He is not.

2051
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:40,700
He is off with the band and that performance and he's doing his best.

2052
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:41,700
He's trying to catch up.

2053
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:44,700
He's never really has the rhythm to perform live.

2054
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:46,700
But yeah, that album, I think is cool.

2055
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:49,700
And I've listened to it not long ago and I was like, this is still pretty good.

2056
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:50,700
This is kind of interesting.

2057
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:57,700
As obvious and referenced as it seems, the Shatner rocket man is, I feel like once a

2058
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:00,700
year I go back and like, I just can't believe it's real.

2059
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:05,700
I can't believe it's so, how did they get, how did they possibly land on, then he's going

2060
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:09,700
to split into three and the third is going to be a party guy with a loose tie.

2061
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:10,700
It's so good.

2062
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:12,700
Go to be a long, long time.

2063
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:14,700
It's, it's bonkers.

2064
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:15,700
It's so good.

2065
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:16,700
And yeah.

2066
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:17,700
And that one almost, yeah.

2067
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:20,700
When you watch it, you go, oh, this holds a better even than sort of like people joking

2068
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:22,700
about it or the hacky Shatner impressions.

2069
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:26,700
Can you imagine the era where like there wasn't YouTube and you just had to know someone with

2070
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:30,700
a tape of the sci-fi award show to have seen that?

2071
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:31,700
Yeah.

2072
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:32,700
A big tape or something.

2073
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:33,700
That's a TV station.

2074
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:34,700
Yeah.

2075
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:35,700
Yeah.

2076
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:36,700
Yeah.

2077
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:37,700
Yeah.

2078
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:38,700
Yeah.

2079
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:40,700
And by the way, he didn't even put in Nimoy.

2080
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:42,700
There's multiple Nimoy albums.

2081
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:43,700
Yeah.

2082
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:45,700
Is that, no, Shatner is transformed man, right?

2083
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:47,700
What Nimoy is Nimoy does.

2084
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:48,700
Bilbo Baggins.

2085
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:49,700
Oh, right.

2086
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:50,700
Bilbo.

2087
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:51,700
And if I had a hammer.

2088
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:52,700
If I had a hammer.

2089
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:53,700
I do have a hammer.

2090
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:54,700
The hammer of justice.

2091
01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:59,700
He also does one of the best Rainey Newman songs on a different album that I didn't know

2092
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:00,700
existed until last night.

2093
01:36:00,700 --> 01:36:05,700
I think it's going to rain today, which is one of the saddest songs ever written.

2094
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:08,700
And his version is not as sad, but it's all right.

2095
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:11,700
We didn't even touch on that.

2096
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:12,700
I want to say something in general.

2097
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:13,700
Yeah.

2098
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:18,700
I think that when that era, like records, records are new and we just need shit on records.

2099
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:19,700
Fill them up.

2100
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:20,700
It can be crazy.

2101
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:21,700
It could be novelty.

2102
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:22,700
It could be weird.

2103
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:23,700
There's a reason why I love all that.

2104
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:26,700
And then I love the VHS era where like, doesn't matter.

2105
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:28,700
Any crap can be on VHS.

2106
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:31,700
We're still every day finding new wonders of the VHS era.

2107
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:32,700
I know.

2108
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:39,700
And I think it's horrible that the streaming era is like infinite and should provide endless

2109
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:40,700
funny crap.

2110
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:42,700
And instead it's all bore.

2111
01:36:42,700 --> 01:36:47,700
It's like, and we're like seeing now, now it's scaling back and it's only going to become

2112
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:49,700
more predictable and more safe.

2113
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:55,700
I wish that streaming at any of the vigor of crazy old record era or crazy old VHS era.

2114
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:56,700
That's a great, great point.

2115
01:36:56,700 --> 01:37:01,700
And the closest like I can even find to stuff like that now is just niche YouTube.

2116
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:02,700
That's really where it lives.

2117
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:06,700
But it's the bummer is you get like, you can't, people can't make money doing it.

2118
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:10,700
You just have to be like, I sort of, I guess people make money on YouTube, but like, but

2119
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:11,700
I missed it.

2120
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:13,700
Like Leonard Nimoy, you're making an album.

2121
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:14,700
Why I don't sing.

2122
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:15,700
Who cares?

2123
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:16,700
I don't know.

2124
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:17,700
Or get Zappa in there.

2125
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:23,700
Like these things, these like made at gunpoint albums that we're still just picking apart

2126
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:24,700
for decades.

2127
01:37:24,700 --> 01:37:25,700
You get your renters.

2128
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:27,700
You do get here and there.

2129
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:30,700
Just requires the initiative of somebody to anyone.

2130
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:31,700
All of us could make an album.

2131
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:33,700
We can make Jason sings the old ones tomorrow.

2132
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:35,700
Should we make it tomorrow?

2133
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:36,700
Yes.

2134
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:38,700
You got plans tomorrow?

2135
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:39,700
Tomorrow we're doing it.

2136
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:41,700
So yeah, we have plumber coming into handyman.

2137
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:42,700
All right.

2138
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:43,700
Well, let's write a song about that.

2139
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:44,700
Yeah.

2140
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:47,700
You can use the plumber of the banging of the wrenches as the percussion.

2141
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:49,700
We can do it.

2142
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:52,700
Plumber woes.

2143
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:54,700
Yeah.

2144
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:56,700
I just, I like with Adam West.

2145
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:57,700
I just, I do.

2146
01:37:57,700 --> 01:37:58,700
I'm just regret.

2147
01:37:58,700 --> 01:38:02,700
I wished Shatner treatment got put on West more.

2148
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:07,700
I don't think West fully got is enough chances like Shatner did and Shatner's made a ton

2149
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:12,700
of crap, but is in enough stuff that I think people really like.

2150
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:18,700
And it's got really got to show that he's funny and interesting on multiple shows and

2151
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:19,700
movies.

2152
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:22,700
And Adam did not get the chance, which bumps me out though.

2153
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:23,700
There's a timing.

2154
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:24,700
There's a lot out there.

2155
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:27,700
And you got to give it, you know, honestly, family guy at this point, it became like such

2156
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:29,700
a big part of the lineage.

2157
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:30,700
Really funny.

2158
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:31,700
That rest.

2159
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:32,700
Yes.

2160
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:37,700
I've just been like, he didn't get his Boston legal where he got to be like a mainstream

2161
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:38,700
star.

2162
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:39,700
They sure.

2163
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:40,700
Yeah.

2164
01:38:40,700 --> 01:38:43,700
Maybe he was never meant to be like, and now a serious actor at him.

2165
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:44,700
Cause I love everything he did.

2166
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:48,700
I love like became the, like the post look well.

2167
01:38:48,700 --> 01:38:51,700
Deploying of him is so brilliant.

2168
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:52,700
Yeah.

2169
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:53,700
Why?

2170
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:54,700
Why?

2171
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:55,700
I just want more.

2172
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:56,700
That's all I'm saying.

2173
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:57,700
Yes.

2174
01:38:57,700 --> 01:38:58,700
I just wanted more.

2175
01:38:58,700 --> 01:38:59,700
Yeah.

2176
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:01,700
And then Shatner, some might argue too much.

2177
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:02,700
They got him too much.

2178
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:03,700
Yes.

2179
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:04,700
Yeah.

2180
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:05,700
And he's still going.

2181
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:06,700
God bless him.

2182
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:07,700
Yeah.

2183
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:10,700
But anyway, happy whatever birthday to me.

2184
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:11,700
Who knows?

2185
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:12,700
Whatever age I am.

2186
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:13,700
Who's keeping track?

2187
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:14,700
Who can track?

2188
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:15,700
I don't know.

2189
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:16,700
29 yet again.

2190
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:17,700
29.

2191
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:19,700
That's what I'll call myself.

2192
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:21,700
And then to play us out.

2193
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:24,700
Can I throw out something before you play us out?

2194
01:39:24,700 --> 01:39:25,700
Please.

2195
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:27,700
I will wish you a sincere happy birthday as well.

2196
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:29,700
Thanks for taking a very fun birthday shot.

2197
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:33,700
But because it, look, it might be a big one, it might be a big birthday.

2198
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:34,700
It might be.

2199
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:35,700
Yeah.

2200
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:36,700
And I don't think that we should celebrate with only this.

2201
01:39:36,700 --> 01:39:39,700
And this is, I've been saying this for a while and we aren't ready to do this yet, but I

2202
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:43,700
just want to like, there's a shot I want to call on your behalf.

2203
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:45,700
Something I've been wanting to do.

2204
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:47,700
We'll do this in Club 3 as soon as we can.

2205
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:49,700
There's other Club 3 plans.

2206
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:50,700
Right.

2207
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:54,700
But, you know, I'll say you survived podcast The Ride, Mike's birthday shot.

2208
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:55,700
Thanks for subscribing.

2209
01:39:55,700 --> 01:40:03,700
And if you want to go all the way to the VIP tier, Club 3, basically, if you don't know,

2210
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:04,700
audience picks the topics.

2211
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:05,700
There's these polls.

2212
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:11,700
And very frequently, something is suggested that becomes Mike's pick for the poll that

2213
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:12,700
month.

2214
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:14,700
This always has a very long title.

2215
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:19,700
It usually has like, the one that's in my head is like, Legends of the Superheroes Roast,

2216
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:20,700
1978.

2217
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:22,700
Adam West and Ed McMahon.

2218
01:40:22,700 --> 01:40:24,700
And there's so many details you can't even put them all in the poll.

2219
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:25,700
Right.

2220
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:26,700
What is this?

2221
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:29,700
So at some point when we feel like we're free and clear to do it, but at some point this

2222
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:35,700
year, I'm calling the shot of the Club 3 poll where all of the Mike last place finishers

2223
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:41,700
go up against each other and they finally, one will finally get their day in the sun.

2224
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:42,700
So that's coming.

2225
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:45,700
It won't necessarily be next month, but there's the list.

2226
01:40:45,700 --> 01:40:50,700
It says I've just enjoyed how much like, well, the length of that and the year of it, it

2227
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:52,700
can only be Mike.

2228
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:59,700
HR Puff and Stuff and Jabberjaw and Rip Taylor and Shields but not Yarnell.

2229
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:00,700
Don Knotts.

2230
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:01,700
Yep, yep, yep.

2231
01:41:01,700 --> 01:41:02,700
Don Knotts, yeah.

2232
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:03,700
That'd be one of those.

2233
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:05,700
There was a Don Knotts one in there.

2234
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:09,700
So we will set that up on your behalf in the next couple months.

2235
01:41:09,700 --> 01:41:11,700
But anyway, now to play us out.

2236
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:15,700
So yeah, to play us out and the reason I'm playing it out is just because it's the same

2237
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:20,700
song that Martin sings at the end of the pool episode on The Simpsons.

2238
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:22,700
Oh, what a stirring moment.

2239
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:24,700
Adam West singing.

2240
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:25,700
Really?

2241
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:26,700
Summer Wind.

2242
01:41:26,700 --> 01:41:27,700
Oh.

2243
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:35,700
Summer wind came blowing in from across the sea.

2244
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:37,700
He's not dressed as Batman.

2245
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:38,700
And he's not naked like Martin.

2246
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:40,700
Does he have a little abscott on?

2247
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:41,700
What was that shadow?

2248
01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:42,700
Of course.

2249
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:43,700
Handsome man.

2250
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:53,700
All summer long we sang a song and then we strode the golden sands.

2251
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:55,700
I feel like he sounds better on this.

2252
01:41:55,700 --> 01:41:56,700
Yeah, this is good.

2253
01:41:56,700 --> 01:42:03,700
Two sweethearts and a summer wind.

2254
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:05,700
Hell yeah, King.

2255
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:13,700
Like painted kites, the days and nights they went flying by.

2256
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:16,700
Any of our dads made an album.

2257
01:42:16,700 --> 01:42:23,700
The world was new, beneath a blue umbrella sky.

2258
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:33,700
And softer than a piper man, one day it called to you.

2259
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:41,700
I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind.

2260
01:42:41,700 --> 01:42:45,700
It really makes you reflect about life and whatever birthday it is you're celebrating.

2261
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:46,700
I know.

2262
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:48,700
I'm feeling wistful.

2263
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:50,700
He's probably 40 years old.

2264
01:42:50,700 --> 01:43:03,700
Still the days, the lonely days, they go on and on.

2265
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:05,700
And guess who sighs?

2266
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:06,700
Yeah, I like it.

2267
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:07,700
Okay.

2268
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:09,700
Through nights that never end.

2269
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:12,700
A little too modern for you.

2270
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:15,700
I think he's having a lot of fun.

2271
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:17,700
And I mean that sincerely.

2272
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:18,700
That's not as fun.

2273
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:23,700
The summer wind.

2274
01:43:23,700 --> 01:43:29,700
The summer wind.

2275
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:33,700
I'm sure he played the Batman interstitial music.

2276
01:43:33,700 --> 01:43:40,700
The summer wind.

2277
01:43:40,700 --> 01:43:42,700
Thank you.

2278
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:51,700
Thank you very much.

2279
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:54,700
So good.

2280
01:43:54,700 --> 01:43:58,700
I'm back to business.

2281
01:43:58,700 --> 01:43:59,700
Hello.

2282
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:01,700
Oh, it's you.

2283
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:04,700
It's the Riddler again.

2284
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:09,700
You want to tell about the next Hollywood Palace show, Riddler?

2285
01:44:09,700 --> 01:44:13,700
The hostess will be Miss America?

2286
01:44:13,700 --> 01:44:18,700
Oh, not Miss America, Mess America.

2287
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:23,700
Well, everyone knows who Mess America is.

2288
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:32,700
The hilarious Phyllis Diller.

2289
01:44:32,700 --> 01:44:42,700
Next week at this time, ABC will present one of the big specials of the season, Lerner and Lowe's Brigadoon.

2290
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:47,700
And two weeks from tonight, the Hollywood Palace with Phyllis Diller.

2291
01:44:47,700 --> 01:44:52,700
You know, I've met some wonderful people here tonight, including you.

2292
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:53,700
Thank you.

2293
01:44:53,700 --> 01:44:54,700
Good night.

2294
01:45:02,700 --> 01:45:04,700
Good night.
