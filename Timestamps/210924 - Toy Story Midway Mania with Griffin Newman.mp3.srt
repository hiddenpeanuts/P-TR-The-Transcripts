1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,640
Warning, the following podcast contains aggressive trash talk among competitive males, a talking

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,760
potato that's not afraid to go there, and host Mike Carlson being played by his identical

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,200
sounding brother, Jim Carlson.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,640
PTR accidental legend Griffin Newman returns to break place with us and talk Toy Story Midway

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:47,360
Today's podcast, The Ride.

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,240
Welcome to podcast The Ride where we're glad that Sarge reminds us he's not our mother

9
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,040
because otherwise we would not feel permission to break those plates.

10
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,040
I'm Scott Gardner.

11
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,200
Mike Carlson, I assume, is in agreement.

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,600
I am in agreement, yes.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,080
Saying that I am not your mother is so reassuring to me.

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,280
And if all the characters on any ride at Disneyland could just remind me of that before I enter

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,560
whatever world they have, it would really put me at ease.

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,520
You want everyone to say, I'm proud of you, but I'm not your mother.

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,400
Well, yeah, that's true.

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,880
I mean, if they could put all the things, all these comforting thoughts into one sentence,

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,960
one run on sentence, it would be really helpful for me.

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,520
What your dreams are meant to do.

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,720
Like, you'll get the right combo when you're sleeping sometime.

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,720
Mr. Potato Head's like, hey, you, I'm not your mother.

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,200
Oh, by the way, I'm proud of you.

24
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,600
Hey, hey, by the way, you'll book another commercial.

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,280
Don't worry, you'll work again.

26
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,720
That was the last recording Don Rickles ever did.

27
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,520
Yeah, Mike Carlson.

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,280
He didn't record more riffs for that, luckily.

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,400
Yeah.

30
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,200
OK, Jason Sheridan, hi.

31
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,720
Hi.

32
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,480
I'm mostly hoping that Potato Head calls me over, like gives me the Carson knot,

33
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,960
like calls me up, calls me over to the Carnival Barker platform.

34
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,200
To bark alongside him.

35
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,280
Or to just talk, like to just talk.

36
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,000
Like, yeah, even walking around all day, what are you been up to?

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,440
You know, like you've been doing a real good job covering the parks.

38
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,760
Like, I'm proud of you and I want you to come.

39
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,200
That's what you want someone to say.

40
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,680
You've been doing a good job covering the park.

41
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,600
Covering the parks.

42
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,960
I cover the parks.

43
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,560
I mean, I mean, covering your footprint, like not sorry, not covering them as a

44
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,080
media personality.

45
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,880
Walking around, I was trying to mix the metaphors.

46
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,480
We're both. Yeah.

47
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,880
And yeah, he calls me over because when Johnny would call people over,

48
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,680
they would just sort of like chit chat.

49
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,680
Yeah, they would evolve into guests at that.

50
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,240
You wanted to get casual.

51
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,200
Yeah, you wanted to get casual.

52
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,280
With Mr. Potato Head.

53
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,680
As it has gotten casual, let's not belabor it anymore.

54
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,160
Ladies and gentlemen, accidental PTR legend Griffin Newman.

55
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,240
Thank you very much.

56
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,920
So now I qualify it with the accidental.

57
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,360
I hope that kind of like that adds to the absolutely the luster in its own way.

58
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,880
I correct people if they say PTR legend, I go accidental PTR.

59
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,440
You are an accidental.

60
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,120
I'm already overflowing with takes.

61
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,680
And I you know, there's part of me that I I emailed you.

62
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,640
I said I'd like to do this ride. Yeah.

63
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,520
And then when I brought it up again months later, I said,

64
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,240
because you guys said you hate this ride and all three of you went like, what?

65
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,080
And I went like, I swear to God, there's an episode I heard where you said

66
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,120
and I perhaps overstated it, but where

67
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,120
Toy Story Mania was invoked, Midway Mania was invoked.

68
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,560
And then one of you said, what if we just never cover that ride?

69
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,360
And then the other two went like, yeah, that's fine with me.

70
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
We can just not do that one.

71
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,440
It sounds familiar.

72
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,920
And I think maybe I said what I want to say that it's me who said that,

73
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,520
but I don't remember why I would have.

74
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,920
And maybe it was an extremely dry joke or something.

75
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,960
Too dry.

76
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,800
I overstated it when I said, like, you guys said you'd never do.

77
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,400
It was just kind of this energy of just like, do we have to do everything?

78
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,840
Maybe that's when we just never do.

79
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,880
Like it was sort of this.

80
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,320
I really like this ride.

81
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,280
So I tried to rack my brain.

82
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,920
I know we can let's say officially we all love it.

83
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,600
Defending it.

84
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,040
And then the two of you, Mike and Scott, sort of going like,

85
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,040
we could just skip that.

86
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,400
And then that's why I felt the need to email and be like, balance the scales.

87
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,360
I would like to talk about this.

88
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,600
We were convincing enough that we didn't like it.

89
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,800
And whatever this was, please, somebody find this.

90
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,320
I cannot.

91
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,360
I'm sorry we bleeped it before, but we had to keep the mystery alive.

92
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,160
Now the mystery is solved.

93
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,600
So now I just want to triangulate a little bit for the Cliffords out there

94
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,480
who are trying to crack this and find the time code.

95
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:28,720
OK, I believe I emailed you about this maybe October, November, December of 2020.

96
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,800
The craziest months of that year.

97
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,520
Absolutely.

98
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,880
Maybe the most mentally unhinged in my book.

99
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,800
Absolutely.

100
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,760
I was losing my mind.

101
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,120
Yeah.

102
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,040
Now, I had gotten months behind on the show,

103
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,440
and that's when I sort of jumped on.

104
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,760
So I was like catching up to everything.

105
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,360
So it's not after that. We know.

106
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,040
This is the thing. It's like that helps.

107
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,560
I stopped listening to most things during the pandemic

108
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,920
because I didn't want to acknowledge the pandemic. Right.

109
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,080
And I feel like that when I was like, I'm like six months behind on PTR.

110
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,520
I got to get back into it.

111
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,760
So it was around the the the beginning of, I want to say, the remote records.

112
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,480
OK. Post-Papa Scotts, like that.

113
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,160
But that territory, like the early quarantine episode.

114
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,920
I love you tossing all these things off as if they're albums or or B sides or something.

115
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,640
Sure. I love this music to my ears.

116
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,080
Well, it's also it's very hard.

117
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,600
And it has I've caught up more, but I'm still not completely up to date.

118
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,920
I'm less months behind, but I've been like working to get up there.

119
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,480
You like so you were on it.

120
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,200
Yeah, yes.

121
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,640
You'll catch up to that one. Right.

122
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,560
I skipped that one. That's easier than it's like, oh, that's one less one to listen to.

123
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,400
Yeah, that's true. But I was I was there, too.

124
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,240
This dog was there.

125
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,080
Let's acknowledge the dog.

126
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,480
You might hear a dog throughout.

127
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,840
I think somebody walked by that.

128
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,400
I don't think you'll keep hearing the dog.

129
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,800
If you keep hearing the dog, maybe you don't hear the dog.

130
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,400
OK.

131
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,920
But it is interesting in a very depressing way to be like three months off of timeline

132
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,520
and hear how wildly things change in terms of our perception of the world in that period of time.

133
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,520
You know, that we were all so upset in October, November, and then a good thing happened.

134
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,520
The cool death, something more good things happen.

135
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,240
But that's the thing. Like, sometimes you'll listen to an episode and it'll be like one.

136
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,600
I have listened to an episode and it'll be like, and we're just in this forever.

137
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,880
And then I'm listening to it in March and I'm like, baby, we're in vaccine territory.

138
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,720
This thing's done. Put it in the rear view.

139
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,240
These guys freaking out.

140
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,640
Right. And then like three months later, I listened to an episode where you're like,

141
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,560
and now everything's good.

142
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,240
We're all vaccinated. Put it in the rear view.

143
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,440
And I was like, these fools don't know it's coming for them.

144
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,040
Another odd thing I've observed is that so many kind of.

145
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,920
PTR universe figures, if not regular subjects, but the types of people who get discussed,

146
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,960
the types of entertainment, entertainers and public figures who are often referenced by you three guys

147
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,640
died in 2020, like a disproportionate amount because listening to the way I stand,

148
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,600
share, all right, listen to episodes and I would be like, you went out so great.

149
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
I don't want to go out like him.

150
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,320
We don't want to go out like him.

151
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,840
But there were so many episodes I'd listened to where I was like, this is kind of a morbid run

152
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,440
to do on Regis this shortly after he died.

153
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,000
And then I'd be like, oh, they recorded this like six weeks before he died.

154
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,200
Ditto a lot of Bob Evans coming up right before he croaks.

155
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,120
Oh, we did. He was 20, 20.

156
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,760
There were a lot of 20, 20 people who you got back into and started either for one episode

157
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,480
or for a run of episodes, like doing riff runs on.

158
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,200
Now he's part of the Lexica.

159
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,520
What are you boy? What are you?

160
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,080
You found a layer to make us depressed about 2020.

161
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,280
Is it Frieden Roy?

162
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,560
We did so much. That's right.

163
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,560
Roy, Regis, Bob, Groden, Robbie Evans, Groden, Groden and her.

164
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,800
I'll remember some other ones.

165
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,040
This is though. And I said this on an episode.

166
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,840
A friend of the show, Andrew Grissom, we had made a comment or I had said something

167
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,600
when we were at Knott's Berry Farm a couple of months ago.

168
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,800
I go, it does seem like we're cursing people.

169
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,400
And he goes, well, you are also just all fascinated with people over the age

170
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,520
of 80. It's a big factor.

171
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,600
It's a big factor.

172
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,160
And I think another part of it is that all of those people feel like people where it's like,

173
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,720
I guess they'll just never die.

174
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,880
Sure. In your head, you're like they should have died like 10 years ago.

175
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,960
Right. And now they've crossed some threshold and do not seem to have been diminished

176
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,440
in any sort of way.

177
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,320
I guess maybe they just live forever.

178
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,640
Like you start to get cocky.

179
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,360
We'll do this to where like I did a like run about like Ed Asner.

180
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,440
And David was flipping out being like, don't talk about Ed Asner not dying

181
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,320
when this episode won't come out for two months.

182
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,200
And I was like, we're going to be fine. We're going to be fine.

183
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,160
And like, thankfully, it was that Asner death was like two months after that.

184
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,280
You barely.

185
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,960
But he's in that zone where I was like, Ed Asner, I guess he never dies.

186
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,200
I guess it's just always safe to bank up and Ed Asner run.

187
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,640
It also makes sense that like all like every

188
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,360
podcast or comedy writer or whatever is obsessed with Norm McDonald,

189
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,640
who is the most old man ish, bizarrely old man ish for his generation.

190
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,320
Like, of course. And then he we lose him, maybe just by virtue of him.

191
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,160
But being old, I had no idea how old he was.

192
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,560
That was some of the shock of the death.

193
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,640
It's like, how do I know the age?

194
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,480
He was older than the generation and he kept his disease a secret for a decade.

195
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,480
So it kind of like was blindsiding.

196
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,640
But let's say we're recording this on a Wednesday.

197
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,720
A Monday, the four of us went to Disneyland together.

198
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,240
Norm McDonald came up several times Tuesday morning.

199
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,040
He's dead. So weird.

200
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,400
Well, so will you count this as part of that?

201
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,640
God, I don't know. That wasn't on Mike, but it was odd.

202
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,880
And it's not like I never talk about Norm otherwise. Yeah.

203
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,920
You know, it was more jarring when I would hear Regis reference on Mike.

204
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,680
And it was so shortly before he died.

205
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,400
You know why? Why Regis?

206
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,920
But it was it was odd because we brought up to him a number of times

207
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,280
in different contexts within that radically.

208
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,280
There weren't even about necessarily about him.

209
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,000
He just played into it. Yes. Yeah. Weird.

210
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,320
Here's the word. Quisling, I believe.

211
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,840
That was one of the reasons he came up.

212
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,760
Yes. Used by David Letterman in reference to letterman calling him

213
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,960
Don O'Mire or he's calling Norm.

214
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,400
I'm calling. Yeah, yeah.

215
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,440
You're not being angry or Don O'Mire for firing him. Yeah.

216
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,280
Yeah. But there's a problem with the word. Quisling.

217
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,360
Do we figure that out?

218
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,200
It's apparently the name of like a Nazi officer or something.

219
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,720
But it's used as a derogatory of like you

220
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,000
quizzling you, you man who goes along with the Nazis or something.

221
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,560
Oh, it's bad. Yeah. Yeah. Right.

222
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,600
It's an insulting term. Yeah. OK.

223
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,680
It's not like you, Hitler, my favorite Hitler.

224
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,000
It's not a specific way to praise this guy.

225
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,040
He's my best friend. You got to love me.

226
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,680
He's a real gobles.

227
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,480
You know, it's a quizzling, like derogatory.

228
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,800
I don't I think you're allowed to use.

229
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,200
I don't know. But like Colonel Clink, I feel is still used as like

230
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,200
that that's a very old reference, but it's like an idiot.

231
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,600
Like a dumb idiot.

232
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,320
I mean, that is a fictional Nazi.

233
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,480
We're going to kill Werner Klemperer now, are we?

234
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,320
Have you? I assume he's already passed the quizzling definition here.

235
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,720
Wait, have you said is anyone other than me

236
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,040
reference Colonel Clink around you in the last decade?

237
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,720
I'm using Colonel Clink.

238
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,760
No, I'm saying it is the thing that I use as like

239
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:10,080
I feel like that one's evergreen like Lucy and Ethel, you know.

240
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,040
Guys, I just I just watched autofocus like three days ago.

241
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,760
So it's really there's all these.

242
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,320
Oh, my God. That's a reference.

243
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,280
You know, I'm going to Bob Crane.

244
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,720
And to Bob Crane, Scott, after you watched it.

245
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,560
Now you're speaking my language.

246
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,520
That's what you don't want to hear is like you tell somebody

247
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,120
something that's going on with you and they're like,

248
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,360
it sounds like a real autofocus situation.

249
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,920
Things might not work out so great for you.

250
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,920
I have a little more information here.

251
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,520
Quizzling, by definition, is a trader who collaborates

252
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,400
with an enemy force occupying their country. Hmm.

253
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,000
So I think Letterman's saying,

254
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,120
why would you sympathize with Don Ohmier?

255
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,880
Who's a bad guy who fired you?

256
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
Right. You're a quiz.

257
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,960
You're being a quizling. Mm hmm.

258
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:56,360
Vidkun Quizzling was a Norwegian military officer and politician.

259
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,040
It's a collaboration with the Nazis. Wow.

260
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,640
Oh, like a Benedict Arnold government of Norway during the occupation.

261
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,400
So Quizzling is a I just want to point out real quick.

262
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,280
We're in the garage here and the door just sort of closed by itself.

263
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,440
But I certainly felt like it was a ghost of some of the some of the people

264
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,800
we're talking about.

265
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,240
Is it Glemper? Is it Quizzling himself?

266
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,560
Is it all of them? Is it as a clink?

267
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,680
Is it norm? So we love you norm.

268
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,600
Is it Montecore, Siegfried and Roy's tiger?

269
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,200
It could be another one.

270
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,000
Talked about Montecore so much.

271
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,160
Montecore died.

272
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,640
Montecore and Roy died. Right. Both. Yeah.

273
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,880
Oh, yeah. It wasn't.

274
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,760
But Siegfried died. Right. They both died.

275
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,640
They both died. Yeah. They both died.

276
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,240
They're both dead. Yeah.

277
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,000
They're both. Yeah.

278
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,480
After we did all this stuff,

279
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,360
so we can't we can't make one pop culture reference to anything you like.

280
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,160
Or else we're we're screwed.

281
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,200
And that's going to be tough for you, Mike,

282
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,240
because somebody you love is in this attraction.

283
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,280
That's true.

284
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,400
Gentlemen, it's just not even I even mention who is in this attraction.

285
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,360
You're talking about Tim Allen.

286
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,280
Yeah.

287
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,160
You know, it was very weird and not to like I'm sure there's a million norm

288
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,040
anecdotes, but learning

289
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,920
one of the people giving a remembrance of Norm McDonald was Bob Dole.

290
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,200
Realizing Bob Dole is still alive.

291
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,800
Ninety eight years old. Yeah.

292
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,080
But Jason, you know what you just did?

293
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,280
No, but I was about to say I don't want to see the next five days.

294
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,880
You did it.

295
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,040
This episode is recorded before the passing of Bob Dole.

296
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,080
You absolutely that's the exact kind of person you don't want to invoke now

297
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,080
with the streak you boys have been on.

298
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,560
Bob Dole represents an America that I think has passed and we say

299
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
thank you for your service.

300
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,480
And any anytime it's somewhere you go, I can't believe they're still alive.

301
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,480
Invoking the means inevitably they will die within the week

302
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,160
of the episode being recorded passing through your brain.

303
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,960
We'll cause it.

304
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,880
Well, in advance, I think Bob Dole, you put a lot of evil on the show.

305
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,840
I'm sorry.

306
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,040
And we're all stressed out as we caused all of this.

307
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,440
Here's a death factor that's kind of nice or cool.

308
00:13:59,160 --> 00:13:59,560
Go ahead.

309
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,480
I don't know if that's the right way to frame this.

310
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,480
I'm sure you guys know this, but

311
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,240
Toy Story four, Don Rickles, entire performance is essentially cobbled together

312
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,040
for Midway Mania takes its I didn't know it was in Mania.

313
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,120
I knew it was existing.

314
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,680
That's crazy.

315
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,720
Main base of it.

316
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,280
Stuff they didn't use or even stuff they did use and we wouldn't reckon.

317
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,000
Combination of both.

318
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,680
He doesn't say a lot in the movie.

319
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,000
It's a lot of little sense fragments like, hey, what's that?

320
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,440
What you really going there?

321
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,120
You know, like a lot of like little things like it's woody.

322
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,680
He doesn't have like a lot of sentences.

323
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,280
There are 65 main characters in Toy Story four and most of them have five lines

324
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,640
that easily could have been cobbled together from any number of different sessions.

325
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,840
We were talking about this the other day.

326
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,080
I like Toy Story four infinitely more than you do.

327
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,360
I like it more than three.

328
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,800
I think that complaint of yours is the most valid complaint against Toy Story four.

329
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,240
It is the one I co-signed the most.

330
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,280
Specifically that I felt like it was designed to open up the universe, right?

331
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,920
That's what you're talking about?

332
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,640
Not that complaint.

333
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:54,880
Okay.

334
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,360
You don't like that one.

335
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,840
Complaint of just they've gotten to a point where the universe now has 60 main characters.

336
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,320
Oh, sure.

337
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,560
Toy Story is unsustainable by the fourth movie.

338
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,800
Like it just it's.

339
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,640
And we go and we meet more and we're bringing back one who's not here.

340
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:08,960
Yes.

341
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,320
Yeah, we end up with so many.

342
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,360
Yeah, right.

343
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,320
To flash to my other my the other thing I said with Toy Story four, which I do like,

344
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,680
I don't dislike Toy Story four.

345
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,760
It felt like they were redoing three.

346
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,120
But then if spoiler alert, if you haven't seen it, Woody like leaves.

347
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,760
They go off to have an adventure with Bo Peep.

348
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,320
And I felt like they were correcting a mistake where three left the toys in a different kids

349
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,640
playroom, which gives them all the same restraints of like, now we got to get out this giant window.

350
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,600
How are we going to do that?

351
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,120
Right now, Woody's out in the universe.

352
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,240
Like he's out in the world.

353
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,280
You don't have to get stuck with the same like now we're in a daycare.

354
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,000
Now we're in a school.

355
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,600
Like we don't have to do necessarily that.

356
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,520
That's a big four thing for me.

357
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:51,440
One of the reasons I prefer it is that I think that is the more correct ending to this series.

358
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
If God willing, it actually ends here.

359
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,880
Obviously, they will always find ways to do things with the Toy Story characters.

360
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,520
Right.

361
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:05,760
But if like this is the last canonical theatrical film, I think that's the better resolution to it.

362
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,880
And like I know I think Toy Story three holds a lot of value for people.

363
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,920
Just to make it clear, main reason I'm doing this episode, Toy Story is my favorite thing in the

364
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,520
world, like period point blank.

365
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,800
It is like my number one fandom of any stripe.

366
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,520
Yeah.

367
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,240
And there's Toy Story rides out there.

368
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,040
There's a lot of Toy Story rides, but this is probably the most

369
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,040
like notable, like maybe the best use of everybody.

370
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,760
It's definitely like the most high profile.

371
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,360
I mean, I have a lot of thoughts on this.

372
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,600
And I think it occupies an interesting space because we were even trying to,

373
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,360
I don't know if it was before or after the ride queue, talking about where this ride

374
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,200
lands in sort of the timeline of the Disney Pixar acquisition and them trying to immediately get as

375
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,040
much out of these characters as possible.

376
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,360
Right.

377
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,280
I think there's a lot of interesting stuff there, but I do think like a thing I like about

378
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,280
Meway Mania is I get to see all my favorite characters again.

379
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,960
I get to spend all this time with them.

380
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,560
When there have been a lot of like the other Toy Story attractions, which are largely gray,

381
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:09,200
I mean, there's kind of the cheapo more carnival bush ones that are just nicely are decorated.

382
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,360
Right.

383
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,840
But then there's Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters, which I think is great, but it's like a particular

384
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,760
subsect of Toy Story universe.

385
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,560
Slinky Dog's kind of only Slinky Dog and the Penguin.

386
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:18,640
Right.

387
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,360
This is kind of the most here is everybody.

388
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,160
You meet all of them.

389
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,800
They all do something.

390
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:22,960
Right.

391
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,800
And everyone has their personality come through in a way that like some characters don't get

392
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,480
their moments in Toy Story 4.

393
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,040
And it's like you're willing to give them Rickles because he is no longer on this mortal coil.

394
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,360
Sure.

395
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,200
They had to work with the scraps they had.

396
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,480
But that's just like, I wish Rex had anything to do in that movie.

397
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:38,880
You know?

398
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,280
Yeah.

399
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,080
There's so many of them.

400
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,640
I think that movie really does wrong by Jesse, who's my single favorite Toy Story character,

401
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,440
I would say.

402
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,160
Very endearing.

403
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,960
I mean, like I love Forky now, but Forky has only one movie to compare to like Jesse's.

404
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,320
The Jesse arc in 2 is just perfect.

405
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,200
Yeah.

406
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,440
Yeah.

407
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:06,720
But yes, it's like, you know, PTR friend of the show, Jeff Garland, Buttercup has like

408
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,800
a successful joke in that movie, right?

409
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,640
Like he has like a runner that pays off.

410
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
Two, three lines that are funny.

411
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:12,800
Yeah.

412
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,880
But they build and it's three beats and the third one really lands.

413
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,360
And it's like a little frustrating that like they couldn't do at least that for all the

414
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,000
characters.

415
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,320
Yes.

416
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,440
It is one of the things that now going on Midway Mania again, and I want to say this

417
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,080
is the first time I've gone on it since 4 came out.

418
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:37,040
It's just nice to see characters get spotlighted in that way, you know?

419
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,440
Yeah.

420
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,840
It's a thing I enjoy about that ride where like as much as it's like,

421
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,640
it's a screen ride, it's a shooting ride, like really?

422
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,800
And that felt a little more novel at the time.

423
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,800
And I was going back onto the ride this time going like, am I going to be weary about this

424
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,600
now because of like everything else that's become like this?

425
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:53,760
Yeah.

426
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,600
There's something nice about just being like, here's like four minutes with Sarge.

427
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:58,800
Yeah.

428
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,440
You know?

429
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,360
Like it's just here's some Sarge time and you're going into these different silos of

430
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,320
theming of Toy Story.

431
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,720
It's a thing I love about Toy Story is you have these characters that would not exist

432
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,880
in the same universe under any other premise.

433
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,840
And you sort of get to go to like all of their, here's Sarge World, there's Woody Old West World.

434
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,400
Because it's just a kid owning toys, Toy Story means you get to have sci-fi and

435
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,760
westerns and dinosaurs and military and everyone plays their role pretty straight.

436
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,040
And it's nice that every little zone you go to is like themed.

437
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,960
You spend some time with the characters.

438
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,680
I believe Pixar actually did the animation themselves.

439
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,640
I think that was a big deal.

440
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,160
It's all the real voice actors.

441
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,720
Yeah.

442
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,200
I think this ride has a lot of production value in that way.

443
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,080
That having been said, frontloader right off the top.

444
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,360
I just don't want to forget this because I almost said it walking off the ride.

445
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,360
And then I went, no, I should hold on to this.

446
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,000
Save it.

447
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,720
Yeah.

448
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,920
That ride opens, I believe in 2008.

449
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,720
Correct.

450
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,200
Yeah.

451
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,840
Disney acquires Pixar in 2006.

452
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,400
We were talking about this that Cars was the last movie of the Disney deal.

453
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
Closed out what they owed them post Toy Story.

454
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,720
The original Eisner Katzenberg deal was five film sequels don't count.

455
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,320
Post Toy Story, it's a bug's life.

456
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,320
They got screwed on Toy Story too because it was supposed to go direct to video.

457
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,080
And when they pushed it to theaters, Katzenberg went, no, no, no, no, no.

458
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,280
Eisner went, no, no, no, no, no.

459
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,760
Doesn't count.

460
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,040
You owe us four more.

461
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,400
And that started a lot of the contentiousness between Disney and Pixar for years that made

462
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,960
people think they would split up when the deal was done.

463
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,680
So then it was Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, Incredibles Cars.

464
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,600
And that should have been the end of the loop.

465
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,320
Right.

466
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,000
And they were like free market.

467
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,520
I forget if the deal happens right before or right after Cars.

468
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,520
I want to say right before because when people were like, I was reading Jim Hill all the time.

469
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,680
This is when I got into Jim Hill because I was like, I want to understand the Pixar acquisition.

470
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,520
Oh, you had a Jim Hill era.

471
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,000
Yes.

472
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,800
I mean, not that.

473
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,440
When is everybody?

474
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,720
It's like when that's a good question.

475
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,160
I ask you, when did you get into Jim Hill?

476
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,520
Like, what was what was your hair?

477
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:08,080
My thing for me was it was the Pixar acquisition, which was like the first thing Eiger did,

478
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,800
and the Muppet acquisition, which was the last thing Eisner did.

479
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,160
And I was so protective of both of those worlds that I was just like,

480
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,640
I don't know how I landed there, but it was like,

481
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,840
this is the only guy who seems to be really going into the weeds on

482
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,320
everything this means for these companies.

483
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,560
Like honesty and like warts and all.

484
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:31,360
And then I just got into reading all of everything, reading his Superstar limo pieces.

485
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,520
But that's how I got turned on to him.

486
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,880
When was everyone else's Jim?

487
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,440
Jim Awakening.

488
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
Oh, I think only a few years ago.

489
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,880
I think probably around the start of the DCA redo.

490
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,760
But what I was going to say off of your point,

491
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,880
I think the Pixar acquisition happens because Eisner is out.

492
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,240
Because Steve Jobs and Eisner were like oil and vinegar.

493
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,440
Like two big personalities who did not see eye to eye.

494
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,640
The story is that everyone thinks there's no way Disney will be able to get Pixar back

495
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,120
because Eisner has like really sullied the water.

496
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,620
Right?

497
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,920
And Pixar starts independently producing their next three movies.

498
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:20,080
WALL-E, Up, and Ratatouille were all produced independently, self-financed.

499
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,200
And they were like, and whoever acquires us gets these three movies.

500
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,600
Which is why they're the three weirdest Pixar movies.

501
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,160
It's why they're the three where it's like, how did this get made?

502
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,040
That aren't necessarily like, and there'll be obvious part two and part three of these.

503
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,760
It was just like, let's just like, it's true blank check shit where it's just like,

504
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,600
someone's going to buy the next three Pixar movies.

505
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,800
We do whatever we want.

506
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,800
Very idiosyncratic.

507
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,440
I think maybe the most, I would say the most interesting time.

508
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,520
Although Pixar, I mean, I was like 10 when Toy Story came out.

509
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,200
And so like, I think that was the last one where I was like fully, I was like all in.

510
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,920
Sure.

511
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,240
Sure.

512
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,040
You know?

513
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,280
But it's, yes, that run is really interesting.

514
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:11,040
And that's like 2007 Ratatouille, 2008 WALL-E, 2009 Up.

515
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,680
And then 2010 is Toy Story 3.

516
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:18,080
Because the first thing that happens is like, Eisner slams the door behind him.

517
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,400
Right?

518
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,080
Everyone's like, this is a rapper ball.

519
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,000
Eiger takes over.

520
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,280
His story is that he like goes to the parks and he goes to one of the parades and he realizes

521
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,760
that the only characters in the parade from the last 10 years are Pixar characters.

522
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,680
That Disney has created no characters in the last 10 years that have had any staying power.

523
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,840
And that it's just Pixar.

524
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,840
And he just goes like, my first order of business is whatever it takes.

525
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,400
And he goes to Steve Jobs and he's like, you have all the leverage, you name your price.

526
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,800
We need you guys.

527
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,280
It's yours.

528
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,320
We buy you outright.

529
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:50,800
It's not.

530
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,040
Right.

531
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,240
Like we keep doing it.

532
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,600
We do another deal with you that could last.

533
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,960
And Jobs said the fact that Eiger came to him with that much humility is like the thing

534
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,320
where he was just like, I liked that.

535
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,160
But he wasn't playing hardball with me after Katzenberg and Eisner were always trying to

536
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,520
be a step ahead.

537
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,040
That he was like, we're fucked.

538
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,840
We need Pixar.

539
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,360
You name your price.

540
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:07,920
Oh, weird.

541
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,400
Steve Jobs liked people being subservient to him?

542
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:10,880
Yes.

543
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,160
Who could have seen that coming?

544
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,360
He liked Eiger self-cucking.

545
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,000
But so they pay all this money.

546
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,920
I think Cars comes out right after that.

547
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,440
People were like, they spent too much.

548
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,680
The Cars merchandise the first year alone, like pretty much makes back everything.

549
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,320
Right.

550
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,320
But the first thing Eiger says when he takes over is like Toy Story 3 has got to happen now.

551
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,320
It's been at this point, seven years.

552
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,080
You fast track that by that point, we're already getting into way more.

553
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,080
There are lots of we're past Harry Potter.

554
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,720
We're into this.

555
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,560
Like, you don't just do two movies.

556
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,040
Right.

557
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,720
And three could never happen because Pixar was like, we'll do it if it counts.

558
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,960
And Eisner was like, doesn't count.

559
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,920
And they were like, then fuck you.

560
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,880
It doesn't happen.

561
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,600
Weird.

562
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,920
The direct-to-video when Eisner was playing hardball with them, he started this animation

563
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:04,240
company, Circle 7, that was named that because they were housed in an old ABC 7 building.

564
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,640
For some local affiliate or whatever.

565
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,440
Because he was going to do Cinderella 3, Twist in Time to Toy Story, basically.

566
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:13,840
Right.

567
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,560
He was going to make a sequel, like the cheap sequel.

568
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:16,960
Yes.

569
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,720
ABC 7 is our affiliate.

570
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,000
Los Angeles is the affiliate.

571
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,160
I wasn't sure because ABC 7 is also New York.

572
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,160
That's in Chicago, too.

573
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,640
Yeah.

574
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,280
Last seven.

575
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,480
Lucky number seven.

576
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,040
But yes, that's where I think Circle 7 animation was.

577
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,320
And they announced when they were just like, fine, Pixar, you want to leave us?

578
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:34,800
That's fine.

579
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,680
Finding Nemo 2, Monsters Inc. 2, Toy Story 3.

580
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,240
They announced all of that.

581
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,760
Imagine that world, all these gross bad, like losing half the actors every time.

582
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,480
Yes.

583
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,560
The Toy Story 3 premise was that the Buzz gets recalled.

584
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,520
He's defective and they make everyone send all the Buzz's back to Japan and all the toys

585
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,400
have to travel to Japan to rescue him from the factory.

586
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,960
But he's like lost his mind.

587
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,400
He's gone like psychotic.

588
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,080
Who knows?

589
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,720
Maybe.

590
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,240
It's not like outwardly.

591
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:15,120
It's not as bad as there's no fraction in the title that helps.

592
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,880
We're not in Lion King one and a half.

593
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,000
We would have gotten there.

594
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,480
Yeah.

595
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,880
But so Eiger immediately makes good but is like, you got to give me Toy Story 3.

596
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,520
Come on, guys.

597
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,280
Let's stop dicking around.

598
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,520
And then Jason, I think you were telling me that you had found in your research

599
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,680
that Midway Mania was originally developed as a Mickey concept.

600
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,680
Well, see, I found that through Jim Hill.

601
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,800
They were talking about it.

602
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,520
Jim.

603
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,720
Because of the straight line from, let me see if I can get this right.

604
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,560
Pirates of the Caribbean, the battle for Buccaneers gold.

605
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,240
Which is what?

606
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,920
Which is an attraction.

607
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,720
Yeah, Pirates of the Caribbean, battle for Buccaneer gold.

608
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:05,200
It was a game at Disney Quest that replaced the Hercules game.

609
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,520
And this was like you were on a pirate ship and you were firing a cannon at other pirate ships.

610
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,680
Before this moment, before I heard that, it did not thought of me that the Toy Story Midway Mania

611
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,960
gun thing you use is a cannon, basically.

612
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,520
Oh, yeah.

613
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,080
Oh, sure.

614
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,560
Yeah.

615
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,280
Uh-huh.

616
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,760
Yeah.

617
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,240
Yeah.

618
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,800
That makes sense.

619
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,840
And he was the one who said that I think it was very, very early on because I was digging for a

620
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,440
while and I could not find any articles about that.

621
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:44,640
But I think early in the development, imagineers may have been like, maybe this is a Mickey Midway

622
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:44,880
thing.

623
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,520
Right.

624
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,720
That makes sense that Mickey's still on the Ferris wheel.

625
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,800
In the end, you don't really have a Mickey ride yet.

626
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,040
Right.

627
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:59,120
But even that placement within the pier would make a lot of sense.

628
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,400
It just seems conjecture on my part, but it's like,

629
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,120
Eiger comes in, they close the deal, it's 2006, Toy Story 3 is greenlit, and it's like immediately,

630
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,360
how do we do as much of Toy Story as we can?

631
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,880
That movie is four years away.

632
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,280
What's the quickest we can get something in the parks?

633
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,480
What's an idea we have that is somewhat modular?

634
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,920
That's up for grabs that any IP maybe can be on.

635
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,840
And another thing going on is we have to do something with California Adventure.

636
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,400
Right.

637
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:32,400
This is the canary in the coal mine of, oh, we're acting from a position of power with

638
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,360
California Adventure.

639
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,120
It's not just stop gaps.

640
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,800
It's not just like, get a Monster Thing thing and get a Chibi Tower in.

641
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,400
This was a big deal when they were redoing this park.

642
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,440
We're starting with this.

643
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,120
What is essentially a technological marvel?

644
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,680
That's the thing.

645
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,160
This ride was such a big, you've never been on a ride like this, but I feel like they

646
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,360
kept on flaunting this is going to be a very different thing.

647
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,840
Yeah.

648
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,560
Yeah.

649
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:06,400
They also, I found this other history of it though from the Kevin Rafferty book where

650
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:13,120
the idea was, they had, and this might have been when they're starting the process of

651
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,320
how do we start changing DCA and especially change the Paradise Pier area, which is sort

652
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,360
of the shinsiest, most off the shelf zone.

653
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,000
So how do we do something that's more elevated?

654
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,040
And they were like, there were, there still are like midway games, but I think they're

655
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,400
walking past those and saying, wouldn't it be great if there was a way that you could

656
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,920
play these infinitely in a way that you could cycle more people through than having to go

657
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,720
up to a stand, have a transaction and then play the game.

658
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,520
So they start, they start figure trying to figure out what is a ride around this.

659
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:51,040
I think even without IP necessarily attached, but what I found interesting about all this

660
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,000
is that they may be, they didn't, they weren't even at screen ride yet.

661
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,640
According to this book that they were trying to figure out a way that you could have just

662
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,640
like a bunch of balls and rings loaded onto a ride vehicle, like enough that were just

663
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,840
ever refilled and that you wouldn't run out of in the allotted time.

664
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,320
I cannot believe that idea lasted for longer than five seconds without someone getting

665
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,640
the practicality of who picks up the balls?

666
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,280
Where do they go?

667
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,320
Yeah.

668
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,640
Yeah.

669
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,080
Like bowling has a system that's been in place for a long time.

670
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,680
We have to invent the bowling pickup system, but more, more complicated with small marvel.

671
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:31,040
You're in a ride car and you're moving around to different areas and people keep throwing

672
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,640
an infinite amount of things.

673
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,040
How do they not just like take them, grab them, hurt each other with them?

674
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,200
How do you not have teenagers throwing them at each other?

675
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,760
Right.

676
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,880
It would have to come out of like a long tube.

677
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,440
It would have to have like a skeeball mechanism in the actual ride and it would all have to

678
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,360
funnel its way down and then reload into each vehicle, but not ever have it be possible

679
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,880
for you to grab the ball.

680
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,120
Right.

681
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,160
I mean, just a nightmare.

682
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,240
What you just described is a nightmare.

683
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,400
Seems hard, but I know it's not impossible.

684
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,680
Maybe if they had to stay with that line of thinking, they might have rigged something

685
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,960
up eventually, but once they realized screens of the thing.

686
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,240
The other thing from that book, Kevin Rafferty, by the way, the Imagineer,

687
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,640
responsible for this and Cars and A Thousand Things Tower of Terror, like one of the greats

688
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:23,040
ever, when he described the Mickey situation, he said that it was maybe it was going to be

689
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,800
a Mickey thing and he said that they ran into this weird thing where they've always had

690
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:32,080
trouble at the Imagineer and cracking Mickey rides because what is Mickey and his world?

691
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:38,000
He's almost doing a different job every time you see him in a Homer Simpson sort of fashion,

692
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,200
although even Homer is defined as his main job before he has side adventures, but like

693
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,520
what really is the base of Mickey?

694
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,440
And it all makes more sense in this new style.

695
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:54,080
Weird fact that like, you know, as Disney keeps on getting scared of losing Mickey to public

696
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,680
domain, right, and they keep on fighting and spending millions and millions of dollars in

697
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,600
court to like get public domain to lobby the government basically.

698
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,760
Yeah, years stretched further and further and further back.

699
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,960
The other thing they've done is started siloing.

700
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,080
I'm sure you guys know this, but like different versions of Mickey they legally treat as

701
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,360
different characters.

702
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,920
So if they ever lose Steamboat Willie, they're like, well, that's Steamboat Willie.

703
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,120
That's not Mickey.

704
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,560
Steamboat Willie Mickey is that one character and then like Taylor Mickey is one character

705
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,840
and this Mickey is one character.

706
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,560
Like they split it into very separate licenses with separate copyright.

707
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,640
So they're like each Mickey is actually they're not all the same.

708
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,240
This is the whole the Mickey should end up in the public domain situation is interesting

709
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,400
because like for all of the evil things that Disney does and the evil things Disney does

710
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,720
involving lawyers, this one I'm a little like, what the fuck is that rule?

711
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,480
Why does why do they need like they are they could not be more active 100 years later

712
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,440
for this character.

713
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,000
Why do they have to just surrender it?

714
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,560
It's weird.

715
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,880
I like anyone else going to do with Mickey.

716
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,560
Can you imagine Warner Brothers being like, finally, we get to do our Mickey project?

717
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,080
I just think the graffiti art when Mickey goes into the public domain is just going

718
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,280
to be unbearable.

719
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,000
You mean officially?

720
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
The show was basically.

721
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,640
You can do it.

722
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,200
People like to joke about like Disney so litigious showing down everyone's fun.

723
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,560
It's like, do you know how much bad Mickey shit we're being saved from by Disney's lawyers being

724
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,120
diligent?

725
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,720
I think it'll be funny though when like every studio has a Mickey movie that first year.

726
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,080
It's like the Snow White rival projects were just like four untitled Mickey projects.

727
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,600
We are different creative teams.

728
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,280
We're going to develop a movie podcast.

729
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,160
The Ride presents Mickey and we're going to make it.

730
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,360
Jason stars as Mickey.

731
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,760
I love this already.

732
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,040
Jason, do the voice Plum roll.

733
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,040
Hey, everybody.

734
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,000
See great.

735
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,560
He's Mickey.

736
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,920
It's like, right?

737
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,240
Yes.

738
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,920
Yeah, he's wearing the little shorts.

739
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,920
If that's what you're asking.

740
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,160
You can also have Mickey who's just like, hey, I'm Mickey.

741
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,680
He could be like strapping and sexy.

742
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,800
Michael, Michael Mouse.

743
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:08,720
Yeah.

744
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:14,240
And just like a kind of hot current version of like sort of a like hipster bartender version

745
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,120
of the suspenders.

746
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,920
Little shorts.

747
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,720
Shorts need to be little.

748
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,040
Why bother to get the character if you're not going to be shorts?

749
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,000
It's been a long time.

750
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,320
People have been asking, you know, when will Mickey get hot?

751
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,800
And now we can finally know.

752
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,680
Now we can now.

753
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,040
Two thousand twenty eight.

754
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,760
Exactly.

755
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:36,320
But like when we were walking through Toontown, I was saying like this whole area is very odd now

756
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:45,280
because it is so frozen in amber of like the 90s sort of take off on the 60s Disney cartoon

757
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,600
aesthetic, which is not the best era of the shorts by any stretch.

758
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,040
And then they're doing the short films.

759
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,920
Not the shorts.

760
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,440
Oh, the shorts were great in that time.

761
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:53,680
Yes.

762
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,840
It's never been a bad era for the shorts.

763
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,680
The only thing that could go wrong is if they went long.

764
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,200
That would suck.

765
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,680
That would suck.

766
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,680
There's got to be poor shorts, Mickey.

767
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:02,640
Don't.

768
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,680
There's got to be.

769
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,560
Jort Mickey?

770
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,600
Mickey wearing jorts?

771
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,720
Oh, Mickey.

772
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,600
John Cena Mickey?

773
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,680
John Cena style shorts.

774
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,640
Yeah, I could see it.

775
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:20,800
It's like the 90s, like more day glow, more rounded version of the 60s Mickey cartoon aesthetic

776
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,040
that now has no connection to anything.

777
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,960
And when there was like maybe like three cartoons were made in that era.

778
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,320
And when there was like 20 years of just like, well, I don't know, Mickey's inactive.

779
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,640
Mickey's definitive vibe is Toontown.

780
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,440
Like there's nothing that's more Mickey than this place.

781
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,440
Because what else are they really doing with him?

782
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,160
But the shorts they do now are good and are popular.

783
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,760
They've been using more, right?

784
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,720
Runaway Railways.

785
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,720
Already, there's been enough time for a generation to view it as, well, that's Mickey.

786
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,320
They might not even know the previous Mickey.

787
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,920
So I was saying this to you where you're like saying that your son watches those shorts.

788
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,640
You watch them with him.

789
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,600
And it's like at some age when he is cognizant enough to like feel attached to those new Mickey

790
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,960
cartoons and that aesthetic, that vibe, and what that personality is.

791
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,040
And then understand what's going on when he goes to the park.

792
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,880
He's going to be like, what is this place?

793
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,560
Why is there this weird other?

794
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,760
Yeah, this is nothing.

795
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,080
Why haven't they painted this since 1994?

796
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,440
Right.

797
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,880
Like it's just so odd.

798
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,080
Who is Roger Rabbit?

799
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,640
It is interesting to me that like on one hand, oh, makes sense to swap in Toy Story

800
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,960
instead of Mickey because Toy Story, like all the characters have such defined personalities.

801
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,840
And as you're saying, like milieus, they're worlds to play in.

802
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,440
They're obvious ways to go, right?

803
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,600
There's like no shortage of options there.

804
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:38,800
But then you also go like there's no logical link between Toy Story and the Carnival.

805
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,360
Like they get to the Carnival in Toy Story 4.

806
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,640
Oh, yes.

807
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,360
After yes.

808
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,040
A movie made after the ride.

809
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,280
Right.

810
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,920
But at that point in time, when you're just looking at Toy Story 1 and 2,

811
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,480
the sweatiness of the premise, which I don't care about the premise, but when they were like,

812
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,160
the idea is that Andy buys a play set that's a make your own midway and he sets it up in the

813
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,240
bedroom and then he leaves and then the toys decide to run the games themselves.

814
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:02,960
And it's like, right.

815
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,520
Yeah, I don't care.

816
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,320
Just let me play the games.

817
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,720
I don't care.

818
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,120
It's fine.

819
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,920
Andy lead.

820
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,280
Yeah, I found it so specific.

821
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,440
All this is listed somewhere.

822
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,800
But Andy's called to dinner.

823
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,560
Don't get on that ride and start trying to break plates unless you know that Andy is

824
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,200
and he should be here and he should be giant, much bigger than you.

825
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,040
But he had to go eat his giant dinner.

826
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,880
See, but that's what that starts me out on the ride on a stressful note because I'm

827
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,720
afraid someone's going to call me late for dinner.

828
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,640
My biggest fear is disappointing these characters.

829
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,880
And you've been hoping that the ride vehicle will just take you into the dining room.

830
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,200
Yes, I'm hoping one of the delays, it's not target practice.

831
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,640
It's just like, oh, good.

832
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,600
You're finally here.

833
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,040
Water, iced tea, soda.

834
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,480
Jason wants the ride car to move into a room where suddenly he is still toy size and there's

835
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,600
just giant food.

836
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:55,440
You know, and he's like a little pewter who's able to climb inside a turkey and eat it.

837
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,680
You know, they painted this pot pie with the 3D glasses on so the black light would look

838
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,560
correct when you were wearing your 3D glasses yourself.

839
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,360
That is a good thing about that ride, though.

840
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,920
I feel like more than a lot of other 3D rides.

841
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,760
I don't think that ride looks muted, neither in screen nor in like actual physical.

842
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,560
It still looks pretty good.

843
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,600
I mean, I think at this point they probably could make it a little brighter.

844
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,440
But other than that, it's not as egregious as a lot of rides.

845
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,200
And it also like it's fun.

846
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,720
And this is why I'm curious if this opinion is out there and maybe this is the opinion

847
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,800
that you feared that we had or something.

848
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,000
But like, are there because for sure we've said it, everybody said it like a screen rides

849
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,440
and you're all your eyes at screen rides.

850
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,160
I almost don't think of this as a screen ride or I don't apply like the same.

851
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,720
It doesn't have the sort of the bummer aspects of things I would call screen rides.

852
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,280
No, it's I want this is the main thing I want to talk about.

853
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,920
I don't quite understand how this ride avoids those trappings.

854
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,400
Well, I think the games I think everything works together

855
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,600
in such a great way.

856
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,240
All the games are very clear and simple.

857
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,240
I think satisfying.

858
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,440
They're all very different.

859
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,320
The, you know, blacklight sets are nice accompaniments.

860
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,560
The 3D is not the movement of the cars.

861
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,400
The movement of the cars is very nice.

862
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:16,960
It's fun.

863
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,560
Yeah, there's enough like real ride stuff between the games.

864
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,240
You're like, oh, I like what the ride vehicle does and how it looks.

865
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,000
I mean, because you guys haven't done the episode yet, but I wrote it with you guys.

866
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,400
And we like we do Toy Story Mania.

867
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,200
And then I think we go over to the web web slingers.

868
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,600
Yeah.

869
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,480
Now I've done that.

870
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,400
You've done your Griffin and I hadn't done it when that ride starts.

871
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,840
I was just like, fuck, this ride is going to make Toy Story Mania look like diarrhea.

872
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,560
And then I'm going to have to pick up the pieces and do an episode on a ride

873
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,640
that's become completely outmoded.

874
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,120
Right.

875
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,240
Stuck in the past.

876
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,680
That was my fear.

877
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,800
And then it took about three minutes of Norm McDonald's opening the door again.

878
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,840
It took about three minutes into web slingers to be like, no,

879
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,560
midway mania is like definitively better than this.

880
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,080
And this is more advanced.

881
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,720
But I think there are a lot of things such as that.

882
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,680
Web singers really feels like a screen ride.

883
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:19,520
Putting aside, I think problems with the game itself and the functionality of that

884
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:24,880
and the clarity of that and how that premise is overly confusing and spends too much time

885
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,560
trying to describe it and explain it to you.

886
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,880
I also think when you move from one screen to another in web slingers,

887
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,640
you're just seeing the space between two screens.

888
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,840
They're trying too hard to sell you on the you are immersed in a world,

889
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,480
a door is opening and this is just what's outside this door.

890
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,560
And you're very aware of the fact that you're looking at screens.

891
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,120
And then when the car moves, it just sort of moves laterally to another screen,

892
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,640
another steel door opens, and then you're seeing another thing.

893
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,120
As I'm writing, just like you from left to right.

894
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:03,040
Yes, I think Toy Story mania is better gameplay aside, just as a ride,

895
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,560
because it accepts the artifice of what it's doing, where it's like cura flats.

896
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,200
There are screens, they're big blocks.

897
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,920
There's this premise that if you really want to know,

898
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,000
we can explain to you that Andy was called to dinner, but also who gives a shit like,

899
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,640
who cares? The characters are talking to you directly.

900
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,000
They're just like, let's have some fun.

901
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,840
I find that I got a lot more stressed out playing web slingers, not only because it was hard to do,

902
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:32,480
but also because the intensity of the ride of just being like, we got to stop this.

903
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
Yeah, it's kind of yelling at you.

904
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,680
It's sort of shades of what there's like an arcade game.

905
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,080
It's called like jungle go go.

906
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,880
What am I talking about?

907
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,440
There's a game that is so stressful where so many giant spiders are jumping out.

908
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,840
It's kind of like that.

909
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,880
I mean, well, it is spiders.

910
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,040
I guess what I'm saying, we did a VR.

911
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,600
No, it's a thing.

912
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,200
You're in a little vehicle and we know our thing in Westwood that was like that,

913
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,920
where we were being attacked relentlessly by alien spiders.

914
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,400
Yes.

915
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:00,960
Ever.

916
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,200
Yeah, I think maybe I don't like anything like that.

917
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,040
We're like, there's there is a swarm.

918
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,960
Is that there's like that whole subgenre of arcade game that I feel like often would be

919
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,640
in movie theaters of like the alien game Terminator Salvation House of the Dead,

920
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,360
where it's like you have a gun and it's relentless and things just won't stop coming at you.

921
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,680
Yeah, I mean, I was was it like last two episodes ago where I was saying that does

922
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,560
seem to be the trend in these three D riots because we did it in knots.

923
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,800
There's knots 3D thing for very tales, which is like it's relentless.

924
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,040
Right.

925
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,120
There's so much happening or shooting a little.

926
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:43,040
I like you're shooting Crafty Coyote's sons holding pies, if I'm correct, which is great.

927
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,080
The concept is great.

928
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,600
And we're shooting at his little son.

929
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,720
Shoot my son.

930
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:53,120
And then the Spider-Man, it's like it's a lot of like relentless and a lot of stuff happening.

931
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,440
And it's like I think I said it about Spider-Man, wouldn't it be just like it would be more

932
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,400
satisfying if you shot a web at nothing happening and like it shot out of a barrel and you moved

933
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,480
your hand left and the barrel whipped there and you would feel like, wow, I did like the Spider-Man

934
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,560
thing versus like throwing my arms at the sex of the sky.

935
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,800
I think that is possible to do in Web Slayers, but I'm so confused.

936
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,360
I know.

937
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,320
It's confusing.

938
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,440
It's hard to see.

939
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,160
That's a great thing about Toy Story Midway Mania.

940
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,320
The color of your cannon.

941
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:22,960
It's so clean.

942
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:28,000
The color on the screen, like you can see what you're doing.

943
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,240
They play tested it with like eight to 80, you know, to make sure like all ages can figure this out.

944
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:38,880
And considering that every game, the objective changes a little bit and what your shooting

945
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,840
changes a little bit.

946
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,640
The adaptation time is zero.

947
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,720
Like you're just like, oh, it's plates now.

948
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,520
My plates are blue.

949
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,480
I'm throwing Matt thing.

950
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:46,960
It's rings.

951
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,720
My rings are getting them over the thing.

952
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,920
You're in it immediately.

953
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,600
A character slides in one sentence of instruction, not like a whole entire pre-show of it.

954
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,080
You're right.

955
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,000
You're totally right about like simple clarity.

956
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,560
You get it.

957
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,600
I'm comfortable, you know, and you're just like, oh, great.

958
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,720
I want to play this versus like, fuck, what do I got to do now?

959
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,360
Yeah.

960
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:10,240
And you and you note and whatever like the other rides, which are again, like impressive

961
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,760
technically, and I don't dislike the other 3D rides, but it feels like they got it down

962
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,400
from like pulling the weird cannon string.

963
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:18,720
Yeah.

964
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:24,080
It down to the millisecond where your brain just believes it's shooting it.

965
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:24,400
Right.

966
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,840
Like it, there's no question in my mind that it's coming out of the cannon for real.

967
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,160
Yeah.

968
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,160
Like my brain accepts the reality of it.

969
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,000
And there's just these little like the other rides, like it's off a little bit.

970
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,280
Your brain starts to get confused because it's not putting it together.

971
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,560
The web is not actually coming out of your hand or you're shooting like when you're

972
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,120
shooting on the.

973
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,680
Here's just a basic thing.

974
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,480
The webs are way too thin and it's really hard to tell which colors.

975
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,120
That's also.

976
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:49,600
Yes.

977
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,120
Colors are too similar.

978
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,680
That's the single biggest issue with that thing is like I did the best of the four of us and

979
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,280
you guys were like, what did you do?

980
00:44:59,280 --> 00:44:59,600
Right.

981
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,120
And I was like, I have no idea.

982
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,200
I don't know.

983
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,520
I was like, I kept checking and going like, did I hit some secret thing?

984
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,960
But I don't think I did.

985
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,200
And every round I was doing well and I was just like, I feel like I'm failing.

986
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,120
I was literally just flailing around.

987
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,920
There's no satisfaction from doing it, which you should.

988
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,360
I think a similar thing also would not just swing us into this to smugglers run.

989
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,160
I think maybe you have to.

990
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,760
Yeah, that's another video gamey.

991
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,000
Yes.

992
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,280
Super like highest tech of the moment.

993
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,520
Which I think I enjoyed because I had incredibly low expectations because this was my first time

994
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,800
going on it after two years of everyone dunking on it and saying it was a disaster.

995
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,200
I thought it was like, OK, I thought it was like fun.

996
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:39,680
You know?

997
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,560
Yeah, sure.

998
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:46,320
I was in the gunner role, which I was just shades of like it is a thin like you're not sure what

999
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,040
you're looking for.

1000
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:47,600
Looking at it.

1001
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,440
The gunner is frustrating as hell.

1002
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,080
Yeah.

1003
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,240
You said no, you were like because we didn't we didn't fill up the car so you had you could

1004
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,440
swing from position to position.

1005
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:55,760
Yeah.

1006
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,440
You said I will not be the gunner.

1007
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,960
I wanted to be engineer because they will if you only have four, they'll just give you

1008
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,320
gunner and then two pilots.

1009
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,240
And I was like, I want to be engineer over a gunner.

1010
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,400
Gunner is like, it's not fun at all for me.

1011
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,240
But in the movies, very fun.

1012
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:12,800
The gunner pods in the Millennium Falcon sequence in the movies, very fun, kind of

1013
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,360
abandoned.

1014
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,400
Why is it so fun in the movie?

1015
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,800
Yeah, it's more like locking automatic doors on a car in this.

1016
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,440
It's sort of failing.

1017
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,520
I open and close aim.

1018
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,280
That's the most fun thing to do in the world, but they deny you of doing that.

1019
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,920
I just I remember like I knew from everyone I've heard talk about this that there's like

1020
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:40,080
an absolute like there are short straw positions and everybody says engineer is, but I disagree.

1021
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:40,640
It's gunner.

1022
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,840
I've heard and then when you said no, gunner is the one you don't want to do.

1023
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,680
I was surprised because I was thinking like gun Luke and he's got the thing in the head.

1024
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,400
Yeah, of course.

1025
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,760
Coolish in the world.

1026
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,160
Of course.

1027
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:56,320
I hear you can tell what you're doing like the Toy Story games and you can see the results.

1028
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,640
Engineer at the very like at like gunner, you have to like kind of like you have to

1029
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,880
tilt to the left or right like your back like you're hitting a button.

1030
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,840
It's like an awkward spot and watch the screen and try to do it and it's like engineer.

1031
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:13,600
You can kind of chill out and just go click click and you can pretend you're like a little kid like

1032
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,640
in Scotty and engineering or or LeVar Burton or whatever.

1033
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:23,680
This gets to a key thing, which is that Toy Story Midway Mania is in no way going for immersion,

1034
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:24,480
right?

1035
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,640
Toy Story Midway Mania is only aiming to give you a fun time.

1036
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,200
I agree with that, but I also think immersion comes from the fact that everything works in perfect.

1037
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,080
That's the irony is then you start to get more pulled in completely immersed.

1038
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:42,400
I think when you're in Millennium Falcon, you're more aware of the fact that it's like this is

1039
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,240
them trying to trick my brain into making you think I'm doing the thing and this has any cause

1040
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,680
and effect and whatever that seamless right versus Midway Mania where it's just like,

1041
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,120
hey, come on, shoot some things.

1042
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:57,440
And you're like, oh my God, I'm in and going for photo reel, which is tougher as opposed to

1043
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,120
cartoony.

1044
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:03,520
And I think it's why you're not so critical of graphics from 2008.

1045
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:03,680
Yeah.

1046
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,520
That it's going in the same way that you're not so critical of Toy Story from 1995.

1047
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:07,600
Okay.

1048
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,320
So here's the surprise.

1049
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,960
Besides the humans who you expect to be more photo real.

1050
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,360
Right.

1051
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:11,600
Right.

1052
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:19,600
Here's the thing I'm surprised by, especially because they have done such a complete

1053
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:23,840
Pixarfication of California Venture after this.

1054
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,800
Does Cars Land open before or after Midway Mania?

1055
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,200
After.

1056
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,080
Okay.

1057
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,360
Shortly after, right?

1058
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:35,360
They were considering this a radiator Springs kind of that I think comes up.

1059
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,240
I saw it mentioned in the Rafferty.

1060
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,720
They were like, we got to add something else to Cars Land.

1061
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,880
Could we add some sort of thing to radiator Springs?

1062
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,400
And I think like before they hit on like that Midway observation, like,

1063
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,680
Oh, this was almost a Cars.

1064
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,520
It was potentially like, oh, could we put a thing in cars?

1065
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:00,400
And of course that, you know, there was the Route 66 stuff that was already kind of percolate.

1066
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,120
So like, I think this had a lot of lives.

1067
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:03,440
Yeah.

1068
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:03,920
Yeah.

1069
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,320
I was just going to say a big part of the announcement is I remember it is like,

1070
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,280
Disney's mended the fence, you know, like Pixar's back in the fold.

1071
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,040
Toy Story 3 is happening.

1072
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,920
Like they got control of these franchises.

1073
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,360
Again, these beloved characters are going to be used to the best of their ability.

1074
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,600
None, no simple reskinning, you know?

1075
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,280
And like this ride is going to be a technological breakthrough.

1076
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,600
And then the big thing I remember them advertising is like,

1077
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,520
because it's all based around these screens and the games,

1078
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,400
the basic ride can remain the same, but every couple of years we can update it and add new games.

1079
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,080
It's very easy to refresh this, which I thought was a cool idea.

1080
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,160
And they were announcing that especially because it was like,

1081
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,080
this ride is going to open two years before Toy Story 3 comes out.

1082
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:52,560
But when Toy Story 3 comes out, we're going to update it with new characters you haven't met yet.

1083
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,680
And the only thing they do is, what is it?

1084
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,880
They replaced, was there a Bo Peep one, I think, at opening that got replaced with the Buttercup

1085
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,000
ham and eggs one?

1086
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,440
No, with Trixie and Rex.

1087
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,800
Oh, it's Trixie and Rex.

1088
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,120
Yes.

1089
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,120
But also Buttercup gets put into the...

1090
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:07,600
Right.

1091
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,560
Oh, it was a ham thing and then they put...

1092
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:14,400
So they add Buttercup to ham and then the Rex and Trixie wasn't in it at all.

1093
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,840
It was originally the Bo Peep sheep.

1094
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,640
It was literally, yeah, Bo Peep, they do Bo Peep dirty.

1095
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,680
She's missing in Toy Story 3, then she gets cut out of this ride

1096
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,840
and then they do a make good with her in Toy Story 4.

1097
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,160
But that's what's so bizarre is it's just like...

1098
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,600
So this ride has now been open for 13 years.

1099
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:35,760
By the time Toy Story 4 comes out, it's been open for over a decade.

1100
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,000
It feels very bizarre that they didn't go like,

1101
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,880
new Bo Peep, new Dookaboo, Forky in some capacity.

1102
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,520
Ducky and Bunny, who literally are part of a carnival game.

1103
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,640
Who are in a game, right?

1104
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,920
Why is it just like...

1105
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,600
It feels very odd that they didn't do at least one refresh.

1106
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,800
Especially being that they have kept that consistent with Star Tours.

1107
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,800
You would think they would have given up or gone,

1108
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,400
are we really getting our money's worth for that?

1109
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,800
Are we really worried people aren't going to see the new Star Wars?

1110
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,600
But I think it's really neat that they've kept doing it.

1111
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:16,400
It heartened me to see the amount of Forky merch in the parks.

1112
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,880
When you get off this ride, half of the gift shop is Forky stuff now.

1113
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:22,960
Forky's sticking.

1114
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,560
I called it.

1115
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,600
Forky's here to stay.

1116
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,480
You're in love from the trailer, it seems.

1117
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,200
I love the guy.

1118
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,480
I love the guy.

1119
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,600
But it's weird that he's not reflected anyway.

1120
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,960
It's weird that Bo Peep, who I feel like they very much now elevated to,

1121
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,520
to the expense of Jessie, now being the main Toy Story female.

1122
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,680
At least in merchandising and branding stuff now.

1123
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,360
She's very active and everything.

1124
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,720
So how is there not a game?

1125
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,120
Absolutely.

1126
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,720
There's so much stuff you could do.

1127
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:55,440
It feels a little bit odd to me that they have kept the ride frozen

1128
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,880
after doing one very quick update within the first two years of its opening.

1129
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,960
It's also extra weird because they did a whole refresh of the pier.

1130
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,440
Exactly.

1131
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,000
It would have been a perfect time for them to do it.

1132
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,600
And now one new game added.

1133
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,200
We added Forky into the Woody game or whatever.

1134
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,760
You know, added to the ride, added to the gift shop.

1135
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,680
And it's kind of a miracle that there was an update to this ride at all.

1136
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,720
Because any time they say it's modular and we'll be able to update it, it never happened.

1137
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,040
This was the one time it actually happened.

1138
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:31,760
And it happened so quickly that you wanted to believe, like, well, they'll keep it going.

1139
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,320
And especially when another movie happens.

1140
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:40,000
And by the way, in between Toy Story 3 and Toy Story 4, they do two TV specials.

1141
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,440
They do three short films that play before, theatrical films.

1142
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,840
They are doing new stuff with the characters.

1143
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,960
Yeah, like Barbie and Kanantix.

1144
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,720
I mean, I guess there's a licensing issue.

1145
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,040
There's a lot of stuff they haven't done.

1146
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:59,200
To the Toy Story 4 fault, there are 60 main characters in this franchise now.

1147
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,400
And there are things like Halloween theming that you could do, you know,

1148
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,720
like just seasonal special things.

1149
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,760
You know what I bought on that?

1150
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,040
And I built with if they did Rex dirty in Toy Story 4,

1151
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,000
just watch Party Sorus Rex, which is so fantastic.

1152
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,280
That might be my favorite of the shorts.

1153
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,080
It's a great film.

1154
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:14,880
I'm a big fan of that one.

1155
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,760
All the shorts are great.

1156
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,480
Like, yes, it's.

1157
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,800
Yeah, all this is the quality is pretty high on those things.

1158
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,520
I think Toy Story of Terror is really good.

1159
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,720
I just watched it for the first time.

1160
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:29,920
Yeah, and it's like there should be some monsters after dark style Halloween late night.

1161
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:30,720
A wheel.

1162
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,600
The midway is broken down.

1163
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:35,600
That was the first for Griffin and first for me as well.

1164
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,240
I braved.

1165
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,320
I dared to see monsters.

1166
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,760
You were you were very scared.

1167
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,720
Can we say this now?

1168
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,520
Yeah, yeah.

1169
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,440
There was a lot of everyone trying to reassure you it was going to be OK.

1170
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,800
I was I think I was here because of Mike.

1171
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,760
I feel like you built it up.

1172
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,440
We're like, no, it's scarier.

1173
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,560
It's a lot scarier.

1174
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,560
I think the song makes it scarier.

1175
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:57,600
I think I said if I was a young kid, I would I would find it scarier for sure.

1176
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,840
Because it's darker in there.

1177
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:03,760
And you were also saying, right, like a lot of what you think would hit you hard as a kid

1178
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,120
is like walking into the ride and suddenly everything's red and like,

1179
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,280
yeah, alarms are going on.

1180
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,000
Yeah, not the.

1181
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,080
Oh, it's a little post apocalyptic or something.

1182
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:12,400
Yeah.

1183
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,880
And that's what I talk about that ride is I say it's like if you went on

1184
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,800
pirates after the town burned down.

1185
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,200
Right.

1186
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,400
Like it's scarier to me.

1187
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:19,680
Yeah, it's great.

1188
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,000
It's great.

1189
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,720
It's my favorite thing.

1190
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,000
I loved it.

1191
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,920
I also I swear to God, like there was some time on this podcast where you were building up the

1192
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,920
monster after dark song and I thought I'm going to be afraid of this song.

1193
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,640
This is going to be the darkest death metal I've ever heard.

1194
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,760
And then the song itself.

1195
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,600
I really liked the song.

1196
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,360
I am very on board with the song.

1197
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:41,920
So good.

1198
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,640
I want to buy the song on a seven inch vinyl.

1199
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,000
You can get it's an Apple music.

1200
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,720
Yeah, but I want to.

1201
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,120
I want to.

1202
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,000
You want an album.

1203
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,320
Yeah.

1204
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,440
You want to hear that when you hit that needle pops in the cracks.

1205
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:51,680
Yeah.

1206
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,080
Yeah.

1207
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,600
I'm monsters after dark.

1208
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,160
Because you gave that exact example.

1209
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:04,000
I got an Instagram ad recently from like Disney records of a seven inch for one side is the

1210
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,360
skeleton dance and the other side is the three little pigs.

1211
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:12,800
And I opened the link and it was five dollars and I was falling asleep, but I opened up the

1212
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,520
thing and I was like, I will buy that tomorrow.

1213
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,440
And I woke up in the morning.

1214
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,360
It says this page does not exist.

1215
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:24,240
And I was so mad that like it wasn't for sale anymore.

1216
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,080
Like they were like it was the last copy or the last handful of copies.

1217
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:32,400
Now, have you since then found any proof that this item does exist that you didn't dream?

1218
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,880
I'm reasonably sure that this actually happened

1219
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:37,920
because I wanted to.

1220
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,600
I remember looking up seven inch frames.

1221
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:46,000
Can I just also because I don't want to just assume that we know the song three little pigs.

1222
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,240
What is the sound of the song?

1223
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,440
The skeleton dance?

1224
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,200
Is anyone willing to like, is it like a new?

1225
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,880
Well, no, it just had a cool in.

1226
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,840
I was more going to buy it and buy one of those record frame and like hang it on a wall

1227
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,000
because it had the guys like doing the dance.

1228
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,280
It's a thing from the 20s.

1229
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,280
It's like a really early black and white.

1230
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:05,440
Yeah.

1231
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,000
Yeah.

1232
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,400
Yeah.

1233
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,120
It's awesome.

1234
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,440
And it's in one of the windows right now for Halloween.

1235
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,720
You got very excited.

1236
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,320
I went skeleton dance.

1237
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:12,480
Yeah.

1238
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,280
Oh my God.

1239
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,480
Yeah, it does exist.

1240
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:14,880
Okay.

1241
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,080
You can get it for like 35 bucks on eBay.

1242
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,600
It was for record store.

1243
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,320
I'm sorry.

1244
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,600
This does sound cool, but Disney doing record store day stuff.

1245
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,680
I mean, that's very funny.

1246
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,720
That's very much.

1247
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,080
They go so hard on that now.

1248
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:28,400
Yeah.

1249
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,880
Well, I found a 10 inch rare.

1250
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,160
Some day my prints will come.

1251
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,040
Holy shit.

1252
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,080
Wow.

1253
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,600
It's the monkey's uncle outtakes.

1254
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,920
It's the monkey uncle demo.

1255
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,880
It's in and they pressed it on an orange vinyl.

1256
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:50,320
We did Musker and Clemens on Blank Check at the beginning of this year.

1257
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,720
And I sort of just I kept on stewing back on the like.

1258
00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:00,240
It is kind of astonishing how successfully in the last 10 years,

1259
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:05,760
Disney has been able to sell Disney as simultaneously being kind of alt.

1260
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,200
You know, yeah, that like find a way, right?

1261
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,640
Hot Topic is just kind of a different Disney store now

1262
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,520
and that they can do all these like vinyl releases that are like manufactured by Disney.

1263
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:24,880
Yeah, like Nightmare Before Christmas maybe just reads is like this cool retro movie.

1264
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,920
Have you ever heard of it?

1265
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,200
It's kind of this art film.

1266
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:32,000
I think that was their entryway that they had this movie that like Disney was embarrassed by

1267
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,640
and that kind of underperformed and then people reclaimed

1268
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,360
and then Disney figured out how to monetize and then they were like,

1269
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,960
could we do this with everything?

1270
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:43,920
Yeah, we simultaneously sell like aerial dolls to little girls, but also sell like

1271
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,280
notebooks that look like VHS clamshells and go like,

1272
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,800
I'm just like, I don't know what to tell you.

1273
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,080
I'm like a 90s kid.

1274
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,840
That is the canniest move.

1275
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,160
I and I saw a Toy Story one.

1276
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,000
I came so close to buying that.

1277
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,280
I was so close to buying.

1278
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,400
We like them too.

1279
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,360
These things aren't bad.

1280
00:57:59,360 --> 00:57:59,760
They do.

1281
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,720
They do them right.

1282
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,280
Clever.

1283
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:06,400
I mean, my sister is like my sister works in food and like Ratatouille is like a big movie for us

1284
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:11,600
and a couple years ago I got her for her birthday like four very cool things that they had made

1285
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:16,800
where it was like, you know, a recipe book, a fill in your own recipe book that looks

1286
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,360
like a perfect replica of the Gusteau book and then it was like a jar that looks like

1287
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,320
the jar they have in the restaurant and all this stuff and I was like,

1288
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:29,520
this is just so smart to make the products that are either like replicating a form factor

1289
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,040
or a thing you have emotional attachment to or here's a practical version of the thing

1290
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,640
in the movie that you can now hold.

1291
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:38,880
Like every time I see the like, oh, it's like a mug that's chip as a cup.

1292
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,560
I'm just like, yeah, best product ever.

1293
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,720
Like so smart, so obvious.

1294
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,440
I have that.

1295
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:43,920
Yeah.

1296
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:44,560
Yeah.

1297
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,160
We have Cogsworth in the apartment.

1298
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,040
That's another one.

1299
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:47,440
Yes.

1300
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,320
Like all of those when it's just like you can own the real thing

1301
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,440
and it does sort of what it's supposed to do.

1302
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,760
The lapel pin of the up grape soda bottle cap.

1303
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:58,160
Yes.

1304
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,880
And I'm just like, oh, God, why are you?

1305
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,200
Why?

1306
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,200
Well, we can't have this too emotional.

1307
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,920
The fucking Monsters University hats are like the perfect example of just like those hats

1308
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:12,320
are bigger than that movie is and I think it just is because it's like, well, it's a movie

1309
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,080
where the hat has importance.

1310
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:17,920
So if you're going to walk into a Disney store and look at like a wall of 800 hats,

1311
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,680
you can get the one that has a logo on it or you can get the one that immediately makes

1312
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,280
you like part of the thing.

1313
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:23,600
Yeah.

1314
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,000
Yeah.

1315
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,920
They should like any if it's important in the movie, it should exist.

1316
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,640
As a physical item, you know, it'll work out well.

1317
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:38,000
Okay, here's something maybe a little shift we can take here just to make sure that we do it.

1318
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,640
I feel like we should talk about these games and we should talk about them from

1319
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,920
the gameplay perspective and so we can step through it and we'll reveal how we did because

1320
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,960
this was a good like, oh, this is a channel with this.

1321
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:51,760
There's four of us.

1322
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:56,000
We weren't quite in the same car, but on the same vehicle, there was like a little face

1323
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,040
off that happened.

1324
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:01,920
I feel like it was like a chance to put our skills to the test and display anything that

1325
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:06,800
we knew about how to do this ride and how to do these games.

1326
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,360
Mike and I were together.

1327
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,080
Jason and Griffin were together.

1328
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:14,560
Correct.

1329
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:22,080
And the ride had barely been going before Mike and I are murmuring to each other and

1330
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,160
backseat driving what you guys are doing.

1331
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,960
As we look back, we can see where you guys are and we like turn to each other without even

1332
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:32,720
we just knew exactly what the other was thinking, which is like they're doing the practice

1333
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:32,960
rounds.

1334
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,560
They're doing the practice that they're going to blow their energy.

1335
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,280
Big mistake.

1336
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,240
I say they're wearing down their wrists already.

1337
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,640
It's something we learned a long time ago.

1338
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,840
Don't do the practice rounds.

1339
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,640
Rookie mistake.

1340
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,520
In fact, I think it's filling up on bread.

1341
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,320
Why do it?

1342
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,160
I mean, you guys did do better than us.

1343
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,600
That is that is how it ended up playing out.

1344
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:58,160
And I did better than us and Griffin smoked my ass.

1345
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,080
But then Griffin and I both did very well on web slingers.

1346
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,080
Because my web slingers trick is you just punch.

1347
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:07,680
I adopt that as well.

1348
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:11,200
Ben, I'm shooting the webs on the back of his hands, not the other side.

1349
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,200
I just started doing like air drums.

1350
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,800
I just started at a certain point.

1351
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,080
Just anything.

1352
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:16,800
That's what I've heard.

1353
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,320
Just wave indiscriminately.

1354
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:18,720
Yeah.

1355
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:22,960
But even at the beginning, I was I was being diligent and doing the thwip hands and even

1356
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:24,800
that's what you want to do.

1357
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:28,640
No, I thought I was doing really well on the ride because I hadn't been on it in so long

1358
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:32,560
that I forgot what the levels of success are.

1359
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,920
And I was smoking Jason.

1360
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,800
I was like, am I fucking have I gotten great at this?

1361
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,000
And then we check in afterwards.

1362
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,840
I was like, oh, no, you guys smoked both of us.

1363
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,680
We didn't come anywhere close to anything.

1364
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,280
Nobody super.

1365
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,320
Nobody went out of the water.

1366
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:51,920
I did extra good for my normal score for sure.

1367
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,440
But I wasn't in any of that.

1368
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,920
I never do better than like the top score that there's people that are so good at the game.

1369
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,520
There's no reason to build it up too much.

1370
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,800
We might as well just and we can maybe say figure out how we got there.

1371
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:03,040
Sure.

1372
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,880
The in ascending score orders.

1373
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:07,200
Yeah.

1374
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,440
Uh, or I guess which way should I do?

1375
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,720
Mike was Mike was number one.

1376
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:11,200
I was number one.

1377
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,720
I was number two.

1378
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:13,600
Griffin was number three.

1379
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,720
Jason was last.

1380
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:15,600
Unfortunately, I'm sorry.

1381
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:20,560
Mike, I believe your score put you at you were the only one who graduated from

1382
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,400
Beaver to cat.

1383
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,040
You were a cat.

1384
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:23,840
I got a cat.

1385
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:24,480
Is it Beaver?

1386
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,000
I usually looks cooler.

1387
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,600
I don't disagree with that.

1388
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,400
It was a fun friend.

1389
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,800
I usually get the Beaver.

1390
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,640
But no, I got a cat.

1391
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,960
I vastly the vast majority of my trips have been the Beaver.

1392
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,960
This is also the only context in which the four of us would casually be bragging about

1393
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:41,840
getting the Beaver.

1394
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:44,000
I got yeah, I'm always getting Beaver.

1395
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:44,240
Right.

1396
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:47,200
Like this is the kind of thing that would sound really gross if anyone.

1397
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:51,280
Go on the ride, you do a jerk off motion and at the end you get the Beaver.

1398
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,000
Okay, you do a constant flick.

1399
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,360
Yeah, your wrist turns a lot.

1400
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:59,840
And then like, oh, yeah, that thing you do when your co workers, you know, they're at

1401
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,400
it again.

1402
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,440
Geez Louise.

1403
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,440
Look, I'm not quitting until I get the Beaver.

1404
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:07,840
Okay, but heading down to Anaheim this weekend, maybe I'll end up getting some people.

1405
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,640
Look, the only time I've ever said that word on this podcast was when I was referring to

1406
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,560
the famous Jerry Mathers character.

1407
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,920
Okay, now that's a wholesome way to use that word.

1408
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,720
Colonel Clink.

1409
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,640
Although you know who actually has the Jerry Mathers reference from this podcast is Scott,

1410
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,280
I believe.

1411
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,000
Yeah, because I'm the house that I was born into.

1412
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,600
The first house I lived as a baby was sold from Jerry Mathers to my parents.

1413
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,120
Who played the Beaver on an old show.

1414
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,400
Is the Beaver.

1415
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,400
Which does explain this to me.

1416
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,200
I was getting a little insulted.

1417
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,440
Maybe there's a new listener who doesn't know.

1418
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,560
But the house was getting sold then like a decade later.

1419
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,040
There had been multiple people in the house by that point.

1420
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:56,240
And we went to my dad was like, you should see the first house that you lived in.

1421
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:00,160
And there was a little like makeshift plaque that called it the Beaver house.

1422
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,080
Despite it being as he moved into in what?

1423
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,840
1979.

1424
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,760
And like a perfectly plain house.

1425
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:13,520
I will say I did just do the check during Mathers 73.

1426
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,160
I think.

1427
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,120
Not at risk.

1428
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,160
Of the blank.

1429
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,680
The PTR curse.

1430
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:28,080
My mom regularly tells me what the guy Tony Dow who played Beaver's brother Wally.

1431
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,640
What he's up to because she follows him on Facebook.

1432
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:31,120
Wow.

1433
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:33,040
So this is what I this is my life still.

1434
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,600
Because I think Eddie Haskell passed away recently.

1435
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:36,720
I forget if the actor's name is.

1436
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,240
Eddie Haskell did pass away.

1437
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,080
I am also blanking on the actor's name.

1438
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,800
We did lose Eddie Haskell.

1439
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,600
I don't know that we talked about Eddie Haskell recently, though.

1440
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:49,760
My dad, Eddie Haskell, I feel like is still one of my father's favorite references.

1441
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:54,240
And in a Colonel Klink kind of way of just referring to someone with Eddie Haskell behavior.

1442
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,520
You're bringing friends around.

1443
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:56,800
You're like, this guy's a real lady.

1444
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:57,280
Haskell.

1445
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,000
Some Eddie Haskell.

1446
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,680
Yeah, selling.

1447
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,240
Yeah.

1448
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,760
Who's that reference today?

1449
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,520
Does young Sheldon have a ne'er do well, a slightly ne'er do well friend?

1450
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:09,120
Well, but the thing with Eddie Haskell was that he was a ne'er do well who was so good

1451
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,960
at sucking up to every last.

1452
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:11,760
That's right.

1453
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,800
It was the balance of the two where it's like I'm not the insincerity of it.

1454
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:17,520
You know?

1455
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,000
Yeah.

1456
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:18,320
Yeah.

1457
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:18,880
I don't know.

1458
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,840
No one's been able to touch Haskell's lane.

1459
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:22,400
I don't know.

1460
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,320
You really think about it.

1461
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,520
He retired unopposed.

1462
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,480
Retires Jersey.

1463
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:35,040
Do you have it's I feel so stupid that I have never thought about

1464
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:39,760
not wasting your energy on the practice round and get every time I do that ride,

1465
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,680
you know, and I do it less frequently than you guys, but I certainly never go to Disneyland

1466
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,040
without going on it or world.

1467
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,640
I never go to the parks without going on that ride because I want to see my best friends.

1468
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,040
Of course.

1469
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:54,400
Every single time, by the time I get to the final round where it's just hit as many times

1470
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,240
as you can, I'm like spent.

1471
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,120
Yeah.

1472
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:57,760
I'm in pain.

1473
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:58,880
It's exhausting.

1474
01:05:58,880 --> 01:05:59,680
Really awful.

1475
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:05,360
And to into the like good up until that point, and then I'm just like losing it.

1476
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:05,760
Yeah.

1477
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:06,000
Yeah.

1478
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:11,520
You know, Jason, your reference, we're talking about any crossover between this attraction

1479
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,880
and sexual.

1480
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:18,000
There is something about the way that that finishes where like it like finishes with

1481
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,520
a big torrent and then an explosion and everybody leans back in their chairs like, oh, well,

1482
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:24,880
you're like you're like throw.

1483
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,400
That's like the Jerry Seinfeld bit.

1484
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,960
Like you're thrown clear afterward.

1485
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:33,520
Like your body literally has to move away from everyone sort of has their own style.

1486
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,600
But essentially, your strategy is you're going to develop a rhythm that you maintain for

1487
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,240
most of the ride.

1488
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,120
And then you get to that final one.

1489
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:43,040
You start speeding up and the intensity increases faster and faster and faster.

1490
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:43,200
Right.

1491
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:43,680
More.

1492
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:43,840
Right.

1493
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:44,240
You see.

1494
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:44,560
Yes.

1495
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:44,800
Right.

1496
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,080
And you're likely to get the best score if you're an active listener.

1497
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:49,280
Yes.

1498
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:49,920
Right.

1499
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:53,040
Listen to what they're telling you to do.

1500
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:56,240
And then you just you have that moment where you can literally just release your hands,

1501
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,240
finally release your grip and just go.

1502
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:02,480
But then also you start to actually feel like what position you might have been in that was odd.

1503
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,600
And you go, oh, my leg or my arm.

1504
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,000
I shouldn't have done that.

1505
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:13,440
And was it like, did you like take some risks, but maybe you did worse in taking the risk

1506
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,080
and you should have just aimed for a solid performance.

1507
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,720
Yeah, you should have just stuck with what works.

1508
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,080
And what we know, what we like.

1509
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:24,320
From my experience, predominantly there's that feeling that immediately where you look

1510
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:26,560
at the screen in front of you and go, what am I looking at?

1511
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:27,680
You know, there's the immediate.

1512
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,240
Yeah, it's it's bullseye.

1513
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,040
You sort of lose.

1514
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:31,840
What did I do?

1515
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:32,960
Yeah, you lose contact.

1516
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:33,600
It's something.

1517
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:33,840
Right.

1518
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,240
What?

1519
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,760
You like wake up again.

1520
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,320
Yeah, yeah.

1521
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:36,960
Horse.

1522
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:37,600
Yeah.

1523
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,800
I got the beaver.

1524
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,040
Yeah.

1525
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,640
Or is this an army man yelling at me?

1526
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,560
Says he's proud.

1527
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:45,680
Okay.

1528
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:46,880
But he's not my mom.

1529
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:49,280
That's another thing.

1530
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,720
When you made your Sarge reference at the beginning of the episode, I got confused for a second.

1531
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:58,480
I realized for the first time as a Pixar fanatic that there are two Pixar Sarges.

1532
01:07:59,120 --> 01:07:59,600
Oh, yeah.

1533
01:07:59,600 --> 01:07:59,840
Yeah.

1534
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:00,720
Yes.

1535
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,480
Near identical personalities.

1536
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,040
Right.

1537
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,320
Obviously, same color scheme.

1538
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:09,440
Both have decent presences in the parks.

1539
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,080
Mm hmm.

1540
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:10,960
Similar voices.

1541
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:14,000
I mean, Paul Dooley is Carsarge.

1542
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,680
Arlie Army is Toy Story.

1543
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:16,960
Great character actors.

1544
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:17,520
Yeah.

1545
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:21,200
I just like that they just went back to that well and they were like, I know, another militant guy.

1546
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:34,320
If we're talking general strategy on this attraction, I guess it is similar to maybe

1547
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:37,440
do a lot of these kinds of rides and to web slingers.

1548
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,080
Do you want to just flail around and do as much as possible?

1549
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,440
Like, I don't know, there's no real...

1550
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:50,240
Or is it better to aim for smaller targets, secrets?

1551
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,040
I think it just depends on your skill level.

1552
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:53,440
Yes.

1553
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:58,960
I'm a smaller target secret guy and I feel like I always tell myself, like,

1554
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,920
look up the secrets before you go on and I always forget to.

1555
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,600
But I definitely, I try to like...

1556
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,240
My accuracy is always very low.

1557
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:11,840
I try to shoot as much as I can, but I'm saving those shots for the harder targets,

1558
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,840
for better or worse by and large.

1559
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:16,000
If I feel like it's been a little while and I haven't gotten anything, I'm like,

1560
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,480
maybe let me go down to the easier ones, knock out a couple of quick points,

1561
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,760
and then go back up to the little guys.

1562
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:24,560
I think you can really rack up points with quantity on the lower ones.

1563
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:29,200
But I think where I get competitive is like, I want to get those high...

1564
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:30,320
Of course.

1565
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:36,000
Even maybe even more competitive than with the person next to me.

1566
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:42,560
I'm like, I want to get that airplane that's really far away or I want to get the one that's moving.

1567
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,040
You know what?

1568
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:43,520
Here's...

1569
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,400
You want it for yourself.

1570
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,280
Here's another thing this ride has on web slingers.

1571
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:52,640
Web slingers, it's just all of those goddamn spider bots who essentially look the same

1572
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:57,280
with almost no variation, and then you end each room with like a major spider bot.

1573
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,160
The targets are so different in this and there is that fun kind of like...

1574
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,680
They react differently.

1575
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,760
You know, there's the added bonus to like, if you get a harder target,

1576
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,360
you get a little fun animation, maybe a little alien launches, you know?

1577
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,560
And there's also an ASMR aspect to it too.

1578
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,240
There's a very satisfying...

1579
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:18,560
Like the plate breaking is very satisfying noise.

1580
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,640
The balloon popping is very satisfying.

1581
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,080
Like when I hear it and when I've done it, I feel good.

1582
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,840
Like there's some extra level of it.

1583
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,120
And the variation is really valuable.

1584
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:33,120
The fact that you're changing sort of materials, projectiles every time.

1585
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,800
And that it does still feel kind of tangible to you.

1586
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,560
Everything flies a little differently.

1587
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:38,880
Yeah.

1588
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:39,440
You do have to...

1589
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:43,040
It's a little adjust, like this thing doesn't launch in the same way.

1590
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:43,280
Right.

1591
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,400
This is blunter.

1592
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:49,600
It's interesting, Jason, I never had noticed that it was a cannon before now.

1593
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:56,480
But it is such an odd like weapon because it's not like astro blasters or Men in Black,

1594
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,120
where you just have like a gun, right?

1595
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,000
Or Spider-Man where you're just flailing your arms around.

1596
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:02,400
Right.

1597
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:08,240
It's like this odd pull string mechanism that it seems bizarre,

1598
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,720
but there's something about it being this one central thing

1599
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:16,400
that doesn't represent any of the activities better or worse than any others,

1600
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,520
if that makes any sense.

1601
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:21,760
It's funny we're talking about this ride perhaps and the whole relationship.

1602
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:27,360
It's all about Disney maintaining their relationship with Steve Jobs and everything.

1603
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,000
Yeah.

1604
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,920
There's like an Apple level of simplicity into the single button and now to the no buttons

1605
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,120
that we had, like how much you're able to do on all these devices with very little...

1606
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:41,360
But the aerodynamics of a ring are different from a projectile that you're shooting

1607
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,200
or throwing a dart or whatever.

1608
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:48,000
You're still using the same physical motion, but as you said, the arc of it,

1609
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,360
as you're launching it, you have that adaptation process every time of like,

1610
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:52,480
I got to adjust.

1611
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:57,360
But how do they possibly land on this single thing that is meant to represent

1612
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:02,080
throwing a dart or launching an egg or a rubber dart?

1613
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:08,240
Is there a real game that has a pull string thing?

1614
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,520
Does that have a basis in something?

1615
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:10,720
No, but it's what you said, right?

1616
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:13,280
That it was taken from this Pirates of the Caribbean thing.

1617
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:17,280
Yeah, I think that's where the early version started.

1618
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,360
That's like a fuse a little bit on it.

1619
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,240
Right, that must be...

1620
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:28,320
And Jim and Lem pointed out, it is amazing that this thing looks like string,

1621
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:32,880
like a pull string and people are yanking on them all day long

1622
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,240
and they always seem to be in pretty good shape.

1623
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,680
I think that took a lot of engineering.

1624
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:41,280
That's a great call, because this is the kind of ride where you imagine,

1625
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,960
if I go on this in two years, it's going to be gnarly.

1626
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,080
It's going to be like...

1627
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:49,760
Well, it's like Astro Blasters, where sometimes you get a really bad gun

1628
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:55,200
and Astro Blasters is hanging down and it doesn't even fit in the holder anymore.

1629
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:57,760
Yeah, but they always work.

1630
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:58,400
I've never had...

1631
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,440
I think the first game when we were just playing, we were like,

1632
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,480
is this a little off today?

1633
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,120
But it's always consistent, by and large.

1634
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:07,360
You're not dealing with like, oh, this one's frayed.

1635
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:13,280
There's not even just on a tactical level in terms of what you're engaging with.

1636
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,840
Any degradation I really sense there.

1637
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,800
It always really works and there's never...

1638
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,120
Sometimes a round will end and you'll go, oh, that was it,

1639
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,720
especially compared to who you're sitting with,

1640
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,840
but you never bomb out.

1641
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,360
You get enough satisfaction, you're getting those sounds that you want, Mike.

1642
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:38,080
It's like even in one that's a little lesser, it's not like, well, I didn't hit anything.

1643
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:38,960
Yes.

1644
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:39,440
Yeah, yeah.

1645
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:40,400
It's like impossible.

1646
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:40,960
Right, right.

1647
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:46,320
It does pass that sort of like 8 to 80 test and it also just is fun.

1648
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,320
It's like aesthetically pleasing.

1649
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,680
There's such a variety.

1650
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,360
The music is so upbeat.

1651
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:55,200
You have your nice toy friends saying like, great job.

1652
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,160
They always say great job.

1653
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:58,720
That's right.

1654
01:13:58,720 --> 01:13:59,840
It's very encouraging.

1655
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,200
It's not like too quippy.

1656
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,400
It doesn't feel like they're overloading jokes.

1657
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,880
They're letting you focus on the task at hand.

1658
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,560
Yes, and they're not throwing too much at you,

1659
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,800
which is what all these other rides generally do.

1660
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,360
Because if there's an element, and I've said like,

1661
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,920
obviously Transformers is a screen ride that throws a lot at you,

1662
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:18,880
but you don't have to shoot.

1663
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,160
If you were to shoot on Transformers as well, it'd be insane.

1664
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:23,760
But this is simple.

1665
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:27,840
It stays in one spot and it's just clean and easy.

1666
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:32,560
And Astro Blasters and what's Men in Black called Alien Attack?

1667
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:39,120
Yeah, they have the benefit of it being like a classical dark track ride.

1668
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,800
So whether or not you're doing well in the game,

1669
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,960
you're still getting the experience of going through a cool themed area.

1670
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:46,320
Right.

1671
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:50,000
Like the Toy Story thing felt like, oh, this is the beginning of something new.

1672
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
And then no one else has really done it successfully since then.

1673
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:55,440
Right.

1674
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:59,120
Because there's something about I think again, where you come back to that,

1675
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:03,360
it's a construct thing where like you don't think about that really,

1676
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:06,480
that you're just landing at TV after TV.

1677
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:06,560
Right.

1678
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,720
But oddly, if the ride is trying to do something more immersive than that,

1679
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,120
then you just think, well, I'm just going from TV to TV.

1680
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,880
It becomes so much more aware of it.

1681
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:15,360
Yeah.

1682
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:15,920
Yeah.

1683
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:20,080
And in like Spider-Man 2, I think I was saying this on the Marvel episode.

1684
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,440
It's like they don't put any villains in it.

1685
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:26,000
Which is which is weird.

1686
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,320
But then, OK, so it's relentless spider bots.

1687
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:34,080
If it was just maybe like spider training and this one level is like we're shooting

1688
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,720
what I was saying before, like taking the barrel and whipping it.

1689
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:39,360
And it's like a much simpler static task.

1690
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,360
Well, I bet it might be more satisfying.

1691
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,200
What is that also getting at, Mike, too?

1692
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,720
It's lowering the stakes.

1693
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,160
It's not putting the pressure on you.

1694
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:48,240
It's not making it feel like a swarm game.

1695
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:51,280
It's not like Peter Parker, like sing like, I fucked up.

1696
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,560
You have to fix this for me.

1697
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:53,200
Right.

1698
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,680
It's just kind of like, hey, I'll teach you how to be Spider-Man.

1699
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:55,840
Yeah.

1700
01:15:55,840 --> 01:16:00,160
Even if there is a scoring system there, it's like that's the kind of let me relax.

1701
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,680
Tell me I'm going to do a good job.

1702
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:02,160
Right.

1703
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:05,200
Not going to do if we're not going to get attacked by the Hobgoblin.

1704
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:05,440
Right.

1705
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,960
And we're not going to do any of that.

1706
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,000
Might be weird, right?

1707
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,920
Shit with the Sony Disney deal.

1708
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,000
Like, who fucking knows who they can and can't use?

1709
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:12,720
Yes, very possible.

1710
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:13,680
But we're not going to do that.

1711
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:14,080
Yes.

1712
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:18,080
A simpler Spider-Man training simulation with points.

1713
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:18,320
Right.

1714
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,800
If he was like Mr. Stark made me this training facility.

1715
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,640
This is like Spider-Man's danger room.

1716
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:22,880
Right.

1717
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:23,520
Yes, sure.

1718
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:28,400
And it's like you have robots coming at you, but they're not just a thousand of the same

1719
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:28,960
little thing.

1720
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,640
It's different types of tests.

1721
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:30,880
Yes.

1722
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:35,840
By the way, if it was danger room ride and it was we got to wear the visor, Jason and I would.

1723
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:40,560
We would be like, as orgasmic as at the end of Toy Story with the Omanians.

1724
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:46,720
It just really kind of feels like the web slingers concept should be applied to the danger room.

1725
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:47,280
Sure.

1726
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:47,600
Yes.

1727
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:52,640
But yeah, no, I've said before I want Cyclops's visor on this ride.

1728
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:55,520
But that's again, maybe not going to because of rights.

1729
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:56,000
I don't know.

1730
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,480
Although Iron Man's you can get as repulsed you buy as repulser.

1731
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,800
So I guess you can use Iron Man on this.

1732
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:05,120
Yeah, we were looking at the all the well, I mean, this isn't a web slingers episode.

1733
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:05,680
I'm sorry.

1734
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,280
I was like, I'm not like racing to do one.

1735
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,800
So if we want to do a mini one.

1736
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,040
Yeah, I want to get better at web slingers.

1737
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,120
Also, if you yeah, I want to get better at it.

1738
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:18,480
I would like to do it a bunch of times and figure out like how to do the satisfying things

1739
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,000
that I supposedly can do.

1740
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,680
I mean, your line, Scott, when we walked off was like, I don't think I'd be capable

1741
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,040
of doing an episode after that.

1742
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,920
I don't think I really could process what was happening.

1743
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:28,640
I would have to.

1744
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,280
Yeah, a lot of ride throughs, a lot of videos.

1745
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:33,680
Also, just down that car.

1746
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:34,720
They Manhattan also.

1747
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,080
So it's just, I don't know.

1748
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,560
I just I'm sorry.

1749
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,040
What happened?

1750
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,880
I think that might have helped, though.

1751
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:41,600
I don't know.

1752
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,240
Yeah.

1753
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:42,740
Yeah.

1754
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,800
But yeah, I just have all that stuff.

1755
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,880
It's like it's overthinking.

1756
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:53,440
And I'm sure they put a lot of thought into Toy Story, but like it feels like they didn't

1757
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:53,920
overthink.

1758
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:57,520
It seems like some of this or some of this older imagineering.

1759
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:02,480
I don't mean because you never want it to be like it was only good before.

1760
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:05,200
But we're talking about things in 2008 and 10 and 12.

1761
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:05,680
Yeah, right.

1762
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:09,360
And it's and we praise things when they are good when they come out now.

1763
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:10,640
So it's not cut and dry like that.

1764
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:11,600
But it does.

1765
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,320
I do just think about this guy, Kevin Rafferty.

1766
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:20,800
He seems like his aim is a lot, a lot of thought then in the most simple.

1767
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,840
It comes back around to simplicity.

1768
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:28,960
But so much is put into what seems like a simple, breezy experience.

1769
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,160
And I feel like lately there's a lot more of these things that are like, oh, yeah,

1770
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:34,960
the complication of it is showing.

1771
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,720
And they think that's part of the appeal.

1772
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:37,920
Look how much work we've done.

1773
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:40,720
I had not done.

1774
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:43,840
I done neither Galaxy's Edge nor Avengers Campus.

1775
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,080
I was doing it for the first time with you guys.

1776
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:52,080
And, you know, I had had I've read less about Avengers Campus.

1777
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:56,480
I've been waiting very long to go to Galaxy's Edge and have read all the

1778
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:01,200
waves of response on everything, you know, tried to do Rise without spoilers,

1779
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:04,240
but certainly the response to the land and like the obvious complaints of like,

1780
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,080
why are you not putting all the classic stuff in here?

1781
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,760
Why aren't we getting to see everything we want to see?

1782
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:10,720
Why is it a new planet?

1783
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:13,680
Why is it more focused on the Disney or all this sort of stuff?

1784
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,480
And I was like, I don't think that's going to bug me.

1785
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,160
I like these Disney movies more than most people.

1786
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:21,840
I just want to walk around Star Wars land and I get there and I did feel the absence

1787
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,360
of all these things.

1788
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,040
And then we walked over to Avengers Campus.

1789
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,120
It was not very crowded the day we were there.

1790
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:30,960
I think that area is probably super underwhelming if you have to deal with a lot of hassle to go

1791
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:31,680
through it.

1792
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:35,040
But the second we walked there, we saw three superheroes.

1793
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,960
Like we walked there, we were like, oh, there's Shang-Chi.

1794
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,320
Oh, look, Captain Marvel's over there.

1795
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,840
Wasp is up there on the ledge.

1796
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,800
And then we left and then we came back through to get like drinks.

1797
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,440
And then we were like, oh, Captain Thor's there.

1798
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,640
Loki's on the ledge.

1799
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:51,040
And then the third time we came by, we saw like a different combination of three superheroes.

1800
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:55,440
And you're just like, man, that really fucking works that you just walk through this Marvel

1801
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:59,520
area, which is visually the least interesting thing in the world because all Marvel movies

1802
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,920
look like like concrete military bases now.

1803
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:02,480
Right?

1804
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:05,440
All your favorite shades of gray and brown are here.

1805
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:05,680
Right.

1806
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:11,680
Like it looks very boring during the day and they don't have enough well defined

1807
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:15,040
Marvel landmarks to even be able to replicate.

1808
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:19,200
Like now that they've gotten rid of the Avengers tower and all these things, movies and whatever,

1809
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,480
they should just fucking build the tower.

1810
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:24,080
Well, it's a different it's the Marvel theme park universe, right?

1811
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:24,400
Right.

1812
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,360
That's how they so it's a different because Tony Stark's not dead in.

1813
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:27,600
Right.

1814
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,560
And so they could.

1815
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:29,680
They should.

1816
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:35,520
And like, but even still, the characters being there goes such a long way.

1817
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:35,840
Oh, yeah.

1818
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,120
Having them walking around.

1819
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:41,360
And I think that so much of the Toy Story mania value too is just like they have these

1820
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:46,720
other rides where it's like Astro Blasters is essentially just a ride of like the Buzz

1821
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:50,160
Lightyear in universe Buzz Lightyear, the real man, not the action figure.

1822
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:50,480
Right.

1823
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,320
Like that's what Astro Blasters is.

1824
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:53,920
Actually, yeah, it is.

1825
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:58,480
Wow, that idea kind of is around the same time that they do that Star Command cartoon show.

1826
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:04,320
And it's sort of like between that and the opening of Toy Story 2 and the stuff that's

1827
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:10,800
now going to be retconned by the Chris Evans movie and quality.

1828
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:11,280
Right.

1829
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,240
But then you have things like Slinky Dog Dash or whatever, where it's like, well,

1830
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:17,120
you're like covering like one tiny sliver of Toy Story.

1831
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,320
There's so much representation.

1832
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,600
These movies are so big.

1833
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,520
There's so many characters that can do so many things.

1834
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,320
This is the one ride where you just kind of get to see everybody.

1835
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:25,360
Yeah.

1836
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:28,960
And even though it's still mostly screen based, it's like, well, but it's just it's

1837
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,520
top tier animation and really good voice work.

1838
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:31,840
Yes.

1839
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:32,400
Yeah.

1840
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:32,800
Yes.

1841
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,960
Because like, yeah, if it's your movie, you want to see everyone.

1842
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:37,200
Right.

1843
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,880
It's just nice to spend time with everyone.

1844
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:46,000
Like, you know, I came out here when the ride had opened and I was like begging friends

1845
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,080
to go and they were like, why do you care so much about this?

1846
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,440
I was like, you don't understand.

1847
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,600
I haven't been able to see my friends for like nine years.

1848
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:55,280
You know, it like really was a thing for me where it was just like for so long,

1849
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:58,720
it felt like Toy Story 3 was never going to get made because of the legal stuff.

1850
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:03,280
And even though I knew at that point it was going to open, I was just like to be able

1851
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:07,680
to like sit there and see them again felt so big to me.

1852
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:08,240
You know?

1853
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,160
And they're behaving like themselves.

1854
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,040
They're correct.

1855
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:11,840
They're correct.

1856
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,080
Right.

1857
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:20,240
I in terms of complications, I think the complicated stuff is all behind the scenes.

1858
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:27,360
Like I read an Internet Archive article from the website Design News and it's all about like

1859
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,360
there's three big computer systems.

1860
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:31,040
There's a system for the vehicles.

1861
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,240
There's a system for the games.

1862
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:38,080
There's a system for the special effects and they all work together and they all

1863
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,000
there's a lot of automation going on.

1864
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,040
There's a lot of like fail safes where it's like, oh, the way these ride vehicles move,

1865
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:49,440
if they don't land in the same exact spot every time, that's OK because the computer

1866
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:52,160
will auto correct it and you won't even notice.

1867
01:22:53,680 --> 01:23:01,680
To think that this cost, it only cost 80 million dollars to then develop this stuff

1868
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:03,200
they had never done before.

1869
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:10,480
And I mean, inflation being what it is, but like you hear the price tag that each rise

1870
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:15,680
of the resistance cost 500 million and those are also very impressive, but it's almost

1871
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:20,640
like I don't there are parts reading about how they execute everything on Toy Story

1872
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:24,080
Mamia where I'm like, well, this is almost more impressive.

1873
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:27,840
It makes it all the more surprising they don't refresh it every five years.

1874
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,760
Because it's like the heavy duty work's already been done.

1875
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:36,880
Yeah, all you need to do is really like do new animation and come up with a new.

1876
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:40,640
Yeah, well, here's a yeah, because I'm going to propose sort of game by gaming in a little

1877
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:44,880
bit and I think maybe one issue is like, what do you get rid of?

1878
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:49,840
Not to say it's going to be forever, but like that, you know, is it just does that

1879
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:54,080
Trixie slot have to be that one is for the new?

1880
01:23:54,080 --> 01:24:00,880
Not necessarily, but I also like I do think I don't know the inner workings of this,

1881
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,040
but I do feel like they could be like we have a rotation of 10 now.

1882
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:05,920
Well, yeah, like a start.

1883
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:06,800
Yeah, like start tours.

1884
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:07,840
There's no replete.

1885
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,040
You aren't even thinking about replete.

1886
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:09,280
Right.

1887
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,800
I mean, it's seasonal or maybe it's this or maybe it's that or you don't know which

1888
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:16,880
ones you're going to write, but like it just feels like you could go like this year

1889
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,360
we're adding to we're moving this one.

1890
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:25,360
Yeah, but nothing's ever like sort of permanently retired or just drove by.

1891
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:32,720
Yeah, I think that like it's probably a victim of it being too popular.

1892
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:38,320
So also, because they don't see the reason it's be better if they just like put some

1893
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:43,600
static figures on the California Screamin of the Incredibles to like try to get the

1894
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:44,720
numbers up on that.

1895
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:54,720
You know, I'm also guessing that the updates, the adding Buttercup to Ham and the Dino one

1896
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:58,720
were probably done at the same time as the originals and they just held on to them for

1897
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,000
two years until the movie had come out.

1898
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:00,960
I would not be surprised.

1899
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:02,720
That was probably all done.

1900
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,600
Now they'd have to like crack it all open again.

1901
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,840
Right, because like Monsters After Dark was started like that was being developed

1902
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:10,880
concurrently, right?

1903
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:11,040
Right.

1904
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:15,200
I bet the other time that that's like, let's slip it in.

1905
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:15,680
Let's slip it in.

1906
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:17,440
Just like you had a decade.

1907
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:23,440
There's nine years between Toy Story 3 and 4 and that movie kept on getting delayed

1908
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,320
and was a problem.

1909
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:28,240
They only have more and more time to like throw stuff in there.

1910
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:32,400
And now that the movie, like the characters have been well received and Forky is here

1911
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:36,560
to stay, it's just like they want a Forky talk.

1912
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,560
I want a game where you're throwing.

1913
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:39,840
You're really just my best friend.

1914
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,400
You want to hang out with Forky a little bit.

1915
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,880
Are you throwing lots of Forky's?

1916
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:45,440
I don't know.

1917
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,080
No, you know what?

1918
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,920
No, you should shoot forks.

1919
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:48,960
Well, you could do that.

1920
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,960
But also the other thing, obviously, is a Forky loves trash.

1921
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:52,160
Yes, sure.

1922
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:55,680
There's an obvious sort of trash game where you're trying to throw trash into bins.

1923
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:56,240
I feel like.

1924
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:57,840
Interesting.

1925
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:01,840
You're trying to get trash to Forky.

1926
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:02,800
He's in the can.

1927
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,960
He keeps on popping up in cans and you're trying to.

1928
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,160
Is it different kinds of...

1929
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:09,280
I just came up with this idea.

1930
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:09,600
So let's...

1931
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:13,600
Well, no, but like it would have to be consistently the same trash, I assume.

1932
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,120
Like, so would it be like crumpled up paper?

1933
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,800
That's what I'm picturing in my mind.

1934
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,080
Yeah, sort of a crumpled up ball.

1935
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:18,640
It's the most basic.

1936
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:19,040
Yeah.

1937
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,120
Yeah, not banana peels or something.

1938
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:26,160
Well, one thing I read that they didn't do, like they had a bunch of potential games

1939
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:29,840
because, you know, they're trying to correspond to real with real Midway games.

1940
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:30,000
Right.

1941
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:38,160
And the one was the, you know, at not a simulated Midway, at a real Midway, you fire the water

1942
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:41,120
and your horse or your whatever runs along the race.

1943
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:43,760
They talked about doing that with Rex.

1944
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,720
And I'm like, Rex?

1945
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:45,360
That would be fun.

1946
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:46,640
You got a fucking horse.

1947
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:49,840
He said Bullseye is the horse.

1948
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,280
That would actually be the like, that's the game is usually a horse race.

1949
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:54,240
Yeah.

1950
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:55,440
Yeah.

1951
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:58,960
But I feel like Rex upstages Bullseye a lot.

1952
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,560
Isn't Rex the bigger character?

1953
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,600
Rex is a bigger character.

1954
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:01,760
Yeah.

1955
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:02,720
And I think that...

1956
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:03,360
Couldn't they race?

1957
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:04,640
Couldn't the both of them race or something?

1958
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:08,560
Bullseye is another character who I think is sort of was given a bad shake.

1959
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,400
I mean, that's probably fair.

1960
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:14,960
Also that game, like the racing, you know, kind of game, nothing is destroyed.

1961
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,360
A lot of these are destroying balloons or plates.

1962
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:18,080
Oh, sure.

1963
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:18,480
Sure.

1964
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:18,800
Sure.

1965
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:19,040
Sure.

1966
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,240
It's such a difference.

1967
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,000
Yeah, you'd have to like shoot the horses and then...

1968
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:22,320
Right.

1969
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,360
That's not going to be good.

1970
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:23,840
Yeah.

1971
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:31,440
Oh, there was an early pitch that was trying to knock down Mr. Potato Head and make his pieces come

1972
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:34,720
off in a dunking booth kind of way.

1973
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:37,040
And then that helps them land on...

1974
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:39,120
I don't know if you want to shoot at the characters.

1975
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:40,080
I think that's weird.

1976
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:41,360
I think it's got to be these...

1977
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,760
And it's not even characters at all, really.

1978
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:44,000
Right.

1979
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:49,520
Besides the army men who like want that, they want to get hit with the rings so they can

1980
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:50,160
fly away.

1981
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:50,800
They want it.

1982
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,720
Yeah, and they're also like...

1983
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:53,280
The aliens.

1984
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:53,760
The aliens.

1985
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:54,320
Wait, what did I say?

1986
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,200
You said army men.

1987
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:55,840
Oh, yeah, sorry.

1988
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:56,640
Yeah, yeah, aliens.

1989
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:57,120
Yeah.

1990
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:01,680
But you do have like army men in that too where it's just like, oh, those are like kind of

1991
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:05,440
the grunt characters, you know, where they're just like...

1992
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:06,640
Build defined.

1993
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:07,120
So...

1994
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:08,240
Right, and they're just lesion.

1995
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:14,880
But it does help that our hero characters are all sort of playing like Barker.

1996
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:15,920
Yes.

1997
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:16,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1998
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:17,840
They're not even really in it.

1999
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,360
They're running the game for you.

2000
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:20,640
Which is sort of what they...

2001
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:24,960
Yeah, I think the idea was probably more like...

2002
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:29,920
This is sort of in the line of the Simpsons ride where it's booths and the characters

2003
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:31,520
are there and they stay at the booth.

2004
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,000
Right.

2005
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,320
And that was probably more the idea was something like that.

2006
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:40,080
You land at a booth and like step right almost the way Mr. Potato Head is outside.

2007
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,400
But then instead, it's these like brief appearances and they slide out of the way

2008
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,480
because you don't want them around consistently.

2009
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:51,120
All right, so let me throw out a couple because we can talk about secrets a little bit too.

2010
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:53,040
Or how are you getting good at these things?

2011
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,200
First things, ham and buttercup.

2012
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,400
You're throwing eggs.

2013
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,200
Right, ham and eggs.

2014
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,600
It's like, oh, we're the seven miters of Barnyard animals.

2015
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:00,160
What is the...

2016
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:01,760
What's the secret here?

2017
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:02,880
It involves the barn.

2018
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:08,640
Yeah, this one I always forget because I know the volcano one and I know the...

2019
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:11,120
The rocket.

2020
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:12,080
The rocket, excuse me.

2021
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:18,080
Yeah, but the barn one, I haven't been waiting to look it up and now I'm not in my right spot.

2022
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:18,720
No, sure.

2023
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:21,920
Now everyone's waiting for me.

2024
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,360
I will say, at like the time they...

2025
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:24,960
You're losing points.

2026
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:25,920
Hold on a second.

2027
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,160
Everyone, let's practice for a moment.

2028
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:30,240
You're not going to be best in vehicle at this rate.

2029
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:37,440
At the time they added this, it kind of warmed my heart because

2030
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:41,600
buttercup and ham only get to meet at the very end of Toy Story 3.

2031
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:46,320
Then there's like a little after credit bit when they're doing all the sort of like odds

2032
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:49,680
and ends, little like blackout jokes in the end credits of that movie to

2033
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:52,880
Randy Newman's Academy Award winning song, We Belong Together,

2034
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,640
where you're like, oh, these guys are a good match.

2035
01:29:57,280 --> 01:30:00,160
Like, not just these two characters, but like Ratzenberger and Garfield.

2036
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:01,440
And the similar comic energy.

2037
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,440
There's funny to have these two guys, right?

2038
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:07,680
Where it's nice that you're like, oh, you get to like watch the two of them being buddies.

2039
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,320
You know that they're on the same page.

2040
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,600
They're running a business together.

2041
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:12,400
Right. It's fun.

2042
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:12,960
Nice feeling.

2043
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:13,280
It's fun.

2044
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:18,400
As opposed to all the other ones where you're just like, well, obvious pairing, you know, like

2045
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:22,080
Trixie and Rex, I guess is the same thing too, where you're like destined.

2046
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:22,800
Right.

2047
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:23,360
Here we go.

2048
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,320
From the same line.

2049
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:29,200
They've done more Trixie Rex stuff since this.

2050
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:29,840
Yeah.

2051
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,840
So this is the start of it, which is nice.

2052
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:32,000
Yeah.

2053
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:33,360
I found it.

2054
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:37,600
You have to hit the 500 point gophers at the bottom of the screen and make sure to hit the fox on the

2055
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,520
hen house in the bottom corner as well.

2056
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:42,800
Next, you want to aim for the 100 point pigs on the lower fence.

2057
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:47,600
Once you've cleared them, a cat will appear in the same general area with a 500 point value.

2058
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:51,520
Continue to repeat the process and each time the cat target point value will increase

2059
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,080
from 500 to 1000 to 2000.

2060
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:57,440
So it's a very specific order you have to do.

2061
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:57,760
Yes.

2062
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:59,920
But look for this cat, maybe.

2063
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:01,120
The cat is, yes.

2064
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,600
And then it tells you you should have like 50,000 points by the end of this.

2065
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,200
But there's nothing that like opens it.

2066
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:11,680
There's no like big ticket item where I, in my head, like the bar opens up or something.

2067
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:14,960
It doesn't say that on here.

2068
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,000
That might be the case.

2069
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:16,960
I just found one.

2070
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:20,960
This is the one site I think I've been to before, but maybe, yeah, maybe there's a different secret

2071
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,480
that I'm not even aware of.

2072
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:27,840
These are like sequences and Easter eggs that like, if you don't do them in the game

2073
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:31,920
or you aren't aware of them, it doesn't detract from your enjoyment.

2074
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:32,640
No, which is a he.

2075
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:33,600
It's just little secrets.

2076
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:33,840
Yeah.

2077
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:37,200
That maybe increase your score, but that's what I'm saying.

2078
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:40,160
Maybe in the pursuit of it, you can end up doing worse.

2079
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:42,560
That's why you're trying so hard to get the secret.

2080
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,960
It's not dissimilar to on Buzz Lightyear.

2081
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:50,640
If you know the color codes, like, oh, this color target is worth more points than this

2082
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:51,440
color target.

2083
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:53,200
That was the earlier iteration.

2084
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:54,080
Yes.

2085
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:58,320
But yeah, you would never know.

2086
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:01,520
It's not like you get upset because it's just as fun to play without the secret.

2087
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,840
But once I learned the secrets, I was elated.

2088
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:07,040
Not this little one because I didn't know it, but the ones that I know.

2089
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:11,680
Now, I think that well, here's we'll go in around two, which is Rex and Trixie's

2090
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:12,560
Dino darts.

2091
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:17,280
It's all kind of centered around a volcano and balloons are flying around and you're

2092
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,640
hitting them with darts.

2093
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:22,960
And the secret is thin strips of lava.

2094
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,280
You want to hit those.

2095
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:26,160
Lava balloons.

2096
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:29,520
That causes the volcano to erupt with balloons.

2097
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:32,800
Now, that one, I think we both knew and we're both trying to get it.

2098
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,400
And we did both, I think, help each other.

2099
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:39,120
I think it was a very good round for both of us because I think if both people in your

2100
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:41,680
party are going for it, then it can benefit.

2101
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:45,360
It's not just the person trying to get it.

2102
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:45,680
Yeah.

2103
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:50,000
And we didn't even get to the point because if you get all those balloons, then meteors

2104
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:50,400
appear.

2105
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:51,600
Oh, yeah.

2106
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,200
I don't think I knew it.

2107
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:54,240
Those are even more.

2108
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:55,360
Those are worth more points.

2109
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:58,000
So we did not get to that point there.

2110
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,960
So that's an extra level of success.

2111
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:07,440
Now, I've also seen this tip about it that potentially it is possible that you can do

2112
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:10,240
better if you are flying solo.

2113
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:13,280
If there is not a person in the seat next to you.

2114
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:13,840
Interesting.

2115
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:21,200
And I got curious about previous scores that I have gotten.

2116
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:28,400
And I have two photos at different times where I took a photo of the screen after because

2117
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:32,960
I got the cat, a rare instance of getting a cat and not getting Beaver.

2118
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:33,520
Yeah.

2119
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:36,160
And in both instances, I was by myself.

2120
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:40,640
I'm sorry, just to clarify, you didn't get the Beaver, you got the pussy?

2121
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:40,880
Yes.

2122
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:44,720
I felt like it was being left on the table.

2123
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:47,280
Is that officially the balliest thing that's ever been said on this map?

2124
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:48,960
Failed to get Beaver did end up getting pussy.

2125
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,960
Can't even say it.

2126
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:53,360
They ended up pulling away from the mic upon seeing it.

2127
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:54,480
This is Patreon only now.

2128
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,480
This is Monsters After Dark, PTR Monsters After Dark.

2129
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:58,980
Yeah.

2130
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,520
I went down and I'm solo to get the pussy.

2131
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:06,720
And it didn't work out.

2132
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:07,200
You're so unnatural.

2133
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,920
You're like, you winced while you said that.

2134
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:14,640
He transforms into a different character as well, like different body language.

2135
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:16,000
And it's like a whole thing.

2136
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,480
It has to happen to have that word come up.

2137
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:19,840
Staring at the ground.

2138
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:22,400
I'm rubbing my hands together like I'm being a bad.

2139
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,680
You're like, I can't do that.

2140
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:24,640
I can't commit to this.

2141
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:26,560
He turns to like Igor or something.

2142
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,840
His eyes turn black.

2143
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:32,080
Peter Laurie voice would be appropriate for that.

2144
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:35,680
It's that special bottle at Napa Rose that he orders.

2145
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,080
Something happens.

2146
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:38,720
The Norbit.

2147
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,320
The two times you've gotten the cat.

2148
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:44,400
Yeah, were by myself.

2149
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,760
So which indicate.

2150
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2151
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:50,960
And I guess the logic there might be that the other person just gets in the way.

2152
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,520
It's with sex itself.

2153
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:57,520
Amen.

2154
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:06,720
Did that episode go to a very strange flavor of Habsden is only a vacation?

2155
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:10,560
No, no, it was masturbation only.

2156
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:12,560
Yeah, Habsden masturbation based.

2157
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:17,040
Habsden is just I can't follow what they're talking about.

2158
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:20,480
Are they too horny or not horny enough?

2159
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:23,920
What's the ultimate question from this for this podcast?

2160
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:25,840
Strange reading on all of these guys.

2161
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:31,840
Anyway, the real thing I'm saying, maybe there is something to this.

2162
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,640
So don't go with your friends anymore.

2163
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:35,520
Go by yourself.

2164
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:38,400
And if you're with your friends, say no, you're not getting on with.

2165
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,920
Break off your friendships.

2166
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,640
Ended right then and there.

2167
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:46,560
If there's a friendship that's teetering, take him to Disneyland, pay for it.

2168
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:47,600
It's a nice exit.

2169
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:51,440
Then they'll maybe have fun feelings for you, even though you say, hey,

2170
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:52,560
I don't really want to do this with you.

2171
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:53,200
Oh, the ride?

2172
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:54,240
No, the full thing.

2173
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:55,120
This is the end of life.

2174
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:59,360
Toy Story mania ruined my life.

2175
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:02,240
All I could do was play Toy Story mania.

2176
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:04,240
I could do nothing else.

2177
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:05,760
It had to be deep program.

2178
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:13,040
Yeah, I was going to say, like, I would like if somebody sometimes,

2179
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:15,760
like if you're on there with somebody who's like to I don't want to play

2180
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:17,920
or whatever, just tell them they don't even touch it.

2181
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:19,120
You know what?

2182
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:20,400
It will only help me.

2183
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,120
It's great advice.

2184
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:22,160
Let me do the work.

2185
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:23,040
Don't even touch it.

2186
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,680
If you don't want to play, don't even touch it.

2187
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:26,160
Don't even touch it.

2188
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:27,680
I guess the ride 2021.

2189
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:29,520
I'm Griffin Newman.

2190
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,840
Memify all of these.

2191
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:33,360
Yeah.

2192
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:35,120
Make us stare at everything we said.

2193
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:38,480
Somebody does an out of context Twitter account for podcast the ride

2194
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:41,360
where they just take quotes from episodes.

2195
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,040
And I don't remember anything.

2196
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:43,920
I don't remember anything.

2197
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:47,120
But this one will be I'll remember everything from this.

2198
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:51,680
Do you guys find I can't tell if I no longer remember anything

2199
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:54,640
because I've crossed whatever threshold of hours recorded

2200
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:59,600
or if it just the covid brain just done.

2201
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:00,960
My memory is fucked forever.

2202
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:02,720
It definitely accelerated the.

2203
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,680
Absolutely.

2204
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:04,240
Absolutely.

2205
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:07,040
I think it's maybe both at the same time, but I just really,

2206
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:09,520
when people quote back stuff to me from episodes,

2207
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:11,360
I have no idea what they're talking about anymore.

2208
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:13,280
And I used to have a pretty good memory.

2209
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:18,880
Yeah, I think we've had we would have to like talk about it a couple times.

2210
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,040
It would have to become like a baby Aladar.

2211
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:21,520
Right.

2212
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:22,720
That's how I gauge it.

2213
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:26,880
If it becomes a baby Aladar in our like we've mentioned it multiple times.

2214
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:27,360
Yeah.

2215
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,800
But yeah, that's what it takes now.

2216
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:32,240
Maybe if back when we had all only done, you know,

2217
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:35,040
one hundred and twenty five episodes.

2218
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:35,440
Yeah.

2219
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,680
But now that we're in whatever the hell we're at.

2220
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:37,920
Yeah.

2221
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:38,560
Mm hmm.

2222
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:41,840
Yeah, no, it's I have a pretty good memory.

2223
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:44,960
I just I yeah, a lot of stuff I go back.

2224
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,240
I go, oh, I don't remember that.

2225
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,920
And especially when it's out of context.

2226
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:48,720
No clue.

2227
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:50,720
Yeah, it sounds unhinged when it's out of context.

2228
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:51,280
Absolutely.

2229
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:51,920
Mm hmm.

2230
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:53,360
I'll sound just fine, though.

2231
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,520
I think the law makes sense and seem very clear.

2232
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:56,000
Yeah, this stuff.

2233
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,280
I'm not going to forget this episode.

2234
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,600
I will never forget this episode.

2235
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:02,160
Yeah, I am so sweaty, intense.

2236
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:05,040
And all this vulgarity and well, you know, I'm never going to forget it.

2237
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:08,240
I don't know if we've said we're recording in Scott's garage.

2238
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:08,640
Correct.

2239
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:09,760
We did lock the gates.

2240
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:12,560
I did say this is our first time recording in the garage.

2241
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:13,760
And you know what they say?

2242
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,680
You never forget your first time.

2243
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:18,880
So the cat ran and make it guys just come up to the garage.

2244
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:19,840
The cat ranch.

2245
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:21,440
Oh, Dennis Hoff died.

2246
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:27,200
Did we mention bunny bunny ranch cat, whatever the hell that brothel is called?

2247
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,880
Bunny ranch and the cat ranch are different.

2248
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:29,520
Yeah.

2249
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:30,240
Oh, excuse me.

2250
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:32,800
Excuse me, Mr. Expert.

2251
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:38,240
Yeah, so I don't know if podcast the right curse Dennis Hoff, owner of that brothel.

2252
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:39,920
I don't think we talk.

2253
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:40,960
Maybe we did talk.

2254
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:44,240
I mean, you haven't done a second gate episode on the bunny ranch, right?

2255
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:46,080
It's one of America's top attractions.

2256
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:46,880
One of the lunatics.

2257
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:48,000
We have not done a second.

2258
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:54,880
We did that long second gate series investigating the Phil Spector, Lana Clarkson.

2259
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:55,440
Right.

2260
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,120
And then he died.

2261
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:57,360
Yeah.

2262
01:38:57,360 --> 01:39:00,000
We were just asking for trouble with that 12 part series.

2263
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:03,120
You also you you almost cracked it.

2264
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:07,440
You guys came very close to cracking the figure out who really did it.

2265
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:08,160
Yes.

2266
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:08,320
Right.

2267
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:12,880
It's always been a little in question to look at Specter and I'm like, I don't think so.

2268
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:13,760
This guy.

2269
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:15,600
No, he's too steady.

2270
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:19,040
We got to get this guy out of jail and then God, we couldn't do it.

2271
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:21,520
We couldn't free the innocent Phil.

2272
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:27,680
It just doesn't line up with 50 prior years of extremely normal behavior from Phil Specter.

2273
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:30,080
Pulling guns on every person he's ever known.

2274
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:31,280
He never shot them.

2275
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:33,360
I don't believe he would pull the trigger.

2276
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:37,920
He had more practice than us who might accidentally pull a trigger the first time we pick up.

2277
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:41,040
He was the best at not shooting guns in a year.

2278
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:45,040
I'm going to look at that Twitter account and I go, are we Phil Spector truth?

2279
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:51,440
I remember saying that one where we declared what will happen is there'll be a guest and

2280
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,680
much like how you were saying that we said we never do.

2281
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:54,080
Toy Story.

2282
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:57,680
They go, well, there was the episode where you guys, I have to confront you about it.

2283
01:39:57,680 --> 01:40:01,360
You all believe Phil Spector was innocent and that's just not the case.

2284
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:06,160
You said he was good at guns and we're like, I don't think we said that.

2285
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:11,600
You said the made for TV made for HBO movie was David Mamet's most notorious work.

2286
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:15,040
Al Pacino's finest performance.

2287
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,480
Al Pacino's surprisingly textured in it.

2288
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:24,560
I found that more offensive than you absolving the actual man of murder.

2289
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:25,600
Very obvious.

2290
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:31,440
Like, wait, so wait, do you want to talk about King Arthur Carousel or not?

2291
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,600
No, that topic was that was a Trojan horse.

2292
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:37,520
I just wanted to get here and say, I really think that he did do the murder.

2293
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:40,160
We agree with you.

2294
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:42,320
It's really confusing.

2295
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:45,920
I heard you're on tape and it's on this out of context Twitter account.

2296
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:46,880
What else do you want?

2297
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:48,080
I guess here she's, I guess.

2298
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:50,160
You guys aren't innocent either.

2299
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:51,680
Yeah, we should.

2300
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:52,480
I mean, we should.

2301
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:56,800
It's funny this came up organically, but there was briefly the pitch that was going to be

2302
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,560
Phil Spector's Midway Mania.

2303
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:02,560
That was an early Kevin Rafferty idea.

2304
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:03,120
Right.

2305
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:06,080
You'd have to get those darts past the wall of sound.

2306
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:06,580
Yeah.

2307
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:11,200
And each scream was a different group that he very quickly alienated.

2308
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:11,700
Yeah.

2309
01:41:11,860 --> 01:41:12,360
Yeah.

2310
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:19,940
The transitions were going to be little tuning radio sketches like on that Ramones album.

2311
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:27,940
You'd have to somehow shoot orchestral parts on To Let It Be, angering Paul McCartney.

2312
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:33,060
Instead of the animatronic Mr. Potato Head, it's like the Christmas gift from Phil Spector going,

2313
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:35,220
thank you so much for coming to my ride.

2314
01:41:36,980 --> 01:41:39,780
Your so open as a nicer future for all of us.

2315
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:42,900
Never thought about that scary message.

2316
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:44,260
That's everything you need to know right there.

2317
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:45,780
It's the most fun Christmas set.

2318
01:41:45,780 --> 01:41:46,100
Wow.

2319
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:47,860
All every one of these is classic.

2320
01:41:47,860 --> 01:41:48,500
Oh god.

2321
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:49,940
And this is like muttering.

2322
01:41:50,580 --> 01:41:55,060
That's like whenever my family asks me to put Christmas music on, I put that on and it's a hit

2323
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:56,820
and people go, oh, good choice, Griff.

2324
01:41:56,820 --> 01:41:59,540
As if I haven't done it like every year for a decade.

2325
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:03,940
And then we get to that and there's just silence and everyone sort of doesn't know.

2326
01:42:03,940 --> 01:42:05,380
Like, should we talk over this?

2327
01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:07,220
Should we skip it?

2328
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:09,860
It's a pretty album in the future.

2329
01:42:09,860 --> 01:42:10,340
The devil.

2330
01:42:10,340 --> 01:42:12,420
Should I do a spoken word on this one too?

2331
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:17,780
The devil has shown up in the middle of Christmas to wish you well.

2332
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:20,260
And everyone's like, uh oh, the devil's here.

2333
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:22,180
I hope you have a great Christmas.

2334
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:30,420
If the devil just hops from body to body on this earth, was he just, was he Spector for a while?

2335
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:33,700
That was his 20th century body?

2336
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:35,860
Yeah, he produced some fantastic records.

2337
01:42:36,180 --> 01:42:38,100
And then he also did some awful shit.

2338
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:39,460
Great artists are dark.

2339
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:42,900
A Christmas gift to you from me, a Jewish murderer.

2340
01:42:47,540 --> 01:42:53,220
So green army men shoot camp is round three of the attraction.

2341
01:42:54,020 --> 01:42:55,860
I'm not your mother, break those plates.

2342
01:42:55,860 --> 01:42:58,420
Oh yeah, I gotta get my guide out here.

2343
01:42:58,420 --> 01:43:00,100
There's no secrets in this one, I don't think.

2344
01:43:01,140 --> 01:43:02,100
Hold on, there is.

2345
01:43:02,660 --> 01:43:04,580
There's no secrets, just like Phil Spector.

2346
01:43:04,580 --> 01:43:05,460
It was an open book.

2347
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:13,460
I would say, personally, this one might be the most satisfying.

2348
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:14,020
It's fun.

2349
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:15,380
The breaking the plates.

2350
01:43:17,380 --> 01:43:20,580
It's digital, but there's somehow a tactile feeling to it.

2351
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:22,340
The shards, yeah.

2352
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:23,460
Yeah, there's shards.

2353
01:43:23,460 --> 01:43:29,540
The next one might, the rings might be the most like, computer programming impressive

2354
01:43:29,540 --> 01:43:31,460
that they were able to like figure that out.

2355
01:43:31,460 --> 01:43:32,260
The arcs of it.

2356
01:43:32,260 --> 01:43:33,780
Getting up and over.

2357
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:36,820
Up and over and landing and then clearing.

2358
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:38,340
Okay, I have the secret here.

2359
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:41,380
At the start, break as many of the higher point plates that you can.

2360
01:43:41,380 --> 01:43:44,180
Two 2,000 point plates will pop up on each side of the horizon.

2361
01:43:44,180 --> 01:43:44,740
Hit them.

2362
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:47,700
They aren't static and will drop back down below the horizon if you don't hit them.

2363
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:51,380
Once this step is finished, the front of the mountain will sync to reveal a hidden army

2364
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:52,740
tank inside.

2365
01:43:52,740 --> 01:43:58,180
After the army tank reveal, a wave of four 2,000 point planes will pop up in succession

2366
01:43:58,180 --> 01:43:59,540
on each side of the mountain.

2367
01:43:59,540 --> 01:44:03,300
These two aren't static and will drop back down below the horizon if you don't hit them.

2368
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:08,580
Hit all eight 2,000 point plates as well as the 5,000 point plate that the tank shoots

2369
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:10,820
out at you and then repeat the process.

2370
01:44:10,820 --> 01:44:14,660
Make sure to hit all of the plates that the newly revealed tank throws out at you.

2371
01:44:15,940 --> 01:44:16,500
Wow.

2372
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:17,220
Wow.

2373
01:44:17,220 --> 01:44:21,300
I thought, I literally thought there was no secret and I feel like I've even seen things

2374
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:22,900
that said, yeah, there's not really a secret on this one.

2375
01:44:22,900 --> 01:44:25,300
I guess the secret is so complicated.

2376
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:25,700
It's very complicated.

2377
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:29,620
But like a, the hidden, like the real army shows up.

2378
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:32,420
Real military shows up on this ride.

2379
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:33,380
Both heard it.

2380
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:34,020
Blood red.

2381
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:39,700
This is like DisneyEveryday.com has these secrets here.

2382
01:44:39,700 --> 01:44:40,980
I don't want the secret.

2383
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:42,580
That sounds like that's doomsday.

2384
01:44:42,580 --> 01:44:43,460
Pretty intense.

2385
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:43,940
Yeah.

2386
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:49,300
See, this is a changing times, changing taste because this is what gaming with a perception

2387
01:44:49,300 --> 01:44:50,180
was in 2008.

2388
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:53,860
If you could do all of this really quick, you'll get all these extra points and bonuses

2389
01:44:53,860 --> 01:44:54,260
and stuff.

2390
01:44:54,260 --> 01:45:00,900
And now in 2021, the perception of gaming is I have called a SWAT team to your house.

2391
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:05,220
Because gamers, insane people.

2392
01:45:05,220 --> 01:45:07,620
They call SWAT, they SWAT.

2393
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:08,580
They SWAT PBS.

2394
01:45:08,580 --> 01:45:11,380
So this is, this is, this is SWATting in this round.

2395
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:11,620
Yeah.

2396
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:16,420
Well, like, or like you could, you should be able to like dock someone on one of these

2397
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:16,900
levels.

2398
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:17,940
Oh yeah.

2399
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:18,180
Yeah.

2400
01:45:18,180 --> 01:45:19,300
The social, yeah.

2401
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:21,780
It's like, here's the social security.

2402
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:23,300
That's the CID game.

2403
01:45:23,300 --> 01:45:23,460
Yeah.

2404
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:24,580
That's a good point.

2405
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:25,060
Yeah.

2406
01:45:25,060 --> 01:45:26,980
That's only available on the Oogie Boogie Band.

2407
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:31,140
But like, that's like, that's right there.

2408
01:45:31,220 --> 01:45:34,420
Like Halloween overlay should be mutant toys, right?

2409
01:45:34,980 --> 01:45:35,860
Of course.

2410
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:36,500
Yeah.

2411
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:37,540
CIDs toys.

2412
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:38,420
Oh, that's cool.

2413
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:40,180
It'd be fun to see them again after all this time.

2414
01:45:40,180 --> 01:45:41,140
How fucking cool would that be?

2415
01:45:41,140 --> 01:45:42,900
Put big babies staring at the moon in there.

2416
01:45:42,900 --> 01:45:45,860
Because Prospector comes in for like a moment at the end of the Woody and Jesse game.

2417
01:45:45,860 --> 01:45:51,460
But like, do a twisted Prospector game, Lotso, Gabby Gabby, the mutant toys.

2418
01:45:51,460 --> 01:45:52,820
And Treloquist dummies.

2419
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:53,540
Yeah.

2420
01:45:53,540 --> 01:45:54,260
Dude, perfect.

2421
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:56,580
Those, you could shoot those off of the shelves.

2422
01:45:56,580 --> 01:45:58,660
I think anybody would be happy to just watch them.

2423
01:45:58,660 --> 01:45:59,060
Yes.

2424
01:45:59,060 --> 01:46:00,260
They wouldn't die either.

2425
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:04,820
They just would fall in that weird broken limb kind of way and stare back at you.

2426
01:46:04,820 --> 01:46:05,460
That'd be great.

2427
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:06,660
It'd be really fun shooting them.

2428
01:46:07,620 --> 01:46:12,020
This tank reminds me too, when we were talking about how they were trying to figure out how

2429
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:18,180
to do this physically, there are at some amusement parks like bumper tanks that will shoot,

2430
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:19,860
you can shoot balls at each other.

2431
01:46:19,860 --> 01:46:23,540
And in theory, the tanks will then suck up the balls to use again.

2432
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:29,140
They're the most cumbersome, clumsy, barely work sort of thing.

2433
01:46:29,140 --> 01:46:32,660
Yeah, I've always wanted to do that one of those, honestly.

2434
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:34,340
I've never seen that ride in person.

2435
01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:38,900
I've seen those at like family fun spot kind of places in like,

2436
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:45,700
middle of New Jersey and you were looking around and you're like, is this a death trap?

2437
01:46:45,700 --> 01:46:46,820
We gotta find one of those.

2438
01:46:46,820 --> 01:46:50,020
Does Jigsaw run this? Family fun center?

2439
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:50,740
Yeah, we gotta get that.

2440
01:46:50,740 --> 01:46:51,700
We gotta find that.

2441
01:46:51,700 --> 01:46:52,580
We gotta go do that.

2442
01:46:53,780 --> 01:46:56,500
What's the ring toss is next?

2443
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:58,420
Buzz layers, flying tossers.

2444
01:46:59,540 --> 01:47:02,260
I think this is my favorite one.

2445
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:05,620
I love this one, but it is hard.

2446
01:47:05,620 --> 01:47:08,260
I find it hard to get the ring around the aliens.

2447
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:09,220
It's a good burn.

2448
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:14,420
Sometimes I get like real frustrated because I'm like just not in the groove.

2449
01:47:15,620 --> 01:47:18,020
It's the most challenging one, but that makes it fun.

2450
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:21,540
It's such a difference in the physics from all the other ones.

2451
01:47:21,540 --> 01:47:27,540
But I also just like the being able to unlock all the animation from the aliens.

2452
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:28,100
Oh, yeah.

2453
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:30,820
So this is where I shined.

2454
01:47:31,540 --> 01:47:33,220
This is where I pulled ahead.

2455
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:33,780
Yeah.

2456
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:34,500
Oh, really?

2457
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:35,460
There was a big jump in this.

2458
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:36,660
I got a huge jump.

2459
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:37,220
Yeah.

2460
01:47:37,220 --> 01:47:41,380
I was I've never done better this level because you have to get all the

2461
01:47:42,260 --> 01:47:46,020
aliens off of that rocket ship and then the rocket ship blasts off

2462
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:48,500
and then there's a giant mouth opening.

2463
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:51,060
Yeah, they call it a giganto bot.

2464
01:47:51,060 --> 01:47:54,500
Suddenly, it's a giganto bot with a big toothy mouth.

2465
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:58,420
And it closes his mouth and opens it again and then it's more points then.

2466
01:47:58,420 --> 01:48:02,820
So you have to do what I was in a very good groove with shooting things

2467
01:48:02,820 --> 01:48:06,260
when the mouth is closed and the mouth open again and I was immediately back in.

2468
01:48:06,260 --> 01:48:08,020
You were always right there and I wasn't.

2469
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:08,340
Yeah.

2470
01:48:08,340 --> 01:48:12,900
And that's where I got the points and I think it's the best I've ever done on that level.

2471
01:48:14,180 --> 01:48:17,380
And that is yeah, shooting it in the mouth is actually,

2472
01:48:17,380 --> 01:48:19,380
as long as you have the timing down, you don't have to actually

2473
01:48:20,340 --> 01:48:23,940
like the physics aren't a big problem because it's not like you have to get the ring off

2474
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:24,740
over a small thing.

2475
01:48:24,740 --> 01:48:26,660
It's just shoot it in its giant mouth.

2476
01:48:26,660 --> 01:48:26,980
Yeah.

2477
01:48:26,980 --> 01:48:27,540
Giganto or mouth.

2478
01:48:27,540 --> 01:48:29,940
It's just getting the timing right when you're shooting into the mouth.

2479
01:48:32,020 --> 01:48:33,540
Yeah, yeah, it's simple.

2480
01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:36,100
It's simple because the mouth is large.

2481
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:36,420
Right.

2482
01:48:36,420 --> 01:48:43,300
And then it's also in this level where you have to get these rings over the top of the rocket

2483
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:45,780
and get it down and slide it down the shaft.

2484
01:48:45,780 --> 01:48:47,380
And time is of the essence.

2485
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:47,780
Yeah, yeah.

2486
01:48:47,780 --> 01:48:48,340
Let's be honest.

2487
01:48:48,340 --> 01:48:54,260
Because you can getting that ring down to the base, which is a lot of pleasure once the ring,

2488
01:48:54,260 --> 01:48:56,500
when you see the ring slide down the shaft.

2489
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:59,940
Sometimes you screw it up and you get really like flopped sweat again.

2490
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:03,540
Well, sometimes you do too quickly and things just pop off real fast, you know?

2491
01:49:04,820 --> 01:49:05,060
Yeah.

2492
01:49:06,580 --> 01:49:11,060
And then, oh man, it's the dirtiest episode ever.

2493
01:49:11,060 --> 01:49:11,780
I don't know what you mean.

2494
01:49:11,780 --> 01:49:14,580
I was describing things that happen in Buzz Lightyear's flying concerts.

2495
01:49:14,580 --> 01:49:15,540
Classic Midway game.

2496
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:17,700
Not sure what you were hearing.

2497
01:49:17,700 --> 01:49:18,580
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

2498
01:49:18,580 --> 01:49:20,820
I just got called to dinner.

2499
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:22,740
I have a crass brain tonight.

2500
01:49:22,740 --> 01:49:23,940
I just keep hearing things.

2501
01:49:23,940 --> 01:49:27,540
It's the garage man telling me you put the boys in a garage.

2502
01:49:27,540 --> 01:49:29,700
In a dirty garage.

2503
01:49:29,700 --> 01:49:32,260
A dog, a van driving by.

2504
01:49:32,260 --> 01:49:34,820
Honestly, it's so good to finally have some man talk.

2505
01:49:36,660 --> 01:49:37,380
That's right.

2506
01:49:37,940 --> 01:49:42,180
My wife's asleep inside and I'm just out here with the boys at night.

2507
01:49:42,180 --> 01:49:43,460
The garage.

2508
01:49:43,460 --> 01:49:45,620
The dimly lit garage.

2509
01:49:45,700 --> 01:49:49,460
Making like giggly little innuendos about the Toy Story ride.

2510
01:49:50,100 --> 01:49:51,620
What a naughty podcast.

2511
01:49:51,620 --> 01:49:52,980
On the gates.

2512
01:49:52,980 --> 01:49:57,860
Those are dirty things we said about the squeaky alien game.

2513
01:49:59,460 --> 01:50:00,420
Did we do bad?

2514
01:50:02,580 --> 01:50:03,620
Then you go to the old west.

2515
01:50:03,620 --> 01:50:04,900
You go to the old west with Woody.

2516
01:50:05,700 --> 01:50:07,620
And this is very engrassing.

2517
01:50:07,620 --> 01:50:08,260
And Jessie.

2518
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:09,140
And Jessie, yeah.

2519
01:50:09,780 --> 01:50:10,900
Lest she be forgotten.

2520
01:50:12,580 --> 01:50:14,580
Well, and another thing not to be forgotten here.

2521
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:19,540
You always have to nod to the great work of Mr. Jim Hanks.

2522
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:21,300
False Tom Hanks.

2523
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:21,540
Right.

2524
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:22,340
Fake Woody.

2525
01:50:22,340 --> 01:50:24,340
He's the only fake voice in this.

2526
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:25,860
Yeah, I believe so.

2527
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:27,300
And you know, you could complain.

2528
01:50:27,300 --> 01:50:28,740
You could say they didn't spring for Tom.

2529
01:50:28,740 --> 01:50:30,580
And it is nice when you're watching the shorts.

2530
01:50:30,580 --> 01:50:33,540
Which not every short has Tom, but a lot of them have.

2531
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:35,300
They have like, shelled out for him.

2532
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:38,660
So it was always Jim for everything.

2533
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:40,020
That was like very much the thing.

2534
01:50:40,020 --> 01:50:41,700
Tom Hanks has talked about this in interviews.

2535
01:50:41,700 --> 01:50:43,940
That he was just like, there's so much of it.

2536
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:46,900
I just thought it would be a nice thing to like, give my brother a career.

2537
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:49,380
Like he never will be lacking for work.

2538
01:50:49,380 --> 01:50:52,420
And then when they renegotiated for Toy Story 3,

2539
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:57,940
part of the deal was that Tom had to do all of those shorts and specials.

2540
01:50:57,940 --> 01:50:59,060
They worked those all in.

2541
01:50:59,060 --> 01:50:59,300
Right.

2542
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:00,820
It was like a new deal for that.

2543
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:03,780
Because at that point, they thought 3 would absolutely be the last movie.

2544
01:51:03,780 --> 01:51:08,980
But they wanted some new stuff to last for the next six or seven years.

2545
01:51:08,980 --> 01:51:09,620
Yeah.

2546
01:51:09,620 --> 01:51:11,620
But maybe now he's off, like Robert Downey Jr.

2547
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:14,660
He's off the hook because they killed Woody at the end of 4.

2548
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:15,380
I think so.

2549
01:51:15,380 --> 01:51:16,820
Woody's noble sacrifice.

2550
01:51:17,540 --> 01:51:17,940
Right.

2551
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:22,820
But it's, yes, even from the beginning, it's sort of like always been Jim for everything.

2552
01:51:22,820 --> 01:51:26,020
And even post shorts, I think it's back to Jim for almost everything.

2553
01:51:26,020 --> 01:51:28,740
Because you can complain about Jim or you can accept Jim.

2554
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:32,500
Jim Hanks has been Woody more than a lot of people have been any character.

2555
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:33,220
That's the thing.

2556
01:51:33,220 --> 01:51:35,140
I mean, it's like, is there a difference?

2557
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:35,460
Yes.

2558
01:51:35,460 --> 01:51:37,300
But I like Jim Hanks Woody.

2559
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:40,500
Like I prefer Tom Woody, but Jim Hanks Woody.

2560
01:51:41,620 --> 01:51:42,900
It does feel valid to me.

2561
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:43,540
Yeah.

2562
01:51:43,540 --> 01:51:45,540
It's not like a Castellaneta Homer.

2563
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:46,820
No.

2564
01:51:46,820 --> 01:51:47,780
It feels good.

2565
01:51:47,780 --> 01:51:48,020
Yeah.

2566
01:51:48,020 --> 01:51:48,660
It feels right.

2567
01:51:48,660 --> 01:51:49,380
It feels good.

2568
01:51:49,380 --> 01:51:50,180
It feels good.

2569
01:51:50,180 --> 01:51:51,380
It feels really good.

2570
01:51:52,740 --> 01:51:57,620
And you're going to love the return of Woody, voiced by Chad Hanks.

2571
01:51:57,620 --> 01:51:58,120
Oh.

2572
01:51:59,060 --> 01:52:01,140
That's going to be really great.

2573
01:52:01,140 --> 01:52:04,900
Woody got a little crazy on his adventures this time around.

2574
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:10,340
Oh, Woody is speaking in poor patois, like inaccurate patois.

2575
01:52:10,340 --> 01:52:13,220
Woody is saying it's going to be a white cowboy summer.

2576
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:14,600
What?

2577
01:52:15,940 --> 01:52:16,900
It's really weird.

2578
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:21,460
He's questioning the vaccine for toys.

2579
01:52:21,460 --> 01:52:21,960
Yeah.

2580
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:29,940
If I can just recommend to people quickly, there's a video of Tom Hanks on the Graham Norton show.

2581
01:52:30,980 --> 01:52:34,260
I don't know what he's promoting, but it's clearly done when he's filming Sully.

2582
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:36,420
Because he's in like beautiful white haired mustache.

2583
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:38,340
I've seen whatever you're about to say, I think.

2584
01:52:38,580 --> 01:52:42,660
And Graham Norton's asking him about like, do you do the voice for the dolls?

2585
01:52:42,660 --> 01:52:45,460
He's like, no, that's Jim and this and that and whatever.

2586
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:47,460
And he's like asking about his process for doing it.

2587
01:52:47,460 --> 01:52:52,580
He does this impression of what it's like to do voiceover that I will not ruin for people.

2588
01:52:52,580 --> 01:52:53,940
That is so incredibly funny.

2589
01:52:53,940 --> 01:52:57,300
And it's one of those moments where you're like, oh, Tom Hanks really is just one of our best

2590
01:52:57,300 --> 01:52:58,660
performers ever.

2591
01:52:58,660 --> 01:53:04,180
The way he acts out an anecdote on a talk show is just kind of immaculate.

2592
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:04,680
Yeah.

2593
01:53:05,380 --> 01:53:06,580
It might have been on that show.

2594
01:53:06,580 --> 01:53:09,780
I feel like another time on Graham Norton is when he did the full

2595
01:53:09,780 --> 01:53:11,940
Dragnet City of Crime rap.

2596
01:53:11,940 --> 01:53:12,420
Yes.

2597
01:53:12,420 --> 01:53:16,180
Which is also in print that he's so able to do it exactly right.

2598
01:53:16,180 --> 01:53:17,940
And with all of the vocal risings.

2599
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:20,420
Remember that was sacrifice.

2600
01:53:20,420 --> 01:53:25,460
That's like, I mean, when Michael Keaton hosted SNL after like Birdman.

2601
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:25,860
Oh, yeah.

2602
01:53:25,860 --> 01:53:28,260
And they did this sketch that was Taron Killen and Bobby Moynihan

2603
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:30,980
trying to convince him to play Beetlejuice and Batman again.

2604
01:53:31,700 --> 01:53:33,460
And he's like saying no, no, no, no, no.

2605
01:53:33,460 --> 01:53:36,580
And at the end of the sketch, he just like goes like this, like cut it out.

2606
01:53:37,220 --> 01:53:41,780
And then he like turns to camera and he stares it down and he says, I'm Batman.

2607
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:44,180
And he's just like right back in it.

2608
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:48,580
And I get chills every time I watch it where I'm just like, it's just not a day's gone.

2609
01:53:48,580 --> 01:53:51,220
But he can just at any moment drop straight into it.

2610
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:52,420
He knows the angle.

2611
01:53:52,420 --> 01:53:54,980
He knows exactly how much the arch the eyebrows.

2612
01:53:54,980 --> 01:53:56,580
He knows the exact pitch of voice.

2613
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:59,460
And he just like he throws it out.

2614
01:53:59,460 --> 01:53:59,780
Yeah.

2615
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:00,420
Oof.

2616
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:00,900
Wow.

2617
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:01,540
Wow.

2618
01:54:01,540 --> 01:54:02,820
Well, he's coming back.

2619
01:54:02,820 --> 01:54:03,460
He's back.

2620
01:54:03,460 --> 01:54:04,100
He's back.

2621
01:54:04,100 --> 01:54:04,660
He's back.

2622
01:54:04,660 --> 01:54:05,540
When and when?

2623
01:54:05,540 --> 01:54:06,180
What is it?

2624
01:54:06,180 --> 01:54:08,180
Him and Ezra.

2625
01:54:08,740 --> 01:54:09,460
What's his name?

2626
01:54:09,460 --> 01:54:10,100
Ezra Miller.

2627
01:54:10,100 --> 01:54:10,500
Flash.

2628
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:11,540
Miller's Flash from.

2629
01:54:11,540 --> 01:54:12,980
Is that next year?

2630
01:54:12,980 --> 01:54:16,020
It's either next week or next year.

2631
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:16,980
I wouldn't be shocked.

2632
01:54:16,980 --> 01:54:17,780
Years ago.

2633
01:54:17,780 --> 01:54:18,660
I didn't see it.

2634
01:54:18,660 --> 01:54:19,540
Already happened.

2635
01:54:19,540 --> 01:54:20,340
They're in spite.

2636
01:54:20,340 --> 01:54:23,940
He's in Spider-Man 2 or something like Batman and Spider-Man.

2637
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:25,700
And he's in Morbius.

2638
01:54:25,700 --> 01:54:27,860
He is in Morbius as Vulture.

2639
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:32,100
Scott, Michael Keefe plays Vulture in the MCU.

2640
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:36,340
He is also going to be in the Morbius movie, which is a Marvel character.

2641
01:54:36,340 --> 01:54:39,700
But it's Sony because Sony has the rights to Spider-Man and Sony is doing their own

2642
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:44,340
Spider-verse that's independent of the MCU.

2643
01:54:44,340 --> 01:54:48,500
The Sony Marvel deal is so weird because part of it is like

2644
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:53,220
Marvel gets to use Spider-Man in X amount of films that Sony doesn't produce.

2645
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:53,460
Right.

2646
01:54:53,460 --> 01:54:56,100
Which is like him ending up in the Avengers movies and stuff.

2647
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:56,500
Yes.

2648
01:54:56,580 --> 01:55:05,220
And then part of the deal is Marvel has to give Sony one ostensibly A-tier Marvel character to

2649
01:55:05,220 --> 01:55:07,140
use in every Spider-Man movie.

2650
01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:09,460
So it's like Donnie Jr. in the first one.

2651
01:55:09,460 --> 01:55:11,620
It's Samuel Jackson in the second one.

2652
01:55:11,620 --> 01:55:12,820
Cumberbatch in the third.

2653
01:55:12,820 --> 01:55:13,140
Right?

2654
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:18,100
Feige gets to produce and direct the direction of it.

2655
01:55:18,100 --> 01:55:18,420
Right.

2656
01:55:19,620 --> 01:55:24,580
But then now they're making the Venom sequel, Morbius, like these spin-offs.

2657
01:55:24,580 --> 01:55:28,020
Jared Leto is Michael Morbius, the living vampire.

2658
01:55:28,020 --> 01:55:28,660
Right.

2659
01:55:28,660 --> 01:55:30,500
Which is that sentence do anything for you?

2660
01:55:31,860 --> 01:55:34,580
Does that sentence do anything for the movie going public?

2661
01:55:36,260 --> 01:55:40,500
This movie has been pushed back so many times and obviously COVID and everything,

2662
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:44,180
but they keep on going like, let's just knock it back another 18 months.

2663
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:46,260
Let's just keep kicking it back.

2664
01:55:46,900 --> 01:55:51,620
But they can't put Spider-Man in those movies.

2665
01:55:51,620 --> 01:55:55,460
So now what they're doing is putting supporting characters from the Marvel

2666
01:55:55,460 --> 01:55:58,020
Spider-Man movies in the other villain movies.

2667
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:04,580
So Michael Keaton can interact with Morbius because he's in the Spider-Man movies that

2668
01:56:04,580 --> 01:56:07,540
are in the Spider-Man continuity with the MCU.

2669
01:56:08,260 --> 01:56:09,780
I like the convolutedness.

2670
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:12,820
Yeah, it's very convoluted.

2671
01:56:13,300 --> 01:56:14,740
It's going to get worse too.

2672
01:56:14,740 --> 01:56:15,540
So much worse.

2673
01:56:15,540 --> 01:56:15,860
Yeah.

2674
01:56:17,540 --> 01:56:20,820
Tom Hardy Venom cannot cross over yet.

2675
01:56:20,820 --> 01:56:21,300
Right.

2676
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:24,740
This is not dissimilar to in the late 90s.

2677
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:31,940
They kind of peeled off all the street, like, you know, gritty, not super, super powerful

2678
01:56:31,940 --> 01:56:34,340
characters into the Marvel Knights line.

2679
01:56:34,340 --> 01:56:35,060
Punisher, dear.

2680
01:56:35,060 --> 01:56:36,420
The street level.

2681
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:37,780
Yeah, the street level guys.

2682
01:56:40,820 --> 01:56:42,900
Just because those books weren't selling very well.

2683
01:56:43,300 --> 01:56:49,860
And so they gave them to people from outside of comics or they tried weird takes.

2684
01:56:49,860 --> 01:56:52,180
The Punisher is back as an avenging angel.

2685
01:56:52,180 --> 01:56:54,420
This sentence to God, does this do anything for you?

2686
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:54,740
Yeah.

2687
01:56:54,740 --> 01:56:56,900
Daredevil written by Kevin Smith.

2688
01:56:58,340 --> 01:56:59,380
An award winning.

2689
01:57:01,140 --> 01:57:02,740
Like a landmark run.

2690
01:57:02,740 --> 01:57:04,260
Yeah, a landmark run.

2691
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:10,260
And very, I haven't reread them, but I remember the time being very like liking those comics a

2692
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:12,420
lot drawn by Joe Cassata.

2693
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:13,540
Joe, great art.

2694
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:14,180
Great art.

2695
01:57:14,180 --> 01:57:14,580
Yes.

2696
01:57:14,580 --> 01:57:15,620
So now it is.

2697
01:57:15,620 --> 01:57:18,260
It is just as confusing and dense.

2698
01:57:18,260 --> 01:57:23,060
And what's weird too is that then the Marvel Netflix thing is essentially doing Marvel

2699
01:57:23,060 --> 01:57:27,380
Knights again, where they're just like these characters can't sustain $200 million movies.

2700
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:28,660
We have no other outlet for them.

2701
01:57:28,660 --> 01:57:33,540
So we punt them off to a different department of Marvel that Feige has no oversight over.

2702
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:37,140
And you make lower budget Marvel TV shows with these characters.

2703
01:57:37,140 --> 01:57:41,940
And then now they're stuck in this netherworld where it's like, are they in shared continuity

2704
01:57:41,940 --> 01:57:42,980
with anything?

2705
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:47,220
Those shows started out acknowledging things from the movies, but then the movies have

2706
01:57:47,220 --> 01:57:48,420
never acknowledged them.

2707
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:52,100
And then there are ongoing rumors that they will be acknowledged.

2708
01:57:52,740 --> 01:57:53,620
Yeah, we know.

2709
01:57:53,620 --> 01:57:54,900
I know what you're talking about.

2710
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:56,980
This is the end of this Toy Story episode, right?

2711
01:57:56,980 --> 01:57:57,860
We're almost at the end.

2712
01:57:57,860 --> 01:57:59,460
I guess we're almost at the end.

2713
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:03,780
Yeah, the shooting gallery is the Woody's Rootin' Tootin' shooting gallery is the last

2714
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:04,180
game.

2715
01:58:04,180 --> 01:58:04,820
Another game.

2716
01:58:04,820 --> 01:58:06,100
It's the last game.

2717
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:07,300
It's the last game.

2718
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:12,180
I again has a real world parallel over at the other park, the shooting gallery, which when

2719
01:58:12,180 --> 01:58:17,460
I was leaving Disneyland the other night at 10 p.m. at night was very crowded.

2720
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:19,700
Yeah, like always popular.

2721
01:58:19,700 --> 01:58:20,900
People trying to take the edge off.

2722
01:58:20,900 --> 01:58:21,140
Yeah.

2723
01:58:23,140 --> 01:58:25,460
Stupid kid yelling at me all day.

2724
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:27,780
I want chicken fingers.

2725
01:58:27,780 --> 01:58:28,260
Do you?

2726
01:58:28,260 --> 01:58:29,620
It's brutal.

2727
01:58:29,620 --> 01:58:29,860
Yeah.

2728
01:58:31,300 --> 01:58:36,820
It's a bit, you know, it's such an epic ending because now I think maybe you get to that

2729
01:58:36,820 --> 01:58:39,620
screen and don't even realize you're next to more screens.

2730
01:58:39,620 --> 01:58:45,460
It almost like gets expansive like a big widescreen Western epic as you travel and

2731
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:46,660
you're shooting the whole way.

2732
01:58:48,260 --> 01:58:50,740
But you know, you wear out here.

2733
01:58:50,740 --> 01:58:53,300
I think who doesn't in the home stretch?

2734
01:58:53,300 --> 01:58:58,180
I was trying to figure out is there a stretch I should be like, is there any scenario where

2735
01:58:58,180 --> 01:59:00,020
I like I'm fine after it?

2736
01:59:00,020 --> 01:59:01,060
I try different things.

2737
01:59:01,060 --> 01:59:05,460
I mean, I'll tell you a thing I do oftentimes is rather than like pulling the ball like

2738
01:59:05,460 --> 01:59:07,940
this, I sort of hold my hand out this way.

2739
01:59:07,940 --> 01:59:08,660
If this makes sense.

2740
01:59:08,660 --> 01:59:12,580
I don't even know how to describe this, but it's like I hope my hands straight out in

2741
01:59:12,580 --> 01:59:18,100
front of me and then I sort of notch the ball in between two fingers.

2742
01:59:18,100 --> 01:59:20,500
And so I'm pulling the hand towards me.

2743
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:20,740
Yeah.

2744
01:59:20,740 --> 01:59:21,460
That makes sense.

2745
01:59:21,460 --> 01:59:21,700
Yeah.

2746
01:59:21,700 --> 01:59:22,260
Yes, it does.

2747
01:59:22,260 --> 01:59:25,700
Because I've tried different techniques is the one the way you want to do it like the

2748
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:26,580
way you're biting my body.

2749
01:59:26,580 --> 01:59:30,180
Naturally, I think this we've gotten to the end of the episode where we have to talk about

2750
01:59:30,180 --> 01:59:33,140
how you handle a ball handle a singular ball dangling ball.

2751
01:59:33,140 --> 01:59:34,420
One ball is this.

2752
01:59:34,420 --> 01:59:36,020
This is how you handle one ball.

2753
01:59:36,660 --> 01:59:40,900
You like I think you want to grab the ball and then I use my whole arm.

2754
01:59:40,900 --> 01:59:42,580
That's how it naturally wants to go.

2755
01:59:42,580 --> 01:59:42,900
Right.

2756
01:59:42,900 --> 01:59:43,140
Right.

2757
01:59:43,140 --> 01:59:45,300
Because you blow out your wrist if you're just doing that.

2758
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:45,780
Right.

2759
01:59:45,780 --> 01:59:51,780
But the wrist, you really the least impact is like holding as you're saying with two

2760
01:59:51,780 --> 01:59:54,980
fingers and then just like pulling it like this.

2761
01:59:54,980 --> 01:59:55,700
Yes.

2762
01:59:55,700 --> 01:59:56,740
This is the motion.

2763
01:59:56,740 --> 01:59:56,980
Yeah.

2764
01:59:56,980 --> 01:59:58,660
But I feel like I don't get as much.

2765
01:59:59,460 --> 02:00:01,460
I don't get as many balls that way.

2766
02:00:01,460 --> 02:00:02,420
I don't get as many.

2767
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:04,820
I can't get it as fast.

2768
02:00:04,820 --> 02:00:06,260
I can't get going as fast.

2769
02:00:06,260 --> 02:00:12,180
I need like for that last run where you're trying to get as many as possible and it just

2770
02:00:12,180 --> 02:00:14,820
becomes giant targets to just like speed round go.

2771
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:19,060
And again, you want to get it to a thousand and two thousand as possible.

2772
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:24,020
I definitely like put an arm on the handle to try to give me resistance like something

2773
02:00:24,020 --> 02:00:29,940
to hang off of so that it's not like it's anchored and I'm like using like so I'm pushing

2774
02:00:29,940 --> 02:00:31,300
one way and I'm pulling another.

2775
02:00:33,060 --> 02:00:34,340
We should be filming all of these.

2776
02:00:34,340 --> 02:00:37,380
I know the all doing the same weird gesture.

2777
02:00:37,380 --> 02:00:42,020
Guys, the gestures are so funny if you were here right now.

2778
02:00:42,820 --> 02:00:45,380
If you've done it looks like something else.

2779
02:00:45,380 --> 02:00:48,420
They look like so nasty.

2780
02:00:49,220 --> 02:00:54,500
It's like an angry father like summoning a cat in the house or like a dog like get in

2781
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:54,900
here.

2782
02:00:54,900 --> 02:00:57,140
That's really what it's not sexual.

2783
02:00:57,140 --> 02:00:58,420
It's just like get in here.

2784
02:00:59,140 --> 02:01:01,300
I switch arms once in a while too.

2785
02:01:01,300 --> 02:01:02,100
Yeah, that's a good thing.

2786
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:03,940
Which does that throws me off.

2787
02:01:04,340 --> 02:01:06,580
The stranger sometimes I have to.

2788
02:01:08,820 --> 02:01:16,420
Sometimes what I do is like I sit on my left hand right before the other games and then

2789
02:01:16,420 --> 02:01:19,860
I pull so it feels like a stranger is playing the last round for me.

2790
02:01:20,660 --> 02:01:21,300
That's what I do.

2791
02:01:22,100 --> 02:01:26,740
It's not the first time also that we've all done these motions and then had people laugh at us.

2792
02:01:28,660 --> 02:01:29,700
That's a good point as well.

2793
02:01:31,140 --> 02:01:32,020
But it's just.

2794
02:01:32,020 --> 02:01:34,740
I really wish I didn't have to say I wish I could only hear your voice.

2795
02:01:34,740 --> 02:01:39,940
Right and then someone and then someone in sort of overselling that you did a great job.

2796
02:01:41,140 --> 02:01:41,620
No, it was.

2797
02:01:41,620 --> 02:01:45,140
Yeah, you should have like a hand be like it was fine.

2798
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:48,020
It's okay.

2799
02:01:48,020 --> 02:01:49,380
We can try again later.

2800
02:01:49,380 --> 02:01:51,140
Let's not talk about it.

2801
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:53,380
You're making the worst by talking about.

2802
02:01:54,980 --> 02:01:56,340
Let's just go to sleep.

2803
02:01:56,340 --> 02:01:59,140
Wallachian telling let's just go to sleep.

2804
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:00,340
Let's just go to sleep.

2805
02:02:01,860 --> 02:02:03,380
We're really still talking about this.

2806
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:04,820
Why must we dwell on this?

2807
02:02:04,820 --> 02:02:06,420
I'm going to tomorrow.

2808
02:02:07,780 --> 02:02:09,060
It was hours ago.

2809
02:02:09,060 --> 02:02:11,540
I'm writing a play that I'm going to write a play.

2810
02:02:12,660 --> 02:02:13,380
I'm busy.

2811
02:02:15,060 --> 02:02:17,620
God, this is going to play great at the store later.

2812
02:02:19,380 --> 02:02:19,940
Who is that?

2813
02:02:19,940 --> 02:02:20,340
Jeff.

2814
02:02:20,340 --> 02:02:20,660
Tim.

2815
02:02:21,700 --> 02:02:23,060
That's just a general.

2816
02:02:23,060 --> 02:02:24,100
That's just a general.

2817
02:02:24,100 --> 02:02:26,660
Oh, generally, this would all play well at the lab.

2818
02:02:26,660 --> 02:02:28,660
Tim Downs, a laugh factory guy, I assume.

2819
02:02:29,940 --> 02:02:30,260
Right.

2820
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:35,300
I think, well, if Superstar Lima was to be believed, yeah.

2821
02:02:35,300 --> 02:02:35,800
Yeah.

2822
02:02:36,420 --> 02:02:37,700
It is canon, right?

2823
02:02:37,700 --> 02:02:38,420
I think so.

2824
02:02:38,420 --> 02:02:38,660
Yeah.

2825
02:02:38,660 --> 02:02:39,620
Whatever that club is.

2826
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:42,420
Look, you get exhausted.

2827
02:02:42,420 --> 02:02:43,380
You get very worn out.

2828
02:02:43,380 --> 02:02:47,380
I mean, I didn't really happen to be that bad on this, but I for sure, you know, like two

2829
02:02:47,380 --> 02:02:49,220
minutes later, you'll be feeling it.

2830
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:51,060
Five minutes later, you could be feeling it.

2831
02:02:51,060 --> 02:02:54,580
If you the listeners have any tips on wrist care.

2832
02:02:54,580 --> 02:02:55,080
Yeah.

2833
02:02:55,140 --> 02:02:58,900
And how to, you know, because we're all getting older.

2834
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:02,740
Um, how do you make your wrist last?

2835
02:03:02,740 --> 02:03:03,220
Yeah, we need.

2836
02:03:03,220 --> 02:03:04,740
Are there pills we can take?

2837
02:03:04,740 --> 02:03:05,540
Everyone, yes.

2838
02:03:06,260 --> 02:03:07,380
Chime in on this.

2839
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:11,380
Is there any, like, do you just agree with us that you're like, you're sore after it?

2840
02:03:11,380 --> 02:03:13,460
Or do you have some sort of technique?

2841
02:03:13,460 --> 02:03:14,660
Do you double hand it?

2842
02:03:14,660 --> 02:03:15,940
Do you have a looser grip?

2843
02:03:15,940 --> 02:03:16,420
Mm hmm.

2844
02:03:16,420 --> 02:03:16,920
Yeah, right.

2845
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:23,860
Is there like a, uh, uh, web slingers piece of equipment you bring with you?

2846
02:03:23,860 --> 02:03:24,900
I was just thinking that.

2847
02:03:24,900 --> 02:03:26,980
Like you just attach it and you put a button.

2848
02:03:26,980 --> 02:03:27,480
Toys.

2849
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:32,200
If you're a, if you, if this, if these kinds of acts are getting older or getting

2850
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:36,840
tougher as you get older, does toys bringing toys reinvigorate everything?

2851
02:03:36,840 --> 02:03:41,720
There's some sort of like motorized suction device you could use, which has a very consistent rhythm.

2852
02:03:43,480 --> 02:03:44,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2853
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:47,880
And you could like just help smooth out performance issues.

2854
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:48,380
Right.

2855
02:03:48,380 --> 02:03:49,320
And it's like themed.

2856
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:50,680
It's a theme thing too.

2857
02:03:50,680 --> 02:03:53,720
So it could be different characters or.

2858
02:03:53,880 --> 02:03:58,040
The thing that web slingers gets right that you can introduce toys into the equation

2859
02:03:58,040 --> 02:03:59,880
and add some new dimensions and levels.

2860
02:04:01,880 --> 02:04:03,080
Repulsors or.

2861
02:04:04,600 --> 02:04:05,960
It helps with repeatability.

2862
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:06,460
Gauntlet.

2863
02:04:07,480 --> 02:04:08,440
Wrist gauntlets.

2864
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:12,360
All that stuff, you know, that spices things up.

2865
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:13,320
Different bindings.

2866
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:13,960
Yeah.

2867
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:15,560
Different bindings.

2868
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:16,360
Suit of armor.

2869
02:04:17,080 --> 02:04:18,840
Different suit of armor you could wear.

2870
02:04:20,440 --> 02:04:23,240
I will say a weird thing about this ride that defies logic for me

2871
02:04:23,240 --> 02:04:29,160
is that I feel like a year or two after it opened, they released it as like a cell phone app.

2872
02:04:29,800 --> 02:04:32,200
And then also as a Wii game.

2873
02:04:32,200 --> 02:04:32,440
Right.

2874
02:04:32,440 --> 02:04:35,080
I think they did it for PlayStation Move and Xbox Connect.

2875
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:37,800
It was that wave of motion controlled video game systems.

2876
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:38,600
I bought it for the Wii.

2877
02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:39,800
I didn't like it right away.

2878
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:40,840
I think I never played it.

2879
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:41,560
Yeah.

2880
02:04:41,560 --> 02:04:48,200
What I bought, which I showed you guys the last time we zoomed was like I got this like plug and play thing.

2881
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:53,160
Where it's like it's a physical cannon that you plug into.

2882
02:04:53,160 --> 02:04:56,440
The TV and then it has just this game loaded on it.

2883
02:04:56,440 --> 02:05:02,520
So it's a sort of lower res and the cannon is push button rather than the ball pull.

2884
02:05:04,040 --> 02:05:10,600
I thought by buying that and prepping for like six months before this episode, I'd get very good at it.

2885
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:12,280
When you're there in person.

2886
02:05:12,280 --> 02:05:12,840
Didn't happen.

2887
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:16,840
The thing is like I played that app for a long time until they just continued.

2888
02:05:16,840 --> 02:05:18,360
I have this thing now I play.

2889
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:22,440
I remember being bummed out when they did that because I was like, well, that kind of devalues the ride.

2890
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:28,120
If you're just taking the exact same game screens and like making it playable at home, then what's the ride got?

2891
02:05:28,120 --> 02:05:31,000
And then every time I go on the ride, I'm like, this is so much better.

2892
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:36,360
It really just speaks to how the whole interface is the whole is the thing.

2893
02:05:36,360 --> 02:05:36,760
Yes.

2894
02:05:36,760 --> 02:05:38,920
It's not the graphics and anything.

2895
02:05:38,920 --> 02:05:40,200
It's just how they made it perfect.

2896
02:05:41,160 --> 02:05:42,200
Let's also call it out.

2897
02:05:43,240 --> 02:05:44,360
It's a 3D movie.

2898
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:46,760
It's my favorite kind of thing a theme park can do.

2899
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:52,360
It's a series of 3D movies, a thing that the at home versions never can get.

2900
02:05:52,360 --> 02:05:53,560
Right. I can't get it right.

2901
02:05:53,560 --> 02:05:54,120
Yeah.

2902
02:05:54,120 --> 02:05:54,760
Yeah.

2903
02:05:54,760 --> 02:06:05,160
Well, and you're not, you know, we haven't talked about Jason nodded to it very quickly, but the effects, the effects are something when those aliens fly around and there's a little blast, it's mainly blasts.

2904
02:06:05,160 --> 02:06:07,720
There's not a lot of like there's not too much going on.

2905
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:09,320
There's surprises, but they're cool.

2906
02:06:09,320 --> 02:06:09,960
Yeah.

2907
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:10,280
Yeah.

2908
02:06:10,280 --> 02:06:19,000
There's like, is there confetti or something that shoots or the balls like shoot out at you and it makes that like poof sound and then like you get a blast of air.

2909
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,400
And it makes it all like more confusing.

2910
02:06:21,400 --> 02:06:24,360
There's like there's sometimes when you're playing, you get blasted with air.

2911
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:29,160
That's like part of the all kinds of shit ends up breaking your face.

2912
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:29,400
Right.

2913
02:06:29,400 --> 02:06:30,120
It happens.

2914
02:06:30,120 --> 02:06:30,360
Yeah.

2915
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:35,240
We hadn't mentioned the cues.

2916
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:36,520
Yeah.

2917
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:38,840
There's a lot of weird stuff.

2918
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:49,480
The cues in both California and Florida have both been reconfigured at different points due to changing of the areas they're in.

2919
02:06:49,640 --> 02:06:54,680
Well, because Orlando is now the weird fake Pixar campus.

2920
02:06:54,680 --> 02:06:56,280
Well, no, that's what it was now.

2921
02:06:56,280 --> 02:06:56,760
Not anymore.

2922
02:06:56,760 --> 02:06:58,680
Now it's Toy Story land.

2923
02:06:58,680 --> 02:06:59,640
Toy Story land.

2924
02:06:59,640 --> 02:06:59,880
Right.

2925
02:06:59,880 --> 02:07:00,360
They flipped it.

2926
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:04,040
They never moved the building, but they put the entrance on the other side.

2927
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:04,840
It's really odd.

2928
02:07:04,840 --> 02:07:06,440
I had not gone to do Toy Story land yet.

2929
02:07:06,440 --> 02:07:09,320
And they added a third track in Florida because it's just so popular.

2930
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:09,560
Yeah.

2931
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:17,800
DCA California Adventures cue is pretty bad.

2932
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:21,080
That's one of the big open criticisms of the ride.

2933
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:24,760
Love skipping that one in the Max Pass era.

2934
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:28,360
But the potato head is all you got going for.

2935
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:30,440
I mean, the potato head really elevates it.

2936
02:07:30,440 --> 02:07:32,040
The potato head can talk to you.

2937
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:36,200
Florida has a lot more character to it.

2938
02:07:36,200 --> 02:07:40,280
I think Florida does more of trying to sell you on the like, here's the room.

2939
02:07:40,280 --> 02:07:43,000
Here's like this box he got constructed.

2940
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:46,200
And like the giant viewfinder, like the Disneyland.

2941
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:47,480
Tomorrowland.

2942
02:07:47,480 --> 02:07:48,040
Yeah.

2943
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:49,880
Giant viewfinder things.

2944
02:07:49,880 --> 02:07:52,920
And then in Japan, two things.

2945
02:07:52,920 --> 02:07:53,400
Oh, yeah.

2946
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:54,200
You got to say it.

2947
02:07:54,200 --> 02:07:56,360
You enter through a giant Woody head.

2948
02:07:56,360 --> 02:07:58,440
It's so cool.

2949
02:07:58,440 --> 02:07:59,960
It's a dream I've always had.

2950
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:02,280
Put myself in Woody's mouth.

2951
02:08:02,280 --> 02:08:03,960
Oh, perfect.

2952
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:04,680
I'm going in.

2953
02:08:05,320 --> 02:08:11,160
This area in Japan is called, I almost missed this, it's called the Toyville Trolley Park.

2954
02:08:11,160 --> 02:08:13,320
And we all know I love my trolley parks.

2955
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:15,000
Yeah, that's cool.

2956
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,080
It looks really neat.

2957
02:08:17,080 --> 02:08:18,200
It's a great design.

2958
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:21,480
It looks very ornate, as is all of Tokyo DisneySea.

2959
02:08:21,480 --> 02:08:22,840
Looks amazing at night.

2960
02:08:22,840 --> 02:08:23,320
Yes.

2961
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:25,560
But this is like, you'll see this repeated.

2962
02:08:25,560 --> 02:08:33,800
This is a big Japan travel tip that if you've ever done Toy Story Mania at Disneyland or Disney World,

2963
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:36,040
you can't do it in Japan.

2964
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:37,880
That will eat into valuable time.

2965
02:08:37,880 --> 02:08:40,840
It is like the one thing that is exactly the same.

2966
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:42,040
Go look at the outside.

2967
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:43,320
The outside is great.

2968
02:08:43,320 --> 02:08:48,840
But I saw travel guides that were very clear about, you've got to sacrifice that one

2969
02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:50,680
because there's so much that's unique to that park.

2970
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:52,520
Or maybe you have to add an extra day.

2971
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:53,720
You still have to have an ad.

2972
02:08:53,720 --> 02:08:56,920
You need to take it up to four days or beyond.

2973
02:08:56,920 --> 02:08:58,840
Just to be able to go seven days, you need seven.

2974
02:08:58,840 --> 02:08:59,400
You need seven.

2975
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:00,600
I think you need a clean seven.

2976
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:01,080
Full seven.

2977
02:09:01,080 --> 02:09:02,200
You just keep moving up.

2978
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:05,720
It's going to be 12 before you know it.

2979
02:09:05,720 --> 02:09:10,520
Yeah, I mean, I'll say in defense, because the California one opened first, right?

2980
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:11,560
It is the original.

2981
02:09:11,560 --> 02:09:12,360
Maybe not.

2982
02:09:12,360 --> 02:09:12,600
No.

2983
02:09:13,080 --> 02:09:13,400
No?

2984
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:13,800
Really?

2985
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:14,280
Opened.

2986
02:09:14,840 --> 02:09:20,680
This was a rare instance where they were developing both simultaneously.

2987
02:09:20,680 --> 02:09:24,520
Florida opens a few weeks before California.

2988
02:09:24,520 --> 02:09:33,960
I believe Florida's also was timed with a piece being added to the International Space Station.

2989
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:36,200
And there was a Buzz Lightyear toy.

2990
02:09:36,200 --> 02:09:36,920
Yes.

2991
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:39,320
In the imaginary story.

2992
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:40,360
Right.

2993
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:41,480
They put Buzz in space.

2994
02:09:43,160 --> 02:09:43,480
Yeah.

2995
02:09:43,480 --> 02:09:48,280
It's all strange that that opened first and how it's like it's this midway game ride.

2996
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:51,800
But then they it's so it's midway mania in California.

2997
02:09:51,800 --> 02:09:56,200
But because it's part of the pier, but then it's just Toy Story mania everywhere else.

2998
02:09:56,200 --> 02:10:00,120
I remember thinking when I heard all this before it opened, I was like, is this going to be any?

2999
02:10:00,120 --> 02:10:00,520
It's weird.

3000
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:02,120
It's midway games, but it's over there.

3001
02:10:02,120 --> 02:10:07,000
And is that just like plugging it in in a non-natural way?

3002
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:10,200
And it's all like the odd.

3003
02:10:10,200 --> 02:10:11,800
Just something about the description of the ride.

3004
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:12,760
Never sounded that great to me.

3005
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:13,800
It's like games with it.

3006
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:15,800
And then like immediately, first time you're on it.

3007
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:16,120
Yeah.

3008
02:10:16,120 --> 02:10:17,960
Just fun classic like must do.

3009
02:10:17,960 --> 02:10:22,520
Defies logic, but it gets back to sort of the stuff we've been saying about just like

3010
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:23,800
sort of don't overthink it.

3011
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:25,800
Do the thing that's fun.

3012
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:27,400
Show the people the thing they want to see.

3013
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:30,040
You know, just make it clean and easy.

3014
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:31,320
The rules.

3015
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:31,960
Yeah.

3016
02:10:31,960 --> 02:10:32,520
Don't get in.

3017
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:32,680
Yeah.

3018
02:10:32,680 --> 02:10:33,960
Don't get in your head.

3019
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:34,040
Yeah.

3020
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:35,160
Try to relax.

3021
02:10:35,160 --> 02:10:35,400
Yeah.

3022
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:36,680
Yeah.

3023
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:39,000
Simple.

3024
02:10:39,080 --> 02:10:39,320
Right.

3025
02:10:39,320 --> 02:10:43,080
If you're worrying too much about what, how other people think you're doing.

3026
02:10:44,680 --> 02:10:45,240
But you do.

3027
02:10:45,240 --> 02:10:48,680
You're not going to enjoy yourself because ultimately like you need to be enjoying yourself.

3028
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:49,240
Right.

3029
02:10:49,240 --> 02:10:51,640
But also you want to make sure they're having a good time.

3030
02:10:51,640 --> 02:10:52,840
You have to do that.

3031
02:10:52,840 --> 02:10:55,880
Just not worrying about how they think you're performing.

3032
02:10:55,880 --> 02:10:58,680
Just worry about trying your hardest.

3033
02:10:58,680 --> 02:10:58,920
Yeah.

3034
02:10:58,920 --> 02:11:01,160
You know, you can't get too, you can't overthink it.

3035
02:11:01,160 --> 02:11:01,320
No.

3036
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:02,280
Because there's this.

3037
02:11:02,280 --> 02:11:02,680
Yeah.

3038
02:11:02,680 --> 02:11:02,920
Yeah.

3039
02:11:02,920 --> 02:11:03,880
I mean, you have to be attentive.

3040
02:11:03,880 --> 02:11:05,000
Sometimes the rules change.

3041
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:08,520
Sometimes they say throw this and then you move over a little bit and they go,

3042
02:11:08,520 --> 02:11:12,120
actually, you know, spin this or whatever.

3043
02:11:12,680 --> 02:11:13,160
I don't know.

3044
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:14,920
I don't even have to sustain this anymore.

3045
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:17,240
It's unsustainable at this juncture.

3046
02:11:17,240 --> 02:11:18,440
Things are at a different angle.

3047
02:11:20,120 --> 02:11:24,040
You know, but we're looking like with Mike and I just like worked really well when it was

3048
02:11:24,040 --> 02:11:25,240
pleasurable for both of us.

3049
02:11:25,240 --> 02:11:27,400
We made, we made each other better.

3050
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:27,560
Right.

3051
02:11:27,560 --> 02:11:27,960
Exactly.

3052
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:28,200
Yeah.

3053
02:11:28,200 --> 02:11:31,400
We were work, Scott and I were working together to achieve a goal.

3054
02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:33,080
Jason and I were perhaps being selfish.

3055
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:34,840
What?

3056
02:11:35,880 --> 02:11:37,320
I say mutual midway.

3057
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:41,080
That's it.

3058
02:11:41,080 --> 02:11:42,600
Griffin Newman, you survived.

3059
02:11:42,600 --> 02:11:43,800
I guess the right.

3060
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:44,440
Well, I do.

3061
02:11:44,440 --> 02:11:46,200
I do have a thing I want to say.

3062
02:11:46,200 --> 02:11:46,440
I know.

3063
02:11:46,440 --> 02:11:48,280
I sure know that was just like be planning the flag.

3064
02:11:48,280 --> 02:11:49,160
No, I understand.

3065
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:50,040
Come back to the station.

3066
02:11:50,040 --> 02:11:50,360
Right.

3067
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:56,920
Uh, I, so I, you know, I, uh, this was so much fun to get to go to the parks with you guys.

3068
02:11:56,920 --> 02:12:01,720
And I joked about this when I was, uh, when I got there, but I was like, I was like having

3069
02:12:01,720 --> 02:12:05,400
the jitters beforehand of like, oh my God, I'm going to meet the guys for the first time

3070
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:11,640
because it did feel like, I think people don't know this, but like up until going to the parks

3071
02:12:11,640 --> 02:12:15,000
together two days ago, we had never hung out outside of recording.

3072
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:18,360
Cause all the good records are all, it's all these long episodes.

3073
02:12:18,360 --> 02:12:22,440
We all go like, and so then by the time you're done, it's like, yeah, we could go like get

3074
02:12:22,440 --> 02:12:23,560
dinners up some of it.

3075
02:12:23,560 --> 02:12:25,960
Like you're in town for a brief amount of time.

3076
02:12:25,960 --> 02:12:27,720
But I like message you guys.

3077
02:12:27,720 --> 02:12:29,160
I was like, I'd love to be on the show.

3078
02:12:29,160 --> 02:12:30,280
Then we did that.

3079
02:12:30,280 --> 02:12:35,080
We always like end up, uh, talking for too long before and after the record and turning

3080
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:38,360
what's already a long session into a super long session planning a thing.

3081
02:12:38,360 --> 02:12:38,600
Yeah.

3082
02:12:38,600 --> 02:12:40,360
Then that after show just happened.

3083
02:12:40,360 --> 02:12:44,280
And then like the last time we recorded before the pandemic, you were like, by the way, next

3084
02:12:44,280 --> 02:12:45,880
time we should just make plans to hang out.

3085
02:12:45,880 --> 02:12:48,920
Like this doesn't have to be the only structure in which for us to hang out.

3086
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:52,360
Then the world ended and it was very much a thing I was looking forward to is being able

3087
02:12:52,360 --> 02:12:57,800
to record with you guys again, but also being able to, uh, uh, you know, actually like hanging

3088
02:12:57,800 --> 02:13:00,040
out and then cross that friend threshold and whatever.

3089
02:13:00,040 --> 02:13:02,840
And to go to the parks with you guys was like the best version of that.

3090
02:13:02,920 --> 02:13:05,320
I didn't realize the three of you hadn't gone together.

3091
02:13:05,320 --> 02:13:07,000
So it was nice that I was able to.

3092
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:07,640
In a while.

3093
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:07,880
Yeah.

3094
02:13:07,880 --> 02:13:09,160
This was a big impetus for that.

3095
02:13:09,160 --> 02:13:09,800
I have the fits.

3096
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:12,200
It was 20 months is what it ended up being.

3097
02:13:12,200 --> 02:13:12,360
Yeah.

3098
02:13:12,360 --> 02:13:12,840
Right.

3099
02:13:12,840 --> 02:13:12,920
Right.

3100
02:13:12,920 --> 02:13:14,360
We had seen you in person.

3101
02:13:14,360 --> 02:13:17,560
I feel I started with you in person was almost two years ago.

3102
02:13:17,560 --> 02:13:17,960
Yeah.

3103
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:18,120
Yeah.

3104
02:13:18,120 --> 02:13:18,680
That's right.

3105
02:13:18,680 --> 02:13:24,680
The last time I was here was October, 2019 and it's now September, 2021.

3106
02:13:24,680 --> 02:13:25,080
Wow.

3107
02:13:25,080 --> 02:13:25,240
Yeah.

3108
02:13:25,240 --> 02:13:30,120
So like all these things I was looking forward to and you know, like, uh, listening to the

3109
02:13:30,120 --> 02:13:35,000
show was, was a thing that really helped my, my sanity throughout all of this, you know?

3110
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:41,320
So I'm very appreciative, uh, to you guys, uh, as friends, but also just as, uh, uh,

3111
02:13:41,320 --> 02:13:44,680
people who make a good thing that, that helps people a lot.

3112
02:13:44,680 --> 02:13:49,480
But, um, I, I, I did in, in the run of listening to the show.

3113
02:13:49,480 --> 02:13:53,720
And as I said, I was listening some months behind go like, I want to do something to

3114
02:13:54,680 --> 02:13:57,480
repay the favor to the boys to some degree.

3115
02:13:57,480 --> 02:13:59,800
I feel like I, I, I need to, I'm just,

3116
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:00,840
I have such an affinity.

3117
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:03,800
I'm so excited to see them again in person and do all of this.

3118
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:07,160
I need to, I need to come bearing gifts to some degree.

3119
02:14:07,160 --> 02:14:16,600
And then I, I caught up with some episodes and I got very worried that I perhaps had been, um,

3120
02:14:16,600 --> 02:14:20,360
sniped in what my potential gift was.

3121
02:14:20,360 --> 02:14:22,280
Oh, that's what's in your case.

3122
02:14:22,280 --> 02:14:25,080
I brought a secret to your rifle.

3123
02:14:25,080 --> 02:14:25,400
Yes.

3124
02:14:25,400 --> 02:14:27,640
That is perfectly sized just for this one thing.

3125
02:14:27,640 --> 02:14:28,520
It kills us.

3126
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:32,200
And I had to message Jason and go, here's my gift.

3127
02:14:32,200 --> 02:14:32,760
Eat lead.

3128
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:40,120
I've got the specter spirit now.

3129
02:14:40,120 --> 02:14:44,680
Um, a couple of weeks ago, uh, I, when we had these plans in place, I messaged Jason.

3130
02:14:44,680 --> 02:14:46,920
I said, Jason, like no spoilers.

3131
02:14:46,920 --> 02:14:51,880
I'm still catching up, but I might've ordered something and spent a fair amount of money on

3132
02:14:51,880 --> 02:14:51,960
it.

3133
02:14:51,960 --> 02:14:54,840
And I'm worried that perhaps this has already been purchased in exchange.

3134
02:14:54,840 --> 02:14:56,840
And I want to know if this ever happened.

3135
02:14:56,840 --> 02:14:58,360
And he said, I think you're in the clear.

3136
02:14:59,320 --> 02:14:59,640
Yeah.

3137
02:14:59,640 --> 02:15:04,440
This was maybe the most memory workout I had to do.

3138
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:06,360
At one point in the park, Scott went to the bathroom.

3139
02:15:06,360 --> 02:15:07,720
He went, remind me what the thing is.

3140
02:15:08,280 --> 02:15:12,120
I, well, I messaged Mike about it.

3141
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:12,440
Okay.

3142
02:15:12,440 --> 02:15:12,920
I know.

3143
02:15:12,920 --> 02:15:15,080
I remember you did ask me.

3144
02:15:15,080 --> 02:15:15,720
Yeah.

3145
02:15:15,720 --> 02:15:15,960
Right.

3146
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:17,240
Oh, interesting.

3147
02:15:17,240 --> 02:15:22,600
Because, uh, I didn't, I, I had purchased this and received it before I caught up to

3148
02:15:22,600 --> 02:15:27,720
the point where it was invoked on the show, but I did in fact purchase a big,

3149
02:15:27,720 --> 02:15:28,440
he'd be alive.

3150
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:29,400
Aladar.

3151
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:30,200
Whoa.

3152
02:15:30,840 --> 02:15:34,360
I want to make clear was specifically purchased for Scott Gardner.

3153
02:15:34,360 --> 02:15:35,720
This is not for Mike.

3154
02:15:36,760 --> 02:15:38,280
This is for you and your son.

3155
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:39,640
All right.

3156
02:15:39,640 --> 02:15:41,160
You have to accept this.

3157
02:15:41,160 --> 02:15:41,640
Okay.

3158
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:42,200
Okay.

3159
02:15:42,200 --> 02:15:42,760
Let me get a closer look.

3160
02:15:42,760 --> 02:15:43,560
In your garage.

3161
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:45,560
That is for you.

3162
02:15:45,560 --> 02:15:46,680
It's a mint condition.

3163
02:15:47,640 --> 02:15:48,360
Oh boy.

3164
02:15:50,120 --> 02:15:50,920
Dino Alive.

3165
02:15:50,920 --> 02:15:53,000
Oh, these beautiful fonts.

3166
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:54,120
It's great fonts.

3167
02:15:54,120 --> 02:15:55,560
The best of 2000.

3168
02:15:55,560 --> 02:15:56,520
It's a good box.

3169
02:15:57,160 --> 02:15:58,040
It's a very good.

3170
02:15:58,040 --> 02:15:59,480
Help me hatch.

3171
02:15:59,480 --> 02:16:00,520
Let me out.

3172
02:16:01,160 --> 02:16:02,760
Hatch and hatch again.

3173
02:16:03,560 --> 02:16:05,960
Feed me in quotes.

3174
02:16:05,960 --> 02:16:09,400
Feed me and I'll show what I can do.

3175
02:16:10,680 --> 02:16:11,960
Dirtiest episode.

3176
02:16:11,960 --> 02:16:13,240
Grossest episode.

3177
02:16:13,240 --> 02:16:13,720
Yeah, really gross.

3178
02:16:13,720 --> 02:16:16,680
It was gross enough before Aladar entered the picture.

3179
02:16:16,680 --> 02:16:18,120
And now Aladar's here.

3180
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:19,480
And he's here to stay.

3181
02:16:19,480 --> 02:16:22,120
Hatch your prehistoric pet again and again.

3182
02:16:22,120 --> 02:16:22,520
Wow.

3183
02:16:22,520 --> 02:16:25,720
You can go, that's the miracle of childbirth over and over again.

3184
02:16:25,720 --> 02:16:26,760
He comes with the egg.

3185
02:16:26,760 --> 02:16:30,120
For the listener at home, he comes with the egg and you can have him hatch out of the egg.

3186
02:16:30,120 --> 02:16:32,120
This is going to be a great sex ed tool.

3187
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:34,360
You know, teaching tool.

3188
02:16:34,360 --> 02:16:35,400
Your wife.

3189
02:16:35,400 --> 02:16:35,800
Yeah.

3190
02:16:35,800 --> 02:16:36,760
My son.

3191
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:37,320
Exactly.

3192
02:16:37,800 --> 02:16:39,640
This is where babies come from.

3193
02:16:39,640 --> 02:16:39,960
Yeah.

3194
02:16:40,680 --> 02:16:47,720
So one day you came out of an egg and the first thing you did was pee and burp and I

3195
02:16:47,720 --> 02:16:49,640
thought it was so cute.

3196
02:16:49,640 --> 02:16:50,440
Very cute.

3197
02:16:50,440 --> 02:16:51,480
Very cute, yes.

3198
02:16:51,960 --> 02:17:02,040
And then on the back of these quotes, I'm Aladar, I'm hungry, burp, let's go.

3199
02:17:03,640 --> 02:17:04,520
Can you imagine?

3200
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:05,560
Let's go.

3201
02:17:08,120 --> 02:17:11,320
What's the thing he says in the, stand together.

3202
02:17:11,320 --> 02:17:13,160
I think that's the actual.

3203
02:17:13,720 --> 02:17:15,160
But that's adult Aladar.

3204
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:16,680
You do not own adult Aladar.

3205
02:17:16,680 --> 02:17:17,640
No, that's baby Aladar.

3206
02:17:17,640 --> 02:17:19,560
You own Dino Alive baby Aladar.

3207
02:17:19,560 --> 02:17:20,280
Oh my God.

3208
02:17:20,280 --> 02:17:21,320
Dino Alive.

3209
02:17:21,320 --> 02:17:24,600
He walks, he talks, he's amazing.

3210
02:17:24,600 --> 02:17:25,080
I will say.

3211
02:17:25,080 --> 02:17:26,120
I'd have to agree.

3212
02:17:26,680 --> 02:17:28,600
I ordered this, it took a while to come.

3213
02:17:28,600 --> 02:17:32,440
It thankfully didn't get lost like the one that you ordered for Mike.

3214
02:17:32,440 --> 02:17:37,160
But when it arrived, I like didn't know what it was and it was such a big box.

3215
02:17:39,480 --> 02:17:40,680
Do I have this here?

3216
02:17:40,680 --> 02:17:41,160
Hold on.

3217
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:42,760
I thought I took a picture of it.

3218
02:17:42,760 --> 02:17:46,200
Was that your carry on luggage that backhoe in the overhead?

3219
02:17:46,200 --> 02:17:50,680
This was essentially a bag I brought just to carry baby Aladar.

3220
02:17:50,680 --> 02:17:51,400
Oh my God.

3221
02:17:51,400 --> 02:17:56,840
You see you carry the precious egg like a movie character cross country.

3222
02:17:56,840 --> 02:17:58,600
You had to protect an egg.

3223
02:17:58,600 --> 02:18:02,600
You were a father or bringing, you were a makeshift father,

3224
02:18:03,240 --> 02:18:05,880
bringing Aladar to his real father me.

3225
02:18:05,880 --> 02:18:06,360
Yes.

3226
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:06,600
Yes.

3227
02:18:06,600 --> 02:18:06,920
A lot.

3228
02:18:06,920 --> 02:18:09,800
It felt like the journey, the beginning of Disney's dinosaur,

3229
02:18:09,800 --> 02:18:12,760
where you're seeing the egg getting carried by all these different creatures.

3230
02:18:12,760 --> 02:18:15,480
Clive Owen and children of men getting her.

3231
02:18:15,480 --> 02:18:15,960
Absolutely.

3232
02:18:15,960 --> 02:18:19,320
People dying all around you.

3233
02:18:20,120 --> 02:18:25,480
I can't find the picture of this now, but it arrived in this like huge box.

3234
02:18:25,480 --> 02:18:29,720
And by pure coincidence, I couldn't tell if it was like a joke from the eBay

3235
02:18:29,720 --> 02:18:35,560
seller, but I think it was pure coincidence that it showed up in a box that had like

3236
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:41,720
a big stamped warning of like careful live eggs handle with care.

3237
02:18:41,720 --> 02:18:42,200
Wow.

3238
02:18:43,560 --> 02:18:44,040
That's great.

3239
02:18:44,040 --> 02:18:45,720
They just reuse some.

3240
02:18:47,240 --> 02:18:48,760
Egg delivery box.

3241
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:49,720
They were just being cute.

3242
02:18:49,720 --> 02:18:50,360
I don't know.

3243
02:18:50,360 --> 02:18:52,920
No, because it was like it was like stamped on there.

3244
02:18:52,920 --> 02:18:54,200
It wasn't like handwritten.

3245
02:18:54,760 --> 02:18:56,440
Oh, but like they may, but they still may have.

3246
02:18:56,440 --> 02:18:56,920
Might have.

3247
02:18:56,920 --> 02:18:58,440
The box for that branded.

3248
02:18:58,440 --> 02:18:59,560
No, no, it wasn't.

3249
02:18:59,560 --> 02:19:00,520
No, I see.

3250
02:19:00,520 --> 02:19:02,200
No, that was just the shipping container.

3251
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:02,920
Got you.

3252
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:03,880
It was not part of the product.

3253
02:19:03,880 --> 02:19:05,000
They were still being cute then.

3254
02:19:06,040 --> 02:19:09,720
And also, by the way, just there's so much disturbing on the box.

3255
02:19:10,360 --> 02:19:11,640
You never know what it'll do next.

3256
02:19:11,640 --> 02:19:14,120
There's a lot of every time going on with the box.

3257
02:19:14,120 --> 02:19:17,720
And then the more you feed him, the more real he becomes.

3258
02:19:18,440 --> 02:19:19,640
Just everything about it.

3259
02:19:19,640 --> 02:19:23,640
But then there's this little thing in the corner that says, try me.

3260
02:19:23,640 --> 02:19:27,240
And it's a hand that's putting up two fingers.

3261
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:30,120
And under that, it says, touch the metal contacts.

3262
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:32,120
I touch them.

3263
02:19:32,120 --> 02:19:33,480
Oh, wait, I should touch the metal.

3264
02:19:33,480 --> 02:19:34,120
Wait, what happens?

3265
02:19:34,120 --> 02:19:35,640
I think the batteries are dead.

3266
02:19:35,640 --> 02:19:36,200
That's OK.

3267
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:36,840
Yeah, yeah.

3268
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:38,200
It's probably an ancient enough.

3269
02:19:38,200 --> 02:19:38,440
Yeah.

3270
02:19:38,440 --> 02:19:42,280
This little diagram of the finger, more weird, lewd finger gestures.

3271
02:19:42,280 --> 02:19:43,560
So many lewd fingers in this episode.

3272
02:19:43,560 --> 02:19:45,880
Just put your fingers in, but then sort of curl them up

3273
02:19:45,880 --> 02:19:48,440
until you feel the contact point.

3274
02:19:48,440 --> 02:19:50,600
And you'll know when you feel it.

3275
02:19:50,600 --> 02:19:51,640
You'll know when you feel it.

3276
02:19:51,640 --> 02:19:52,680
There'll be no mistaking.

3277
02:19:56,280 --> 02:19:57,480
Griff, amazing.

3278
02:19:57,480 --> 02:20:01,880
Thank you so much for guiding baby Aladar's journey across the country.

3279
02:20:01,880 --> 02:20:05,480
I mean, I had to rethink my packing.

3280
02:20:06,760 --> 02:20:07,240
Wow.

3281
02:20:08,360 --> 02:20:09,960
That thing made a cross-country trip.

3282
02:20:09,960 --> 02:20:11,000
This is heavy.

3283
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:15,160
Also, you're on foot going into a train station.

3284
02:20:15,160 --> 02:20:16,440
Train station, I believe.

3285
02:20:16,440 --> 02:20:16,840
Correct.

3286
02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:17,320
Correct.

3287
02:20:17,320 --> 02:20:21,720
I took a cross-country train from New York.

3288
02:20:21,720 --> 02:20:23,800
This had to be accounted for.

3289
02:20:23,800 --> 02:20:24,680
It made it here.

3290
02:20:26,280 --> 02:20:29,160
I've got to cross two hotels and brought it here today

3291
02:20:29,160 --> 02:20:30,840
to its rightful place in this garage.

3292
02:20:31,640 --> 02:20:33,560
Strangers on a train remake.

3293
02:20:33,560 --> 02:20:38,040
And the guy's going like, hey, man, is that a fucking Disney dinosaur toy?

3294
02:20:38,040 --> 02:20:40,680
Is that Dino Alive baby Aladar in mint condition?

3295
02:20:40,680 --> 02:20:43,000
I was going to ask you to kill a family member of mine,

3296
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:44,840
but you're too weird for me now.

3297
02:20:45,160 --> 02:20:49,720
Oh, man, wow.

3298
02:20:49,720 --> 02:20:50,360
It's amazing.

3299
02:20:51,160 --> 02:20:54,440
The miracle of life comes from making contact with the egg.

3300
02:20:56,200 --> 02:20:58,760
I feel so much life from this.

3301
02:21:00,280 --> 02:21:01,960
Maybe I love baby Aladar now.

3302
02:21:01,960 --> 02:21:02,440
I mean.

3303
02:21:02,440 --> 02:21:03,160
After all this.

3304
02:21:04,600 --> 02:21:05,640
It took this gesture.

3305
02:21:07,400 --> 02:21:09,160
Now you have to care for him.

3306
02:21:09,160 --> 02:21:13,080
It's hard not to form an emotional attachment when he's your responsibility.

3307
02:21:14,040 --> 02:21:15,560
You can't shut me off.

3308
02:21:15,560 --> 02:21:17,320
I have no opposition.

3309
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:22,600
We between the lines, Scott, this thing is cursed.

3310
02:21:23,800 --> 02:21:29,400
Well, the last time we may have heard, we got to a baby Aladar toy that never made it.

3311
02:21:29,400 --> 02:21:30,520
It didn't have it still.

3312
02:21:30,520 --> 02:21:33,640
This is why I messaged Jason in a panic because I ordered this.

3313
02:21:33,640 --> 02:21:34,440
It arrived.

3314
02:21:34,440 --> 02:21:37,960
Then I got to the episode where you revealed that you had ordered it for Mike,

3315
02:21:37,960 --> 02:21:38,760
but it had been delayed.

3316
02:21:38,760 --> 02:21:41,800
And I was like, if I just spent all this fucking money.

3317
02:21:41,800 --> 02:21:44,280
It's the fact that this cost a substantial amount.

3318
02:21:44,280 --> 02:21:44,520
Right.

3319
02:21:44,520 --> 02:21:45,160
We had a list.

3320
02:21:45,160 --> 02:21:46,920
I didn't show that for the egg.

3321
02:21:46,920 --> 02:21:47,880
You show that for the egg.

3322
02:21:47,880 --> 02:21:49,560
The egg, the box, all that.

3323
02:21:49,560 --> 02:21:52,920
The listener told us, though, they had the same exact story where they tried to get rid

3324
02:21:52,920 --> 02:21:55,320
of the baby Aladar toy and it kept coming back.

3325
02:21:55,320 --> 02:21:58,040
Yeah, it kept coming back and they couldn't get the batteries out.

3326
02:21:58,040 --> 02:22:02,040
I think and the batteries had enough juice that every few months it would just go like

3327
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:05,000
without warning.

3328
02:22:07,560 --> 02:22:11,480
I am remembering again, because memory little fuzzy at the moment.

3329
02:22:11,800 --> 02:22:18,760
I remember I think just recently I double checked with Scott because I convinced myself that like

3330
02:22:18,760 --> 02:22:24,040
de Griffin by a Nimgaloo and I asked you like, hey, the stuff Nimgaloo is covered in bugs and

3331
02:22:24,040 --> 02:22:25,400
you threw it in the trash, right?

3332
02:22:25,400 --> 02:22:26,360
And you were like, yeah, yeah.

3333
02:22:26,360 --> 02:22:26,920
That was you.

3334
02:22:26,920 --> 02:22:27,800
You put that in.

3335
02:22:27,800 --> 02:22:30,680
You couldn't remember if I had bought a Nimgaloo or an Aladar.

3336
02:22:30,680 --> 02:22:36,040
You knew both items had trouble arriving, but you could remember which one I had got.

3337
02:22:36,040 --> 02:22:39,240
This point that we're at, what we mythologize.

3338
02:22:40,200 --> 02:22:45,400
I'm going to open this thing up and it's going to say, I'm the one you tried to buy for Mike.

3339
02:22:46,120 --> 02:22:51,080
I got into all the packaging, made it through the plastic.

3340
02:22:51,080 --> 02:22:55,560
But there was also a point where I was like, if the one for Mike arrives and Mike gets it,

3341
02:22:55,560 --> 02:23:00,840
and then I bring one for Scott as a punishment, then I feel like an asshole that Jason doesn't have.

3342
02:23:01,480 --> 02:23:02,920
A punishment Aladar?

3343
02:23:02,920 --> 02:23:03,560
That's all right.

3344
02:23:04,840 --> 02:23:06,200
I think we all need to end up with one.

3345
02:23:06,200 --> 02:23:08,120
I'm just letting you guys have fun.

3346
02:23:08,120 --> 02:23:09,080
I'm just trying.

3347
02:23:09,080 --> 02:23:09,960
Everyone's having a good time.

3348
02:23:09,960 --> 02:23:13,400
One is going to burrow out from inside your stomach tonight.

3349
02:23:16,520 --> 02:23:17,720
This gift is so...

3350
02:23:17,720 --> 02:23:19,000
I have gifts for everybody too.

3351
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:20,200
This gift is so much better.

3352
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:24,440
I just brought little gifts real quick for everybody because I want to throw...

3353
02:23:24,440 --> 02:23:25,320
It's nothing big.

3354
02:23:25,320 --> 02:23:29,000
They have these 50th anniversary McDonald's toys celebrating Disney World.

3355
02:23:29,800 --> 02:23:32,600
And I went and got a few of them.

3356
02:23:33,560 --> 02:23:34,600
This one's for Griffin.

3357
02:23:34,600 --> 02:23:35,480
This is R2-D2.

3358
02:23:35,480 --> 02:23:38,680
I was hoping for Toy Story, but it did not happen.

3359
02:23:38,680 --> 02:23:42,040
Scott, I have here Lumiere for you.

3360
02:23:42,040 --> 02:23:42,600
Wonderful.

3361
02:23:44,200 --> 02:23:46,200
50th anniversary.

3362
02:23:46,200 --> 02:23:51,480
And then for Jason, I have a Walmart exclusive Funko pop of the Moon Pie Mastop.

3363
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:53,500
Yeah!

3364
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:54,620
All right!

3365
02:23:57,400 --> 02:24:00,680
I didn't know that mid-September was suddenly Christmas.

3366
02:24:00,680 --> 02:24:01,480
When did this change?

3367
02:24:01,480 --> 02:24:02,200
Mid-September.

3368
02:24:03,720 --> 02:24:05,480
I think this is 2020 Christmas.

3369
02:24:05,480 --> 02:24:06,360
I haven't felt like we've...

3370
02:24:06,360 --> 02:24:09,320
I think we made up for it today and now out of nowhere.

3371
02:24:09,320 --> 02:24:14,120
I had something for Mike and Scott I brought back from New Jersey that I forgot today.

3372
02:24:14,120 --> 02:24:18,280
And Griffin, I real quick bought you a pretzel at DCA because I was like,

3373
02:24:18,280 --> 02:24:21,400
oh no, if I bring that, I won't have anything for Griffin.

3374
02:24:22,680 --> 02:24:25,320
Well, because I asked you, do you want to split a pretzel?

3375
02:24:25,320 --> 02:24:26,920
Because we were debating how hungry we were.

3376
02:24:26,920 --> 02:24:29,320
And then the next thing I knew, you handed me a whole pretzel.

3377
02:24:29,320 --> 02:24:29,820
I...

3378
02:24:30,380 --> 02:24:32,380
I couldn't figure out what the mech-a-nation was.

3379
02:24:32,380 --> 02:24:36,540
The short-term memory and the long-term memory are both a little fuzzy right now.

3380
02:24:36,540 --> 02:24:37,100
I'm with you.

3381
02:24:37,100 --> 02:24:37,740
I'm right there.

3382
02:24:37,740 --> 02:24:39,340
I forgot you had said that.

3383
02:24:39,340 --> 02:24:41,900
Well, we didn't even get into the cheese thing.

3384
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:45,100
No, but that's its own episode.

3385
02:24:45,100 --> 02:24:46,140
That's its own episode.

3386
02:24:46,140 --> 02:24:47,740
Jason's Cheese Polly's.

3387
02:24:47,740 --> 02:24:49,660
Not to tease the title.

3388
02:24:49,660 --> 02:24:52,300
Bummed out by the plastic cheese situation.

3389
02:24:55,020 --> 02:24:57,740
Mike, thank you for these good new anniversary toys.

3390
02:24:58,140 --> 02:25:00,620
Thank you for this egg.

3391
02:25:00,620 --> 02:25:03,020
Thank you for delivering the egg across the nation.

3392
02:25:03,020 --> 02:25:05,020
It already looks like right at home.

3393
02:25:05,660 --> 02:25:09,980
It looks like it always belonged right where you put it.

3394
02:25:09,980 --> 02:25:11,980
Underneath an out of time license plate.

3395
02:25:12,860 --> 02:25:13,500
It made of...

3396
02:25:13,500 --> 02:25:15,020
A bunch of visors.

3397
02:25:15,020 --> 02:25:18,620
Yeah, I do have a bunch of visors hung up in my garage.

3398
02:25:19,980 --> 02:25:22,140
Sports Almanac from BTTF2.

3399
02:25:23,260 --> 02:25:24,220
Anyway, yeah.

3400
02:25:24,220 --> 02:25:24,940
Thank you for that.

3401
02:25:24,940 --> 02:25:31,260
Thank you for being here, for getting us back to Disneyland, for a great hang the other day,

3402
02:25:31,260 --> 02:25:33,500
a great episode now, many great episodes.

3403
02:25:33,500 --> 02:25:35,740
Truly a thing I've been looking forward to as like,

3404
02:25:35,740 --> 02:25:38,300
oh, then I'll feel like the world is slightly normal again.

3405
02:25:39,020 --> 02:25:43,740
This is a great thing, great light at the end of the tunnel of all of that waiting.

3406
02:25:46,380 --> 02:25:50,140
I'm so happy we actually got to hang in the happiest place on earth.

3407
02:25:50,940 --> 02:25:51,660
Such a blast.

3408
02:25:52,380 --> 02:25:53,500
Let's exit through the gift shop.

3409
02:25:53,500 --> 02:25:54,540
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

3410
02:25:54,940 --> 02:25:58,700
I'd like to plug Mattel's Dino Alive Baby Aladar.

3411
02:25:58,700 --> 02:25:59,500
It's a great product.

3412
02:25:59,500 --> 02:26:01,020
More and more Dino Alives?

3413
02:26:01,020 --> 02:26:01,260
Yeah.

3414
02:26:02,380 --> 02:26:04,700
Mike, you buy a lot of vintage toys as well.

3415
02:26:04,700 --> 02:26:08,860
I kind of can't believe what good condition the packaging is in for this thing.

3416
02:26:08,860 --> 02:26:09,660
Yeah, sometimes.

3417
02:26:09,660 --> 02:26:13,660
Well, I just I revealed to you two days ago whenever we were there that I had bought some

3418
02:26:13,660 --> 02:26:18,700
Austin Powers McFarland toys that are 20 years old and I am like, well, these are like in pristine.

3419
02:26:20,460 --> 02:26:22,620
People just might just have them in the box.

3420
02:26:22,940 --> 02:26:24,860
Original shipping box.

3421
02:26:24,860 --> 02:26:25,500
Preserved.

3422
02:26:25,500 --> 02:26:28,140
Yeah, I am impressed sometimes.

3423
02:26:28,140 --> 02:26:30,380
Yeah, but yeah, look for them on eBay.

3424
02:26:31,180 --> 02:26:34,220
Blank check with Griffin and David where our podcasters found we're doing all the

3425
02:26:34,220 --> 02:26:39,500
John Carpenter movies that's taken us through the rest of the year.

3426
02:26:40,300 --> 02:26:44,140
And then Good Boys in 2022.

3427
02:26:44,140 --> 02:26:45,260
2022.

3428
02:26:45,260 --> 02:26:46,060
2022.

3429
02:26:47,020 --> 02:26:47,580
Would love to.

3430
02:26:47,580 --> 02:26:51,580
Yeah, and watch Masters of the Universe Revelation, a very uncontroversial show

3431
02:26:51,580 --> 02:26:53,340
that no one is upset about online.

3432
02:26:54,060 --> 02:26:56,860
I've had really, really normal reactions to.

3433
02:26:57,500 --> 02:26:58,780
I think it's really good.

3434
02:27:00,140 --> 02:27:03,980
Maybe even more so if you haven't watched the old show, then maybe you like it a lot

3435
02:27:04,940 --> 02:27:07,500
because you're not going to feel a lot of strange baggage.

3436
02:27:08,300 --> 02:27:13,100
But yeah, first five episodes of that are up now and the remaining five episodes will be up soon.

3437
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:17,820
I think you got a gun to voice of Aladar next for the Dinosaur reboot.

3438
02:27:17,820 --> 02:27:18,220
God.

3439
02:27:18,220 --> 02:27:19,500
That's the next one to.

3440
02:27:19,500 --> 02:27:19,820
Yeah.

3441
02:27:19,820 --> 02:27:24,300
But people, I mean, people online are going to be upset if Baby Aladar doesn't look exactly

3442
02:27:24,300 --> 02:27:28,700
as cute as he did 30 years ago in the old movie.

3443
02:27:28,700 --> 02:27:30,780
If Baby Aladar is a little too woke now.

3444
02:27:30,780 --> 02:27:33,740
If Baby Aladar is woke in a new version of Dinosaur, yeah,

3445
02:27:33,740 --> 02:27:35,180
there's going to be a lot of people online upset.

3446
02:27:35,180 --> 02:27:37,180
There's an agenda behind his burping now.

3447
02:27:37,180 --> 02:27:38,700
They don't even let him pee anymore.

3448
02:27:40,380 --> 02:27:41,420
Like that's his thing.

3449
02:27:43,100 --> 02:27:45,100

Victorious week, victorious episode.

3454
02:27:56,860 --> 02:28:00,380
I feel like we feel like we all got the beaver today.

3455
02:28:00,380 --> 02:28:01,260
Oh, tonight.

3456
02:28:02,620 --> 02:28:03,900
I'm not going to say anything else.

3457
02:28:03,900 --> 02:28:04,780
It's all right.

3458
02:28:04,780 --> 02:28:05,580
