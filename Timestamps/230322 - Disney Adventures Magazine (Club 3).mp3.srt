1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Club Three.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
All right, Metalo, a little misspronounce, a little glurgled Club Three start.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Maybe they have to be more polished.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You could have hit record again, you could have restarted.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
No, I'm just going with it.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You know, because we don't do these the standard way.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We don't even say our names other than just establish we're all here, but we've all done that.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
A lot of business to get through, I would say.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So let's dive right in.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Today's topic, Disney Adventures Magazine, the runner up in the poll and the returning fighter next month will be Disneyland smoking areas.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Really like it.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Very proud to announce that.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Excellent idea.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But you know what? I misspoke.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I said next month, and that's not actually true because we're going to do something a little different for the next poll.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I've been thinking for a little while now.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We are coming up on the tenth Club Three poll, if you can believe that.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Wow.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Really?

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yeah, isn't that weird?

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, it is.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah, it doesn't feel good.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Well, time flies when you're having fun and you're getting fun topics.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I have loved everything.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Everything that's won has been great.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I think they've all gone over well, except for that certain people called Port of Entry a debacle because people...

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Jason, do you want to address your feelings about the Port of Entry episode?

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I think I was pretty happy.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I got out everything I wanted to say.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I found some very cool articles.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I found like, you know, touring plans and Orlando Informer of like, wow, I didn't know that about Port of Entry.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And then it's just a place.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I really like the vibes.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I love the music and confit school grill.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We did the episode already.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So I said my piece.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I said my piece.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But I didn't have the discovery until it happened in real time that...

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
People thought you were under duress.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No, I had not patronized like half of these stores.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh, that part of it.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:42,000
No, I'm just saying there was a feeling with some of the audience that you were being held captive basically by two torturers.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Mike and I. And I just whatever you want to say, if you want to say that is how you felt or if you want to say that you had a fine time doing the episode.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hey, look at me.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Say whatever you want.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But say whatever you want.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Say what you fucking feel.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I think my thesis of like, look, I think it's a really fun way and it's a fun way to enter the park.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's still some of the most lingering mistreat you.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Tell them I didn't mistreat.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He wasn't mad.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He wasn't mad.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He's furious now.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
No, I think it's fun.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I think it's some of the remnants of the very early days of the park.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We're posting.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We're just doing the episode.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, I think it's fun.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Now I am going to mistreat you.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I should ignore.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We are post new logos.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You know, we're post unveiling of the new logos.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I didn't think it was that terrible.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Like, I mean...

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I didn't know.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I didn't know if you would just be upset because it changed at all.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Well, here's the thing.

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't think they're going to spend the money to take that sign down.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That's a very good point.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I would be shocked.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I mean, I'd be nice if they did.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's survived a lot of hurricanes.

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Probably needs to be repaired.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But yeah, no, I didn't think it was...

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I thought of Logan.

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I had been thinking about that too doing the episode.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I was like, man, this is the same load.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's been 20 plus years.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I think it's another...

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's a PTR curse that you talked about.

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Oh, that's true.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And now it's changing.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It keeps happening.

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But anyway, I got off the track.

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What I was going to say is I think all the topics have been great and all the suggestions have been great.

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But I've started to see as we call for new ones, people have been asking what happens to topics that don't make it.

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Is there any system to try to catch these and give them a second chance?

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And now there is.

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We are going to turn back the clock and give another chance to the topics that didn't make it.

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And we are going to give another chance in next month's theme, which is...

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Good boys of the galaxy topic rewind.

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Oh, wow.

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
All right.

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Get into it.

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So, guys, I emailed this to you.

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You should get it in front of you right now.

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What you have is a document that is a list of every topic that made it to a Club 3 poll but did not then turn into an episode.

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
We're going to go around the room twice.

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh, wow.

101
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We are each going to pick two episodes that we are two topics that we want to get back in the poll.

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And this will lead to a six-way brawl for domination of the month of April.

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We'll see what comes back.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And a little idea I had to spice it up also, because that's cool if one of the topics, you know, that deserve to get it, does get a chance to win.

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But I think it might put a little heat on the other end if we say that whatever comes in sixth now being a two-time loser has to go into PTR jail and cannot be discussed for one year's time.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't think that's harsh enough.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I think it should be a couple more.

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I was going to say forever, but should we say forever?

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I think forever is yes.

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Mike votes for upping the charges.

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Jason, how do you feel?

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Is that going to wait our two choices of like, well, I'm not going to I'm not going to banish.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I think you have to send your prized fighter in knowing that they might get the shit kicked out.

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Right.

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But it could also take it all the way.

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I don't know.

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And I think it's interesting for the voter.

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:37,000
If you look at the results and something is already way ahead as number one, maybe you use your vote in a different way to try to save the bottom.

119
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
There's another one down.

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh, OK. I'm sorry.

121
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I misunderstood.

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The voters are the ones who could potentially send a topic to hell.

123
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I get it.

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We're throwing it out there.

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But then, yeah, we will be because we're going to say six topics and then the audience will still vote like a usual Club 3 poll.

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But but it's a way to your vote because you are you're you're sending one up to victory, but also potentially sending one to hell.

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yeah.

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And if somebody has one ready to go, I was going to suggest that Mike go first because your choices for the last three months in a row have come in last.

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So if you would like to.

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So I'm not going to pick anything I like here because I don't want to get rid of like, for instance, that Don Nott's at WikiWaki Springs promoting Mr.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Limpett.

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm not going to pick it because I want it to live on.

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't like this.

134
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Well, we have to be strategic.

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Now, this is what Jason was concerned about.

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This is what I'm saying.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Now we end up maybe we got to do only one year because I don't want because maybe don't you want that one to potentially.

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I think one year is fair.

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I think one year is fair because.

140
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I like forever.

141
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Inevitably.

142
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You're just going to pick bad topics?

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
No, I didn't say that.

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
OK.

145
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Maybe there's one that I think's on the bubble that I won't pick.

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Maybe I'm going to only pick heavy hitters because I want to see them get into the top one or two or three.

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah, OK.

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm not going to completely throw the fight here, but for instance, something like Don Nott's I'm worried about.

149
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I maybe won't choose it because I might run up the back.

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Right.

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's interesting.

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
OK.

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I guess I guess you're right.

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Well, I did not think about the psychological implications of the sending to hell system.

155
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Do you have something you wanted or do you see to Jason?

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I see to Jason.

157
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
OK, Jason, your first pick.

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:36,000
OK, I'm going to go for a little left field one, but it's a thing I am interested in, but I have not really, really deep dive on it.

159
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And I don't even know how much you can.

160
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So I'm going to pick first out the gate the Google Assistant dark ride from CES 2019.

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Wow.

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Google Assistant dark ride.

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I think it's a I think it's an interesting time for tech companies.

164
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:58,000
They're all laying people off, seemingly for no reason, because they're, I don't know, grifters and liars and what have you.

165
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So you're on blast tech giants who subscribe to Club 3.

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yeah.

167
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah.

168
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So I but I think this this definitely feels like a time of plenty of like the go go 2019 year.

169
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Where they're building a dark ride for their CES presentation.

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Everything was fine in tech.

171
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Everything was fine.

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Everything was great.

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Roaring 2019.

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Wow.

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Do you want to take a mic or do I?

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I will choose.

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
God, I don't want to.

178
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm so worried.

179
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll choose the conversations with Michael Eisner.

180
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

181
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I would like to see that get an error.

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That was that was on my shortlist potentially, too.

183
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I believe he has a book on that, too.

184
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I think I saw there.

185
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
There's a book and maybe an audio book on that.

186
00:09:46,000 --> 00:10:03,000
OK, well, then much to discuss is CNBC show and among other things, I am very excited to give the rewind nod to Universal Studios Theme Park Adventures, the GameCube game from 2001.

187
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:11,000
If I haven't made this sell already or if you don't know, this is a game where you wander around a mostly empty Universal Studios Japan.

188
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And before you can get on any rides, you have to pick up a bunch of trash.

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So if that doesn't sell you, that doesn't keep it out of hell.

190
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't know how else to do, but I'm very excited.

191
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That's going to get another go back to you, Jason.

192
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:33,000
OK, this is this is another thing that I really would like a chance to dig into the topic more.

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And it's it's got one of our main are all all star guys in it.

194
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm going to go with the Muppets 2015 episode where Fozzie meets Jay Leno.

195
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Oh, yeah, that's that's a great choice.

196
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh, I don't remember offhand what the other details of the episode where it was fully fleshed out.

197
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You can only there's only so many letters, characters you can put in the poll. But I yeah, I I'll see if I can find it fast.

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Well, Mike makes this bit, but it seems like a good story.

199
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah, Leno meets them up. It sounds like fun.

200
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Now, here's my thinking. I can pick something that I think is maybe going to get fourth place fifth place if I'm lucky.

201
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I could also choose something I never want to talk about that I'm confident will be number six that I can banish to the underworld forever.

202
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Well, I think you're challenging. I am challenging that.

203
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I think so. I think now we end up with maybe people do it at you know, if they do it out of spite, they have their gluttons for punishment because I'm going to choose escape from tomorrow.

204
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:39,000
No. Oh, thank God. Thank God you're saying that and not Don Nott's just give Don Nott's. I've chosen my choice.

205
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Oh, my God. What I choose is my choice from the Smash Mokun song.

206
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Okay. Oh, fair enough. Oh, no. Well, that is don't want to talk about that.

207
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Okay. I hate it. But you know, we might get votes in that direction, but that is one of the ones that in the comments, people were saying, does can this get another go?

208
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And now it is. And with me having the last choice, there's only one possible way to go with it, which is bar rescue.

209
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:24,000
John Taff right deep dive the taffer. So, so the choices, unless guys scan the list really quick, if we could all agree on a number seven to make this a seven way, if there's one that we think has got to be in there.

210
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Well, I mean, I think like one of the pure most pure ones that everyone will love that is on there is uncle O'grimace.

211
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Uh huh. That would be I don't know if there was a universal I was expecting cheering rapturous applause and didn't really get it. So that's fine. That's fine.

212
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Well, what I mean is there potentially an uncle O'grimace use either for St. Patrick's or some greater McDonald's McDonald's year.

213
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Probably the full year where we cover McDonald's probably get a full year. We can send uncle O'grimace to a domain feed St. Patty's days coming up.

214
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Well, maybe they might be passed for the time you're hearing this. Yeah, that's true.

215
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Okay. So in the poll will be bar rescue John taffer deep dive conversations with Michael Eisner on CNBC escape from tomorrow. 2013 that by the way, if you don't know, that's the movie that was secretly filmed in the Disney parks.

216
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah. Yeah. That was billed as like the most subversive film. Yeah. And then you saw it.

217
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You had a different review. Don't forget also filming important filming location. The worst green screen mankind ever created.

218
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yeah. Well, when that part kicks in, you're like, I didn't really make good in the promise. Did you?

219
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Disney was worried for a second and then they saw it. They're like, whatever.

220
00:13:49,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Lions don't care about the thoughts of the sheep. You know. Okay. It's here from our Google Assistant dark ride Muppets Fozzie meets Jay Leno and Universal Studios picking up trash adventure for GameCube.

221
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So the first six way poll make your posts. Wow. Your choices wisely. Join the conversation.

222
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Get involved. Okay. Great. Excited for that. And of course, Disneyland smoking areas will return after all that is done.

223
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:37,000
But now we take it to Disney Adventures magazine as suggested by Becca Gilgen. I googled the magazine and the cover showed everything from the Backstreet Boys to the mask animated show, which the guys were just talking about.

224
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And absolutely. I mean, great covers, great magazine. I absolutely subscribed to this magazine was delighted to see it in the poll. How do you guys feel about Disney Adventures?

225
00:14:48,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I just the warmest memory is the most fond memories looking up these covers. And first I did. I looked up some of the articles and comic strips and ads. I certainly did. But the covers, you can't beat them.

226
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's mainly covers. I would say these are, I mean, we as with Jay Leno meeting Fozzie Bear, that could have been one of them should have been one of them when he took over tonight.

227
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
How did that happen? When that happened, it was just busy. I got busy with the affiliates. So busy with the affiliates.

228
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Busy with the affiliates. Him with like him with the genie stretching out his chin to look like Jay. Oh my God. That would have been great. That would have been great. Disney Adventure. Unbelievable. So excited about it. Yes. Every month. Every month. So excited that I've got all my old Disney Adventures on me right now.

229
00:15:40,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I had a pile and I forgot to bring them and I feel like a fool. I was assuming you'd have a pile. I did. I mean, I found snippets from it so I can talk about those. I don't have the impressive pile that you have. I've saved. This is a lot. I had a lot of magazines growing up and I've tried to go through and save like select ones because there was just too many. I still have too many. But these are the ones I found in storage.

230
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's hard with collector's brain where it's like, well, I'm saving all the, I'm not throwing out any of the comics and magazines are kind of close. They're periodical, you know, like, yeah. But I think at one point when my mom was moving, she's like, do we need all these Disney Adventures? And I can't remember if I picked out some and threw them in a box or if I just said throw them in the garbage.

231
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:47,000
This took me a while to find them too because I have all the stuff now in the garage and whatever. But I have a few selects from a lot of different magazines. I mean, I may even have a stuff magazine here somewhere. I may have stuff. Stuff was like Maxim. And I know he was going to say it's contradictory, but this is what I purchased. I was after older than 18, I think, when I was reading stuff.

232
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Who was on this cover of this stuff?

233
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I think I might have had like a Pamela Anderson stuff magazine, which is I think what the picture I was scared to look at when I was 13 or 12 or whatever.

234
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That was discussed. If you look up stuff magazine Pamela Anderson, I think that's what it was. I also read Blender periodically, which had a sexy lady often on the cover, but I was very into music. So that's why I was reading it.

235
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Again, after I was older than 18. So don't worry. Sure. Nothing on to untoward was happening, but I have a collection of all the wizard magazines I have.

236
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Don't worry. He had wizard stuff. Toy Fair magazine. I was never a Toy Fair guy. I liked the Twisted Toy Fair theater that was kind of like an early, early robot chicken. Yeah. But also you had a lot more of the like one off wizard special issues in the way that like life or just magazines as a store would be like.

237
00:17:49,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Bruce Springsteen. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, no, I was big. We were says magazine family. I have some entertainment weekly still. And yeah, for a while I would get these every month. But yeah, I have I have my selects here and they're in okay shape.

238
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yeah. Well, is one of it. I like shout out some surprised ones and look, I've got it. I've got the big one. Yeah. Hammer and Darkwing Duck and early one. This is the first one I think I ever owned. That was one of my first 1990 January 1992.

239
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That is over 30 years old at this point. And I remember I think I got this from our local comic store from Dreamland Comics. And I remember just being like, this is maybe the greatest image I've ever seen. Like I was such an exciting picture. They're both kind of leaning both making arms out like what are you going to do about it? Yes. We're just cool.

240
00:18:45,000 --> 00:19:05,000
They were two cool guys. They were the two coolest guys in America at the time. Big, big blazers. A lot of breasts on those jackets. There was like a wide. I don't really think of Darkwing Duck is like a cool cartoon, but it certainly had the coolest theme song of a Disney afternoon show up to that point.

241
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:34,000
In the sense that it's like a little bit groovy. I take offense on behalf of Chippendale rescue ranger. I'm not saying it's a better song. I'm not saying it's a better song. I'm saying there's a little more like vibe to it. There's a little more like, like you can kind of dance to it. Those other songs are good. And I'm not even saying I like one better than the other. I told you I almost got kicked out of my dorm for dancing to the DuckTales theme. Well, you said you were stomping around like Godzilla. I was stomping around. Yeah, but that's a duck.

242
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah, but that's a dance. It is a dance, but stopping. That's actually a perfect illustration. My point DuckTales a perfect song to kind of stop around to. You don't have to be so much rhythm to it. But Darkwing Duck's theme song is definitely like a little bit more of a dance song. And it has more of sort of 90s like dance song hallmarks. I feel like this is our R&B song. But I don't think it requires a more elevated type of dancing.

243
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Well, it doesn't require that. I'm just explaining this is maybe what their thought process is. Darkwing Duck, even though he was kind of like Inspector Gadget, they thought of him as like a cooler character. Maybe I'm wrong. I guess Goof Troop kind of has like a more modern pop theme song too.

244
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I don't think that one has the same pull. But it's not as good as Darkwing Duck's theme song.

245
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I don't know. This is just a taste issue. I sincerely. I'm not saying it's better. Yeah, yeah, sure. I think Gummy Bear's theme is awesome. Yeah, yeah. That not now not so dancey. No, not so dancey. It's a soaring song. Yeah, that's an emotional. Yeah, it is kind of emotional honestly. And I didn't even like that show. I didn't really watch that show much.

246
00:20:36,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Mike, what is the cover date on that? January 1992. Okay. Well, you know, a big part of the Disney Adventures cover is where like cartoon character and live person and icons, iconic cartoons and icon of the year. I think the big thing for me as a kid too, just the cover design made it seem like a grown up magazine.

247
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And I felt like a little more mature, especially because inside was like general interest. I like it was culture stuff and like oddly enough stories and music and movies, but then sports. And then here we followed, you know, like a guy climbs cliffs and here's about archaeology.

248
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And yeah, they cover. It was a very good, well rounded magazine and a lot of comics. A lot of the comics. But the and not just Disney, it covered a lot of pop culture, other TV networks and movie studios. It's not like the kind of like wall garden thing that like Disney has now.

249
00:21:45,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Like here's here's a dark wing duck making multiple appearances. Here he is with the mask. And of course I had that they're both tipping their big hats. That makes sense. Good pair. But then the above the logo, East Ventura puts on the mask.

250
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So double Jim Carrey on this cover. Well, that's you got to. Yeah, you're you're absolutely right. This was something Aaron pointed out as we were looking at old issues is can you imagine today something with the word Disney on it that so voraciously plugs the work of other studios?

251
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Networks. It's insane. There was I saw something that was like a they would often you know this magazine kind of was my guide for what's cool and what's not. Well, we're going to talk about that. That's maybe my favorite thing. Yeah, yeah, this funny. This is great.

252
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But you know, like here this this there was a regular ins and outs segment and the in the here the in and out in for clothes Warner Brothers clothes out Barney clothes. I mean, that's great. And you're like, yeah, that's a rep is Barney so lame.

253
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:19,000
But I'd like to blow him. I want to hurt Barney. But it says Disney on the cover and then Warner Brothers clothes are in the other universe. Michael Eisner. I probably didn't have eyes on this at the time or else I bet he would have maybe said like, oh, yeah, you might not have had eyes on every page.

254
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I think he was you know what it is actually considered like a major stepping stone in the career of an executive named Michael Linton who started Disney publishing. He was considered like a young go getter because Eisner kind of wanted you know, newer hungrier people.

255
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Right, you know, instead of like, you know, Walt's relatives hanging around. So this guy started Disney publishing up entirely and this is one of his first major victories because he grew up in Europe, I think in Holland, and he had the magazine Topolino.

256
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, an Italian Mickey Mouse magazine and had a lot of Mickey comics. Yeah, in it. So this is a lot of his earlier exposure to the characters and he said, Why is there no such thing as this in America, we should do it. He starts it up a big hit out of the gates started this entire magazine arm of Disney that there wasn't before.

257
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And that guy went on to become the CEO of Sony Entertainment. And today he is the chairman of both the Warner Music Group and snap, meaning Snapchat. Yeah, both of those things at the same time. He's one of the most successful executives ever.

258
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Wow, it started with Disney Adventures. Topolino. This is just like a big gap in my knowledge thing but like worldwide, there was a whole chunk of Disney, I think most Americans that like, oh yeah, Mickey Mouse comics are huge the DuckTale like the comics that inspired DuckTales

259
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Carl Bark stuff of fan graphics puts out very nice collections of them. He like Tintin level huge those were the big adventure comics, the Duck comics and Tintin.

260
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah, real quick, I just want to periodically through this episode, read and ins and outs that are in these because these are my favorite things in all these magazines so this one is from the X-Men are on the cover it's February 1995 so a few years after that, the Darkwing T-Rex.

261
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
The Darkwing Duck.

262
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:42,000
This is hot the music hot and not hot smashing pumpkins, Mr. Jones by counting crows ace of base, not Reba McIntyre guns and roses clothes hot Doc Martens shack shoes bell button bell bottoms, not dorky flowery stuff all dresses except baby doll dresses.

263
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:55,000
What's what he's all dresses are not hot, except for baby doll dresses very totalitarian yes point of view, can I just say, I'm looking at a hotter not right now.

264
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I don't know what the year difference on this but I'm seeing.

265
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Wait wait where to go I'm seeing hot music country, and I'm seeing not hot clothes bell bottoms what's going on. Well I guess this is how rapidly culture changes. Yeah, is that they're one month or hot one month or not.

266
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Like for instance did you know this month Mrs doubt fire lightning jack and home alone to are hot and not Jurassic Park, not hot dress park in 1995 February, not hot anymore.

267
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Oh, yeah, sorry in favor of lightning jack that's right and home alone to now in 95.

268
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm sorry, what is lightning jack I don't know. I don't know.

269
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Okay, this is a good time to talk about the reaction of, I don't know. I found a page of.

270
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It's called new kids on the block and it's about bands the hottest new meet the faces behind the brand new sound hitting the airwaves.

271
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I until I read the descriptions with them, I had a lot of who. And these are equations. Okay.

272
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:23,000
So, I'm going to give you the best one first partridge family divided by Hanson equals Katie Cassidy.

273
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Katie Cassidy is this a nepo. Yeah, we got a nepo baby. Katie's father David led the partridge family to fame with hit records and TV show in the 1970s. Wow.

274
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
There, there's a lot of stuff for you go what is this, when you're looking through these.

275
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And that yeah that's one of them, like, all of a sudden I'm looking through this and there's a picture of like a little boy robot, who looks like he's like hooked up to oxygen.

276
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Is that from 97 lost in space. No, it's not. Joey eight plays Ulysses on Earth to the sci fi show about living on a new planet 200 years from now.

277
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I don't know what that is. I kind of faintly remember to Earth to got a cover there there.

278
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Two was on the cover at some point. Oh, was it a car with a character. It was the whole game. Wow. Earth to you. I don't know if it was with a Disney.

279
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:24,000
They were hired this practice by the way, in a very cruel move they stopped doing the celebrity and the character photo so we're going to I think focus on everything before that probably was there more of these equations.

280
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Okay, I gotta go this this one. Jane data remember this group, so it, it's the new group Dixie chicks plus me anymore equals both sisters. Do you remember the both sisters. No, no. Okay. The both sisters.

281
00:28:44,000 --> 00:29:06,000
An insane number of soundtracks. Ellen Shannon home on the range. Disney Girls Rock. The Lizzie McGuire movie dance mania they appeared on the soundtrack of because of when Dixie and also how to lose a guy in 10 days.

282
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So this is like they're trying to push it via this is like that artists there's like the pop star in 2002 Country Bears who nobody. Right. Right. And the only credit is another movie. Right. Yeah. This is one path like it well if Hollywood says they're real and they must be.

283
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yeah, and reading about them it's like, oh, they were going to have a Sony record contract and then they decided one of them decided to go to college.

284
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Super stardom or college. Yeah, they put out a few more on their own label. I mean this is they beat Napster I think they, they made the right choice. Yeah. Wow. Lightning Jack, by the way, is a 94 Western turn of Paul Hogan.

285
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:03,000
As well as written by him as well and also starring Cuba Gooding Jr and Beverly D. Angela. Wow. So again, so if you were, I think we can well, you know, a lot of people listening were were kids in 95 you probably remember how by 95.

286
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:12,000
You did not want to see a dinosaur again you like you you vomit at this site. T Rex mere months after you saw it like Jack shirts, please.

287
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Lightning Jack Lunchables. Look, people were yeah people saw Jurassic Park but they did they had had enough with Disney Adventures after this cover of Hulk Hogan and the dinosaur.

288
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,000
This is one of the greats I don't have a hard copy of that either. Yeah. Yeah. Well it's Hulk Hogan.

289
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Putting a he's got a dinosaur in a headlock. Yeah, is in a headlock no bandana very bald. No bandana. This is a missed opportunity in the cinematic works of Hulk Hogan to like show the events leading up to that situation.

290
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Yeah, an entire movie of Hulk wrestling dinosaurs that look like that that are as cartoony as the one you just show.

291
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Yeah, it's I'm trying to remember. I don't that's before I liked wrestling so that wasn't even on my radar, sadly, but the Hulk versus brontosaurus brontosaurus but but I would have come out before this when dinosaurs were out and they were not hot anymore.

292
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:18,000
So that would make sense. This is there's so much x-men in this I remember going nuts. Oh, yeah, this is before Disney owned Marvel. What year is that 95.

293
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Okay. They've also got Disney adventures fourth annual music awards here in this issue. I found some I was looking at the third which are famous favorite female singers Janet Jackson favorite male singer is Garth Brooks.

294
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Their favorite group is ace of base, and the coolest dressed award. Mr. Steven Tyler.

295
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So don't you feel justified why you have the taste of a bunch of children from 1995. That's correct from 28 years ago you know and if you turn the if you turn the page it says the hottest things in 1995.

296
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And there's Sheryl Crow, there's collective soul there's candle box and yeah candle box was hot Green Day.

297
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Once again, well if hey can 100 kids responding to a poll 28 years ago be wrong. That's right. You're telling me Green Day dookie era green he was popular.

298
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:32,000
10 million selling so yeah yeah I started filling out the third annual music survey okay and did not send it in I what I probably found was that I did not have answers to enough of the questions.

299
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I just stopped trot like can I name a group there's no look the Beach Boys aren't going to make it so yeah I should probably just stop filling it up but I did check my favorite type of music oldies favorite male singer Michael Jackson favorite female singer Shanice.

300
00:32:48,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I did place and I stand by this. I like Shanice I like I love your smile, very much. Great performance in front of the Matterhorn in the early 90s Disney special. Right. We all come across the Michael Jackson cover.

301
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I have to. Michael Jackson with Pinocchio on his shoulder. Yeah, yeah, I had that but I think for some reason I didn't hold on to that one. I don't think I want to hold on to it as a digital copy on my laptop.

302
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yeah, I took the risk. Here's a more wholesome one to balance it out though because this this was I remember getting a couple of these here and there when I if I went to the grocery store with my mom because they had giant magazine sections and it was Disney so it was wholesome and trustworthy.

303
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And then at some point I think she sent away either got someone was selling magazines and I got a subscription and we had a subscription for years, I think I was in high school, my brother was younger than me.

304
00:33:49,000 --> 00:34:03,000
So we just kept it going for a while but there was a time where I was getting like X-Men subscription Disney adventure subscription. And then we sent away a form on the back of Lunchables and I had a Spider-Man subscription to for a while.

305
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Anyway, this is one that stuck in my mind as an early when I had which is Jafar in Beethoven the dog. Oh yeah, I have.

306
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Not your dog germs. Here it is.

307
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
There it is right there. Do not lick me.

308
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:36,000
We have to just we have to describe these scenarios because it's a two of them together but the little scenes that are invented right really what are wonderful. By the way, I also have the Michael Jackson one in front of me and they're the like the article, whatever the headline for this one.

309
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:48,000
25 things you probably didn't know about Michael Jackson in 1993. I actually think a lot of people did know most of them.

310
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Great singer. Okay, you know look I'm the one who voted for him.

311
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:05,000
But you know but I didn't send it in so I have nothing to take back right yeah you're not part of it. You know, I know we're all over the place here, real quick what I'll say is I'm looking through is I'm looking through all of these.

312
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I haven't looked at these in a long time. And, oh my god I forgot about this oh my god I forgot about this. And then I will feel my brain turn off when there's an article it's vaguely educational. Oh yeah, I like, there's something about the pyramids or something

313
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:28,000
about exploring Antarctica, I, my brain, I can feel it shut down I can feel there's no nostalgia because I didn't even bother to read this because I was such a little idiot.

314
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I subscribed to this for I believe four years. I don't think I ever read one article of that nature. I basically used this as a children's entertainment weekly. I want to know what movies and music are coming out.

315
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Maybe I have some vague sense of what might be considered cool I will probably still get it wrong.

316
00:35:47,000 --> 00:36:04,000
But, you know that section of the magazine is pretty much over within. Yeah, the first 10 pages so the rest of it just ballast. I didn't even, I didn't read, I don't think I don't think I read 6% of the Disney Adventures magazines that I claim to be fond of.

317
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Yeah, no it's it's really wild to look at it and I go some of these might be actually interesting. There's like a six or seven page article just about pirates and stuff. Zero interest, not about the ride who cares. Moving on what else is there, oh video game ad for Super Nintendo.

318
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I'm staring at this for a few minutes. It was a video game for system I did not have that had my interest because I'm like, I'm probably not going to play that.

319
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Wild Runner, Wildy Coyote, Desert Demolition for Sega Genesis. Holy shit I didn't have Sega. This must have been a dream to play. I never did. Mike, only because this came up.

320
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Worst new costume in this January 1994. Worst new costume, the invisible woman in Fantastic Four. That's what I was just talking about. Yeah. I made that joke about her racy new costume. Yeah.

321
00:36:50,000 --> 00:37:02,000
In this episode? No no, a couple days ago when we were recording. Yeah. But I said I threw away the issue because you could see her navel. Oh this was a navel. That was an Annette reference.

322
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:20,000
But staying in the world of comic books under the Hall of Lame, the biggest book bummer, the death of Superman. The whole, the entire Doomsday story lining one book. It's okay now though, Supes back. Because he didn't stay dead for very long.

323
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:34,000
No. So yes, Scott back to your thing with the scenarios. It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's clear out, let's talk covers for a little bit. We want to make sure we get to all of these and then we'll see what else we can fit in. But yes, please.

324
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So yeah, I'm holding here Wayne and Garth with Cruella DeVille and Ursula sort of like talking to, like what do you think is happening on this cover? It looks like Cruella is like trying to get Garth's attention and then Ursula might just be sort of entertained by them.

325
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
She looks like she's mid clap.

326
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Sure. This one is, I would say is less well tied together than others. I don't think there was a custom photo shoot done with Mike and Dana. It doesn't seem like it. Does it feel that way to me? I don't know if I can tell the intention there. But there are, is it like, I don't know, are they babes? Are they, are they swinging?

327
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:33,000
That's kind of what I get the sense of. Cruella and Ursula generally not like fangirling a lot because they have such, such goals, such whatever evil plans. But no, they seem to be very taken with Wayne and Garth in this instance. And yeah, they just seem like they want to like be hanging out with them at the very least.

328
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:51,000
If not, Ursula might be taking Wayne's voice. He sings or his guitar shredding abilities. She might have bad plans. They should have added like some effects to make it look like Wayne's voice was coming out into her hands.

329
00:38:51,000 --> 00:39:00,000
That's pretty easy. That's pretty visualized in Little Mermaid. Right. Yeah. So if that is what it was, they dropped the ball. Music notes perhaps coming out of his guitar. Yeah.

330
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So maybe that's what it is. Maybe Ursula is stealing Wayne's singing voice and I guess voice in general. And Cruella is jerking off Garth under the part of the magazine we can see.

331
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Well, you know what, actually, it would, she'd have to be doing something to his butt is what I'm going to say. Like, because the way her hand in the front, you can see her hand in the front of him and then the hand behind you can't see.

332
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:37,000
So maybe this is sort of what Kim Basinger was like that. She's filling the Kim Basinger role of Wayne's World 2. Yeah. People, yeah, there's oddly, either Garth's getting nothing or it's really scarily aggressive.

333
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Yeah. So when was Wayne's World 2 come out? Indeed. We've got to check one of these hot or not. Because this is July 92. Is that 93 maybe? So maybe this is before. So. No, this is Wayne's World 1 main. Yeah. Yeah.

334
00:39:51,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Okay. I also, by the way, oh, okay, sorry, keep going. No, I don't. I said all I had to say. Flip to the back because this is a wonderful, there's a lot of ads for Tiger Electronics throughout these, the little, the handheld, not Game Boy, but the free-standing cartridges with the worst graphics you've ever seen. Oh, yeah.

335
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:25,000
But that at least make you feel like I have a tangible Beauty and the Beast or Little Mermaid or Batman Returns product in my hand. And I love this Beauty and the Beast one a lot because you don't really think about handheld video games and romance. Right.

336
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:48,000
This beautiful pink cartridge has been laid out on a nice table between two candles and a rose. Yes. And it says bring home a Beauty of a game. This is the most elegant, very simple video game ever played. Yes. I got the Aladdin one. We had this, yes. Over here. Yeah, but that's not as romantic, that layout.

337
00:40:48,000 --> 00:41:02,000
You broke the mood, Jason. We're trying to start. Well, look, we're lost in romance. No, Aladdin and Jasmine, the running away together right on the printed corner. Yeah, that's more exciting. This is a romantic, slow romance.

338
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:14,000
You imagine the tray being opened up. What's my defined delicacy I will eat this evening. Right. You're great. Oh, a Tiger Electronics game for me.

339
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Yeah, the big platter you're lifted up. Which Tiger Electronics game will it be? I don't know. Somewhere in my my screenshots. This is just listener. This will just be a barrage of free association, whatever we think of. But really excellent Tiger Electronics.

340
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I mean, mainly this magazine was great just to see, like, I just want a big picture of Danny DeVito Penguin, right? Like, now I have this. This came to me in the mail. I don't need an article. I don't need to learn anything.

341
00:41:48,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I just want to see this Batman Returns ad. A lot of great video games that I learned about from these old issues that I didn't know about previously. I don't remember Booger Man. Oh, yeah. Booger Man. I never played.

342
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I remember Booger Man. I don't think I ever played it. Little crew. Little bot. You voted for it for not due to its crudeness. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Put it in the crude file or in the not file. I don't really remember the caveman video game. Chuck Rock. Yes, I remember that. You remember Chuck Rock. I didn't play it though. Chuck Rocks. Your super NES. This is also this is the dying days of this is something because I've like grabbed a lot of old magazines.

343
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I've grabbed a lot of old magazines over the years, especially from the 80s. But this is the last vestiges vestiges in the early 90s of magazine ads having tons of copy. Oh, yeah. You don't ever see that now, but especially in the 80s. Here's the big point. We're making in a picture.

344
00:42:50,000 --> 00:43:12,000
And now here's seven paragraphs to further elucidate the point here. And in this you get just a long you get the whole story of Chuck Rock and mainly the detail you join Chuck Rock on his belly bashing, odor kicking rock tossing mission to rescue his wife Ophelia from arch rival Gary Gritter.

345
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:28,000
It's about it's a very glitter, not very greater who I don't I don't know if we ever have any of I hope not. I have to take that with like, yeah, did he get a very good or got a cover with Peter Pan? Unfortunately.

346
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Oh, Kevin Spacey and Simba. No, I hope nobody kept that one. Robert Blake and Robin Hood.

347
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Oh, another one. I can't believe I don't remember this. And we just did all of this kind of Nintendo dumpster diving. We probably rejected this information because it is educational because there was the game Mario's Time Machine. That's what I was just referencing the other day on one of the episodes.

348
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:08,000
You reference Mario's time. I think that's the one I was talking about because yeah, he goes to different historical. Yeah, it was a very brief mention on one of the episodes. I had Mario teaches typing.

349
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Oh, which was kind of reasonably satisfied. He teach you typing.

350
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I think it was half him and half like classes in school. I had a lot of computer typing classes in school, but I can still tell on a computer nowadays where I tapped out or the course ended because if I have to go to the number row or like the all the options on the numbers, I got to look. I can't do it blind. Yeah, I know.

351
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I have to look at that. Okay, that's not I think it depends what you're talking about. But like you mean like if it's a like an exclamation point or something or it's two, there's two options. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But depending on what keyboard it is, sometimes or ZQ X. Well, you're missing like a third of the

352
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I know I got the important punctuation, but like 16 letters, I'm from lost. I can't pull where ampersand is, you know. Oh, yeah. Just I don't know where that is. Yeah, I'm not sure. Yeah, I've been taking a test in a long time. You don't have you don't ever have to renew your typing license.

353
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Was there anything else in this category? Oh, yes, of course. Kind of crazy ad copy here for hook the video game. Oh, yeah. Copy is cross your sword with the bloodiest pirate of them all.

354
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I have to cross my sword with cross swords with hook. Yeah, but look, I'm I'm fully I'm deep into being creeped out by Peter Pan. But now I am being now I need to cross a sword with hook. I didn't think hook was the one to be worried about here. I just a Disney product mentioning the concept of blood is a little shocking to me in this day and age.

355
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:12,000
The bloodiest pirate of them all. I think there's a lot of easy probably that you know, you bring that up and I just happen to have stopped on this ad right here. This is 1992. Look at this sweet sweet tarts. It says lick this.

356
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:28,000
This is a children's magazine is a picture of a sweet tart. It says lick this. Oh, it is. You're a little bit of a distance away from me, Mike. Yeah. And that is a tiny red. It's a little like, well, it's a little it looks a little pink where I'm sitting. It does look a little pink.

357
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:42,000
It says lick this. Yes. You know, children's magazine. Yes. Now look, it went right over my head and I said, yes, mother, let's go out and get a roll of sweet tarts. This sounds delicious. But now I'm looking this as an adult is very responsible.

358
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Look at all this weird people were right. Those Republicans are right. They were. They just missed this years ago. 30 years ago. They were on the campaign trail. I've got a more wholesome ad.

359
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I think God, if you are friend, the Taco Bell Chihuahua is here and he is saying tacos and animorphs pinch me. I must be dreaming.

360
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
That is one of the finest.

361
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:25,000
That is that was like a 90s thing of like, oh, hot, hot tub and chocolate. Oh, heaven. Like, you know, I was just I couldn't I dawned on me that it's like, oh, these are toys because they're they did make an animorphs TV show.

362
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And I was like, you know, toys based on a book series is pretty interesting. And then I'm like, oh, wait, there was a cheaply made Canadian TV shows with some of the worst morphing you've ever seen.

363
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I mean, I love it now. I love seeing it now. But Taco Bell and animorphs doesn't sound like a bad night to me. I must pinch me. I must be dreaming.

364
00:47:47,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Two more things from this at this Wayne Wayne's World issue. I found I open this comic in here and it's called Space Mickey and the Throg Ray Wars. And I don't think I gasped, but I kind of did because I went, oh, my God, I loved this.

365
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Oh, and I haven't thought about it forever. Like, it's got such fun, cool art.

366
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Really like kind of hyper illustrated, not a style you see Mickey and Minnie in very often. Right. And it's like they get captured Mickey, Minnie, Pete and Goofy.

367
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And then they like end up in like a Star Wars like space fight. And I just remember going, oh, this is like the ultimate version. Like they're in like a Bucky O'Hare style, like ships firing lasers. And I remember going, oh, my God, this amazing. And I haven't thought about that. Oh, sure. 30 years.

368
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:48,000
You just toss that. You just find a random Mickey quote. Oh, you know what? You know what? Actually, go. Let's the start of it. They're flying in a small plane and they're like lost or something.

369
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And it opens with Pete telling Goofy. So how was I supposed to know he was the chief of police? If I had known that I wouldn't have conked him with a blackjack. Now, would I?

370
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Goofy goes, I don't know what's a blackjack. Just a big like, you know, like with that. It's like a sap. It's a sap. Like a club. No, it's a leather. It's a leather with a chunk of metal in it. Oh, you knock someone out. I never knew what that was.

371
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Yeah, like thing. I forget what the Simpson episode where he keeps like hitting him. He goes, where'd you get that? And he goes, sent away. OK, yeah, I bought one for you.

372
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Showed me a few years ago. A real one. Yeah, Sam Blackjack. I have one. I hope there was no harm done to any of your fellow. No, no, no, no, no. Of course, just Jason and I on stage.

373
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:46,000
No, but I didn't use it on him. But anyway, we didn't use it on him in the port of entry episode either. Tell them we do have a great time. We didn't. I was so you like I was so clumsy. I fell into the door.

374
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Now I did it to myself.

375
00:49:50,000 --> 00:50:09,000
So, so yeah, so I was like, oh my God, this is great. And then you're going past it's like some article about like what happened in World War Two or something snooze. But then you get to this and it's a it's a showcase of like a cool job you can have. Guy sells hot dogs at Wrigley Field. Nice.

376
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Whoops. Sure. Winners. What a great tumble. Chicago ballpark. And then it's just like a one page thing of a bit like what a great job this guy's got. He gets to sell hot dogs to people. And then I was like, oh yeah, now we're back. Yeah. After some educational shit.

377
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:44,000
The the cover of the Jafar Beethoven one. I just realized the big cover story says what's big, hairy and slobbers Beethoven plus everything you need to know about the Super Bowl.

378
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
This is great.

379
00:50:45,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Yeah, a lot of territory. I'm going to I'm going to shout out a couple other covers. Yeah, yeah. John Candy rides the rails. Oh, wow. He's like a he's like a conductor and blue tailspin errors.

380
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Driving the train launch pad in a little rocket with weird Al. Great. Will Smith plugging up. What's this character's name? Magic Dispel. Here it is.

381
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Oh, you got it. That's the one you're a little. Wow. Wow. Moments away from yelling keep magic dispels name out your fucking mouth. Yeah, it's a it's this Fresh Prince. This is 1992 November 1992. Yeah. So I guess he's stopping her from performing a spell of some kind.

382
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:49,000
This is a 3D issue. This is a collector's 3D issue. Or maybe he said he's closing its kids. Keep keep McDuck's name out your fucking. Oh, yeah, I see that. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's what it is.

383
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Maybe he's he's in this case, it's to make the world safer. Yeah. Yeah. Shut up. The tactics in this case are for the better. Yes.

384
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:17,000
And I remember this one. I was very excited about this because it was 3D. A 3D issue. Yeah. And that's it must have come with glasses. Yeah. And there's odd little like probably working to middling degrees levels of like like even the ads. I think we're. Yeah. I remember. Wow. Look at that.

385
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:33,000
There's a milk ad here. It's chocolate milk ad. I should say. Right. And then there's something about like biology listener some shit. I'm going snooze. Tear it out. Never look at it again. Bugs. Real life bugs. No, no. Anyway, Coups cartoon. Yeah.

386
00:52:33,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Comics trip. Great. Now I don't I have to admit I don't particularly remember any like terribly exciting moments from it was like comics based on the Disney afternoon shows. Yeah. I'm sure we're guy probably read them but it's not like I didn't really dive into these comics to see like oh is there like like did the perverted illustrators accidentally draw a bulge or something. I don't know if anything was in the in the comics. Well at first it's more the people behind it because I think it's like.

387
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:21,000
The people behind it because at first it was all Disney comics and then they kind of branched out and had original car like they they serialized Jeff Smith's bone which is a big like yeah just a ran for years and years as alt comics. The collection of it is like the size with phone book.

388
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Of course there was a Netflix cartoon being made it got canceled before it got made just very recently in the last couple years. You know what's hot in 2023 canceling the hard work a lot of people before anyone gets to see it. That's what is in.

389
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,000
But some of the editors that would would go on that would work it.

390
00:53:42,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Disney adventures on the comics they had Marv Wolfman who is like a legendary comics or the the characters he co created include a blade the vampire hunter most of the Teen Titans cyborg Raven starfire of course their villain Deathstroke black cat and bullseye from Marvel like this was the guy who they had doing it and another woman Heidi McDonald who was an early vertigo

391
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:19,000
comics editor and ran a lot of comics news sites and then the alt comics people making it.

392
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Evan Dworkin Bob Fingerman I think Matt Greening had stuff in there every now and then like.

393
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Yeah, I miss I don't think I have any.

394
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Life in hell or something. Yeah, no, well, I think I was too subversive for the spin off one to Disney comic or Disney adventures comic so it was a section and then it had its own issues.

395
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Yeah, I actually forgot that there was so much comic stuff in here.

396
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I already almost comics. Yeah, I don't.

397
00:54:48,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I read a lot of this stuff I remember these goof troop ones. I was kind of weird what would you call it like a cannon snob. Yeah, in, in it in that I would, like in my own head decide what was official cannon and not.

398
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:21,000
And I think for the most of the car like the comic strips are what do you ever you would call them I guess not strips but I would decide that this is like not really goof troop. The TV show is goof troop, but this isn't actually goof troop whereas like Ninja Turtles I decided that the Archie comics published

399
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Ninja Turtles adventures was the main cannon in my head, and everything else was really good really good but not actually what happened was happening. It's the only this one so I think I had that in my head about most of the like adapted Disney afternoon stuff, except for that.

400
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:54,000
The one that really got me excited was that was that space Mickey one. Yeah, pretty good because where else do you see that there's no space Mickey show right and it like me that that splash tackler show and Epcot right and the L the art felt elevated to me to it felt like it was a little bit more.

401
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:14,000
One of the spin off dizzy adventure co titles collected the first six and saw installments of an adaptation of the black hole, drawn by Jack Kirby. Is that right. Yeah. Wow. I just realized there's a bunch of great Jack Kirby does decide on Jack Kirby is like Ninja Turtles

402
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:30,000
true because Jack Kirby lived into the like the early 90s. Yes. And then have you ever have we talked about the Jack Kirby drawing Paul and Linda flying picture. I don't know about this, because Paul McCartney has a wing song called Magneto and titanium man which are Marvel characters

403
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:45,000
and Magneto is villain and X men and I think Paul was like casually looking you should look this up jacob Jack Kirby Paul McCartney. And so, Jack Kirby like went backstage or at a wings concert and gave Paul and Linda a drawing that he drew of them.

404
00:56:45,000 --> 00:57:00,000
It's awesome. It's so fun. And I had no idea about this I'm surprised this song has never been in a Marvel movie either, because I've been my mom put this on when she like was like oh you're into like she saw me watching X men and like storm screams like oh Magneto or something

405
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
my mom was like wait a minute.

406
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:09,000
This song I've been listening to since Venus and Mars came out is that's a Marvel Comics thing.

407
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Yes, you would you have it do you have it. I gave you plenty of time do you have it. I want to make sure yes yeah yeah they're flying so cool. I loved and Jack Kirby so funny because Jack Kirby is like, just like old school tough work workman type guy short sleeve dress shirt

408
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:43,000
like the old imagineers layers Paul smiling that Paul smile and here's Jack scowling I guess the jack scowl but he was, I'm sure he was probably excited about it. Meanwhile, Jack of course created the majority of characters and movies right now.

409
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Like, that's what he was busy with his busy just creating every character in every movie right now and not making enough money for it. But his family at least eventually got some stuff so that's interesting I didn't realize that his stuff was published early on.

410
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Okay.

411
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Okay, covers, gonna keep going with covers. Yeah, yeah. Goofy mountain climbing with Joe Montana is scared. We got Jason Priestley being fawned over by Jessica Rabbit Daisy and Minnie pretty flirtatious Minnie there and I feel.

412
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Yeah, I feel alright I mean Jessica rabbits doing most of the touching so that's fine.

413
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Many just kind of sit in front of her she's keeping her hands to herself. Yeah yeah so that's fine. She's just being cute other flirtation I have that one too yeah the genie has is has made a wish and out of the lamp came, Cindy Crawford.

414
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Okay yeah so the dream is Cindy, the genius horny for Cindy Crawford.

415
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I guess that's what it's face he just looks confused. All right, maybe it was his wish I guess we dream of Cindy now we dream of genie. Is this a good time to talk about the Barbara Eden fan account that I follow on Instagram.

416
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Well, you know, it's up to it's up to you what's a good time or not there's not a lot to talk about every great. There's a great Barbara it was just at some sort of like pre pre Emmys or not is me with a pre Oscar lunch with Morgan Fairchild at a Hollywood hotel she's 91 she looks great

417
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:28,000
is that we need to stop talking about people over 90. See what happens as we're recording this Robert Blake dies our beloved Robert Blake we lost. We lost Blake.

418
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:44,000
We lost him on the show. So we brought up the thing that he did not do. Bless his heart bless his heart. I want to talk about these two Star Trek actors on the two covers here because they're both up there. I know yeah he's just talking about his mortality.

419
00:59:44,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I don't want to send certain topics to hell. I think you have to do a scan in your head, considering the proven record of the PTR curse. That's true. If over 90 is it worth bringing them up. Let me ask this question though if I didn't explain to the listeners who Barbara Eden is maybe it's okay because they don't know what I'm talking about.

420
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I don't I don't think credits do a reference Google it don't Google it everyone don't Google who Barbara Eden is don't know about Barbara Eden don't get Barbara Eden's image in your head. Don't do it.

421
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Do you have more go keep rolling Tim Allen power tools with Pete from goof true so my question there is that is this because they think Pete looks like Richard Karn maybe wrong like a shaven Richard Karn yeah so they thought that just looked good because like why would it make sense Pete's usually a villainous kind of character but in goof troop there.

422
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:54,000
You're right you're right. Your dad's next door right when dad stuff. I don't really have my Pete yet my next door dad foil. I assume it will come so yeah have taught me this. That's true.

423
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Joey Lawrence in man Aladdin mode it wearing a vest showing off the guns and a boo is on him reaching for an apple a non cartoon apple that has a he took a but Joey took a bite out of it at boo he's claimed it.

424
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:38,000
That is I know you are a thief boo boo but show some boundary this is a whoa to use his words whoa Joey's not reacting to what's happening at all he's just kind of like smoldering for the camera he's got he's got a job to do yeah he was hired to smolder and he's not going to let a thief monkey get in his way yeah I like the other headline cool looks USA.

425
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I don't know anything else about that article I should have looked for one to live in that city man Mickey this is McKelley Culkin was on it a couple times and I had one of those and the the one that I had I seem to have cut his face out of it perhaps for some kind of collage of things that I liked.

426
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Oh really or it was up on my wall or something vision boy making the office that's the color right in the world in 19 that is that's that's on the hot list for sure.

427
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Sounds weird you know what I mean well there was an issue I had don't have with me where it says like TV's hottest kids. Yeah I didn't like that phrase yeah yeah maybe a control leave that word out of it what what is he wearing in that go in this guy I was going to say this is the

428
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:43,000
other Mac cover McKelley Culkin is that rebel without a cause I think he is in rebel without a cause specific motorcycle where and then Mickey behind him he's got a blue riding riding outfit behind him hanging on to old Mac.

429
01:02:43,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Did you guys have that same thing with McKelley Culkin this odd like that we were we were so set up I feel like in interviews and stuff to feel like if only I could hang out with Mac. Oh my life would be set if I as if as if Mac was like so much cooler than some kid I could meet in my actual school.

430
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Yeah I think it was that but it was also like you could be him to like he was an every boy you know in a way. Oh yeah true he's a so wait a minute a celebrity can like water slides and pizza. Yeah, yeah so I feel like maybe I was more, I'm trying to remember because I like

431
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Tomlom but honestly some of the violence made me a little uncomfortable. Not that's not a joke. I just preferred the movie sidekicks. I really don't remember watching those movies a lot and I kind of remember the movie my girl like seeing a little of it.

432
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Oh God and someone was like oh yeah you get stung by a bunch of bees and dies at the end I was like okay well now I got to worry about bees. I was that a thing you think that lasted for a while because I never saw my girl so I probably would have had the same reaction to like oh my god I'm never going outside.

433
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I well you know I didn't really have many childhood memories being about being stung by bees but about five six years ago I got stung by a bee on my hand and I felt like shit for hours so I was like oh I wonder if I have a slight. My girl was right. My girl was right my fears were right.

434
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:23,000
I've you know what I feel I do remember when he did the good son and I felt like a little bit trail almost. He was in a bad movie. Bad movie. Yeah movie. I do kind of remember that. What is that about?

435
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:41,000
He was he a killer kid. I don't remember. He was in an R rated movie. I don't know anything about it. I feel like I said oh look at him a Kelly Culkin movie. It has the word good in it and my parents said no it is bad. Yeah. Do not think about the good son and to this day I have never learned any information about the good son.

436
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I've never watched it but I think in the preview of the trailer he like hurts a kid or like a kid is I'm trying to remember is he like holding on like the kids like holding on for like trying to pull up on a legend he like kicks him off or something.

437
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Yeah I bet. So it's like is that what it says. I don't know that's the trailer I'm imagining. It's like a bad seed kind of movie. Yeah. I remember sort of feeling like oh he's yeah yeah I feel like what is this I don't like this.

438
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Poster. But Kali is kind of looking a little off and it says evil has many faces. Wow. Oh my god. How could they do. I think they actually did like not understand the market. That they cause this movie bombed I believe. Yeah. And oh wait no wait a minute no it actually outdid its. Oh really. I guess the good son did.

439
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I. So that's another thing I've assumed only the good son rightfully bombed they were hoping of making McCallie a bad kid. They made him do it like when we made Jason be polite about the things you were saying. Oh yeah. Port of entry. I remember. Yeah.

440
01:05:47,000 --> 01:06:01,000
But there were there obviously were comments I don't know if you saw them Jason there were comments that were to the effect of like Jason was hiding his feelings he was masking how he was just trying to be nice because I know that this episode hurt him and the recording

441
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:22,000
the recording podcast was a few times I'm not hiding my damn feelings. Jason unfilled I just feel like it didn't get more unfiltered than in therapy. Oh well they are definitely not. I guess you sure we can't see the good son mom David Morse is in it you know from saying elsewhere in the

442
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:51,000
negotiator. Well say no more. I want to see the new David Morse movie. He's from he's in the long kiss good night the long kiss good night actually rocks that movie's awesome. Oh the rock he's one of the bad guys in the rock yeah. Sounds like he's good. He is a good son. He is good. Unlike that son. He's good. I also like Dean Cain's Superman having just tied up all the boys. I mean that's some of the clearest completely you understand.

443
01:06:51,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I mean that's some of the clearest completely you understand. Very simple Beagle Boys bad guys Dean Cain Superman ambiguity with a bad kid right is in the title. I need it to B.M. Little my brain is forming I need to know who's good and bad and now I know and I've known this always and

444
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:14,000
never change my perspective on it. Dean Cain is good. Yeah. Yeah that's what I meant.

445
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,640
So yeah, I'm trying to think.

446
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,080
The Beagle Boys, I feel like we're on another one,

447
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,560
but I can't remember off the top of my head.

448
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:24,680
Yeah, they were always pushing these Disney afternoon guys.

449
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:29,680
To that end, in the last things in my slideshow of,

450
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,040
I mean, I think you have them in the pile potentially,

451
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,320
because my absolute favorite cover,

452
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:39,200
well, okay, there are a few related to Star Trek.

453
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,280
There's so much Star Trek in these issues.

454
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,760
And now I remember, because I was big into Star Trek

455
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:48,000
around this time, so this must have really reinforced

456
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,360
that Star Trek was cool, because it was in this magazine

457
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:51,760
that I liked. Kids can like this.

458
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,360
Yeah. But yeah, it is,

459
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:56,480
the editors must have been huge Star Trek fans to like.

460
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,400
There's like ads for Star Trek 6,

461
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,560
like the last Shatner cast Star Trek, which I like,

462
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:05,000
but still I'm like, this isn't really,

463
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,440
were kids interested in these seniors running around?

464
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:13,440
I saw a kind of movies and TV poll of like favorite,

465
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:19,280
I think one example was like,

466
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,080
it was like voting for your favorite,

467
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:24,440
not just what the movies are, but like things in movies.

468
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:28,400
For example, coolest animated critters on the big screen,

469
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,240
Beast, Beauty and the Beast, Batty Coda from Ferngully,

470
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,640
of course, Shanta Clear from Rocket Doodle.

471
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:35,480
Shanta Clear.

472
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:39,800
How badly did Shanta Clear and Batty Coda lose to the Beast?

473
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:42,280
But anyway, elsewhere, there was another top

474
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:46,200
that was like, best snacks from a movie or from a show,

475
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,080
probably, because it was like,

476
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:51,600
stuff is something at the Peach Pit from 90210,

477
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,400
burger and fries from the Max and Saved by the Bell

478
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:57,520
or Earl Grey Tea on the bridge of the,

479
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,800
I was kind of surprised, like next to like, of course,

480
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:02,520
90210 and Saved by the Bell are of that era, but.

481
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:03,360
That's next gen, yeah.

482
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,080
You would have voted for the Earl Grey Tea.

483
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,000
Yes, I would have.

484
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,080
That's Captain Picard's favorite drink.

485
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,000
I guess I would now.

486
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,320
That sounds better to me now.

487
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:11,360
Yeah. Yeah.

488
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,000
The kids are making that food

489
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,480
at either of those establishments.

490
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,200
It's unclear. Garbage.

491
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:20,000
It's unclear, though, how much the kids were into this.

492
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,480
I don't think I knew another kid that watched Star Trek.

493
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:25,400
I'm sure there was another kid in school who did,

494
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:28,080
but I don't know of another kid

495
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,440
that I could talk to about it.

496
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,400
It was completely something that I liked.

497
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,720
My parents didn't give a shit about it.

498
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:36,720
And there was like at least everything else I liked.

499
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:39,160
There were plenty of kids that had that in common,

500
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:42,200
but I wonder if there was like the editorial board

501
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,880
was pushing an agenda.

502
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:44,920
We need to.

503
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:48,160
The children must watch intelligent science fiction

504
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,320
or whatever.

505
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:50,360
Yeah. I don't know.

506
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:51,200
Maybe I'm wrong.

507
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,020
Maybe there were a lot of kids.

508
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:53,800
And they must read articles about Egypt.

509
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,440
There's a no, no, you went too far.

510
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,760
No, yeah, yeah. Star Trek has Egypt.

511
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,240
No, no kid should learn about Egypt.

512
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:00,240
Is there an Android in Egypt?

513
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,320
No, then I don't give a shit.

514
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,640
Anybody with cool forehead wrinkles?

515
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,480
The no.

516
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:10,280
Some of these letter pages and.

517
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,120
Oh yeah. What's on this?

518
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:11,960
Say the code.

519
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:12,780
Oh yeah.

520
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:15,440
This is a good cover, but it's not the best Star Trek cover.

521
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:19,320
So this is William Shatner as James T. Kirk.

522
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:22,040
He's in his enterprise.

523
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:23,720
It's like Star Trek Generations out.

524
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,400
Well, I guess it's sort of the last few.

525
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,640
It rev his Star Trek movie outfit.

526
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,920
And he's got Huey, Dewey and Louie

527
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:33,240
all in different Star Trek uniforms.

528
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,480
And I don't know which one is which

529
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,040
cause they're not really so specific

530
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,960
cause they don't have their colored shirts on.

531
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:40,560
But one of them is dressed like Jordy,

532
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:43,720
LeVar Burton's character from The Next Generation.

533
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:45,080
Cause he's got the visor on.

534
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,180
And then there are two of them are holding plans

535
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:50,220
or they're holding the same space plans.

536
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,880
And it says Star Trek secrets.

537
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,960
And it's, yes, this is,

538
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,440
I'm trying to determine why it's Huey, Dewey and Louie.

539
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:01,400
This is another one that's sort of unclear

540
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:05,080
what their decision is for showing the three nephews.

541
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:09,440
Whatever, they make a great group.

542
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,080
Shatner not even acknowledging them.

543
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,600
They're like kind of wrapping him up in the plans.

544
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,160
Well, yeah, sometimes you can,

545
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,440
I feel like only in rare cases

546
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,960
did the person do a photo shoot.

547
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,120
One example, there is a,

548
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,920
there's one where Mayim Bialik

549
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,720
seems to be dancing with the Beast

550
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:27,960
from Beauty and the Beast.

551
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,080
And I feel like the wardrobe was specific

552
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,400
and her pose was specific.

553
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,920
I am confident.

554
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:35,240
And there were more pictures from that shoot

555
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,080
in the magazine.

556
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,120
I'm confident that that was a custom photo.

557
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,840
This, I believe is Star Trek promotional materials.

558
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:41,680
It's a promo photo.

559
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:42,520
Yeah, yeah.

560
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,000
It's a Getty Image photo.

561
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,120
So in this issue and the letter page,

562
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,120
this is a lot of, I think,

563
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,840
I don't know if again, this was an agenda

564
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,600
or this is just, I guess, what kids do.

565
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,200
They argue about things.

566
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:59,520
And here's one that's from a girl named Ashley Brown,

567
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,160
age 10, and it says,

568
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:04,160
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers versus TMNT.

569
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:06,840
I hate the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.

570
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,160
The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

571
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,920
don't need robots to help them.

572
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,080
So they could kick Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,

573
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,080
but there is no question about it.

574
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,040
The Power Rangers are just poor imitations

575
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,280
of the Ninja Turtles.

576
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,840
They should fight.

577
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:21,000
Then everybody would see who was better.

578
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,200
That data, I'm sure that,

579
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:26,040
I believe there has been cross-over comics at this point.

580
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:29,120
Well, but they crossed over with the next mutation

581
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,360
with Venus de Milo.

582
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,200
Oh, sure, yeah.

583
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,760
Because they were both being made by Saban at that time.

584
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,960
But I just like that.

585
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:38,920
A kid was so passionate

586
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:42,400
that they decided in January 95 to write a letter.

587
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,240
I agree with this kid.

588
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,080
About that.

589
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,040
I agree with all these points.

590
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:45,880
You know what?

591
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:47,400
Before recording, we were talking about

592
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,200
WWE versus AEW tribalism.

593
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,480
And you said it applies to a lot of other

594
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,520
pop culture things too. Oh yeah, press everything.

595
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,560
And there it is, Turtles and Power Rangers.

596
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,160
That's interesting, because I never thought of them

597
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,280
as competitors when I was a kid.

598
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,560
No. Because I love the Turtles,

599
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:04,520
then they were number one.

600
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:07,040
But I did like Power Rangers, so.

601
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:10,240
Is this not the culture that has led to

602
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:15,120
now that you have to be Team Star Wars, Team Marvel,

603
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,080
and you have to be fighting on social.

604
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:19,400
Is the social media of today's Twitter

605
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:22,560
not today's version of the Disney Adventures

606
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,720
letter section? Letter page.

607
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,800
Yeah, I know it's a very good point.

608
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,840
Oh yeah, there's that one letter where the kid

609
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,960
complains about the fluoride in the water.

610
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,200
I just want a quick hit, ins and outs of this.

611
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,040
Oh please.

612
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:37,880
Yeah.

613
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,840
Clothes in, jeans, t-shirts, flannels out,

614
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,640
neon, anything bright, slang.

615
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:46,440
This is the heartbreak era for me.

616
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:47,280
Yeah, because I wanted.

617
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,680
The end of neon and anything bright.

618
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:49,520
Sling.

619
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:50,340
It was a good dark times.

620
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:53,040
Sling in, what's up, cool, funky, out,

621
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,360
gnarly or tubular.

622
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,200
In, music, rap, alternative rock, heavy metal,

623
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,520
out, country, oldies.

624
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,080
Country's all over the map.

625
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:02,920
It's all.

626
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,040
Decide what you're doing with country.

627
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:04,880
Uh huh.

628
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:05,720
Is it cool or not?

629
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:08,720
Because elsewhere in kind of like the entertainment

630
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:11,960
weekly type, like letting me know about bands

631
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,480
that are happening.

632
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,560
I have so many tabs open, where is it?

633
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,400
Elsewhere, they're trying to tell me

634
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:25,400
about this group called Sick Shooter,

635
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:28,640
who are six teenage guys who aim to prove

636
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,280
that young people love boot scooting.

637
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,280
So one day you're telling me that young people

638
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,080
love boot scooting and now you're saying

639
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,360
country is not.

640
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,560
So contradictory, yeah.

641
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,360
Jason, did you boot scoot when you were younger?

642
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,960
I don't, you know, I don't have a lot of memories

643
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:46,280
of boot scooting, I'm sorry Michael.

644
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,640
I follow that, there was that clogger group

645
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,040
that went viral a couple, a year ago.

646
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:51,880
Oh yeah.

647
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,600
I think they're the J Street Cloggers.

648
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:57,080
And I don't know, I think they're technically boot scooting.

649
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,480
In, clogging.

650
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,880
Out, scooting.

651
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,400
Any types of movement that aren't clogging.

652
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,480
In, boot scooting, out, any other sort of scooting.

653
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,880
Regular scooting is out.

654
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,040
Boot scooting.

655
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,480
Tenant shoe scooting.

656
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,600
Out. Barefoot scooting.

657
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:15,280
Here's something that I don't think would fly today.

658
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:18,280
In, food, pizza, fast food, Chinese food, out.

659
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,360
Mexican food.

660
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:21,640
Maybe we don't.

661
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:26,160
Megzoo mark my words in 1996,

662
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:28,920
Mexican food will never be popular again.

663
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:32,920
Yeah, this was, yeah, January, January, 1995.

664
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:33,760
Yeah.

665
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,440
No one will have a taco ever again.

666
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:40,440
Yeah, unless Mexican food can form some kind of allegiance,

667
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,760
some partnership with, I don't know, Animorphs.

668
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,600
The only hope they have of making any kind of comeback.

669
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,560
It's just a little small franchise

670
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:51,480
that had power range, or Star Wars toys around that time.

671
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,160
Yeah, so that's, oh, pets.

672
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,520
In, dogs, cats, bunny rabbits.

673
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,600
Out, fish, hamsters.

674
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,440
No longer.

675
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:03,760
Fuck off.

676
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:04,720
Throw them away.

677
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:06,040
Go to hell.

678
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:09,560
Drown the hamsters and put the fish somewhere without water.

679
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:10,960
Yeah, hey, beta fish,

680
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,120
don't let the door hit you on your way out.

681
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,480
I got a cover I forgot about.

682
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:21,320
This is a later one, so there are no humans on the photo.

683
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:25,160
Although there is a little circle that says ESPN Action

684
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,320
and has a Siberian Husky in it.

685
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:33,680
This is the coolest cartoon kids of class of 1998.

686
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:37,600
Doug Funny, Bart Simpson, Tommy Pickles,

687
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:41,240
Pepper Ann Pearson, Spinelli, and Bobby Hill.

688
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,280
And it's second season,

689
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:46,960
first or second season, Bobby Hill,

690
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,480
so he just kind of looks kind of bummed.

691
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:51,200
When you think cool, you think Bobby Hill.

692
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,160
I think Bobby Hill.

693
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:56,000
This is before the writers realized I had created

694
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,720
one of the most endearing characters

695
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,400
in the history of television.

696
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,920
The writers hadn't realized that?

697
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:04,080
I think Bobby Hill was a little more hapless

698
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,640
in the earlier seasons by the end of the series.

699
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,800
He's like a hero, you know?

700
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,520
He's always got enough to antics.

701
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,080
Sure, no antics before season two.

702
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:14,920
No antics.

703
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:16,480
They were not giving him any antics.

704
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,560
The early episodes, it's a lot of hanko

705
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:21,200
and that boy ain't right, you know?

706
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,040
Right, and then he comes around.

707
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:23,600
I can't weigh in on this.

708
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,440
I like King of the Hill, but I don't remember the arc.

709
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:26,760
I don't know anything too late of it.

710
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:27,600
Yeah.

711
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:28,760
And then there is also another situation

712
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:30,960
where it's like there's eight seasons I didn't see.

713
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:31,800
Yeah, yeah, I know.

714
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:32,920
But I mean, I don't like the show.

715
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:35,600
I just look, there's a lot of stuff to do in this world.

716
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,240
And I don't know that it fell off.

717
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:39,080
But there's like eight years of King of the Hill

718
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:39,920
I didn't watch.

719
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:40,760
It's very consistent.

720
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:44,880
Oh, it was airing an adult swim in syndication

721
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,400
for years around the time.

722
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,240
I would go to bed.

723
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,040
Are there 15 seasons of King of the Hill?

724
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:49,880
Possibly, maybe 14.

725
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:50,720
12?

726
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:51,560
Something like that.

727
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:52,380
It's in my head.

728
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:53,520
Let me look that up.

729
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,800
So yeah, so anyway, there's nothing that crazy

730
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,040
is Star Trek wise in this, but.

731
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,720
Well, the other one.

732
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:00,560
Well, yeah.

733
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,520
Because the other one is my favorite.

734
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,560
And this is saying a lot

735
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,320
because there's many excellent covers

736
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,640
that we have talked about.

737
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:08,160
And this is me saying, I am not even a Star Trek fan.

738
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,000
Right.

739
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
But I love the next generation cover.

740
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,600
This is the absolute best use.

741
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:15,440
Oh yeah.

742
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:19,120
I love this insane crew of Disney characters

743
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:22,560
who are not of the same universe, who don't go together.

744
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,600
Mike, I will bungle who is who.

745
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,400
Please describe this cover.

746
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:27,720
Well, it's a, yes.

747
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:31,240
It's not a pose photo shoot picture

748
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,000
of Patrick Stewart as Captain Picard

749
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,440
in his regular captain's outfit.

750
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:39,440
He is on the bridge, which is, it's drawn.

751
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:42,200
It's got sort of the same kind of curved,

752
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:43,400
I don't know what you would even call it,

753
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,760
curved railing behind him.

754
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:50,760
And to his right is Jessica Rabbit as Counselor Troy,

755
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:54,360
because she's wearing the outfit, the sort of jumpsuit

756
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:57,760
that Marina Sertis, of course, wore.

757
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:02,480
To his left is the Beast, who is, oh yeah, he's got the,

758
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:05,480
it's Worf, which is a security officer.

759
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:08,160
By the way, compare Jessica Rabbit

760
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,280
and Patrick Stewart's heads.

761
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,400
Look how much bigger.

762
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:14,280
She's got like her head's three times the size

763
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:15,120
of Patrick Stewart's head.

764
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:18,320
He's shorter than him, or else he's up on a step.

765
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:19,160
Yes.

766
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,640
But this is, she's like a Navi.

767
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:24,200
It's really weird too, because she's got her hand

768
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,920
on his shoulder, and that really throws

769
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,560
the perspective off too.

770
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,200
It's a very dainty hand.

771
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,920
Yeah, but she's giant.

772
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:35,080
And it doesn't, it looks like he's shrunk or something.

773
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:36,360
She has T-Rex proportions.

774
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:39,400
Yeah, she has a tiny hand and a giant everything else.

775
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:44,400
And then behind them, Pinocchio, who I assume is Data.

776
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,480
I don't know that to be a fact,

777
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,320
because there's nothing really distinct.

778
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,360
They didn't do anything to the eyes, really.

779
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,840
Right, nothing with the, no yellow eyes,

780
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:55,080
and no face that looks like Data's skin.

781
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:57,720
Magica Dispel is Guinan.

782
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:59,480
Yeah, they're putting Magica with the biggest,

783
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:00,720
the best stars. She's everywhere.

784
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:02,280
Magica Dispel is Guinan,

785
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,200
which is the Whoopi Goldberg character.

786
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,440
And then Darkwing Duck is Geordi,

787
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:09,320
and he has the visor in this one, not one of his nephews,

788
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:11,000
or not one of Donald's nephews.

789
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,840
Mashup of your dreams.

790
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:16,480
Yes, this cover would go on to inspire many drawings

791
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,280
where I would mash up, I'm serious,

792
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,880
Star Trek characters with other,

793
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,760
like Disney characters or turtles and stuff.

794
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,480
And there were Star Trek turtle toys as well.

795
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,600
So yes, this was an inspiration in a lot of ways.

796
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:34,200
And I think this kind of makes sense in some of the ways,

797
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:35,360
although not fully.

798
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,960
I guess Pinocchio in a way makes the most sense.

799
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,160
I don't know why Pinocchio and the beast

800
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,080
and Jessica Rabbit are hanging out.

801
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:41,920
Well, that doesn't make sense.

802
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:42,760
You know what?

803
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:45,360
It's the diversity that the Star Trek franchise

804
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,120
has always championed.

805
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,280
Diversity of movies.

806
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,480
Not diversity of-

807
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,600
Well, no, Star Trek has diversity, but-

808
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:54,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

809
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:57,080
Yes, diversity of-

810
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:57,920
Of properties.

811
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,320
By that I mean puppets and ducks.

812
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,160
Oh yeah, of course.

813
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:02,520
Right, right, right.

814
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:03,400
So yeah, I don't know.

815
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:06,440
I mean, like, Jessica Rabbit is,

816
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:09,640
I don't know that she's a good analog for Counselor Troi,

817
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:12,240
who's just very quiet and empathetic.

818
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,520
Not that Jessica Rabbit's not,

819
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:14,520
I'm not trying to insult her.

820
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,160
I'm just saying, I don't know.

821
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:19,000
I feel like they didn't put too much thought into this.

822
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,760
And I'm trying to think if there's a better,

823
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:22,440
any of the Disney princesses, honestly,

824
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:26,520
might've been a better stand-in for Counselor Troi here.

825
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,240
And Beast is like a war, like,

826
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:30,680
Worf is a Klingon warrior.

827
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:33,480
Beast is like scary, but he's not really a warrior.

828
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,760
He's just scary because he's a beast.

829
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,040
So I don't know, I have a little,

830
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,840
thinking about this intellectually at the time,

831
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:39,680
now I kind of think some of it-

832
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:40,640
Because you don't like it anymore.

833
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,040
No, I like it a lot.

834
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:44,080
I like it a lot and it's a part of my soul.

835
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:49,080
But if I'm gonna analyze it as a guy who does a podcast.

836
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:50,400
What we gotta do.

837
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,960
You know, and Darkwing Duck is Geordi,

838
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,400
that one makes the least sense.

839
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,240
What do you do?

840
01:21:56,240 --> 01:22:00,040
Why are you robbing yourself of joy like this?

841
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,440
This doesn't make sense.

842
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,440
Who cares?

843
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:04,640
Let him have the goggles.

844
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:05,800
Yeah, but I don't know.

845
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:08,760
It's just that Darkwing Duck's such a different character.

846
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,440
I don't know, he could have been Lieutenant Barkley

847
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:11,280
or something.

848
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,600
This is the last thing I expected,

849
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,880
is that you would have complaints about this cover.

850
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,080
Complaints versus just trying to think reasonably about it.

851
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,000
I don't know, I don't know what the,

852
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,160
I'm just thinking out here.

853
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:22,560
And then Magic of Dispel, I don't know.

854
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,760
She's kind of a bad guy and Gaian is like a good guy.

855
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,800
This is, you know, you threw Port of Entry

856
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,720
under the bus last month.

857
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:33,200
Now you're throwing this cover under the-

858
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,040
This great cover.

859
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,600
I guess Club Three is where you go to sulk.

860
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:40,000
I'm a villain on Club Three,

861
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,160
I think is really what we're determining here.

862
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:43,200
Mr. Mike Fist though.

863
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,560
This is why we don't introduce ourselves

864
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:46,400
as much at the beginning.

865
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,240
Cause I guess you've-

866
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:49,240
Pinocchio makes the most sense

867
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:51,440
cause he's not a real boy yet and he longs to be

868
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,200
and that's what Data's whole plate is.

869
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,040
Oh, that does make sense.

870
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,200
That's perfect.

871
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,520
Well, I'm unhappy that the one that you're happy with

872
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,360
is Pinocchio.

873
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,080
He's a little wooden boy, yeah.

874
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:03,600
Cause he wants to be a human.

875
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,920
Mike, I was flipping through the X-Men segments

876
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:08,440
of the X-Men issue.

877
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:12,360
First off, the cover is by the Hilda Brantz,

878
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:15,160
legendary sci-fi painters.

879
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:16,000
What?

880
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:16,840
Greg and Tim.

881
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,640
Greg and Tim, I think, yeah.

882
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:21,280
There's art in here from various comics,

883
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:24,080
including some, a pretty gruesome panel

884
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,800
from Barry Windsor Smith's Weapon X.

885
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:27,640
Yeah.

886
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:29,000
Of like Wolverine on an operating table.

887
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,120
They're like putting the metal into his skeleton.

888
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,200
Yeah.

889
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:35,720
And then interviews with former Marvel editor-in-chief,

890
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:38,760
Bob Harris and the writers, Scott Lobdell

891
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,480
and Fabian Niesienza.

892
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:43,320
Fabian Niesienza, co-creator of Deadpool.

893
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:44,160
Sure, yeah.

894
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:47,080
Scott Lobdell, co-creator of Maggot.

895
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,840
I believe so, the less popular.

896
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:50,680
Our favorite character, Maggot.

897
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:51,600
Equal cultural impact.

898
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:52,440
Yeah.

899
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:53,280
Yeah.

900
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:56,440
Significantly less millions involved with Maggot.

901
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,000
Real quick one in and out.

902
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,920
In, rap, country and western, out.

903
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:02,560
Live concerts.

904
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,640
What is this, 2020?

905
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,520
No, no live, yeah.

906
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,080
No live concerts.

907
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:10,440
Those are uncool.

908
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,600
You might make fun of for going to a live concert.

909
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,960
Concerts in April 1993.

910
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,840
My dad said paying for parking at Veteran Stadium

911
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,920
was just against his principles.

912
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:25,200
There is a lot of good, and I say a lot, I mean a couple,

913
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:29,040
a couple great candids of Brent Spiner

914
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,320
in the data makeup in this.

915
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,840
And these are very, these are stuck in my brain

916
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,440
because I was so obsessed with data.

917
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:38,160
Here is data at the crafty table,

918
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:40,920
like with a cup of coffee, if you can see that.

919
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:43,760
And he's like smiling, he's out of character.

920
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:47,480
And these again stimulated such a strong memory

921
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:48,320
in my brain.

922
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,040
And here he is with like a,

923
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:52,440
he's got like a sweater on and they're rehearsing.

924
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,920
And he's making kind of like a little sly face

925
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:55,880
at the camera.

926
01:24:58,200 --> 01:24:59,600
And I remember this being, I'm just like,

927
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,160
oh yeah, oh yeah, I remember these.

928
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:03,000
And Jonathan Franks is out of his uniform.

929
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,520
He's maybe directing an episode.

930
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,720
So you use the word stimulated, then you said,

931
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,800
oh yeah, I remember these.

932
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,120
Look at that look he's giving.

933
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:12,400
Mentally stimulating is okay.

934
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,720
Yeah, but the other one would be fine too.

935
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:15,800
There's nothing wrong with that.

936
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:17,920
It's not the case, but it would be okay.

937
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:18,760
No.

938
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:19,600
If I was feeling some sort of.

939
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,520
We would celebrate you,

940
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:25,240
whatever you wanna do with this magazine and Brent Spiner.

941
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:28,600
Much like data when he had sexual relations

942
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:31,840
with a human woman, it would be fine.

943
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:32,880
It's not the case though.

944
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,440
That's not what I meant, but it would be fine.

945
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:36,880
Did we what?

946
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:39,120
I saw that episode not too long ago

947
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,360
and I'm trying to remember how and why.

948
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:42,760
Did you make me watch?

949
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:44,480
I don't think I made you do anything.

950
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:47,240
Okay, well, I don't know if that's true.

951
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:49,600
Jason's free will has been clear for this entire.

952
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:53,440
Dr. Nunean song data's creator made sure

953
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:56,480
that his robots had functioning boners.

954
01:25:56,480 --> 01:26:00,440
I just want to remember that that he chose to do that.

955
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:02,400
And he made many different robots.

956
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,120
It's a feature, not a bug.

957
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:04,960
That's what I'm saying.

958
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,280
Yeah, it is a feature.

959
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:07,120
Yeah.

960
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,560
There's data says old feature.

961
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:09,760
He's fully functional.

962
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:11,320
That's what data says.

963
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:12,480
So.

964
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,200
Oh, that's what that means.

965
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,240
That's what it means.

966
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:16,080
That's right.

967
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,520
So I found in here too.

968
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,920
I almost, I apparently was going to enter

969
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:24,040
this goof troop April fools, comic contest.

970
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:25,280
And I had everything filled out.

971
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,320
And I had everything filled out my address and stuff,

972
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:28,160
but I never sent it.

973
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:29,280
Dude, we have the same.

974
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,640
Yeah, I got some partially filled out pages.

975
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:32,480
Yeah.

976
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:36,120
I very rarely, unless it was a tear out like card,

977
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:38,680
I never wanted to enter these contests

978
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:41,160
because then I'd have to ruin the magazine.

979
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:42,960
Yeah, well, I was that way with comics,

980
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:45,480
but I was less precious with like magazines.

981
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:47,560
But yeah, for sure comics.

982
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:50,600
Like I almost have a weird thing that I still have with,

983
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,280
if a comic is almost kind of beat up,

984
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:55,240
I have this weird like, I don't want to touch it thing.

985
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,080
Sure.

986
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:56,920
Do you know what I'm talking about?

987
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:59,200
I had like the very first X-Men issue.

988
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:01,960
I kept in a backpack and I kept taking it to school

989
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:05,280
and it's been grinded up.

990
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,120
I don't know why.

991
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:09,600
I'm talking about like, I still have this weird thing.

992
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,720
If the comic isn't in like the bag and the board,

993
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,440
I almost like don't want to touch it.

994
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:17,200
And I don't, I've, there's some weird trauma

995
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,680
that is behind this if I really unpack it.

996
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,480
Cause I'm going through all these old comics

997
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,680
and a lot of them are the turtle comics I had before.

998
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,880
I was collecting stuff in bags and boards

999
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:28,160
and I still don't really want to touch.

1000
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:31,040
I want to throw away the comics that aren't in good condition.

1001
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:32,640
It's really weird.

1002
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:33,480
I can't track this.

1003
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,200
So yeah, I don't know what this means.

1004
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,600
I think it was at a certain point when somebody was like,

1005
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,440
oh, you need to preserve the comics with the bag

1006
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:41,520
and the board and you put them in the box.

1007
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,920
And I became kind of like anal about it.

1008
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,000
And the old comics that I had taken care of,

1009
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,720
like for some reason they became like gross or dirty to me.

1010
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:51,280
And I still feel this.

1011
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,000
Cause I'm going through a lot of this stuff right now.

1012
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,960
Cause my parents have brought these boxes out.

1013
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:57,720
I always just thought of them as well loved.

1014
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:58,560
You're right.

1015
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,960
I, this is what I can recognize that this is not,

1016
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:04,960
this behavior is not like, it doesn't make a lot of sense.

1017
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,480
Dirty must not be seen.

1018
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:07,520
Must cover the filth.

1019
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:08,360
Yeah.

1020
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,200
Cover my tracks.

1021
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:10,600
What I mom and dad must not know.

1022
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:13,440
They must not open the boxes they brought from Schaumburg.

1023
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,920
What I have literally done because I don't want to deal

1024
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,560
with it is I've thrown them in this big plastic box right now.

1025
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,960
Cause I don't even want to go through everything.

1026
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:21,800
I got that.

1027
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:22,640
And that's not easy.

1028
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:23,480
That's not that.

1029
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:24,840
There's plenty of other stuff lazy.

1030
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:27,400
I have the full run of Ninja Turtle Archie stuff,

1031
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:28,400
the mighty animals.

1032
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,720
I have a ton of Archie books and stuff,

1033
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,680
but they're not in good condition like my X-Men.

1034
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:35,720
Cause I was older and more mature and preserve those.

1035
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:39,520
Well, you could, there could be a ironically titled story

1036
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:43,320
about all this, the good comics.

1037
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:45,080
In fact, it is quite the opposite.

1038
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:48,840
Evil comes in many forms, including.

1039
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:49,680
That's true.

1040
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:52,160
Comic books without the board.

1041
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:56,800
I'm just, I, I, if anyone else out there has something

1042
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,320
like this, let me know.

1043
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,760
Cause I'm not sure exactly where it comes from.

1044
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:06,320
At this point, I'm going to, we have so many great Disney

1045
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:07,440
adventures memories.

1046
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:11,240
And I knew that a friend of the show had these as well.

1047
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:14,680
Kyle Mooney, a big Disney adventures fan.

1048
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,800
I've discussed this over the years with him.

1049
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,080
And I just asked if there was anything in particular

1050
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:22,080
we should shout out.

1051
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:27,080
And he was especially, I mean, this is, this is adjacent

1052
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:29,960
to the, the what's hot and what's not.

1053
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:33,720
There's a lot of terminology, cool slang.

1054
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:34,560
Okay.

1055
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:35,400
You can pick it.

1056
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:38,760
This is a regular feature in the buzz section

1057
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:40,880
of this magazine.

1058
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:44,800
And so he sent a shot of one.

1059
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:48,120
So here's a little, here's some, some cool slang

1060
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:49,920
to teach you guys.

1061
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:54,160
Hut, that means house as in let's play Nintendo

1062
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:55,560
at my hut today.

1063
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:57,720
Aha. Yeah.

1064
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:00,800
I remember saying this in the early nineties,

1065
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,600
stupid large to be very successful.

1066
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,000
He's won a lot of races.

1067
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,160
He's stupid large.

1068
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:08,920
He's won, hang on.

1069
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:11,200
He's won a lot of races.

1070
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:16,200
If you, the epitome of success, winning many races.

1071
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:17,600
Okay.

1072
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:18,680
And that makes you stupid large.

1073
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:21,040
I won't cop to remembering the context,

1074
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,280
but I have heard stupid large before.

1075
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,280
Found stupid large.

1076
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:25,120
Stupid large.

1077
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:26,440
I think it made it out there.

1078
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:27,760
Yeah. Not hut.

1079
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:29,720
You don't think anybody was saying hut.

1080
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:33,080
If we're saying, if we're saying hut in the nineties,

1081
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:34,040
it's pizza.

1082
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:36,600
Yeah. Yeah. Amen.

1083
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:40,120
What's the other, oh, this one applies to us.

1084
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:42,280
Track to talk a lot.

1085
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:45,280
We've been tracking for an hour already.

1086
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,520
Yeah. This was never said.

1087
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:48,360
That's it.

1088
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,040
We have been tracking for an hour and a half.

1089
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,520
We shouldn't go terribly much longer,

1090
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,000
but let me, are there any other, oh,

1091
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,640
apparently a recurring thing in this magazine is

1092
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:02,480
tortured memories for 90210's Jenny Garth.

1093
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,360
There's one Kyle sent.

1094
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:06,120
Try being called Puddles.

1095
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:08,720
That's what they called 90210's Jenny Garth

1096
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:11,720
when she was a kid because everything made her cry.

1097
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:14,280
They also nicknamed her Casper because Jenny's

1098
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:16,240
as pale as the friendly ghost.

1099
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:17,080
Oh man.

1100
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,040
Puddles is kind of cute.

1101
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:20,880
Casper is kind of mean.

1102
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:22,480
Low mean.

1103
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,480
Especially given that a different,

1104
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,960
she was on the cover at one point.

1105
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:27,840
Wait, what happens?

1106
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,600
Oh, I believe on the, when she was on the cover,

1107
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:33,600
she was holding up never quite launched

1108
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,320
Disney character, Marsupialali.

1109
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,680
Oh, is that?

1110
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:39,680
So that's another insult to Jenny Garth

1111
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:42,320
that she is stuck with a character nobody likes.

1112
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:43,160
Yeah.

1113
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:44,000
It was like one that didn't really,

1114
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,120
they tried that on Disney after noon.

1115
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:47,680
What was the name of Marsupialali?

1116
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:48,640
Wait, the yellow guy?

1117
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:49,480
Yeah.

1118
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:52,080
That's like a big European comic character.

1119
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:52,920
Okay.

1120
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:53,760
He'd never caught on Disney.

1121
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:55,640
But they did try that, wasn't it after Bonkers?

1122
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:56,480
I think so.

1123
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:57,960
Yeah, Bonkers didn't quite take either.

1124
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:59,800
No, and I was too old for Bonkers.

1125
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:00,640
You're like Bonkers?

1126
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,040
Bonkers might have been fine, but I was like,

1127
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:04,520
I felt like I was like, I was like, oh, oh.

1128
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:06,200
I was done with all this, yeah.

1129
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:07,040
Yeah.

1130
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,440
Anyway, so look, she puddles, she's Casper,

1131
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:12,080
she's stuck with a bad character,

1132
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:13,480
and then in her interview,

1133
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:15,440
they ask what's her most embarrassing moment.

1134
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:16,680
She says, I was in the fifth grade.

1135
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:18,120
I was on my way to this party.

1136
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:19,520
There were going to be boys there,

1137
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,800
and I was kind of nervous.

1138
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:23,960
Well, a bird went to the bathroom on my arm.

1139
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:25,960
Oh my God, she got shit on.

1140
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:27,440
She got shit on.

1141
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:30,040
I like the term phrase, a bird went to the bathroom.

1142
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:30,880
That is funny, yeah.

1143
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,760
A bird is not in the bathroom.

1144
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:33,600
No, no.

1145
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:36,120
Animals are typically not in the bathroom.

1146
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:39,840
But anyway, and so she didn't go to the party,

1147
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:43,040
because knowing that people might have noticed

1148
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,840
the bird bathroom on her arm,

1149
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:48,400
which was probably as white as her pale arms

1150
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,800
because she's Casper.

1151
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:51,040
She's Casper.

1152
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:52,720
And then all of this would have made her so sad,

1153
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:54,400
she would have been puddles.

1154
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,400
So, Jenny Garth.

1155
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:57,320
Oh my gosh.

1156
01:32:57,320 --> 01:33:00,960
I hope Jenny never revisits any of these Disney adventures.

1157
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:04,360
Charlie Brown's sadness, like, I didn't know that.

1158
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:06,640
Jenny Garth.

1159
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:08,400
Another one Kyle sent.

1160
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:12,480
This is some kind of like celebrity awards thing.

1161
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:15,240
Best throwing arm, the hottest chili pepper,

1162
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:16,640
Anthony Ketus.

1163
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:20,360
When an uppity reporter asked if the MTV award,

1164
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:23,320
which is a bronze statue of a popcorn box, was heavy,

1165
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:25,080
Anthony threw it at the guy.

1166
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:26,080
Yikes.

1167
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,280
Oh yeah, yikes.

1168
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:28,480
That's a Disney adventure?

1169
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:32,120
Yeah, is that a story we want out there?

1170
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:34,040
Is that supposed to be told?

1171
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:35,120
That's weird.

1172
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:37,760
That also doesn't seem quite uppity to me.

1173
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:41,200
That seems like a cute little question.

1174
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:42,640
So is it, yeah, wait a minute.

1175
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:43,480
Is it heavy?

1176
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:45,480
Yeah, what did he ask there?

1177
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:46,400
Is it heavy?

1178
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,480
What do you think?

1179
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:53,120
Guy scarred for nose caved in three years of recovery.

1180
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:54,760
That rock and roll attitude.

1181
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:56,280
I don't know the answer to that.

1182
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:57,400
I don't know if it is heavy.

1183
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:00,080
I feel like people do go up on stage and pick it up

1184
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:02,880
and say, oh, it's pretty heavy, you know?

1185
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,440
I don't know the answer for that.

1186
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:05,040
I don't know.

1187
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,720
There was a dinosaurs comic.

1188
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:09,040
Wow.

1189
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:11,640
That's fun to see them in another form like that.

1190
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:12,160
Yeah.

1191
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:13,800
I'll give this to you in a second, Jason.

1192
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:16,200
I also want to just shout out, apparently,

1193
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:19,080
and I don't remember this, there was a Sega CD game,

1194
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:21,800
Make Your Own Music Video, Criss Cross.

1195
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:23,960
You can make a Criss Cross music video?

1196
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:24,640
Yeah.

1197
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:27,120
So you would edit a Criss Cross video.

1198
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,560
What could that possibly mean?

1199
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:31,160
I don't know, but we need to get a Sega CD

1200
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:32,840
so we can play that Scottie Pippen game.

1201
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,560
And then make our own Criss Cross video.

1202
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:37,800
Getting a Sega CD as a business expense,

1203
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:40,120
which we don't have very much of.

1204
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:40,640
No.

1205
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:43,760
So it'd be kind of fun in the tax end of the year.

1206
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:44,680
One Sega CD.

1207
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:46,400
How much would a Sega CD cost?

1208
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,880
Because that was not the most popular console.

1209
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:51,920
Maybe we could get away with a Sega CD.

1210
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:53,360
Oh, yeah, $299.

1211
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:54,200
Oh, OK.

1212
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:55,480
That's not so bad.

1213
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:57,960
Somebody might loan it to us, too.

1214
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:59,080
I don't know what console.

1215
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:03,880
I think in the course of the vast amount of Aerosmith talk

1216
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:08,160
over the years, I know that we must have talked about not

1217
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:10,320
that one video game, but another one,

1218
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:13,440
Quest for Fame featuring Aerosmith.

1219
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,080
And there's just a detail.

1220
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:19,040
This may have come up before, but just the detail.

1221
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:23,400
After working your way up, you play a tough joint

1222
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:25,560
called the roadkill grill.

1223
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:31,560
If you bomb, you're sent to cheesy lounge MC Copa Costanza.

1224
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:35,360
But if you're a hit, you get to lay down tracks of Aerosmith.

1225
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:36,200
This is IP.

1226
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:38,920
I like learning about Copa Costanza,

1227
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:41,000
the opposite of Aerosmith.

1228
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,760
He is as not as they are hot.

1229
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:47,400
What was that on?

1230
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:51,400
I don't know the platform of Quest for Fame.

1231
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:55,840
It was CD-ROM, possibly, because it's listed after because they

1232
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:59,240
had a bunch of virtual guitar.

1233
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:00,640
We talked about virtual guitar.

1234
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:03,760
There's something called Welcome to West Feedback.

1235
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,360
What the hell does that mean?

1236
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:07,760
Welcome to West Feedback.

1237
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:08,880
I don't know what it is.

1238
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:11,600
Wait, there's another character, Counselor Scruggs.

1239
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:14,520
If you're bad at playing rock, Counselor Scruggs

1240
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:17,840
pops in to tell you to look for another job.

1241
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:20,920
So we're finding the full extended Aerosmith universe.

1242
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:24,520
Scruggs and Copa Costanza.

1243
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:26,520
If that was in Sega CD, we got to get it.

1244
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:27,280
By the way.

1245
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:27,760
CD-ROM.

1246
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:29,160
So we don't even need any.

1247
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:29,920
We can find that.

1248
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:30,920
I bet I can find that.

1249
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:32,080
Yeah.

1250
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:36,480
Probably find it on the Internet Archive.

1251
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,960
The other game, Revolution X, by the way,

1252
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:45,200
released on Arcade Cabinet, Super Nintendo, Genesis, MS-DOS,

1253
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:48,680
Saturn, and PlayStation.

1254
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:49,160
Wow.

1255
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:49,680
Interesting.

1256
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:51,640
It's a good coverage of a perfect game.

1257
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:55,960
There's one with Daniel Stern and Goofy on the cover right here.

1258
01:36:55,960 --> 01:36:58,720
I just want to read one in and out on this one.

1259
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:05,360
In, slang, what's up, out, for Pete's sake.

1260
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:06,080
But you know what?

1261
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:08,280
That's maybe the one I agree with the most.

1262
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:11,840
I do think in July 94, For Pete's Sake, was out.

1263
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:12,600
Yeah.

1264
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:13,960
That's something your parents say.

1265
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:14,440
Yeah.

1266
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:16,600
That was like the Facebook of its era.

1267
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:17,520
What's up was in.

1268
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:18,040
Cool.

1269
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:18,800
Parents are on it.

1270
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:19,040
Yeah.

1271
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:22,560
So that's the only one so far that I think is actually like you could prove it.

1272
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,040
Yeah, finally.

1273
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:30,800
Also, in this issue, there is a Mac versus Elijah, meaning Elijah Wood.

1274
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,040
I remember this.

1275
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:33,080
Breaking it down.

1276
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:34,120
Who's better?

1277
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:35,320
Mm-hmm.

1278
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:37,200
And it's adding up.

1279
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:38,200
It says age.

1280
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:39,240
They're both 13.

1281
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:39,520
All right.

1282
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,240
Latest movie.

1283
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:43,280
Getting Even with Dad for Mac.

1284
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:45,080
North for Elijah.

1285
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:46,320
This is rough for both.

1286
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:48,760
These are mega, mega minus points for both of them.

1287
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:49,160
Yeah.

1288
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:50,520
And they explain the movies.

1289
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:53,800
And then what's up next for Mac?

1290
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:58,160
It's the page master and Richie Rich for Elijah is the war.

1291
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:00,280
I don't even know what that is.

1292
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:01,560
I don't remember that.

1293
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:05,200
I got an adult movie, a scary adult movie as far as I knew.

1294
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:06,560
Yeah.

1295
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:13,000
Biggest movie star he's worked with, Joe Pesci and Kevin Costner for Elijah and Mel

1296
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:13,600
Gibson.

1297
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:15,000
Pretty good.

1298
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:20,880
And so at the time, I guess Elijah's got the stage fright or stage might.

1299
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:25,120
At the last minute, Mac flaked on being an Academy Awards presenter.

1300
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:28,560
So Elijah stepped in, took his place, and stole the show.

1301
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:29,680
We discussed this.

1302
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:30,320
I must have had.

1303
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:34,680
I knew I had some phantom memory as we showed that clip in the Oscar special

1304
01:38:34,680 --> 01:38:38,680
of the T-Rex giving an envelope to Elijah.

1305
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:40,880
So it was supposed to be Mac.

1306
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:41,560
I guess so.

1307
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:43,200
Are they supposed to be telling us this?

1308
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:43,440
This is inside.

1309
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:45,920
Like Anthony Kiedis, this thing's a gossip rag.

1310
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:46,240
Yeah.

1311
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:53,360
And there's I'm trying to when grown up, most likely to resemble what celebrity

1312
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:57,200
they claim Mac will look like Steve Martin and they claim Elijah would have

1313
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:58,440
looked like Mel Gibson.

1314
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:00,520
And we know this today.

1315
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:03,000
I don't think either of those.

1316
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,880
I don't think those are correct.

1317
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:07,400
No, Elijah stayed pretty small.

1318
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:11,360
I mean, someday Mac might have gray hair.

1319
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:15,400
Possible and at the end of this, it just says, who do you like better?

1320
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:17,080
Do we have a choice?

1321
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:17,920
Well, I don't know.

1322
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:20,200
If you want to see him both, you just watch the good son.

1323
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:22,920
The good son is where the showdown takes place.

1324
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:23,760
Right.

1325
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:27,120
And I think what he did, he kill Elijah Wood or did Elijah would kill him

1326
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:29,160
because he was I don't know.

1327
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:30,160
Maybe no one died.

1328
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:31,840
We could throw out the whole.

1329
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:34,080
Actually, we're not going to do any of those votes.

1330
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:35,920
Can we do good signs for his next month?

1331
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:39,120
Club three is we're watching good son talking about it.

1332
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:40,080
I'm not going to lie.

1333
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:44,400
I never heard of a good son before tonight.

1334
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:45,480
Really? Yeah.

1335
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:46,440
You're lucky.

1336
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,840
It showed me my whole childhood.

1337
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:51,960
Good side did a scary Mac movie.

1338
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:54,320
It did stick with me at the time.

1339
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:55,400
I'm surprised you missed that.

1340
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:57,960
Your parents must have covered the TV when it came on.

1341
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:01,120
They like ran out. No.

1342
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:04,840
Little Jason, he cannot handle the horrors of the good son.

1343
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:07,280
Oh, Mike, was your plan to just like,

1344
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:10,880
I'm going to bring the magazines and rifle through them manically

1345
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:12,800
the entire episode?

1346
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:14,800
Yes. Turn, turn, turn, turn.

1347
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,000
You're the master.

1348
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,080
I've looked through them already.

1349
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:18,960
But yeah, now I'm just kind of going through them again.

1350
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:23,480
Yes, that is that was my plan to discuss respective attitudes here.

1351
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:26,400
Mike furiously ripping through magazines the entire time.

1352
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:31,400
Jason in full sweats, slippers and cuddled up with a dog.

1353
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:34,640
Yeah. Lying down for much of the.

1354
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:36,600
That's a good illustration of us in general.

1355
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:41,960
I mean, yeah, I probably filled my iPad to

1356
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:45,000
fill the storage space with screen grabs of covers.

1357
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:52,160
Sure. I, you know, I the page master, by the way, easy, easy

1358
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:54,800
Disney adventures cover, you have McCauley and the page

1359
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,840
master next to him, you know. Yeah.

1360
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:59,800
The live action. Yeah, the cartoon. Of course. Yeah.

1361
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:03,640
Any any thoughts on like what a modern pairing

1362
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:08,160
like would be for a cover modern live action and cartoon?

1363
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:12,600
Well, this would this would the problem is I'd have to consume

1364
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:16,400
a piece of media and know a younger star.

1365
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,640
So that's going to be hard for you.

1366
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:23,840
Don't because like they'll just be like the cast of under siege

1367
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,280
and then the blue from tailspin.

1368
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,400
OK, Sydney Sweeney.

1369
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:31,760
Yeah. From you for a new.

1370
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:34,400
Got it. She's younger, right?

1371
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:37,280
20, 20, I believe. OK.

1372
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:41,440
And what is she? She's doing a movie with that guy, Glenn Powell

1373
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:43,120
from Top Gun. I know that.

1374
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:45,280
I don't know what the movie is called.

1375
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:49,360
OK, so they're one of the two of them are on the cover

1376
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:52,200
and they're with that.

1377
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:53,200
You're stuck now.

1378
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:56,480
Hold on. You need one more piece of knowledge about.

1379
01:41:56,640 --> 01:41:58,240
I'm not stuck. I guess you're right.

1380
01:41:58,240 --> 01:41:59,680
I'm running into. Here's the thing, though.

1381
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:01,880
It doesn't actually have to correspond to anything.

1382
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,600
So this I get out of jail free card.

1383
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:09,680
OK, they're on the cover with Jack, the lamp lighter from Mary Poppins, too.

1384
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:11,680
And Topsy.

1385
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:15,680
From Mary Poppins, too.

1386
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:20,680
So it's Topsy and Jack and Sydney Sweeney and Glenn Powell.

1387
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:24,160
Two younger stars, not probably thinking his 30s. Great.

1388
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:26,760
But still a new hot young face.

1389
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:29,760
Well, the weekend is popular.

1390
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,760
Yes. Oh, sure.

1391
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:33,880
This HBO show coming out.

1392
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:36,880
Oh, the horny, supposedly very unpleasant show.

1393
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:38,760
Yeah, no, they did with that.

1394
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:42,200
He had entirely redone because he thought it was getting too much of a female

1395
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:45,440
perspective so he could just recreate the Will Smith one.

1396
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:50,640
He's holding Magica Dispel's beak shut because he doesn't want women

1397
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:53,360
talking in his show. So it's still Magica.

1398
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:55,360
Yeah. OK, exactly.

1399
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:57,960
Well, they have, you know, we have her in the post.

1400
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:01,120
The 2015 DuckTales 2017. Right.

1401
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:03,360
Jason, did you have one ready to go or you just think about?

1402
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:07,800
I was going to go with like I was trying to go very broad.

1403
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:13,120
So Miles Teller with the Top Gun aviators on and Bluey.

1404
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:16,000
I've heard so much about this dog.

1405
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,360
Bluey Disney character.

1406
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:19,200
It's on Disney Plus. OK. Yeah.

1407
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:21,640
All right. So Bluey is in the family. Yeah.

1408
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:23,440
Has he got glasses on?

1409
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:26,880
Is he in? Oh, he should also have like aviator glasses on.

1410
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:28,320
Yeah. OK.

1411
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:32,720
Top Gun and Bluey, Miles Teller and Bluey Soar writes itself.

1412
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:37,240
Let me let me let me ask you this.

1413
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:40,960
If Disney Adventure existed in 1949,

1414
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:43,280
what would be a good color?

1415
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:45,240
OK, great question.

1416
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:48,240
Maybe like Burt Lancaster and

1417
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,680
trying to think.

1418
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:54,440
Oh, sleepy.

1419
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:57,480
Huh? Maybe sleepy.

1420
01:43:57,480 --> 01:43:59,440
Sleepiest man in show business.

1421
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:01,200
Yeah, they're both taking a nap with sleep.

1422
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:03,960
They both got big hats, so big like sleep on it.

1423
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,560
I can't remember who who I just recently was reminded of.

1424
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:10,400
I work this character, Flip the Frog.

1425
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:12,080
OK, flip the frog.

1426
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:14,600
I don't know Disney owns the frog.

1427
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:17,120
Well, they should get him back.

1428
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:19,600
Yeah. I haven't said this on the show, right?

1429
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:23,800
I was I was looking at my beloved collectible section in Target

1430
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:27,080
and there was an employee that was explaining that some people

1431
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:29,720
that this character on the Funko Pop was Oswaldo.

1432
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:33,400
That was Walt's first creation, Oswaldo, and that they should make a movie

1433
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:35,280
where he earns his gloves.

1434
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:36,920
And they were like, oh, yeah, that's a good idea.

1435
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:37,400
You should write that.

1436
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:40,760
And he goes, they're already working on it.

1437
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:45,000
Well, first off, I like calling him Oswaldo.

1438
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:47,000
Yeah, it was great. I loved all of it.

1439
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,720
I mean, he had some of the details, right?

1440
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:49,880
He's calling him as Waldo, though.

1441
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:53,200
And then he yeah, he's he was like, they're already working on this.

1442
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:54,560
I know it now.

1443
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:57,640
When I've seen a Funko Pie, I have a couple of Funko Pots around.

1444
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:01,120
The characters name usually big letters on the box.

1445
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,960
That's true. Yeah.

1446
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:04,400
But I don't know. I'm not sure.

1447
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:06,440
I'm not sure why he's calling him that. OK.

1448
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:09,920
I'm going to I'm going to make you get that iPad back out

1449
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:11,240
because I have one little bit of business.

1450
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:14,040
You may remember that I texted you guys the list of the topics.

1451
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:18,440
And I said, don't look at page two, because on page two,

1452
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:20,560
I have prepared a little scene.

1453
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:23,160
Allow me to explain.

1454
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:26,680
I in thinking about this episode today, I wanted to make sure

1455
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:30,040
I got Becca's quote correct about why we should cover this.

1456
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:33,920
And she said they've covered everything from the mask animated show

1457
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:35,600
to the Backstreet Boys.

1458
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:38,200
I could not find the issue with the mask animated show.

1459
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:39,200
I got nothing about that.

1460
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:41,600
But I was like, we got I got to do the assignment here.

1461
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:44,240
Yeah. Disney adventures do with the Backstreet Boys,

1462
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:47,200
even though it was in the post animated cover era.

1463
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:49,840
And I Backstreet Boys were on the cover twice.

1464
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,120
One I couldn't find.

1465
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:53,520
The second I found something delightful.

1466
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:55,920
We've been talking about these comics the whole time.

1467
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:59,480
This issue is the home to a true Disney adventures.

1468
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:02,280
Original a Backstreet Boys comic.

1469
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:06,440
Oh, a an original Backstreet Boys adventure.

1470
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:08,960
It is called Backstreet to the Future.

1471
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:14,240
It imagines a world in which they are not only the biggest boy band on Earth,

1472
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:18,720
but also they work with a time travel scientist named Professor Zink.

1473
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:22,440
Can you see any credit?

1474
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:25,480
Some of them had the credits vertically along the side.

1475
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:28,040
I don't have it in front of me, but I can't do that now.

1476
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:33,400
But perhaps some up and coming comic talent designing Professor Zink

1477
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:39,680
and his of course, his trusty robot parrot always on his shoulder.

1478
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:42,400
With all his inventions, he's always of course, jingling.

1479
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:48,880
I picked only the briefest of scenes and they're broken up.

1480
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:53,640
But just to give everybody a little flavor of Backstreet to the Future.

1481
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:57,400
And let me assign some parts.

1482
01:46:57,400 --> 01:47:00,200
I'm going to be Backstreet Boy Brian Littrell.

1483
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:05,160
Mike, you will play the high pressure role of Professor Zink.

1484
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:07,360
OK, what does he look like?

1485
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:08,760
I can't show you.

1486
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:11,560
Imagine what you picture when you picture it.

1487
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:12,400
I'm a science scientist.

1488
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:14,920
OK, should I do like a doc voice or something?

1489
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:15,800
It's up to you.

1490
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:17,880
You know, Professor Zink has never been voiced.

1491
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:19,360
So it's a wide open canvas.

1492
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:21,720
I'm feeling tired, but I guess I can try.

1493
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:22,480
He can be tired.

1494
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:25,040
Professor Zink probably is tired from all his experiments.

1495
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:25,520
All right. Yeah.

1496
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:28,480
And from always having the robot parrot on his shoulder,

1497
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:31,000
robot parrot who will be played by Jason Schiff.

1498
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,720
Of course. Got it.

1499
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:34,680
OK, so I think it is late.

1500
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:36,480
I think it's been long hours.

1501
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:36,840
Right.

1502
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:38,600
Probably the Backstreet Boys were rehearsing all day,

1503
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:41,120
but now Brian is helping Professor Zink in the lab.

1504
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:42,520
Wait, there's a Kevin too.

1505
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:43,240
Are you doing Kevin as well?

1506
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:44,000
I'm going to break it up.

1507
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,120
I'll reassign the roles.

1508
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:48,520
OK, so I will begin.

1509
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:50,520
I'm going to get going now, Professor Zink.

1510
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:52,640
Thanks for letting me borrow these cordless mics.

1511
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:55,880
We'll need them for the Mega Music Awards show tonight.

1512
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:59,440
It's no problem, Brian, but can you stay another moment?

1513
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:02,600
I haven't had a chance to finish telling you about my latest invention.

1514
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:04,520
Squawk!

1515
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:05,360
Very good.

1516
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:07,440
So that sets the scene.

1517
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:12,160
And then there's Brian, clumsy Brian Lattrell,

1518
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,600
pushes a button that he's not supposed to.

1519
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:16,920
He and the Professor end up lost in time.

1520
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:18,600
The other Backstreet Boys got to go find them.

1521
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:21,960
They end up in all these eras that they're not...

1522
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:23,800
They don't know how to get out of them.

1523
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:25,440
They're there with Shakespeare.

1524
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:28,720
They're with Dinus. They're avoiding T-Rex, biting them.

1525
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:29,680
It's a really excellent...

1526
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:32,680
It was my favorite of any comic that I ran into.

1527
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:37,280
But mainly, the big reveal is that Brian and Professor Zink

1528
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:41,120
are tied up on a plank of a pirate ship.

1529
01:48:41,120 --> 01:48:45,400
And that's where we end up at this scene.

1530
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:47,400
Mike, I'm going to reassign the roles.

1531
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:50,000
You're going to be a pirate.

1532
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:54,080
Then you're also going to be Kevin Richardson of the Backstreet Boys.

1533
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:55,880
It's my sister's favorite backstreet boy.

1534
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:57,480
Jason and I's roles will remain.

1535
01:48:57,480 --> 01:49:01,080
Oh, no, she liked Brian. No, no, she liked Brian, not Kevin.

1536
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:03,320
OK, so here's the pirate ship scene.

1537
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:04,440
OK.

1538
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:09,400
Avast, the sharks are going to have stowaway stew for dinner tonight.

1539
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:10,240
It's McGruff.

1540
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:12,920
Into the sea with ya.

1541
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:14,000
It's ye, but OK.

1542
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,040
Ye, sorry.

1543
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:18,240
Oh, no, what are we going to do, Kevin?

1544
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:21,200
Let's show these buccaneers a little rock and roll.

1545
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:24,120
Rock and roll, Squawk!

1546
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:25,640
Wonderful.

1547
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:27,880
And then I will shuffle the parts one more time.

1548
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:30,040
Everything works out with the Backstreet Boys.

1549
01:49:30,040 --> 01:49:32,360
They get back to the time that they're supposed to be in.

1550
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:36,600
They do get to perform at the Mega Music Awards show.

1551
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:40,640
And I will now give Jason his first non-parrot role.

1552
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:44,680
You will play Backstreet Boy Howie Darrow wrapping up the whole story.

1553
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:45,560
All right.

1554
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:50,600
OK, boys, now that we've traveled through the last few millenniums,

1555
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,880
let's sing a few songs from our own millennium.

1556
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:57,840
Beautiful. Wow. Perfect tie in.

1557
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:58,680
That's great.

1558
01:49:58,680 --> 01:50:03,440
I mean, you know, I love seeing the Backstreet Boys getting to meet Bill

1559
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:09,480
Shakespeare, but where they belong is in is in 1999 or perhaps 2023

1560
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:13,560
in kind of a Vegas tie review kind of setting.

1561
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:14,880
It works for them.

1562
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:18,480
Maybe a fun commercial or Christmas song here and there.

1563
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:23,440
Sure. So much credit to Disney Adventures for all this nostalgia

1564
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:26,240
for sending the Backstreet Boys on the adventure of their lives,

1565
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:28,720
for teaching us cool slang.

1566
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,240
But at this point, we've been tracking for a while.

1567
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:34,160
I think it's time to leave your head.

1568
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:36,600
We have to leave the hut.

1569
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:38,400
I'm working.

1570
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:40,640
I know I was going to say they taught us and that would not to say.

1571
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:42,560
Yeah, I thought it's what not to say to you.

1572
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:45,200
It's just wait, what was the for Pete's sake?

1573
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:46,880
Yeah, yeah.

1574
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:51,160
Well, and I was going to have Taco Bell tonight, but just to get out.

1575
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:52,640
That's it's uncool.

1576
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:53,840
It is uncool.

1577
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:57,400
Yeah, listener, don't eat Mexican food ever again.

1578
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:58,640
Unless you want to be lame.

1579
01:50:58,640 --> 01:51:00,920
Unless you just want to show everybody that you're lame.

1580
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:03,640
It might make you mad, but don't say for Pete's sake.

1581
01:51:04,680 --> 01:51:09,160
Well, you survived podcast, the ride club three.

1582
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:11,800
Thank you for subscribing to club three.

1583
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:13,480
Your bravery saved the podcast.

1584
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:14,880
Well done, freedom fighters.

1585
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:18,520
I don't know when we're going to post the poll, but keep an eye out for it.

1586
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:26,680
The returning contenders will vie for the top prize or perhaps be cast away to hell.

1587
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:30,240
I wonder if there's a way to put a term in there.

1588
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:31,560
There's other.

1589
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:33,360
Oh, here we go.

1590
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:34,080
This is slang.

1591
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:38,920
Apparently the loser of the club three poll might end up getting a big old wampin.

1592
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:45,440
But you can choose which which topic is all that and a bag o chips.

1593
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:48,640
Stay subscribed, folks.
