1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,360
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:29,420
Listeners, will you be our valentines here on this special Valentine's Day, very romantic

3
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,220
podcast, the ride the second gate.

4
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,140
I'm Scott Gardner.

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,500
There's my Carlson.

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,160
I am feeling very romantic right now.

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,320
I just want to warn everyone.

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,840
Oh yes, the amorousness.

9
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,560
Well, hold on, amorous.

10
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,320
Wait a minute.

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,380
Wait, hang on.

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,720
Now I crossed the line with amorousness, Jason Sheridan.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,160
Let's get more into this amorousness.

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,200
That's what I'm saying, brother.

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:56,760
What is the major difference between romantic and amorousness in your mind?

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,800
Oh, romantic is flowers and a nice meal and looking nicely at each other while you eat.

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,640
That's not amorousness.

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,100
A feeling of love or fondness.

19
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,640
Fondness is crossing the line.

20
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,840
Fondness is where we get a little R-rated.

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,040
Fondness is where you get amorous.

22
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,140
Fondness leads to horniness, leads to intercourse.

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,060
Romantic is fine, but fondness.

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,220
We're not comfortable with being fond.

25
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,900
You looked at some sort of Christian website that defined what that means.

26
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,620
Amorous in my mind means a little bit more.

27
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,020
Desire.

28
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah, don't you think that's what amorous means?

29
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,200
I am looking at this is vocabulary.

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,020
com.

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:38,780
Yes, Christian.

32
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:45,800
The skewed slant of the smutty slant of vocabulary.

33
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,460
com.

34
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,080
I guess the ride is for lovers.

35
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,260
Yeah, no, I'm romantic.

36
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:58,040
I just mean, you know, I prominently display my April O'Neill figure, you know, for 24 hours.

37
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,860
And then after that, I put her back sort of in the action scene that she's already been a part of,

38
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,040
where she's driving the turtle van.

39
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,820
This is a real thing.

40
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,900
Did you move April O'Neill?

41
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,280
I did not move April O'Neill.

42
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,740
You give her, on Valentine's Day, you give her a chance to shine solo.

43
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,840
Well, not even shine.

44
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,120
Sometimes when you have your figures, some of them are in sort of a diorama situation,

45
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,580
and then some of them are just sort of standing there displayed prominently.

46
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,780
So I guess she is having a time to shine in this fake scenario I've created.

47
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,380
OK, OK.

48
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,580
Which I do not do.

49
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:36,040
I do not take my female figures out for Valentine's Day and prominently display them.

50
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,460
Valentine's Day.

51
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,340
Come on out, girls.

52
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,660
Mimi LeFou from Bucky O'Hare.

53
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,620
Come on out.

54
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,400
I got to look up Mimi LeFou.

55
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,640
I think I may have said her word.

56
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,420
Mimi LeFou.

57
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,920
Is it LeFou or LeFou?

58
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,140
LeFou.

59
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,440
I'm getting it confused now.

60
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:52,940
Let's see.

61
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,960
I'm going to need some autocorrect to help me out.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,180
Mimi LeFou.

63
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,140
LeFou, OK.

64
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,240
I mean, it's especially funny is that one of the first pictures is her looking all mad.

65
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:04,760
Yeah.

66
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,880
With massive hulking, I would say pretty manly hands.

67
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,540
Sure.

68
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,280
Well, she's a military woman.

69
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,440
She's got to be tough.

70
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,620
So yeah, she's she's coming out for Valentine's Day.

71
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,580
She's going to be standing there.

72
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,740
All the different ladies.

73
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,400
It's kind of a look.

74
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,120
I understand.

75
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,820
If you're if you're feeling at all amorous about this particular not amorous, not amorous,

76
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,580
romantic.

77
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,360
And then that's fine.

78
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,020
That's fine.

79
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,480
Romantic.

80
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,440
Having romantic feelings about Mimi LeFou.

81
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,400
Yeah.

82
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,760
Me me my me me.

83
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,300
I call her.

84
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,060
I mean, I got to look up.

85
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,320
All right.

86
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,820
What's the definition of romantic?

87
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,760
Then amorous to me just seems like it means more on the horny area than romantic necessarily

88
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,100
does.

89
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,360
All right.

90
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:59,080
I will admit that Miriam Webster says about amorous strongly moved by love and especially

91
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,260
sexual love.

92
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,080
Yeah, of course.

93
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,340
So I guess Miriam Webster is backing.

94
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,740
Thank you, Miriam.

95
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,500
I'll just play Miriam.

96
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,900
My Miriam Webster.

97
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:14,400
Miriam Webster, who is, of course, a female dictionary, beautiful lady.

98
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,820
Hello, Miriam.

99
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,660
Miriam.

100
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,760
Teach me your words, Miriam.

101
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,520
I don't pay attention to that dash.

102
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,600
I don't get in the name.

103
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,980
I know it's one beautiful lady.

104
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,260
This is Miriam Webster.

105
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,300
Hot for teacher.

106
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,140
Odd for vocab teacher.

107
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,780
Or that means the same thing as amorous as well.

108
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,360
Romantic is the only thing that's always fine.

109
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,100
That's right.

110
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,600
Sex is not part of romantic whatsoever.

111
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,620
Sex is not part of romance.

112
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:39,980
Never.

113
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,840
That's right.

114
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,480
All right.

115
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:47,820
Well, we're off to as weird of a start as you could guess for this kind of love-themed thing.

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,780
And what we're doing here today, this is a topic that didn't make it in the Club 3 poll

117
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,680
due to the Griffin Newman masked magician blockade.

118
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,700
Results of that coming soon to Club 3.

119
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,080
But it's Valentine's Day.

120
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,760
I think usually episodes don't drop on Valentine's Day.

121
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,980
Seemed like a good chance to just seize this, take a romantic opportunity.

122
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,460
Thank you.

123
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,420
To not be amorous to our listeners.

124
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,480
And talk about tunnels of love.

125
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,400
I think we've been talking about this for a little while.

126
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,360
I feel like it's been on the mental shortlist.

127
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,360
And I think it came up in an episode a while back.

128
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,200
Because I think just as a starting point, just to get us all on the same page,

129
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,500
I feel like when you hear tunnels of love, there's something,

130
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,780
I think we can all conjure in our heads a mental image of this.

131
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,060
Yeah.

132
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,540
It is probably something that we've seen in some media.

133
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,420
And I think we can determine that it is a boat ride.

134
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,960
Perhaps the boat is a swan, the most romantic animal.

135
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,020
Not usually?

136
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,160
That's what I found.

137
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:58,920
Well, hang on.

138
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,380
But he's saying my hypothetical thoughts.

139
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:07,080
Like when you just flash to knee jerk, when you conjure a tunnel of love.

140
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,760
That's what I like pictures.

141
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,920
It's from a cartoon or a sitcom or something.

142
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,880
And maybe you're in a swan.

143
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:20,160
And you're going through arches that are shaped like hearts.

144
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,420
And that there's lots of, and Tosin, anything else

145
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,960
that you guys see in the hypothetical of this.

146
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:32,120
But it's cupids, and they're firing arrows.

147
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,480
And maybe some cupids are making eyes at each other.

148
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,860
And the cupids are in this.

149
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,540
Love is style.

150
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,400
Love is, sure.

151
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,840
It's very love is.

152
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,660
I'm a strip of love is, yeah.

153
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,760
But obviously tons of hearts and maybe big puckered lips.

154
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,760
And I think a Greek Roman sort of thing.

155
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,100
Like tunics, perhaps.

156
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,680
Yeah, definitely tunics.

157
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,180
Yeah, yeah.

158
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,820
A romantic time.

159
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,720
And then probably in like, I think columns are probably part of it as well.

160
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,920
That's in keeping with it.

161
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:08,620
And maybe like scrolls, which are very romantic.

162
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,560
Like a big scroll you passed under that says be mine might be in this.

163
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,660
And then definitely lattices.

164
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,120
The most romantic surface or wall.

165
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,580
You got some boring concrete wall wood to get out of here.

166
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,280
But the criss-crossing of the white wood.

167
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:28,660
Yeah.

168
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,460
That, like the criss-crossing of bodies in a relationship.

169
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,300
Maybe that's why lattices are sort of romantic.

170
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,740
I hadn't thought of that, but you're right.

171
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,040
Yeah.

172
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,920
I figured it out.

173
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,120
This is, yeah, this is the popular consciousness.

174
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,440
The existence of the tunnel of love has lived on.

175
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:53,840
Even though by the later 20th century, most of them gone or flipped.

176
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,940
This was my question.

177
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,940
And I think that this, I'm sure this came up in an episode and I don't remember which one.

178
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,180
But my thought was we've all seen something like this portrayed on some show.

179
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,440
I don't know if we can even say exactly what the, what show that was.

180
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,460
That was a question I had.

181
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,660
Where do I have this image?

182
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,800
But I think we all have it.

183
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,680
We're like, okay, at some point in time, there were these rides.

184
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,140
And these were rides for lovers.

185
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:24,220
And if you broke away from your chaperones, from your parents or your deadbeat, deadweight,

186
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,560
third wheel friends, and you got a little pucker up time on the tunnel of love,

187
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,320
that could seal the deal for this relationship.

188
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,100
Or in a very sitcom-y way, make two people who hate each other.

189
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,080
They're forced together on the tunnel of love.

190
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,300
They come out smooching.

191
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,160
And I think it occurred to me, what is, was this ever,

192
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,300
has there ever actually been one of these in the world?

193
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,060
That was the question.

194
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,360
Or is this fully a contrivance of pop culture?

195
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,340
That was my question.

196
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,780
And this is what we thought we would explore here in this episode.

197
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,140
because you look into this a little bit.

198
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,800
There's been articles about it.

199
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,520
It's mentioned here and there.

200
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,920
So that's just the thesis here.

201
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,800
Let's tackle this notion.

202
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,460
And did these ever exist?

203
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,340
Do they ever exist?

204
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,340
And I'll ask the listener right away, if anyone listening to this,

205
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,100
have you ever been on something that you think is this?

206
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,260
The most, and I don't know, anything else to say about hypothetically what you think?

207
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:35,260
Because the other thing that's in my head is they're all eight to 20 minutes long.

208
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,540
How could a room possibly be so romantic?

209
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:48,980
Maybe it's pulsing like a heart would be, or other body tunnels.

210
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,400
The image in pop culture is so romantic,

211
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,960
versus what I learned was the reality.

212
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,520
And I'm sure you guys came across.

213
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,220
So let's dig in then.

214
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,320
We all have this picture, but what is the reality of this?

215
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,340
Do you want to take us through some of what you figured out?

216
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,360
Well, just broad strokes.

217
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,360
I was starting to say, by the later 20th century,

218
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:23,020
a lot of these are, in reality, are gone or flipped to other rides.

219
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,660
The discovery of the other name of Tunnel of Love,

220
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:37,920
which we've come across before, namely, I think, of Kennywood, the Old Mill.

221
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,760
If you saw a ride named Old Mill, same concept as Tunnel of Love.

222
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:49,260
There used to be an Old Mill at Coney Island, various other places.

223
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,740
The other name I came across was Mill Chute,

224
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,080
which is basically a tunnel of love that ends with a splashdown.

225
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,120
And that's kind of like a combo.

226
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,860
Sort of a Proto-Flume-Red-Splash Mountain kind of thing.

227
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,580
A chute.

228
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,560
A Mill Chute.

229
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,880
Yeah, a Mill Chute.

230
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,480
So a little less romantic.

231
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,480
Well, yeah.

232
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,720
It seems like the reality here, when you start Googling this,

233
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,700
what you get into is the Tunnel of Love is perhaps less literally

234
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:27,060
this small world length and scale celebration of the general feeling of romance.

235
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:34,500
It's maybe less that you enter the Google image search for Valentine's clip art.

236
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,060
That's what I've always imagined it to be.

237
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,860
And more of a functional type of ride title.

238
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,140
Then I think what you're alluding to.

239
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,700
Tunnel of Love.

240
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,840
It's a type of ride.

241
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:52,640
It's a type of ride, and most importantly, it is pitch black or nearly black.

242
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,700
This is a very early 1900s sort of idea.

243
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,860
This is like a very early theme park.

244
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,260
And into way pre-Disneyland.

245
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,000
Theming is probably not to the extent that it would be later.

246
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,680
But yeah, that very Coney Island early days sort of thing.

247
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,180
Combined with that old mill.

248
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:23,260
So the basis of Tunnel of Love in that functional way, are we saying,

249
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:32,420
is like a slow moving dark tunnel ride where probably you are alone.

250
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:41,000
You're in a vehicle built for two as opposed to a Pirates of the Caribbean, a boat for 40.

251
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,360
I'm not doing any smooching on the Pirates of the Caribbean personally.

252
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,060
Probably.

253
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,640
I'm not going to roll it out.

254
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,020
Jason, have you ever smooched on pirates?

255
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,020
Like a little like, you know, a quick kiss.

256
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,620
What rides have you pecked on?

257
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,600
That's a question.

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,800
Which part of Pirates do you think?

259
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,160
Do you think before the drop?

260
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,200
That's interesting.

261
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,740
Those caves are kind of like haunting and a little moody and romantic.

262
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,380
So before you go back in time or whatever, when you're seeing the skeletons, that's when you pecked?

263
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,420
Or pre-skeleton.

264
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,820
Or post-cave pre-skeleton.

265
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,280
That's when you're still getting the momentum though from the drop.

266
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,580
But we're talking about California, of course.

267
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,400
If not, if we're talking about Florida.

268
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:32,620
It's pretty dark before, yeah, the bayou just gets me in the mood.

269
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,540
The old man in the old, yeah.

270
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,000
The old man on the rocking chair.

271
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,180
One old man staring at me.

272
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,460
Single banjo string being strummed and Jason's ready to go.

273
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:52,920
One, when I had forgotten, when I was down in Florida, Disney World, like in the last few years,

274
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,240
I forgot that that old man is also, you can see it from the river boot.

275
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:04,400
They did put that little scene, it's just kind of in the corner.

276
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,340
Oh, okay.

277
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,200
I guess I didn't realize that.

278
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,780
It's also on the Rivers of America or whatever else.

279
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,820
Yeah, which is sort of bigger but more boring in Florida.

280
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,180
Is it called something, the way everything's called something more boring in Magic Kingdom,

281
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,560
is it called, is it there, is it called like Rivers of Dick Irvine or something?

282
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,160
Dick Irvine Presents, Rivers of America.

283
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,820
It's one of those little things, I hate it.

284
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,420
I hate it because it's the boat.

285
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,640
Yeah, what are the examples of it?

286
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,520
Admiral Joe Fallot, boo, hey, dumb name, Mark Twain's cool.

287
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,240
Yeah, that's true.

288
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,060
I'm trying to think of other examples of that.

289
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,060
Or it's like slightly, well that's not slightly different, that's different.

290
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,060
It's the boat, the boat's on the Seven Seas Lagoon.

291
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,800
One of those is called something really boring.

292
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,080
Yeah.

293
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,480
It's just named after some guy.

294
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,720
Well, let's do, let's do, uh,

295
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,120
The Richard F.

296
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:49,780
Ermingham.

297
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,840
Let's do Disneyland Disney World versus two.

298
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,740
And we'll really have a bunch of ammo now.

299
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,740
We'll hit that point.

300
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,120
Well, if we do it with Mitch again, I'm sure he'll care.

301
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,340
I think we will have.

302
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,240
But don't you think it's just, it's these executive names and that's just a little

303
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,620
less enchanting, wouldn't you say?

304
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,640
Well, we'll see what he has.

305
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,120
Fuck you.

306
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,840
Very concerned about enchantment levels, yeah.

307
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,400
That's enchantment levels is something to consider with this ride genre as well.

308
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,180
I think they're, they call, they start calling these things tunnels of love in a functional

309
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:31,440
setting and also it seems to come from, all right, if you're like, on a long boat ride

310
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:38,940
with just you and a partner, then this maybe allows you some privacy and a chance to do some,

311
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,460
I don't know if this is a too harsh of a phrase, canoodling.

312
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:52,160
Some canoodling because public displays of affection were so frowned upon in the late

313
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,620
1800s, early 1900s.

314
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,680
long.

315
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,560
Not as long, you know, in a room, it's open-ended.

316
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,340
You have to decide how long you go into the room.

317
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:08,700
Yeah.

318
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,260
How much you do in the room.

319
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:10,540
Right.

320
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,500
But in a boat ride, you just, you have a limited amount of time.

321
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,140
It's like seven minutes in heaven.

322
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,080
You really should probably plan it out ahead of time because you, such a short amount of time.

323
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:20,580
You have to talk through it.

324
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,120
Yeah, you might want to have a game plan.

325
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,560
Yeah, you may have been on completely different pages about what's going to go on in there.

326
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,460
Yes, so here, I'm going to, some of this is from, this is a mental floss article that

327
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,660
proposes the same question.

328
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,440
That's like, why, so was there ever really a tunnel of love?

329
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,140
And they get into some of this.

330
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,580
That Old Mill rides gained popularity at a time when unchaperoned dates between young

331
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,440
people were still viewed as risque.

332
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:51,840
I mean, that time, I think continued to the 2000s for me, I would say.

333
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:58,300
I don't think suddenly my parents are not psyched on unchaperoned dates.

334
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,880
I had a particularly Catholic upbringing.

335
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,180
The 1910s were no different for me.

336
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,460
But anyway, what's weird about, I think the disconnect here for me is that they start

337
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,500
calling things tunnels of love because of the reputation, because of what you get up to

338
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,160
in the ride.

339
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,080
But so many of the actual rides that existed were scary.

340
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,680
It's caves, like pirates, like we're saying.

341
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,240
It's caverns.

342
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,500
And maybe all the way up to this Old Mill, there's nothing romantic about that other

343
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,460
than that you're in the dark.

344
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,720
Well, hold on, Jason, when you're talking about an Old Mill.

345
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,680
Well, there's a certain charm to an Old Mill.

346
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,480
The romance of times gone by and the nostalgic feeling.

347
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,280
And the never ceasing nature of the mill.

348
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:45,840
That's right.

349
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,500
No matter what's going on in the world, no matter what war we're in, the buckets keep

350
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:50,780
flowing.

351
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,460
That's right.

352
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:57,180
The Old Mill, Jason gets that feeling when he's on the Knott's log ride.

353
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,860
It's kind of an Old Mill, right?

354
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,420
Are there people that are sawing?

355
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,360
Yeah, they're sawing in there.

356
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,000
They're howling.

357
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,840
Yeah, so that's similar.

358
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:12,240
Yeah, there's young love blossoming at that, you know, with the big party where somebody's

359
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,540
dancing on a log or whatever.

360
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:14,820
Yeah.

361
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,820
So that's all in the aftermath of a mill.

362
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,040
But what I'm saying is some of the types of ride, when you start looking into it, this

363
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,100
ride was a tunnel of love.

364
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:23,860
What do you mean?

365
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,180
That is a scary ride.

366
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:25,600
Right.

367
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,820
That doesn't make any sense.

368
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,780
But apparently, this article goes on.

369
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:36,900
This is actually an article quoting a 1950 article that's talking about scary rides and

370
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,100
how they're opportunities for romance.

371
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,980
Research has shown, let me do more 50s.

372
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,900
Research has shown that the snarls, howls, and groans of the hideous sights along the

373
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:51,400
way, while palpably phony, will cause the female to precipitate herself into the male's

374
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,320
arms, the 1950 article reads.

375
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:58,720
Her fright is usually as phony as the hazards of the course, but it serves a useful purpose.

376
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,200
Women are liars.

377
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,480
I get it.

378
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,620
That's what they're saying.

379
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,680
They're lying about their fear.

380
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,080
I wasn't around then.

381
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,620
I don't know.

382
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,260
Maybe all women were liars.

383
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:09,860
I don't know.

384
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,780
I wasn't alive.

385
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,900
I can't vouch for 50s.

386
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:20,100
You know, distraction and lies to that.

387
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,040
There was no desire.

388
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,760
Women did not experience desire until the last 20 years.

389
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,800
Well, that's what they're saying.

390
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,380
They were.

391
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,360
But they had to hide.

392
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,600
They had to couch their desire.

393
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,520
Maybe that's true.

394
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,400
I mean, it's true on some level.

395
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,400
You had to trick them.

396
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,480
You had to use other, you know, like if I'm going to pull on their heartstrings, I need

397
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,420
to activate their fear strings.

398
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,080
That's right.

399
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:48,560
When you pass by a goblin while palpably phony, perhaps even if her phoniness, but you know,

400
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,860
she needs some excuse to want to jump into my arms here in this tunnel of.

401
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,580
This is something I would give the young people a tip about.

402
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,520
Take them to Six Flags Fright Fest and take them in the sewer of souls.

403
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:07,320
Because as soon as your lady or your man or whoever, they see that big pile of shit,

404
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,640
they're going right into your arms.

405
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,060
They're going to get freaked out and they're going right in there.

406
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,240
And then you're going to get a smooch.

407
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,720
You're going to get a couple smooches while you're walking through the sewer of souls.

408
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,200
You know, you need that aphrodisiac to kickstart the relationship.

409
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,020
How about a big pile of shit?

410
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,120
Hey, Betsy, I want to take you out tonight.

411
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,160
We're going to a place called Fright Fest.

412
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,040
You're my best gal and I want you to experience the greatest fear that Six Flags has to offer.

413
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,540
I took the night off from my job also working at Fright Fest.

414
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,080
Me being a 15 year old in Valencia, of course, and you as well.

415
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:46,340
Put on your best poodle skirt because you're going to need your legs to walk

416
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,760
through the sewer of souls.

417
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,220
That's accurate.

418
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,480
There's still there's still poodle skirts, but the poodles are styled like Harley Quinn.

419
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,760
That's the difference in Valencia today.

420
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,360
Yeah, yeah.

421
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,100
It's a poodle Quinn.

422
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,540
It's like a Harley Quinn match up with the poodle.

423
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,120
It's a little twisted, but it's, you know, it's still tasteful.

424
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,440
So yeah, this this is always something that was portrayed, especially I feel like in like

425
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,360
and this again, this is just these are these are in my mind, like AI cobbled memories in

426
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,820
the same way that like AI tries to put together something that it thinks is what you want.

427
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,420
Like my brain does that.

428
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:26,420
I just think imagine a Happy Days episode where they were seeing a movie, a sci fi movie

429
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,700
and like Richie had like his gal in there and she got scared because there was a big

430
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,960
role, but I don't know if that ever happened in Happy Days, but that's what my brain wants

431
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,500
to remember.

432
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,140
Yeah, it's in something like that.

433
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,000
All things are from a kind of collective pop culture.

434
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,640
Yeah, it's mushing it all together.

435
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,140
Right.

436
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,580
Have you guys had a situation like this where like you went to a scary thing

437
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,300
and then your gal ended up in your arms?

438
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,780
Gosh, that's a good question.

439
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,180
I feel like that is true.

440
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,340
That is a true thing that is in my brain, but I can't remember it.

441
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,620
All I'm remembering is now that I'm in Happy Days and I'm wearing Richie Cunningham's sweater,

442
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,960
but that didn't happen.

443
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,220
I'm trying to remember because it does feel familiar to me.

444
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,100
Yeah, right.

445
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,480
That's where you'll end up.

446
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,880
That's the dream is that I was hanging out with Potsy and Ralph Melph and.

447
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,840
Permanent Happy Days is yours.

448
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,880
What awaits you in the great beyond?

449
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,320
Heaven is Happy Days.

450
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,420
Just being at Arnold's and hanging out with the fellas.

451
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,980
Yeah, I think it did.

452
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,320
There's nothing so memorable.

453
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,760
I don't think it was anything where it was like, boy, I like I'd like to get a hug from this girl.

454
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,080
And oh, it did because it was a movie and she got scared.

455
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,120
I don't think it was anything like that.

456
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,300
It was probably like I was in a long term relationship and oh, they got scared and they

457
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,260
like kind of hugged me or something.

458
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,660
It wasn't anything dramatic.

459
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:50,120
One of the biggest like an important early handhold for me was during a movie,

460
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,240
which both parents were present for.

461
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,760
And this was the movie.

462
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,780
What a romantic film.

463
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,200
A.

464
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,720
I.

465
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,480
Steven Spielberg's A.

466
00:22:59,480 --> 00:22:59,820
I.

467
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,000
Which worked out for me.

468
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,120
I don't know if the handhold happened due to like fear.

469
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,160
I don't know if it was the flesh fair is scary.

470
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,140
So we held hands.

471
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,400
But I remember that like held on and then like a handhold started.

472
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,300
I'd like this.

473
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,240
OK, well, this is great.

474
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,620
I'm not letting go, even though like the law you hold hands for a long time.

475
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,880
It becomes like, yeah, it's a long film.

476
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,460
Well, yeah, and that's what this is.

477
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,180
This is the rare film that essentially has like a fourth act.

478
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:34,520
So I was happy, but also probably losing feeling in my hand as I realized like, oh,

479
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,440
this is no adendum.

480
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,520
You were squeezing.

481
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,100
I didn't want to leave.

482
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,240
I had to cling on.

483
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,820
This might be my only chance here.

484
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,500
Like making marks in her hand.

485
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,260
Oh, it cut the skin.

486
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,180
She bled.

487
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,660
We had to go to the hospital afterward.

488
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:56,500
Incredibly sad end of a movie, too, to be like holding hands with a girl you like.

489
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,260
And he's like the robot boy is fine.

490
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,780
Really, it's all about like a false.

491
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,580
It's all if it's a false A.

492
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,020
I.

493
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,600
simulacrum of love.

494
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,160
Yeah.

495
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,700
That's the best that he can get from some aliens who scanned his memory.

496
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,060
A weird and recreated.

497
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,580
Yeah.

498
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,140
Yeah.

499
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,480
But hey, if it was endless, I would have been fine with me.

500
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,560
Do you have any memory of anything like this or like ride romance in general?

501
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,380
Well, Mike, we know you had a failed attempt at this.

502
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,220
Yeah, no, it's the saddest, most pathetic things on a couple levels.

503
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,120
If you're if you've if you've subscribed to the right level on this Patreon,

504
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,420
you know what we're talking about.

505
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,400
I think most scandalous jaw dropping.

506
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,080
I never said it was scandals or jaw dropping.

507
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,740
I just want to make that clear to the audience.

508
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,040
Mike's disgusting, amorous stories.

509
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,880
If they feel let down, it's not I didn't say it was.

510
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,160
It was a bit.

511
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,460
It was a built up story.

512
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,180
Well, I know it was built up, but it was actually it was accidentally built up, I think.

513
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:56,640
Mm hmm.

514
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,800
It was a runaway build up and it's not got away from it got away from me.

515
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,540
Yeah.

516
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,540
No, I don't think there's anything other than that, really.

517
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,720
That's close to I was puked on by a girl.

518
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,020
Oh, no, no, I was puked on by a girl.

519
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,420
I was puked on while a girl.

520
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:11,820
You paid for that.

521
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,060
I was on a Tilted World with a girl I liked,

522
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,000
but then a guy who was also on the Tilted World puked all over me.

523
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,360
I have said this before, I think.

524
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:19,980
Nice.

525
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,540
So that's like really humiliating.

526
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,040
Like I was there's a ton of there was like five of the five kids on.

527
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,240
It was like sixth grade or something.

528
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,440
And we were all on and the girl I liked was probably on the left side.

529
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,640
And I was on the right side.

530
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,460
And then right next to me was this kid, Adam.

531
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,440
And he had had a big brownie and a big like coke

532
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,140
right before getting on the Tilted World.

533
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,340
And in the middle of the Tilted World, he's he's trying to like flag the part.

534
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,900
Like I'm going to throw up, I'm going to throw up.

535
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,780
And I'm like he's got like yell, I'm like yelling.

536
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,840
He's going to throw up.

537
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,360
He's going to throw up.

538
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,240
And the guy, the car and he didn't care.

539
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,760
Didn't affect him.

540
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,480
No, he didn't care.

541
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,000
That's also too many people for a standard Tilted World car.

542
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,920
You should have split that party up.

543
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,060
Yeah, I mean, we fit.

544
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,080
It was fine.

545
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,940
But Jason's worried about say,

546
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,100
do you think the car and he was worried about overloaded?

547
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,120
No, I see.

548
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,640
That's where my mind go.

549
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,620
And I'm like, well, if you had gone two and three,

550
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,680
you would have enjoyed the experience more.

551
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,420
It's more optimal Tilted World.

552
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,360
I think it's fun to be packed in there a little bit.

553
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:24,920
I suppose.

554
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:25,440
With your kids.

555
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,820
But it's not fun when the kid throws up all over you.

556
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,500
And it's like you have nowhere to I know where to go, though.

557
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,840
So I crammed in this corner.

558
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,100
So and all that was the only person.

559
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,880
I was the only person who got it either.

560
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,480
Like everybody else was not covered in puke.

561
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,360
So I was covered in puke.

562
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,140
And that was a little bit embarrassing,

563
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,340
but that was not romantic.

564
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,800
Brownie and a big Coke right before a fun ride.

565
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,180
This Adam was your Jason.

566
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,880
Some people some people can't handle it.

567
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,820
I am sure I could have had a Brownie and a big Coke and been fine.

568
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,320
I could have had it on the ride while we were going.

569
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,880
So I don't know what his problem.

570
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,880
Yeah, that sounds like my idea of heaven.

571
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,680
We were talking about heaven earlier.

572
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,100
Brownie Coke Tilt-A-Whirl.

573
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:07,560
Nice.

574
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,860
Your heaven is an infinite Tilt-A-Whirl.

575
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,580
Never stops when you die.

576
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,620
You're just on it.

577
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,360
And ladies, please don't bother me.

578
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,500
I'm enjoying a ride.

579
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,500
I'll be off in three minutes and then we can engage.

580
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,320
But the theme song, the Happy Days is playing loudly

581
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,860
while the Tilt-A-Whirl is happening.

582
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,460
Of course.

583
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,080
Distortively.

584
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,320
And Ponzi's giving me a thumbs up and he's got the windbreaker on,

585
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,200
not the leather jacket.

586
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,900
For season Ponzi's there.

587
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,880
OK, all right.

588
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,160
But if it's a carnival, it's probably a knockoff.

589
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:36,880
Greaser.

590
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,600
Oh, yeah.

591
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,980
His name is Greaser Guy.

592
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:39,800
That's true.

593
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,880
Well, Jason specifically wanted the non-iconic Ponzi.

594
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:43,800
Yeah.

595
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,780
That is a weird request.

596
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,960
People don't remember.

597
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,360
Ponzi didn't start with a leather jacket, of course.

598
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:50,980
It's like wanting a…

599
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,900
I got a painting of Kramer.

600
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,740
That one note, kind of before the hair went up.

601
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,640
And when he just entered a door normally.

602
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,020
Yeah.

603
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,580
If looking kind of frazzled.

604
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,620
He opens the door slowly and goes, hello.

605
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,040
Yeah.

606
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:04,840
Hello, Jerry.

607
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,120
Jerry, are you home?

608
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,220
OK, so anyway, in this functional…

609
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,600
OK, so this ride starts to become known.

610
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,920
This type of ride becomes known as the Tunnel of Love.

611
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:21,980
And this old mill in Kennywood, that's called out as an example of it.

612
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,800
Though it was never called the Tunnel of Love.

613
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,620
That fully was called the old mill.

614
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,140
Here's an anecdote that's in that article,

615
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,080
I think also in the Funkland video about that ride.

616
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,260
But we're saying here that this type of ride,

617
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,400
people get up to some business on this thing.

618
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,480
How are we going to stop that?

619
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,540
Maybe camera technology wasn't what they needed it to be at that time.

620
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,700
with plastic bats and told them to whack any bare buttocks

621
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,460
that were visible in the boats.

622
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,560
Yeah, I was trying to figure out the mechanics of that.

623
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,780
Like, so you're…

624
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,780
You've got to reach in.

625
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,340
You're getting…

626
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,860
The bat, I understand, but I'm imagining the couple.

627
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,760
I'm like, wait, so…

628
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,660
Huh, OK.

629
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,840
If one is turned around and straddling the other,

630
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,240
or forgive the hoarseness, it's second gate.

631
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,360
If one is getting a standing up blowjob.

632
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,760
So what, you're standing up on the boat?

633
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,580
One partner is sitting and the other has stood up.

634
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,400
Let us assume…

635
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,120
The barest buttocks that are the most like,

636
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,700
right there to be smacked by a plastic bat.

637
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,500
Let us assume the style of the dog and…

638
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,160
My darling.

639
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,260
Too doggy?

640
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,100
Hey!

641
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,340
A rocky, by the way, boat.

642
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,520
Partly, I think why these took a little while were just like,

643
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:02,520
well, the length of this ride is dependent on the speed of the water pushing the boats.

644
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:07,120
And every time they launch a new boat, it'll give you a little oomph.

645
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,580
I hate to even bring…

646
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,460
I hate to even say this.

647
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,600
No, no, no, this is the time.

648
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,040
It's an amorous episode.

649
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,360
What if you're into like, bat play?

650
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,400
What if you're into…

651
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,660
Exactly where I was heading.

652
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,300
Yeah, what if…

653
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,420
If you have a particular thing and you've heard that there's something…

654
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,520
You live in Pennsylvania and you've heard that there is a place where if you…

655
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,160
All you have to do is bare your bare buttocks and a man will,

656
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,720
free of charge, other than cost of admission, hit you with a plastic bat.

657
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,480
Oh no!

658
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,340
What are you doing?

659
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,600
Don't hit me!

660
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,820
I paid for this ride fair and square.

661
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,580
I did not want to get hit by that plastic bat.

662
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:54,340
That is something that Wall Street guys pay 10 grand for on the weekends.

663
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,680
That's not a joke.

664
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,620
That's what happens.

665
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,480
You could go get it from an anonymous stranger.

666
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,720
An underpaid teenager.

667
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,160
Right.

668
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,360
You could even not have a woman or a man with you in the boat.

669
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,520
Absolutely.

670
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,180
You could just be…

671
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,280
Pull your pants down.

672
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:10,880
You just get out.

673
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,260
You start doing…

674
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,440
You get naked and start doing push-ups in that boat.

675
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,700
And then by surprise, you try to not memorize the parts so that it still comes as a surprise.

676
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:24,020
And then at some point, hopefully in success, you got a bat hitting your butt.

677
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:29,920
Yeah, or you just drop your pants and start wiggling it around while you're on the boat.

678
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,120
Wiggle, wiggle.

679
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,680
I hope nobody hits me.

680
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,200
Again, not the most stable platform.

681
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,900
I hope I don't fall in the water after I've been hit on the bottom.

682
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,220
Some of the risk of it.

683
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:44,420
The only concern would be that you were standing up and you were erect and you would fall over.

684
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,000
Because that could be a problem.

685
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,720
That's the only concern I can see from the situation.

686
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,320
So you got to be careful in that regard.

687
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,860
Your balance is all thrown off.

688
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:54,800
All your blood rush.

689
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:58,470
Well, that's true too, because that could really weight you down or you don't know,

690
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,340
depending on the weight of it.

691
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,320
I apologize again.

692
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,420
They factor that into the…

693
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,060
Because there's weight limits on these.

694
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,200
But have they factored in that…

695
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,620
I guess you don't weigh more.

696
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,300
Well, I don't know.

697
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,420
They say that when you die, there's an amount of weight that leaves your body.

698
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,700
So I don't know if there's some sort of

699
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,380
mythical amount of weight that goes into your body when you are aroused.

700
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:22,960
I'm not sure.

701
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,640
Well, you know, you sense sometimes, depending on who's on what side of a boat on a boat,

702
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,960
sometimes it can kind of be tipped in one way or the other.

703
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:35,380
I wonder if they factored into this the possibility of somebody getting an erection,

704
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,440
thus the weight being distributed differently.

705
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,140
I guess the boat tip with the right boner.

706
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,120
In the old days, they…

707
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:41,980
No.

708
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,540
They were not prepared for it.

709
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:47,140
But these days, if there was a new tunnel of construction, they have no choice.

710
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,400
Computers these days would have to calculate that.

711
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,840
They would have to understand that that was a possible…

712
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,540
Before they have to do with slide rules and spreadsheets.

713
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,880
He had to do it old-fashioned way.

714
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,640
Yeah, yeah.

715
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,640
He had to change on the fly.

716
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,760
They just threw me into the water.

717
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,000
I'd never…

718
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:11,720
I didn't go to school for physics and I had no idea how to calculate for a boner.

719
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,800
Learning trigonometry to count.

720
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,160
What happens through an erection on a boat?

721
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:20,140
Oh, this…

722
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,920
Oh, Kenny Wood, this is terrible.

723
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,560
I'm not going on this ride ever again.

724
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,580
I didn't come here to be whacked on my buttocks.

725
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,580
This is crazy.

726
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,940
This idea to stop people from being amorous on the way…

727
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:35,560
Hey, come on out!

728
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,020
You would hit them with a bat?

729
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:37,860
That's the only way.

730
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,220
Certainly you couldn't go, hey.

731
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,880
You can't just say, stop it.

732
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,920
I can see you.

733
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,700
We're gonna do…

734
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,040
You gotta…

735
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,040
It's gotta be a physical…

736
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,280
And this is a time…

737
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,400
I guess, like, this is a time where…

738
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:55,520
You know, look, Inside the Magic is a website and a Twitter account that exists to make it seem like

739
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,920
things like this are happening at Disneyland 12 times a day.

740
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,080
They frame any little thing as if a customer smacked on bare buttocks on boat ride.

741
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:10,100
And then you look into it and like, I don't know, like a fly landed on their butt,

742
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,520
which counts as a smack.

743
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,820
Man had her actor terrorizing guests doing the knockout game.

744
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,780
What is the knockout game?

745
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:27,640
Oh, the knockout game was a thing like 10 years ago that people were gassed up about

746
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,860
the right-wing lunatics stuff.

747
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:36,820
Like, if you go into the city, there will be gangs of youth and they will be betting that like,

748
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,500
all right, go knock that guy out.

749
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,160
Like…

750
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,500
So it'd be like you would just be walking along the street and someone would run up

751
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,800
and try to knock you out quickly and somebody would be filming it.

752
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,680
Yes, right, Jason?

753
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,140
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

754
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,340
I always feel like it's adjacent to bum fights or something like a weird…

755
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,500
Something like that.

756
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,280
I don't know, like a CD is the word.

757
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,420
But like, like, unpleasant video trend.

758
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

759
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,840
Yes, but like if the…

760
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:07,700
Yeah, in reality, then you click on it and the mad hatter like slightly tripped a tiny bit.

761
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,800
Apologized profusely.

762
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,620
Kind of like scuffed the hair of a child and like, yeah, he pantomimed how sorry he was.

763
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,340
And then of course that article also gives you like,

764
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,960
theme parks a bit of tradition in this country for many years.

765
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,560
Six paragraphs of it.

766
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:28,900
Walt Disney, why he came to California with a dream.

767
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,280
You get the history of everything.

768
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,640
It goes back to the Big Bang before they could tell you

769
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,740
what this clickbait is actually about.

770
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,020
Now, speaking of Walt Disney, is that…

771
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,460
Is it possible?

772
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,760
Like he always was like, oh, carnivals are so dirty and nasty.

773
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,960
Like, did he get ripped off on a carnival game once?

774
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,780
And then someone told him a story about the bare bottom bats.

775
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,940
I was going to say, did he get hit on his bare bottom once?

776
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:54,740
Oh, maybe.

777
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,280
Yeah, I don't know that he was doing anything.

778
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,300
Hopefully he wasn't doing anything on too hard.

779
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,920
But maybe they accidentally thought his pants were down

780
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,520
and they hit him on his bare bottom.

781
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,180
Well, his dream, per the carousel story,

782
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,140
is a place where the whole family can have fun together.

783
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,420
But maybe his dream before he had a family was

784
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,100
a place where you can make a family together.

785
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,740
A boat ride with privacy so your wife and you can

786
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,880
flush out your family ranks.

787
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,620
Do you think that woman who worked on his polo injury every day

788
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,700
had a bat and would use it on his bare bottom?

789
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,600
All right, Walt, you want to play Kenny Wood?

790
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,220
I think yes.

791
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,340
I think the answer is yes.

792
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,460
OK, but so that's an example.

793
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:45,640
But again, this is all accidental, the notion that these are tunnels of love.

794
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:45,980
Right.

795
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,360
Until the Park Palisades Park in New Jersey, just like, all right, well,

796
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,420
let's just get up for it.

797
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,520
Let's do a clickbait of a title, shall we?

798
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,240
Let's call it the Tunnel of Love.

799
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,760
And as far as I know, that might be the first one called Tunnel.

800
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,220
That was actually called Tunnel of Love.

801
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,940
Let's just appeal to this instinct in the audience.

802
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,960
This is maybe a place where people, but again, and then I think there's one

803
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,260
in Coney Island in Luna Park that they call Tunnels of Love, multiple.

804
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,800
But none of these are still what I'm after.

805
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:25,020
None of them are like the big Cupid festival because a lot of them have monsters and stalactites.

806
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,160
And it's not what I want.

807
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,940
I want the like what was shown to me in a 40s comic strip.

808
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:37,240
Well, that I there is one that online gets posted a lot as like the original Tunnel of Love.

809
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:41,460
And it's had the Minnesota State Fair and it's called Ye Old Mill.

810
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,080
So not exactly romantic.

811
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,000
It is still operational.

812
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,300
I think the same family ran it for decades.

813
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:54,600
And then finally, in recent years, did sell it to the fair.

814
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,500
But it is funny to watch because there are dark stretches, but then they'll be like

815
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,340
a scene in a display window with trolls.

816
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,660
A lot of times it's trolls.

817
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,540
A lot of times.

818
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:13,980
And I, my dad, I was, I mentioned, look, reading stuff about this and he's like,

819
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:20,880
I think there was one at Dorney Park, which is the eponymous mill shoot for many years

820
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,160
called Mill Shoot.

821
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:29,280
And then in the 50s or 60s, it flipped to Journey to the Center of the Earth.

822
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,760
And kind of, you know, originally a lot of scenes from the book, big monsters.

823
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,840
Then at some point it got a facelift and was a little more whimsical.

824
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:48,200
And then I think closed in 1992 around the time when Cedar Fair bought Dorney Park.

825
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:54,560
There's a great video on this channel called Storybook Amusement, a newer channel that

826
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,440
I like a lot.

827
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,680
But was there, did this Dorney Park one have any cupids or swans?

828
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,340
Right, was it?

829
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:07,740
No, it was like a dark boat ride and then it had a splashdown.

830
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,300
Okay.

831
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,100
A lift hill and a splashdown.

832
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,700
This is what's disappointing to me.

833
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:17,720
I'm never getting to what I want because then I started thinking like, okay, where

834
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,960
are the portrayals of this actually?

835
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,620
And what helped in this search was the website TV Tropes.

836
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:30,220
Tunnel of Love comes up in enough things that it is considered a TV trope.

837
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,740
And let me quote them because they're thinking the same thing we are.

838
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:38,320
This type of ride is rare to find nowadays in any real life amusement park, having started

839
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,440
to go extinct in the 1960s, but it was once very common.

840
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:46,840
Most riders today likely have no familiarity with the ride, but the trope was used in so

841
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:51,300
many pieces of media as a device for creating romantic tension that several generations

842
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,580
have grown up familiar with the idea without ever experiencing one in person.

843
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,580
It does feel like one of those things that like somebody, it was done on one of the first

844
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,300
sitcoms in the 50s.

845
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,600
Right.

846
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,320
And then when it was, by the time it's done in the 80s, that's just referencing the,

847
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:10,260
that's just a rider who grew up on sitcoms and there was never this.

848
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,560
I have another thing like this that I have a theory about.

849
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,320
I included this in Saturday Morning All Star Hits, the show I did with Kyle Mooney.

850
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,060
The notion of the bachelor auction.

851
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,500
This is something in almost every sitcom.

852
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,820
That like, and then, and, uh, you gotta, you gotta be in the big bachelor auction, right?

853
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,700
And then maybe that it's tense because that splits up a couple or it allows the like crazy

854
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,100
weird girl to bid on the hunk.

855
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:35,520
Yeah.

856
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,900
And now they're together and they wouldn't be other than.

857
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,800
I, I feel like I've seen that on Lucy and Modern Family.

858
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:43,700
Yes.

859
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,300
I have an old spectrum.

860
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,280
I could, that could be wrong.

861
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,680
Every single, every TGIF, every save by the bell.

862
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:56,020
Now listeners count up how many bachelor auctions you've participated in, bid in,

863
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,680
uh, and, and attended.

864
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:03,520
Let's all imagine the bevy of bachelor auctions that have, uh, it's, it's, you know,

865
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,660
it's left there every weekend.

866
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:08,240
I'm weighing which of the many bachelor auctions in town I'm going to go to.

867
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,680
We are always invited to the theme park media bachelor auctions.

868
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,060
It's the three of us, Jim Hill and Testa.

869
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,120
And, and everyone bids on.

870
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,460
Coming out fresh baked Disney.

871
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,160
Ooh, oh, yes.

872
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,620
He's got a new cat on and everyone's.

873
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,560
Oh, a red and pink cabbie hat.

874
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,460
That's right.

875
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,000
It's different every, yeah.

876
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,480
So we were always being asked.

877
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,040
$50,000.

878
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,860
We're always being asked to help.

879
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,560
There's young upstart Braden.

880
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,420
Look at him from Mickey Speaks.

881
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,140
I forget what it was.

882
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:38,620
That's right.

883
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,520
You said there's a new guy.

884
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,420
I like Braden.

885
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,240
I like Braden.

886
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,480
People were saying Braden is bad opinions and I I'll be honest.

887
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,360
I was, I did not look into it.

888
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,700
And I'm not too many too busy to look into.

889
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,540
How plugged in can you be?

890
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,700
Some of his opinions.

891
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:52,940
Yeah.

892
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,460
But how much do you think Braden would fetch a bachelor at the theme park media bachelor?

893
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,880
He seems to be younger than all the other guys I just mentioned.

894
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,000
So I may be more.

895
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,480
I don't know.

896
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,400
The median age of the male theme park journalist is.

897
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,200
The young upstarts in our late thirties.

898
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,580
We're the young guns at this point.

899
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,220
Yeah.

900
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:18,620
Not enough sitcoms and stuff use actual community events that I have seen and gone to a number

901
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,460
of times in my life.

902
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,700
Pancake breakfast and spaghetti dinners.

903
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:23,600
Whoa.

904
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,080
How many spaghetti dinners?

905
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,800
I have more pancake breakfast.

906
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:28,540
Okay.

907
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:28,840
All right.

908
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,340
Cause I do know what that is.

909
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:34,020
I remember that from being a kid, but I do not remember spaghetti dinners.

910
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,960
And that was something you go to like at a school or a community center.

911
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,360
Yeah.

912
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,760
It would be like a fundraiser because it's

913
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,800
Or like chicken.

914
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,000
There's a version of it.

915
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,380
I think popular in upstate New York.

916
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,020
There's like.

917
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,720
Chicken desserts for one night a year.

918
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,460
You mix it up.

919
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,240
Chicken pot pie.

920
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,000
You get like a styrofoam container at spaghetti dinners.

921
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,820
You get a plate of spaghetti and salad and a slice of pie or whatever.

922
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:02,320
And it's like five bucks because you can make that in giant bulk quantities.

923
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,760
And it costs like nothing.

924
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,760
in your pockets so you can keep getting in line over and over.

925
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,380
You can buy as many spaghetti dinners as you want.

926
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:14,780
Yeah.

927
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,320
Well, you can wrap your body in spaghetti if you have a big coat on.

928
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:18,620
Sure.

929
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,200
And no one will notice.

930
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,340
So just wrap your.

931
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,960
Oh, that's, no, that's very efficient.

932
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,100
Just line yourself.

933
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:23,920
With spaghetti.

934
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:24,340
Yeah.

935
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,580
Just string up each hack, string up each noodle.

936
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:32,100
So when you take your big coat off and you get home, you have a big spaghetti suit on basically.

937
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:36,820
Just get out of your, just, just have a kiddie pool ready on the floor when you

938
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,880
get back to your living room.

939
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,260
Yeah.

940
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:38,440
Yeah.

941
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:38,680
Yeah.

942
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,000
Let me ask you this.

943
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:49,400
Cause one thing that people at various jobs in the past, I would see this and I would get so confused.

944
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:55,400
If you were bringing leftover spaghetti and sauce to work for lunch.

945
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,260
Go ahead.

946
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,240
What would you put it in?

947
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:59,560
What would I put?

948
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,140
Like Tupperware, right?

949
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:01,660
Like Gladware?

950
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,140
Put it in?

951
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:07,680
I saw multiple people over the years bring a Ziploc bag of spaghetti and sauce.

952
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,180
I'd be like, that is very confusing to me.

953
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,780
I guess you could store, I mean, you do store things in Ziplocs, I guess.

954
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,080
I mean.

955
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:18,800
It's a little weird.

956
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:25,260
That puts the onus on the workplace to have a bowl, a big bowl to be able to, and maybe a

957
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,640
little cereal bowl is not going to do it.

958
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,240
We always had bowls and plates at the places.

959
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,640
So I think, yeah, you're working on the assumption that the kitchen will be stocked.

960
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:37,660
It makes it seem grosser, but technically it's really no different than just having

961
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,180
a Tupperware.

962
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:38,560
Right?

963
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,780
Yeah, that's what I was.

964
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,620
But it's not really.

965
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,500
It's not.

966
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,580
It just looks worse.

967
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:48,000
It looks weird, but there's no real like the separation between the plastic.

968
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:48,900
Different is happening.

969
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:49,500
Yeah.

970
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,700
It just looks worse.

971
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,780
Just don't put the bag in the microwave.

972
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:54,240
That's all.

973
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:54,900
Don't put the, yeah.

974
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,060
Do not microwave the bag.

975
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:56,480
Okay.

976
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,440
So yeah, I don't know.

977
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,680
So you want bag sauce?

978
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,720
Have I ever seen a bag of loose spaghetti and sauce?

979
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:03,960
Probably.

980
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,460
Check the Forever Dog fridge.

981
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,120
But it didn't make an impression on me like it did Jason.

982
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,980
Or I think you're haunted perhaps.

983
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,700
If you were with your sweetheart and you saw a bag of loose spaghetti and sauce,

984
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,200
you would go right into her arms out of fear.

985
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,020
Yeah, yeah, I would.

986
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,280
That's your jump scare.

987
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,200
That's what I mean.

988
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:23,900
Exactly.

989
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:25,200
Okay.

990
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,580
So here's my point.

991
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:31,220
Before we get into like real, may possibly real examples of this thing,

992
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,920
I started to think like, well, with the help of TV tropes,

993
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,320
where did this actually come from?

994
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,320
Where did I see this in anything?

995
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,880
And just to shout out a couple, it seems like a lot of cartoons,

996
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:47,700
more recent cartoons, Rugrats, Hey Arnold, Captain Planet apparently had a ton of love

997
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,320
at some point.

998
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,620
I think it might really go back to, as a lot of things do,

999
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,480
so much is defined by like the early Disney and Warner Brothers.

1000
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:00,240
And of course, Pepe Le Pew's going into some tunnels of love.

1001
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:00,940
You know that.

1002
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,980
And then one I remember very clearly,

1003
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,500
uh, it's called Donald Double Trouble.

1004
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:12,120
It's a Donald and Daisy short in which she is nagging him so much that the

1005
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,580
nagging becomes abstract.

1006
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:20,960
And it's just like, and he's got a winter over, but Donald is so annoying and abrasive.

1007
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,460
And then on the street, he bumps into an exact double of himself.

1008
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,820
He's like, oh yes, all right, be there at six.

1009
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:33,860
And then he gets it like, well, what if I can temporarily use this guy to date

1010
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:34,340
Daisy?

1011
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:38,600
I will introduce a third.

1012
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:45,620
Self-quack?

1013
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:52,080
So I will duck-cuck to, in order to get the ball rolling again, but then I will roll right in

1014
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,560
and Daisy, who is dumb, will not know the difference.

1015
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,120
Right, right.

1016
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,460
But it goes too far because this new Donald is so hot.

1017
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,020
Well, he's better than regular Donald.

1018
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:01,880
Great voice.

1019
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,660
And this all culminates in a tunnel of love.

1020
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:08,920
Here is, this is a point of view of Donald seeing like, how could this have gone so far?

1021
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,320
This is false Donald you're looking at right here.

1022
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:11,640
Right.

1023
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,420
Buying a 25 cent ticket to the tunnel of love.

1024
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,860
It says, bring your sweethearts on it.

1025
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,600
And it goes into like a big cave, which is very, I do think Coney Island is a big,

1026
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,860
because the Coney Island one was like a big fake rock cave.

1027
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:24,400
Right, right.

1028
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,280
So I think that defined what this is for a lot of people.

1029
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:32,220
And this is also, this is very scandalous because this goes against Donald's race specific

1030
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:32,860
instructions.

1031
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:37,200
Not double underlined, the tunnel of love double underlined.

1032
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,040
Anything but that signed Don.

1033
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,460
Casual Donald is just Don Duck.

1034
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,220
I never think of him as Don Duck.

1035
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:49,160
If you see him in the park, say Don.

1036
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,600
This short, like this and Mr.

1037
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,740
Duck, just side note, Mr.

1038
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:58,780
Duck steps out.

1039
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,120
Like these, I really enjoy these old shorts.

1040
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,980
Yeah, they really got cookin'.

1041
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:08,180
I think, you know, they get, look, Steamboat Willie can, that can stay in public domain.

1042
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,640
They really picked up steam.

1043
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,240
I think the best Disney stuff might be 40s, 50s.

1044
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,880
Because that's when you get like that now Chip and Dale are in the picture.

1045
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:21,060
It took them a long time, I think, for the Simpsons fully fleshed out secondary cast.

1046
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:21,560
Yeah, sure.

1047
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,680
To really be cookin'.

1048
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,360
I think you get that in the, and of course the goofy sports cartoons and all that.

1049
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,840
Yeah, but Donald, yeah, Donald in like his little suit and his straw hat and stuff.

1050
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:32,360
Yeah.

1051
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:40,960
So that's one, a lot, what often happens in these is that, you know, they don't show you.

1052
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,400
It's like kids, we're not gonna take you under the tunnel.

1053
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,100
We can't show you what's in there.

1054
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,100
Which is why I still don't understand.

1055
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,640
I'm like, what was in a tunnel of love?

1056
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,460
They wouldn't show us.

1057
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:54,460
And what usually happens in both Pepe Le Pew and several Disney cartoons,

1058
00:48:55,220 --> 00:49:00,100
and the Archie gang, this happened to Archie and Betty and Veronica where it's so dark in there.

1059
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:01,060
Oh yeah.

1060
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:02,680
You start smoochin' and not as a panel.

1061
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:03,660
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1062
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,360
You don't even know who you were smoochin'.

1063
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:05,860
Yes.

1064
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,180
Yeah, you wanna read that?

1065
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,760
Archie, whew, I love the taste of your new lipstick, Veronica.

1066
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,740
Veronica, Archie, I'm not wearing any lipstick.

1067
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:22,240
And then in the back row, because some of these ride vehicles did have multiple rows,

1068
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,800
there is just like a very amorous Betty.

1069
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:31,980
Yeah, so he was, I don't know how he didn't know that he was leaning over to the other row.

1070
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,380
And what was Veronica doing the whole time?

1071
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,120
Yeah, right.

1072
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,020
Just sitting and enjoying, just like having a moment of peace, Veronica's all right.

1073
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,680
She's like me, she's watching the show scenes.

1074
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,460
Right, but if it was not dark then.

1075
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:44,900
Good craftsmanship on that troll.

1076
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:48,040
But if it wasn't dark, how would she not, you know what I mean?

1077
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,300
It would have to be pitch black for her not to notice what was happening.

1078
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,360
Yeah, then what she, yeah, you're right.

1079
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,600
That's the only way this works is pitch black, so what is she doing?

1080
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,740
That's why I think just like, maybe taking a nap.

1081
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,380
Betty is like over, like her foot is in the water.

1082
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,000
Yeah.

1083
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:07,300
Jason, you recently said that you didn't realize on apps that people were maybe dating more than one person at a time.

1084
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:12,140
How do you feel now in hindsight though about Archie seemingly dating Betty and Veronica

1085
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,520
at the same time for decades?

1086
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:20,200
Well, you know, I follow at least one or two Instagram accounts that are just out of context panels from Archie,

1087
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,920
and that is a bawdy comic going back many decades.

1088
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,020
Oh, sure, of course.

1089
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:28,940
I'm just saying though, so you sort of chalked it up to almost like a smut-like amount,

1090
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,900
like a smut-ish comic versus a normal real life situation.

1091
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,960
I think this is a review.

1092
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:41,140
We never finish Riverdale, but I think towards the end of Riverdale,

1093
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:50,320
there is like, you know, some mention of like, oh, Archie and Jughead and Betty and Veronica are in a polycule.

1094
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,600
Oh, Jughead's not involved?

1095
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,820
Oh, in the show, in the show.

1096
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,420
Yeah, because Jughead's a hunk in the show.

1097
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:01,680
Right, Jughead in the comics, I think kind of asexual, even though-

1098
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:06,480
Yeah, mostly sexually attracted to hamburgers and like big chocolate malts.

1099
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,580
Even though he is, Ethel is his girlfriend in the comics, I believe.

1100
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:12,560
I think.

1101
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,360
Midge is with Big Moose?

1102
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,020
No, Midge is with Moose.

1103
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,200
Scott, do you have a read Archie?

1104
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,940
Did you ever read Archie?

1105
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:22,860
It's one of those things, we bump into this a lot, where you guys have the shared reference,

1106
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:26,040
of course, Midge is with Big Moose.

1107
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,720
I have never heard these names.

1108
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:29,320
Dilton Doily, ever heard of him?

1109
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:30,140
The nerd?

1110
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,560
Dilton is a menace in Riverdale.

1111
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:37,400
I have not watched Riverdale, it's not because they're blasphemous with the mythology or anything.

1112
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,380
I'm not that upset about it.

1113
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:42,100
Multiple cult storylines, I feel like.

1114
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,060
They're trying stuff, they want to keep their brand alive, I get it.

1115
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,300
They're serial killers.

1116
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:51,720
Yeah, that's not what I grew up with as far as the wholesome nature of these Archie comics.

1117
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,700
You want malts.

1118
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:57,460
They cheated on malts by not making the show entirely about malts.

1119
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,740
Pops Chocolate Shop, of course.

1120
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:02,720
Pops is pretty good in Riverdale.

1121
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,160
In the show Riverdale.

1122
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,100
In the show Riverdale, Josie and the Pussycats sing the Khalees song,

1123
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:11,120
Meltshake on top of Pops at one point, that's pretty funny.

1124
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,120
I can't be mad at that.

1125
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:18,800
I just wanted to say, when you read that, did you just say, oh this is fantasy,

1126
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:24,020
there never would be a man dating two women at once, or three when Cheryl Blossom came along.

1127
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,240
Yes, fantasy.

1128
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:33,220
Comics, you get to live out, what if I could fly, what if I could date a blonde end of black haired woman.

1129
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:37,520
Can I ask, were you more interested in Betty or Veronica?

1130
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,140
That's a great question.

1131
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,720
I think Betty.

1132
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,360
I would have said Betty when I was younger, but now that I'm older I think I would say Veronica.

1133
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,240
Yeah, I think I would say Veronica now.

1134
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:48,480
I don't know why.

1135
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,280
Betty's kind of the girl next door, Veronica's a little posh, you know.

1136
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,660
A little posh?

1137
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:54,140
Are you kidding me?

1138
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:54,640
Well, daddy.

1139
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,300
Of course, Mr.

1140
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:00,540
Lodge is of course there and he's always upset with her, but her dating Archie,

1141
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,300
but yeah, I don't know why that is.

1142
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,200
I don't know why I've switched now to Veronica my old age.

1143
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,320
Scott's laughing, do you have an opinion?

1144
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,460
I'm looking, I'm trying to make, I think I'm Veronica.

1145
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:13,240
I'm Veronica.

1146
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,560
Okay, maybe it's just dark hair, I don't know.

1147
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:16,960
Sure.

1148
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,140
I don't know, Lindsay's got dark hair, I don't know, maybe that's what it is.

1149
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:23,900
Or it's just that Veronica's very rich and I'd be like, oh man, we could have a big house.

1150
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:30,500
That, they, the Ed Brubaker, Sean Phillips comic criminal did the storyline,

1151
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:35,300
Last of the Innocents where different scenes were done in different comic styles.

1152
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:41,120
And Archie is, essentially the Archie stand-in is married to Veronica and he's very depressed.

1153
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,820
He's very rich, but he's very depressed.

1154
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:44,680
She's mean to him.

1155
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:48,620
And he goes back to the hometown and he falls back in love with Betty.

1156
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:49,720
Sure, sure.

1157
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:51,340
Well, that's probably, yeah.

1158
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:57,200
I mean, it depends, it depends who's writing the strip or the comic to how mean Veronica is.

1159
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:00,360
But sometimes she's not that mean, so maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

1160
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,960
Can I choose Redhead Pussycat instead?

1161
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,040
Oh yeah, okay.

1162
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:05,980
Can I veer off?

1163
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:06,600
You can put her in there, yeah.

1164
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,340
What's her name?

1165
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,140
Well, is that Cheryl Blossom or is that someone else?

1166
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,740
No, not in the Pussycats, I forget the names of the Pussycats, I apologize.

1167
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:13,380
Yeah, me too.

1168
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:15,920
Look at, look at, there's three of them.

1169
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,700
Fun movie.

1170
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:17,540
Fun movie.

1171
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,180
I feel like people look back very fondly on that movie.

1172
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:22,700
You don't want Midge or Ethel?

1173
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,340
Big Ethel?

1174
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:29,660
I believe, I think Josie is the, that's the name we're looking for is Josie.

1175
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,280
Okay.

1176
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:31,480
I didn't know that.

1177
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:32,420
They were not, I did not read that comic.

1178
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,980
There's been a lot of interpretations over the years.

1179
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:40,980
Yeah, Ethel Muggs is the name of the character Jason and I were just talking about, just in

1180
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,360
case you needed to know her last name.

1181
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,240
Midge was always drawn as very cute.

1182
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:46,460
Sure, nothing wrong with Midge.

1183
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:55,980
All right, so, you know, one, just one other iteration of this.

1184
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:03,040
There is a tunnel of love referenced in the, the famous Dick Van Dyke episode of Scooby

1185
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:03,400
Doo.

1186
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:04,800
Oh, interesting.

1187
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,980
You don't see it in which Dick Van Dyke is running a carnival and doing all of the jobs,

1188
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,680
but they, spoiler, the gang ends up inheriting the carnival from Dick Van Dyke, which seems

1189
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,200
like a burden to them more than anything.

1190
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:17,620
Yeah, really.

1191
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,120
But they refer that, what's your name?

1192
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,120
Speaking of other attractive cartoon characters, not Velma.

1193
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:24,640
Daphne.

1194
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,200
Daphne.

1195
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,740
She's going to be in charge of the tunnel of love.

1196
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:34,020
And then Velma says, and maybe somebody will take me on a ride on it.

1197
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:37,520
It provokes a fan moment.

1198
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,420
I was always a Velma kid for sure.

1199
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1200
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,580
Of course.

1201
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:41,360
That was no question.

1202
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:49,780
But anyways, all of the, if it exists in all these forms, if the cartoons of the 40s through

1203
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:54,720
the 60s are rife with this premise, they must have existed somewhere, right?

1204
00:55:55,640 --> 00:56:01,180
So I have a couple examples of what I think may have been actual tunnels of love that

1205
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:03,320
are in this mold that we want.

1206
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:08,180
One is in somewhere called Riverview Park, Chicago.

1207
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,940
You ever heard of this?

1208
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,600
I think this was gone before.

1209
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,340
I looked at it, yeah.

1210
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:13,700
Before our time.

1211
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,200
But got a couple photos here.

1212
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,360
Look, like I said, a big scroll.

1213
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,200
A scroll, it says tunnel of love.

1214
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,340
And then there's a bunch of flowers.

1215
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:29,180
And this couple is going through a big, really cheap look in a heart.

1216
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,980
And they're looking at each other fondly.

1217
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,780
And they have privacy other than the camera.

1218
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,540
It's just the two of them.

1219
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:41,440
So maybe this one Chicago park actually was this.

1220
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,320
This seems pretty what we're talking about.

1221
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,960
And clearly a lot of opportunity for amorousness.

1222
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:51,860
Because the only other photo I could find, no one documented any of these.

1223
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:52,900
Maybe because of the darkness.

1224
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:54,840
But look at this.

1225
00:56:55,360 --> 00:57:03,780
A boat with three rows all with sailors or other types of armed forces all making out with their gals.

1226
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:05,040
Jason, it's Fleet Week.

1227
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,580
At ease, boys.

1228
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,040
Yeah, mind your business.

1229
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:11,700
Mind your business.

1230
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:12,640
Stay in your row.

1231
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,480
Don't worry what's going on in other rows.

1232
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:21,400
This is what I'm like, the only way that this tunnel of love thing is viable is if you were by yourself.

1233
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,720
Because there's no way, no offense, guys.

1234
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,860
I don't want to get in a boat ride with three rows.

1235
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:30,440
And we all make out with our gals together.

1236
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:31,040
I agree with you.

1237
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,680
But that is not necessarily how everyone feels.

1238
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,460
As far as needing complete privacy to do things like that.

1239
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:42,600
This is another trope in TV and movies where with cars.

1240
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,420
There's two couples.

1241
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:45,900
Yes, in a car.

1242
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:52,080
Front row, one couple gets the front bench seat and the one couple gets the back bench seat.

1243
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:52,700
Right, right.

1244
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,720
Never this.

1245
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:55,700
Madness.

1246
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:57,980
How good of friends do you have to be?

1247
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:59,360
Or maybe not good of friends.

1248
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,160
Maybe you got to barely know the people.

1249
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,900
If I'm like kind of friends with anybody in the back.

1250
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:08,040
This is the whole thing with people if they go to like an orgy party where you're go, I don't understand.

1251
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,720
An orgy party, Michael.

1252
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:11,580
Orgy gathering.

1253
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,060
They go to one of those orgy parties.

1254
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,620
They go to one of those orgies.

1255
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,100
Those orgy celebrations.

1256
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:25,560
You know, the one thing I saw mentioned is like one of the downfalls tunnels of love, unshaperooned dates, public displays of affection were more socially accepted.

1257
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,240
Keep rolling.

1258
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,660
You gave us a little shaperoon.

1259
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,780
It sounds like macaroon.

1260
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:33,900
Sorry, sorry.

1261
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:39,740
The other thing I'm surprised I didn't see mentioned the rise of car culture.

1262
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:43,880
You know, just more and more cars gives you privacy.

1263
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,800
You've got a private ride out to wherever you want to go.

1264
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,380
But is that also like movies and TV have rotted my brain?

1265
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:52,760
Just thinking about like the scenes in Greece.

1266
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:57,900
Where people are making out and like implied fucking in cars.

1267
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,800
I bet that's real.

1268
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,240
I think that's probably real.

1269
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,340
That I think there is truth to.

1270
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,640
Sorry, that people had sex in cars?

1271
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:10,080
But you're still, I think it's real.

1272
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,980
I think that, you know what, I'm going to go with that.

1273
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,580
I think people did have sex in cars.

1274
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:13,920
Did.

1275
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,420
Yes, did.

1276
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,020
Never.

1277
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,380
Although you know what?

1278
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:19,760
I came home two apartments ago.

1279
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,440
I came home one day.

1280
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,720
I was like midnight or one in the morning from a bar.

1281
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,540
And I parked the car on this, it was kind of a hilly street.

1282
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,260
And I definitely parked and I went, what's that?

1283
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,340
Oh, there's two people having sex right in front of this.

1284
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:34,320
Me and this car.

1285
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:38,560
The windows are fogged up right by the Gelson's, most Felice.

1286
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:39,980
That's a block over really.

1287
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,260
So I was like, wow, it's happening.

1288
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,140
The thing I've only heard about in Greece.

1289
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,520
I guess it is a reality.

1290
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,440
I've done a thing in a car.

1291
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:49,260
Whoa.

1292
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:49,920
Come on.

1293
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:50,740
Get out of here.

1294
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,000
Get out of here, you guys.

1295
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:53,600
Details.

1296
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,520
No, you don't want to know that.

1297
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:00,620
But that's, you get a little, like once or twice, like a little bit, you know?

1298
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:02,340
This was later.

1299
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:05,120
All right, I'm going to go for it with a gross story.

1300
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:05,900
Go for it, yeah.

1301
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,640
Not really, but I don't know.

1302
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:08,980
Okay.

1303
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:16,440
I was, I was over 18, so my parents kind of couldn't really say much anymore.

1304
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:21,740
And there was a scenario where I was heading out and I was going to pick up my girlfriend at that time.

1305
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:27,240
And just, my dad just like caught the back seat and that all the seats were down.

1306
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:34,580
And he's like, oh, you forgot that something, well, he figured out like maybe Scott's going to go do something here.

1307
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:35,900
But here's the other thing.

1308
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,920
Wait, sorry, sorry, was that prior to you leaving?

1309
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:41,040
I still lived at home, but it was kind of at a point.

1310
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,880
He was, it was this parent turning another, turning a blind eye situation.

1311
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:45,640
I see, okay.

1312
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,740
But here's, see, it was just clear what I was heading off to do.

1313
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:50,100
Sure.

1314
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,080
And bust my dad at this moveable case.

1315
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:52,500
What?

1316
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:57,480
He hopes, he hopes.

1317
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,220
Wait a minute, I hate to do this.

1318
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:01,620
Wait, so before you left, you moved the seats down?

1319
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:02,660
Yes.

1320
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:03,900
That's wild.

1321
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:05,460
Or they were just down already.

1322
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,400
That's wild that before you left, you're like, I got to get it ready.

1323
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:09,320
Let's get this done.

1324
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:10,500
Wow, okay.

1325
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:11,800
That is what I was.

1326
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,500
All right.

1327
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,880
Also, there was like, there was a blanket back there.

1328
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,300
So you really prepped before?

1329
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:22,300
I prepped a little zone in my Jeep Grand Cherokee.

1330
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,420
That is so funny.

1331
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:25,040
So it was kind of undeniable.

1332
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:30,140
But here's what was also, I also had not cleaned out the other things in my car.

1333
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:40,740
And as a prop for a little movie I was making at the time, there was a plastic, or not a plastic, I guess a rubber glove back there.

1334
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:46,940
And that was just like a prop for a robot costume is what it was.

1335
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,860
And my dad looked back there with concern.

1336
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,980
I felt very awkward.

1337
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:51,900
What is he going to say?

1338
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,600
And then he takes the glove and he meant it.

1339
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:55,640
He 100% meant it.

1340
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:59,760
He comes back to me with the glove and says, well, don't use this.

1341
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:03,520
Meaning?

1342
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:11,940
My dad thought I was so dumb that I was going to use a rubber glove as a condom.

1343
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:20,540
There is a Maury clip I saw on the internet the other day where it's like, the condom broke so we used a rubber glove.

1344
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:23,400
And I know I'm not the father.

1345
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,480
And he was not.

1346
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:36,360
It's funny you say that because I feel like the sexual health weeks at college, they were always encouraging like latex gloves.

1347
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:37,200
What?

1348
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:38,080
No.

1349
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:39,380
What are you talking about?

1350
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,560
For like health, for like sanitary.

1351
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:43,600
But not for sexual activity.

1352
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:46,680
Not for like, for like your hand.

1353
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:50,840
They were always talking about rubber gloves and dental dams.

1354
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:51,760
Okay, dental dams.

1355
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,420
I've never seen one in the wild.

1356
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:56,940
The dental dams, sure.

1357
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,440
I've heard this plenty of times.

1358
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,400
The worst experience.

1359
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,500
Apologies to Louie.

1360
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,980
We do need to put a warning on this one.

1361
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:04,180
It's like it's a Doughboy's episode or something all of a sudden.

1362
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:04,600
Yeah.

1363
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:13,020
I think they were also trying to be considerate of heterosexual and different homosexual combinations.

1364
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:17,980
But it was the early 2000s and people were pretty clumsy about that, you know.

1365
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:18,860
Uh huh.

1366
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:19,580
Oh God.

1367
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:25,520
Oh, everybody keeps saying things that make me want to ask ten questions, but I know that this is no, we have to be done.

1368
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,160
It's okay.

1369
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,560
We can veer out of here.

1370
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,780
Let's just veer, maybe all of it was a mistake.

1371
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:30,700
Maybe all of it.

1372
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,940
Take me back to the Archie days.

1373
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,280
Is there one question you can't get rid of?

1374
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:37,900
No, I can get rid of all of them I think if I try harder.

1375
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,660
Alright, let's get rid of all of them.

1376
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:40,540
Let's veer out of here.

1377
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:47,720
What I was going to say is that I, okay, so I do think that maybe Riverview Park had a real tunnel of love.

1378
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:51,580
And then I'm like, what's up with Riverview Park other than that though?

1379
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:54,460
Their slogan was, laugh your troubles away.

1380
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:58,720
And then right under, in this article, like, well they went by the fun phrase, laugh your troubles away.

1381
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:04,280
Then right after that, at least 16 patrons died in Riverview Park between 1910 and 1967.

1382
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,820
Most were on roller coasters.

1383
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:08,380
Also, most were due to their own negligence.

1384
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,260
This is not why the park closed.

1385
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:14,920
The reason why the park closed is believed to be due to rising crime and racial tension in the area.

1386
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:15,560
Oh my God.

1387
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,520
Laugh your troubles away at Riverview Park.

1388
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,940
How worth it is this Riverview.

1389
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:29,660
So, alright, I think everybody, so maybe there was a tunnel of love, but everybody got robbed on it and also fell out of it of their own volition.

1390
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,440
Oh my God.

1391
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,540
This is a nightmare.

1392
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:32,420
This one's bad.

1393
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:33,580
Not good.

1394
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:41,040
The thing I learned about early, early days of Dorney Park is that Solomon Dorney opened it up.

1395
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:49,580
And before that it was mostly a fish hatchery and then eventually he opened the trout ponds for guests to fish.

1396
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:51,120
Okay.

1397
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:54,140
They use me a lot more trout ponds than roller coasters.

1398
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,980
Now we're back to what we do here.

1399
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,480
That's what podcast the ride is all about, trout ponds.

1400
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,540
Podcasts about hatcheries.

1401
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:02,140
The simple pleasures.

1402
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:04,200
And dating apps where you're monogamous.

1403
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:05,740
The simple pleasures of life.

1404
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:10,900
They added a roller coaster which at the time was simply called Coaster.

1405
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:11,680
Okay.

1406
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:12,180
That's it.

1407
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:12,900
I don't hate that.

1408
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,520
That's better than some of the long titles we get these days.

1409
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:18,180
The early days of the Philadelphia Toboggan Company.

1410
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:23,540
I'm going to go from coaster to a much more complicated name.

1411
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:34,640
And this is where, again, listeners, if I'm wrong, if you know for a fact that there's something was a tunnel of love in the way that I picture it with swans, the most romantic animal.

1412
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,640
Guys, when I see a swan, I swoon.

1413
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:43,860
Well, the only other animal I swoon when I see is Mimi LaFleur.

1414
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:49,620
So your tunnel of love would be a big Mimi, a giant Mimi LaFleur.

1415
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,300
And then you're with another Mimi LaFleur.

1416
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:55,400
A fox in a military style uniform is really what does it for me.

1417
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,620
At ease, soldier.

1418
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:57,540
At ease, boys.

1419
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:58,600
Okay.

1420
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:04,560
There is in Sweden, there's a park that I don't think we've ever talked about and the park is called Grönaland.

1421
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:11,620
And they have a ride to this day that is I will I'm about to butcher.

1422
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:13,140
Here's my attempt.

1423
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:15,700
Karleksstunneln.

1424
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,200
Karleksstunneln.

1425
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,340
Beautiful language.

1426
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:23,540
Yeah, it's well, yeah, that's sweet.

1427
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:30,300
So this is a ride that it goes up a little hill and you go through a big heart.

1428
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:31,040
This is it.

1429
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:32,060
This is what I'm after.

1430
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:32,960
It looks like a log.

1431
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:36,120
And then there's some look, there's some hearts on the other side.

1432
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:41,000
This is as close as I could find to a tunnel of love that exists in this world today.

1433
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:42,880
You got to go to Sweden for it.

1434
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:46,200
However, then the rest of it is like trolls.

1435
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:50,220
Here you pass by like a weird little bakery.

1436
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:51,100
I don't know.

1437
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:52,920
Well, hold on, Jason says.

1438
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:55,120
Yes, now we're into Jason's zone.

1439
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:59,540
They are making heart shaped items in the bakery.

1440
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:08,840
And then I guess in the world of amorousness, you also pass by like some little troll girl who is kind of in like Venus mode.

1441
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:17,560
Like she's like nude and covering herself, but not enough because one breast is hanging out with visible nipple.

1442
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:19,020
Well, it's sweet.

1443
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:22,900
This gave me some of those daftling vibes.

1444
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:26,640
So there's like a bear bosom path.

1445
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:27,680
It was a book.

1446
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,280
Let me ask question.

1447
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:30,980
Is a bosom the whole thing or is a bosom?

1448
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,120
We don't have time for all your questions.

1449
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:33,440
Sorry.

1450
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:34,140
I'm so sorry.

1451
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:39,660
I don't know because nobody said bosom since bosom buddies went off the air.

1452
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:40,260
All right.

1453
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:41,580
I think it's both.

1454
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,260
Could it be both?

1455
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:44,740
Perhaps this definition.

1456
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:46,760
The two girls use it in a sentence.

1457
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:50,040
The two girls had become bosom friends.

1458
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,300
No one's ever said this.

1459
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,720
Well, that's what Jason and when we met Jason and I became bosom friends.

1460
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,700
We're fast bosom friends.

1461
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:05,060
The other yet another name for these types of rides River Cave.

1462
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:16,320
So like I feel like trolls in so many of these people's minds went to like, well, that seems like a place a troll would be an old mill, a river cave.

1463
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:16,940
You know?

1464
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:17,400
Yeah.

1465
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:18,080
Yeah.

1466
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:19,700
A lot of trolls.

1467
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:20,640
And then, oh, that's right.

1468
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:21,760
I forgot this one also.

1469
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:26,100
This the Swedish one has stressed out miners in it.

1470
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:28,340
There's a party like the knots ride.

1471
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:32,460
There's a bunch of people working furiously and sadly in a mine.

1472
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:34,520
So this is also not romantic.

1473
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:42,320
So I hate to end the episode still having this question, but I just like, what is this pulling for?

1474
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:49,780
I don't think there was ever something that was just a six minute plotless ride without any sort of well, depending.

1475
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:52,660
I was going to say without a climax, but that depends on what you did in the tunnel.

1476
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:59,500
But the ride itself, where it's just like you're because what I'm picturing is kind of Navi River Journey.

1477
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:00,900
It's more about a vibe.

1478
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:08,480
But instead of the the the vibe of Pandora and a war, it is you're just like it's just a meditation on love.

1479
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,960
To me, it sounds like an interesting kind of ride.

1480
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:16,140
And I'm not convinced that what I what I think ever existed on this earth, it doesn't.

1481
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:22,980
I mean, it really seems like maybe what happened was, yeah, you explained like it started out as just it was dark in there.

1482
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:24,320
So people would neck.

1483
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:31,340
And then at that point, it was used in comic strips and comic books and TV and cartoons and stuff.

1484
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:36,720
But then they had to like suggest to the viewer what was happening in case it wasn't clear.

1485
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,840
Oh, it's like it's a shorthand for.

1486
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:40,240
Yeah.

1487
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:40,780
You know what?

1488
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:41,240
Yes.

1489
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:46,880
Maybe it's especially for a cartoon where kids are watching and you don't you could you could use that you go into a car.

1490
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,060
You could use a seven minutes in heaven kind of right.

1491
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:56,520
But maybe a tunnel of love leaves it at that could just be like a nice date that parents are having as the rug as the pickles parents have.

1492
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:08,620
And yes, so that became a shorthand for the viewer to like tell adults what was happening and to kind of give kids the idea of what like was maybe have like just to give them the general vibe of it.

1493
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:10,240
But not be specific.

1494
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:17,920
It does take me when I think about seeing tunnels of love in cartoons or maybe more so not seeing them because you go in and then I don't know what happens in there.

1495
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:21,540
It does remind me of the fog of not understanding what sex was.

1496
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:22,100
Yes.

1497
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:22,420
Yeah.

1498
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:25,720
That is potentially still on all of us to some extent.

1499
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:34,640
But, you know, we're like, you know, you remember having that feeling like before you found out of just like and then I don't know, they go in there.

1500
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,960
And then they just some of that they flop around.

1501
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,360
I don't know what it is.

1502
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,020
Yes.

1503
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,280
And that's how I feel about these tunnels of love.

1504
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:40,860
I don't know.

1505
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,980
It's just abstractly love happens.

1506
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:44,640
Yes.

1507
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:51,560
Because because you're you're no you're you're trying to probably decipher it for so many years and you're being given these vague hints.

1508
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,280
And this just does more confusing things like this just is confusing more than anything else.

1509
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:57,920
Yeah.

1510
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,980
It's like it's a naked Cupid with an arrow.

1511
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:01,920
What is it?

1512
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:09,260
I was trying to decipher what was happening in the dark television scenes while my adolescent peers were all making out with each other.

1513
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,060
They were all doing it.

1514
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:11,640
They were all figuring it out.

1515
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:15,040
And I was like, what is happening with Helga and Arnold?

1516
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:21,240
You know, and to this day, we're still like, but what really happens in the ride?

1517
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:32,540
All I knew was you basically whatever it was, was you come out with lipstick prints on your face like Archie would after he was necking with Betty.

1518
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:33,140
Yes.

1519
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:38,800
That was a visual shorthand because in reality, you probably wouldn't want any lipstick.

1520
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,920
So you could really knock in without, you know, evidence.

1521
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:43,860
That's right.

1522
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:46,300
This is something that's at the core of this.

1523
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:56,960
Maybe why I'm obsessed with this and still pushing this is that like what would it especially in the cases where it's two people who don't like each other and then by the end they've got smooch marks all over each other.

1524
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:59,280
What would happen in there?

1525
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:11,580
And I'm not talking about physically between them because what I mean is something about the decor has to be so romantic that it could make enemies lovers in the in with the flip of a switch.

1526
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:12,320
Yeah.

1527
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:12,980
What is it?

1528
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:14,080
Is it the lattices?

1529
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:24,240
Is it like what could be in this ride that is so romantic that it would flip you all the way pitch black endless possibility?

1530
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,020
I guess so.

1531
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:30,560
Including a timeline where amorousness has taken control of heat.

1532
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:37,340
Jason, what if it was more like a great movie ride situation where you saw some of the greatest romantic scenes of cinema history?

1533
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:40,700
Oh, look, it's the couple from shop around the corner.

1534
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,540
You know, that's right.

1535
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:49,440
If you saw the couple from shop around the corner, Scott, you can't deny that your romance meter.

1536
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:53,520
Although isn't that that's the same remake lineage as you've got mail.

1537
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:53,900
That's right.

1538
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:58,460
So yeah, that'd be if there was a ride where you could see the full rom-com ride.

1539
01:12:58,660 --> 01:12:59,800
That's pretty good.

1540
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:00,820
Yeah, they'd have to.

1541
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:06,800
Well, they'd save some money because they could just make like five Meg Ryan robots and just keep doing different stuff.

1542
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:08,020
Change outfits.

1543
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:08,680
Yeah.

1544
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:09,420
But great.

1545
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:10,460
Great moments.

1546
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:15,040
Wait, with the great the great rom-com ride is what we're talking about.

1547
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:17,100
That would do it.

1548
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:17,840
That would do it.

1549
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:20,460
I mean, that could be an epic universe land unto itself.

1550
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:22,120
I think a full romance land.

1551
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,300
If you would now with what they can do with.

1552
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:26,100
Well, you know what?

1553
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:26,720
I mean, you know what?

1554
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:33,700
I think might be we've been on this, but what you might call a ride with romantic moments might be this new beauty and the beast ride.

1555
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:34,380
Yes, for sure.

1556
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:43,420
Because this has like I think it is it's it's pretty new thing to make like two animatronic bodies share a romantic moment.

1557
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:51,580
I say it's a new other than experimental robot sessions that people have done in workshops.

1558
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:54,880
But you know what I mean?

1559
01:13:54,900 --> 01:14:03,180
Like I think maybe you could have like like if they if you if you put the full weight of imaginary behind it, I think you could recreate the notebook kiss.

1560
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:05,920
We have that and it doesn't hurt the robots.

1561
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,240
Yeah, that.

1562
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:24,340
Yeah, I think that the thing with robots is that I guess some of them even in the most like if they're recreating a romantic moment from a movie, sometimes maybe a robot's jerkiness doesn't translate to like beauty romance.

1563
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:24,780
Maybe.

1564
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:29,340
So I guess they'd have to be the most advanced romantic animatronics ever created.

1565
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:33,020
Especially if they're doing human being like they're mimicking human beings.

1566
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:33,480
Yeah.

1567
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:43,280
So I think I mean these new robots that we've been seeing from Imagineering are cool, but maybe we still need to take a leap forward in romantic robot technology.

1568
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:48,300
We need to teach the robots to love to bring it back to AI.

1569
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:49,340
Oh, yeah, we do.

1570
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,120
Yeah, it's a nice.

1571
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:54,680
Yeah, we have to teach them to love for real.

1572
01:14:54,680 --> 01:15:02,840
This isn't a technological we have to like hit some with the singularity in which the only thing lacking in that beating the beast ride.

1573
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,200
Those robots don't actually love each other.

1574
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,380
They're just mechanics that look like they do.

1575
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:07,740
Right.

1576
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:13,220
The only imagineering's next level is to make robots that are actually in love with each other.

1577
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:18,700
They figured out how to make the Jude Law sex worker robot, but not the.

1578
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:20,640
Well, that's not amorous.

1579
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:27,340
Lieutenant Commander Data in Star Trek The Next Generation knew how to have sex before he knew how to love.

1580
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:29,200
We've all been there.

1581
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:34,660
He was fully functional and had sex before they put in his emotion chip.

1582
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:46,100
And then after having sex years later, he first, I think, displayed love honestly in Star Trek Generations when he rescued his cat from the wreckage of the Enterprise D.

1583
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:49,220
And he welled up with tears and he realized he felt love.

1584
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:53,280
So I think you're you would probably want let's do a couple steps.

1585
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:58,540
You want Star Trek the experience back and you want there to be a romantic.

1586
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:00,740
So let's do a tunnel of love in there.

1587
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,160
A holodeck of love.

1588
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:02,540
Yes.

1589
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:08,000
In which a real a data robot is actually alive and is taught out of love.

1590
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:08,780
Yeah, I would.

1591
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:10,220
Oh my God, please.

1592
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:11,540
I'll go home.

1593
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,000
Move there.

1594
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:13,900
If that's existing again.

1595
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,580
Michael has left Lindsay for a robot of data.

1596
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:17,820
There's a horny.

1597
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:18,700
It's data.

1598
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:21,680
I hate to hate to correct you, but it's data.

1599
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:22,580
They pronounce the data.

1600
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:26,960
But, you know, Star Trek, there's so much love on start the history of Star Trek.

1601
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:38,420
You know, Will Riker and Deanna Troy and Star Trek Insurrection when they're all getting like sort of the atmosphere of the planet they're on is giving them all kind of like puberty fair hormones back.

1602
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,360
And they're all feeling very horny.

1603
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:45,940
You know, maybe that actually what we're missing about what is wire tunnel of what if they're pumping pheromones?

1604
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:51,880
I'm here going like, is it a big bear with a heart shaped box of candies?

1605
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:58,500
Maybe the secret what they won't say is that pure gas pheromones were pumped into these real tunnels.

1606
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,120
That's good.

1607
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:06,160
You know what else I think could help as well is playing the song on a loop Bruce Springsteen tunnel of love.

1608
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:12,060
If we've ever seen the cover.

1609
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:13,000
Mm hmm.

1610
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:13,660
Bruce there.

1611
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:14,820
I was listening to this before.

1612
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,780
It's kind of in my musical neck of the woods a little.

1613
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:18,420
Yeah.

1614
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:22,360
Some of the I feel like some of the Bruce 90s was not received so well.

1615
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:24,940
But in hindsight, I think a lot of it holds up pretty good.

1616
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:29,460
And this is about I mean, it's about going on the ride we're talking about.

1617
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:35,640
It's also about, of course, you know, the complications of romance and what does it mean and how hard it is.

1618
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:41,400
But it is also just like he calls the man overweight in the first line.

1619
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:41,740
I don't know.

1620
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:49,920
It seems superfluous, but he says he's paying somebody to get on a ride that's working the ride and then they go on there and there's like mirrors in it too.

1621
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,400
But he doesn't describe Cupid or any of scrolls.

1622
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:54,640
Wait, that's a kind of maybe mirrors are good.

1623
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:58,760
It lets you picture each other together and then you get to watch each other.

1624
01:17:59,100 --> 01:17:59,580
Yeah.

1625
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:00,840
They're on a mirrored ceiling.

1626
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:02,820
So you know what?

1627
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,560
Actually, Bruce has helped solve this myth.

1628
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:06,460
That is what was romantic in these rides.

1629
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:06,840
Yeah.

1630
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:09,560
And if there's two rows, you get bored.

1631
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,680
Just take a peek of what's going on behind you.

1632
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:21,060
Be a little bit of where Jason, the third stuck his tongue out when he said he raised his eyes.

1633
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,040
The mirrors are there to be looked at.

1634
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:27,640
You know, that was a good idea.

1635
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,300
You know, oh, that's a good idea.

1636
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:36,120
Jason, what E Street band member and wife would you want behind you in a tunnel of love going down?

1637
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:39,060
Little Stephen and Maureen Van Zandt.

1638
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:41,380
Are you all so deep that you know their wives?

1639
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:42,620
Some of them.

1640
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,620
I don't know that I know all the members.

1641
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:46,680
Oh, of the E Street band?

1642
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:47,080
Yeah.

1643
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:49,060
Oh, just well, you know, you've got your Max Weinberg.

1644
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:50,580
Little Stephen, I'd be distracted.

1645
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,320
Hey, you survived Podcast the Ride.

1646
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,180
Thanks for subscribing to the…

1647
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:55,720
Feel free to keep listing them.

1648
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:57,600
We got to get out of here someday.

1649
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,060
We do.

1650
01:18:58,060 --> 01:18:59,640
Mike's getting worked up.

1651
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,060
He's talking about data.

1652
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:02,520
He's talking about data.

1653
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,140
And tiny Springsteen.

1654
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,380
He's getting worked up over there.

1655
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:09,460
Hey, you know what would be a fun second gate, I think, is to do an episode about data.

1656
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:10,340
Let's do one.

1657
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:11,520
Mike would like this.

1658
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:12,820
Let's do one all about data.

1659
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:17,480
I'm embarrassed at how much hearing him called data drives me nuts.

1660
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:21,160
I'm embarrassed by how much it's like nails on a chalkboard.

1661
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:22,100
All right.

1662
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:23,480
You survived Podcast the Ride.

1663
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:23,800
Data.

1664
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,500
Thanks for subscribing to the second gate.

1665
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:25,920
Data.

1668
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:34,080
Data.

1669
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:39,400
I will say, real quick, I cannot stop thinking about how you prepared the car before.

1670
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:40,760
That is…

1671
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:41,200
I can't…

1672
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:43,680
It's so funny.

1673
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:44,300
And as a boy scout.

1674
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:46,680
It's so funny though.

1675
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,780
Because you just drive around the corner and prepare it.

1676
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:49,460
I don't know.

1677
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:50,620
I was on my way out.

1678
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:51,820
I thought I was in the clear.

1679
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:53,380
Okay, he came out last second.

1680
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:53,800
I see.

1681
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:54,220
I see.

1682
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:54,580
Yeah, no.

1683
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:57,420
So I'm like, oh god, my dad's here.

1684
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:58,220
He's going to say something.

1685
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:02,680
But what I never would have guessed is that he was going to accuse his 18 year old son

1686
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,300
of using a rubber glove as a condom.

1687
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:04,940
That's funny too.

1688
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:09,120
But in my mind, you would like hours before prepare the seats.

1689
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:13,360
And as a former boy scout, I appreciate always be prepared.

1690
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:14,840
Always be prepared.
