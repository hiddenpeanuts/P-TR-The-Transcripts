1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Forever.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,200
Dog.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,160
Warning, the following podcast may contain

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,600
dystopian cookie nightmares,

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,400
forced removal of elephant innards,

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,640
and toxic ass foam.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,520
2022 takes flight with Dumbo the Flying Elephant

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,360
on podcast The Ride.

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:46,680
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the podcast that turns 90-second rides into 90-minute episodes.

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,800
I'm Scott Gardner, back in person with Jason Sheridan, hi.

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,840
Hi, that's right.

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,400
Yeah, it's been a month to the day since the last Improved.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,200
We've done a couple, but over Zoom.

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,480
So here we are, changes everything.

15
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,160
Worth bringing up, obviously, Mike Carlson.

16
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,400
Oh my gosh, worth bringing up.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,080
Don't people love the ins and outs of the podcasting game?

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,440
Yeah, we are here.

19
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,600
It is the longest maybe break between a main feed

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,240
that we've ever taken, is that correct?

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,160
Yeah, maybe.

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,680
Yeah.

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,320
Yeah.

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,160
And if the world was better, it would have maybe felt like a nice break, wouldn't it?

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,600
Yeah, yeah.

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,400
I mean, well, you brought it up.

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,120
It's, you know, you want to come in with some positive energy in 2022,

28
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,440
and that's, you know, for any new year, you want to do that.

29
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,600
You want to do it this year, but it's really hard to do, I'd say,

30
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,520
under the shadow of everything that's going on.

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,360
And I don't need to say it, but I'll say it.

32
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,760
That is, of course, the closure this week of Shrek 4D Universal Studios Florida.

33
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,720
It's like, how do we even...

34
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,000
I think we should be lauded for even doing an episode at all,

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,760
considering the circumstances, but...

36
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,760
And I'm sorry if this is too painful for you to bring up,

37
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:06,640
because it's closer to home, but the soon upon us closer of Sugarboo and Co.

38
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,200
Yeah.

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,360
At downtown Disney.

40
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,360
No, I know. It's a rough one.

41
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,600
Yeah, I think the dates are set.

42
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,680
I mean, what, like...

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,840
I don't want to vocalize this where we end the podcast,

44
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,160
but I know we've at least all thought it.

45
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,760
I think there'd be a relief to saying, like, how do we even go on,

46
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,080
given all of these closures on both coasts? I feel trapped.

47
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,320
Yeah, but you know, here's the thing, like, you're right.

48
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,040
And I felt like we should end the podcast after Sugarboo announced it was closing.

49
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,240
But...

50
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,280
No one would have blamed us. Not one person would have blamed us.

51
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,600
Right, because our spirits were so low.

52
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,120
In case you know what we're talking about, this is a store at downtown Disney

53
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,720
that sells wooden signs with sayings on it.

54
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,480
But I went into the Sugarboo and there was a sign that said,

55
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,600
My heart will go on.

56
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,840
And it was one hundred and fifty dollars.

57
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,960
And I said, you know what? The podcast must go on.

58
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,320
That's right. So right.

59
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:03,400
And if they weren't reducing that price, even though it was one of their final days

60
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,040
of operation, if they're going to be true to who they are right up to the end,

61
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,160
then so do we need to be.

62
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,240
Is there a liquidation sale going on at Sugarboo?

63
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,520
Should we? I haven't really been going a lot of places lately,

64
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,520
but should we go down and see if there's any good sales?

65
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,800
Well, I mean, you also got to go down and check out the new stores,

66
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,080
Pele Soccer and Love Pop, a store that sells mostly pop up greeting cards.

67
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,240
Pop up like so like a picture book, like a pop up book.

68
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,480
Yeah, a child's pop up book like paper flower, pop up paper flower.

69
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,800
There is now now in 2022.

70
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,920
In like as we heading into year two of pandemic.

71
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,320
Now there is a Disney store that is all pop up cards.

72
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Well, the third party, they do have some Disney themed cards.

73
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,240
And then the Pele Soccer, of course, has Pele stuff

74
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,720
and also soccer memorabilia and jerseys and everything.

75
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,160
And it's his brand of it's great.

76
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,280
Pele, it's the corporate entity Pele.

77
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,680
It's the whatever you want to call it, Pele.

78
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,600
I think this is that was the most rosy theme park news I'd seen in a while.

79
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,840
Like, oh, very odd, very specific stores returning to downtown Disney.

80
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,680
Maybe nature is healing.

81
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,040
Yeah, I guess so. Yeah.

82
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,400
Like micro targeted, oddly, like more specific

83
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,200
than would be at a regular mall or shopping center. Yeah.

84
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,520
Like who would ever it does?

85
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,600
The pop up card place harkens back to like an all wind up toy store

86
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,400
at City Walk or the you know, it's not gone, but the sock store.

87
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,880
I feel like sometimes when I see a Sephora,

88
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,040
I feel like they have lost their mission of stores that you

89
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,720
would assume don't exist, which shouldn't exist.

90
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,600
And why would they? Yeah.

91
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,600
I want fridge magnets and bottle openers and nothing else.

92
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,720
I just like I would I wish Pele was involved in more of the stores

93
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,880
down at downtown Disney.

94
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,960
Oh, Pele's Jamba. Yeah.

95
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,400
Why not? Pele's I'm glad to see that.

96
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,080
Pele is the man Pele we're talking about, right?

97
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,320
The soccer player. Yeah.

98
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,040
So I'd like to see him get out there with more like endorsements and more.

99
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,760
I don't know. Got to get his brand up.

100
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,160
Does he have let me ask this question, a celebrity liquor.

101
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,520
Does Pele have a celebrity liquor?

102
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,880
I don't know. Offhand.

103
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,840
OK, he might be a clean living athlete who does not

104
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,960
who thinks that liquor would get in the way of great soccer skills.

105
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,040
OK, well, we'll look it up and maybe we'll suggest it to him on his website

106
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,920
if he has a, you know, suggestions email.

107
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,760
I appreciate that you're striving for more, but you know, that Pele

108
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,320
has finally come to downtown Disney and then you're just like, you're right.

109
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,400
Pele, you're right.

110
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,880
You got to appreciate Pele land. I'm greedy.

111
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,480
I wish Scottie Pippen would come to downtown Disney

112
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,160
because he has a celebrity liquor.

113
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,920
He has a celebrity endorsed popcorn.

114
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,640
And I wish he would come down and do something with Disney.

115
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,840
But I don't know what it is. I'm not sure.

116
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,600
But we can talk about that later.

117
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,280
I feel like it'd be a good

118
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,080
zone for him. Just yeah.

119
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,160
Well, he's really ramped it up in the last couple of years.

120
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,600
So I feel like restaurant stores is next for him and for the brand.

121
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,040
So to play on the ultimate stage, to play in the ultimate arena,

122
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,960
I guess you would say that I would say downtown Disney.

123
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,120
That is the ultimate arena. Yes, I would say that.

124
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,920
And of course, I still have a bottle of digits.

125
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,600
His bourbon I have not opened yet.

126
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,040
It's going to be saved for a special occasion.

127
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,440
So I've transitioned out of liking

128
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,080
Casamigos to exclusively liking digits, despite having not

129
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,240
tried it. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly.

130
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,200
The mere notion of digits.

131
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,520
Yeah. Bye bye, Randy. Hello, Scotty.

132
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,360
That's the way I feel.

133
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,720
Hey, no complaints for me. Yeah, I'm I'm loving.

134
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,320
Well, now I've never felt better about 2020.

135
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,160
22 is different. There's a lot of different.

136
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,320
I mean, if everyone wants to declare how they're going to be different

137
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,200
going forward in this year, I think this is the time to do it

138
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,320
before we dive into Dumbo.

139
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,600
Jason, what do you think? Oh, I don't know.

140
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,240
I hadn't really given that much thought.

141
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,480
OK, so you're going to be the same.

142
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,280
Got it, Scott. Yeah, exactly the same.

143
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,960
Perfect. No, no, it's

144
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,800
let me see. I I don't know.

145
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,000
I say this and I think I might immediately take it back.

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,080
But like, I don't do I need to be more

147
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,480
open minded to

148
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,480
generic radio music of the 90s and 2000s.

149
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,000
This is what I feel like is it's it's come up a lot.

150
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,800
I don't know if it's becoming a wedge.

151
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,800
You know, I I I I slap these things down the green days

152
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,120
and the Brian Setzer's and am I missing

153
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,840
many musical marvels by not pursuing these discographies

154
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,640
of things that are played at supermarkets all the time?

155
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,160
I don't know. I mean, you have to answer that question for yourself.

156
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,160
It is it funny to me now that Brian Setzer is a villain on this podcast.

157
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,360
It's hilarious to me. I love it.

158
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,240
I love that you hate Brian Setzer.

159
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,840
And this was a second gate development, potentially, if you missed this.

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,200
I think about it every other day.

161
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,000
I go, Scott hates Brian Setzer and I giggle like it makes me laugh so much.

162
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,440
I didn't want to add to the episode that we just did on the second gate,

163
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,040
which was about an Incredibles ice show, if you didn't hear it.

164
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,480
And we also met a new friend named not the opposite of an enemy,

165
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,320
a new hero on the podcast named J.

166
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,440
Bigga, of course.

167
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,080
So check that out at Patreon.com slash podcast.

168
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,680
Right. But over there recently, yeah, there was some Brian Setzer discussion

169
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,840
because he was in the Country Bears movie.

170
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,400
And I didn't want to bring it up, but I was the thing that inspired

171
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,880
that Incredibles ice show episode.

172
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,080
There was a the 2005 very Merry Christmas parade features Brian Setzer

173
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,000
at the beginning. They open it.

174
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,960
I didn't want to open that can of worms.

175
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,240
But since we've opened the sets are kind of worms now.

176
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,400
He he he say he opens up the parade.

177
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,720
I'm in the whole orchestra, of course.

178
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,640
He does jingle bells and the change lyrics to be,

179
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,880
oh, what fun it is to ride in a 57 Chevrolet.

180
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,040
And here I am saying I was going to be more open minded.

181
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,840
But I did when I heard that, when I watched the video of that

182
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,520
and then like his whole horn section go like, hey, I was like,

183
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,480
Mike, Jason, tell me this is good.

184
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,640
Look me in the eye and tell me that you like that.

185
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,800
I have to watch the video. I have to see it.

186
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,120
Yes, I've already tainted the description of it. Yeah.

187
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,640
I don't know. Offhand, though.

188
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,200
I mean, you laughed. But is that a mocking laugh?

189
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,760
Is it a or is it a laugh of you?

190
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,720
If you were at the concert, would you go, ha ha?

191
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,120
Well, Brian, you're encouraged.

192
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,880
It's so tainted by now, though.

193
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,040
This is a problem because you've tainted it with with this disgust.

194
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,680
So I feel like I wouldn't even maybe I would have been like, oh,

195
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,520
it's kind of annoying or that's stupid or whatever.

196
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,520
But now when I see it, I can't help but think of the anger toward it.

197
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,160
So I don't think I'll ever be able to completely assess it because it was

198
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,120
I never owned a Brian Setzer album.

199
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,760
I've never like all I said was I do like the song he does in the Country Bear movie.

200
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,560
That's really all I've actually said.

201
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,960
I liked what the single he had. What was it?

202
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,840
I don't like the Stray Cats one as much as the 90s single that he had with the orchestra.

203
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,560
What am I? Jump driving.

204
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,280
Thank you. I did like it at the time.

205
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,560
I don't listen to it now.

206
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,520
So so it's never going to be possible for me not to watch it and laugh.

207
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,440
So now it's actually you made it better for me.

208
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,320
You've made all these performances better.

209
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,840
I know. I knew this is where it was.

210
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,920
Go that like what now would have because I've registered my dislike

211
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,040
now to Mike and Jason going full force on Brian Setzer out of nowhere.

212
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,240
As a spite listen.

213
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
This is a situation.

214
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,480
Yeah, I will be I mean, I'm full disclosure, like depending on what you're shitting.

215
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,600
There are the green day.

216
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,840
I did have like a lot of affection for and I do when I say I mean, I know it's

217
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,000
how it makes more sense to talk about it.

218
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,360
And they're in there in my reconciliatory twenty twenty two.

219
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,960
I get it. I get it. It's not for me.

220
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,440
But Setzer, yeah, I don't have much affection for or disdain for.

221
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,480
But yes, if it comes up on the show, it is 100 percent an attempt to get a rise out of you.

222
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,960
Yes. Yes. Yeah.

223
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,360
There's no way around it. Yeah.

224
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,320
Understood. Jason, you've been awfully silent on this matter.

225
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,720
Well, where's the in terms of what I would like to hear and what I I like.

226
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,120
I think I liked Brian Setzer Orchestra when they were leaning more towards

227
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,040
the like Dorsey Brothers than the Rockabilly stuff.

228
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,800
What are you talking about?

229
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,640
I didn't really more towards the Dorsey Brothers.

230
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,880
The actual like big band.

231
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,880
Like I thought about like you reference something I have no reference for.

232
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,200
Basie's orchestra. Yeah.

233
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Yeah. Like I saw them.

234
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,960
I first learned about them from Cone.

235
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,400
The Brian Setzer Orchestra was on Conan and they all had like tuxedos on or white

236
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:03,080
chat dinner jackets on and they were doing like in the mood, you know, just a straight cover.

237
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,800
Mm hmm. I don't know.

238
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,960
I don't know what song you're talking about.

239
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,160
And I just like that.

240
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,240
I just like old music.

241
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,640
I played in the mood in eighth grade.

242
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,240
I'm in the mood. What's in the mood?

243
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:21,840
Now that I know that title and I just liked old music because it was I liked old movies.

244
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:30,640
So like I I and that's where I got to it and I would find the CDs and like you record stores.

245
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,160
So you had this.

246
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,840
I had one or two of the like Setzer Orchestra CDs.

247
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,400
So when Jason's brings it up, it's not necessarily 100 percent troll.

248
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,480
Yeah, no.

249
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,800
But like anytime anyone has like a very visceral reaction to anything on the show,

250
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,400
the others like jump on.

251
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,240
Well, yeah, there is a potential episode topic floating around the other day where you're like,

252
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,720
guys, this one's real bad.

253
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,920
And you gave a specific and I'm like, you are making me want to watch it so much more.

254
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,120
Oh, you are making me know the other.

255
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,920
Yes. Everyone else becomes a vulture all of a sudden.

256
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,400
No, I smell blood.

257
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,280
That's good podcasting is sadly the problem is the problem is that.

258
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,560
And then I started getting marketing material for your consideration.

259
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:17,840
And I'm like, well, if I'm already considering it as well, I guess it is well.

260
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,800
That to the movie you're thinking about, I just heard Jim Hill talk about it.

261
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,080
Really? I was just listening to Jim Hill talk about the same.

262
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,720
Well, if he's talking about it, we got to America's talking about it.

263
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:34,920
Yeah. So, OK, well, I just wanted to know like where the traps might be and where this could potentially be going.

264
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:42,280
And if you end up suddenly all nine albums deep into you're always playing Brian Setzer in the car.

265
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,200
Lindsay and Jane are like, what's happening?

266
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,720
Why is the song? I'm going to have to listen to a few.

267
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,000
It's nothing but Big Band with you for now.

268
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,800
Look, it's a whole thing. It started with it started as a spiked thing with Scott.

269
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,080
But now I look what can I say? I love the BSO.

270
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,600
They remind me of the Dorsey's BSO.

271
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,600
If I get into Big Band revival music in twenty twenty two, it's not out of the question.

272
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,880
I mean, possible. I have actual like Big Band compilations like in my eye.

273
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,320
So like when my Bluetooth, my car connects to my phone.

274
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,880
Usually when I drive, I listen to podcasts.

275
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,840
But if it this is auto defaults to music and sometimes it will just default to whatever is in the eye.

276
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,360
And then a live.

277
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,400
Yeah. Jason said, oh, I guess we're listening today.

278
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,880
Folks, we're listening to Bunny Bear again while we drive to In-N-Out Burger.

279
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,880
Oh, man, we got to do an old timey Big Band.

280
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:41,360
Yes. By the end of twenty twenty two, I think maybe not spurred not just by Scott's spite,

281
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,760
but also by being hopefully by then excited to be in bigger groups of people.

282
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,480
I think it's the Mike Carlson and Jason Sheridan orchestra.

283
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,600
I think you guys started orchestra. OK.

284
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,560
I think you can have one without being a master of one of the instruments yourself.

285
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,360
Well, I play trumpet, so I am.

286
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,040
Yeah. So you'll take a trumpet solo and I'll just do banter.

287
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,960
Uh huh. I'll have like a lazy conductor's one and I'll turn around a lot and mug to the audience.

288
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,800
And in between songs like, well, that was a real humdinger.

289
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,680
Oh, wow. We got another ditty coming up for you folks.

290
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,640
Well, there's more big band to come.

291
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,960
More. Let's just start building the stands.

292
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,400
Start building the what?

293
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,680
M.C. J.S.O.

294
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,960
So just like even though like, I don't know, maybe it's Carp Over the Horse,

295
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,200
but I say start building them even before you get the musicians,

296
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,240
because you got to get those looking nice and polished.

297
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,280
So, right.

298
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,360
Find a carpenter or start building them yourselves.

299
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,480
And before you know it, you'll be doing shows.

300
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,280
God, that sounds good. Yeah. Yeah.

301
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,280
Coming soon.

302
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,200
The all different world at the end of the year.

303
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,720
What's this episode about again?

304
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,120
About Dumbo the Flying Elephant.

305
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,600
The beloved attraction, the beloved attraction, which I saw

306
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,640
referenced as the only one at all six castle parks

307
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,960
or one of the few other websites saying one of the few attractions at all.

308
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,320
It's on every property.

309
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,840
It's on every theme park property. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

310
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,200
It's a it's a it's a basic.

311
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,640
It's a tenant. It's a tent pole.

312
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,720
The most iconic ride.

313
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,720
Maybe. Yeah, that's what I think you got to.

314
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,880
You got to ask those kind of questions because and if we took our time

315
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,960
getting to it at the beginning, some of it might be at the end of the day,

316
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,080
it's a ride that just goes round and round. Right.

317
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,240
The ride itself is that. Yeah.

318
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,040
However, I think there's bigger stuff here.

319
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,160
I think it's it is. Yeah. It functions as a symbol.

320
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,480
I think it's it's important in the history and the the legacy.

321
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,920
Yeah. Bigger than itself.

322
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,280
Oh, my God. It is bigger than itself.

323
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,240
Yeah, I think it's one of the ones like Space Mountain or Haunted Mansion,

324
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,840
where it is shorthand for like theme parks, certainly shorthand for like Disney parks,

325
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,440
but shorthand for theme parks at large and also

326
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,400
copied everywhere.

327
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,680
Like, yeah, duplicated at traveling carnivals at regional amusement parks,

328
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,520
at fairs, you know.

329
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,680
Yeah. You sit in like sitting in a.

330
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,440
You know, Jason is something's wrong, but I want to imagine it.

331
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,800
Oh, I'm fine. I'm just

332
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,400
coffee repeating on me. Oh, yeah.

333
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,600
I was hoping you were crying about Dumbo

334
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,240
because that's a good also also good podcasting so we can get one of us to cry.

335
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,000
I mean, Dumbo, the movie, by the way, is a well,

336
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,240
there's another thing that's involved far beyond beyond the movie.

337
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,000
The sad kind of nightmarish animated film.

338
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,560
Yeah, which will come up later.

339
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:39,840
That there is more movie stuff tied into one version of this ride.

340
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,120
Right. Yeah, I did a rewatch of the movie and prep for this,

341
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,760
partially because it is short.

342
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,920
I think I can. All right. I can handle a 65 minute.

343
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,920
You know, sometimes you get the question.

344
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,800
I'm sure you guys do or, you know, as people are trying to figure out,

345
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,160
what is this theme park interest that these people I know have?

346
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,480
Or does that mean so you are you into the Disney movies?

347
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,080
Is that part of this?

348
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,520
And I will tend to say no, that would have been my answer in a soft way before.

349
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:15,600
But having reflected on movies like Peter Pan, Pinocchio and now Dumbo,

350
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,720
I might say specifically, I don't like the movies or at least these movies.

351
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,520
Right. Like Dumbo is just unrelenting.

352
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,360
I feel maybe you guys haven't done it in a little bit.

353
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,080
Well, it's for my. Yeah, I haven't done it real recently.

354
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:36,320
But the sadness and the bleakness of Dumbo, like why?

355
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,960
As a kid, I didn't like I liked Dumbo the character,

356
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,000
but I was I don't think I was ever begging to watch Dumbo over and over again.

357
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,240
It's like almost what you want is a Dumbo two, which maybe

358
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,960
I don't think they did that in straight to video times.

359
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,200
I think there were maybe plans in Walt era of another Dumbo that didn't happen.

360
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,760
Right. But what you want is like that to be the miserable backstory.

361
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,640
Yeah, that all is a prequel that you can ignore if you don't want to be upset.

362
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,920
And now you go on a brand new adventure with Dumbo that is 90 percent flying,

363
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,600
zero percent crows, zero percent scary clowns,

364
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,640
making him die from a thousand feet in the air.

365
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,480
Let's get let's strip all that out.

366
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,960
And it's just our friend flying around.

367
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,080
It's it's what you want is a movie that's like the ride.

368
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,640
I feel yes, you do.

369
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,200
100 percent flying and you want Dumbo quest for the magic feather.

370
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,200
Yeah, the feather, the feather gets lost.

371
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,240
Jason, could you make the title a little longer?

372
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,000
Dumbo returns colon

373
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,920
quest for the magic feather.

374
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,080
It can be longer. It could be longer in feather land.

375
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,840
Maybe in the journey, the journey to the rescue of that.

376
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,880
That is right. That's the journey to the rescue of the

377
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,600
phantom rescue of the mists of the magic feather.

378
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Dumbo and Timothy in that.

379
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,520
OK, that's good.

380
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,480
Dumbo and Timothy in the quest for the whatever.

381
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,640
Yes. Yeah, I am.

382
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,080
I will give them credit.

383
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,600
That song, Baby Mine, is

384
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,160
I think a very beautiful song, but also maybe the saddest song ever made.

385
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,880
Yeah, yeah.

386
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,000
I discovered that during

387
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,320
well, I want to say peak pandemic, but who knows at this point

388
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,560
during pandemic one point, oh, when Disney was doing all these specials

389
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:38,560
that were like sing along from home that Katy Perry sang Baby Mine

390
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,880
in full Dumbo wardrobe with her little dog who was also in Dumbo.

391
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,280
Oh, wardrobe.

392
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,040
But not to a baby, not she had just had a baby and did it.

393
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,800
I don't believe so.

394
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,840
In this case, no, I think this was a dog.

395
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,960
A little doll is a little dress elephant.

396
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,800
By the way, did you guys have you guys seen any clips?

397
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,120
She's doing residency in Las Vegas.

398
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,720
OK, all right. I'll save it.

399
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,280
Never mind. Never mind.

400
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,800
Wait, can I spoiler alert a little bit of it?

401
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,680
Is it? It's got to be the one.

402
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,120
It's got to be the thing.

403
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,320
Are you OK? Yeah, I'm OK.

404
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,520
She's doing California Girls and there's a giant toilet with a talking shit.

405
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,280
Yes, she rises out and then a turd rises out.

406
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,080
She climbs up on some toilet paper.

407
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,400
She like twerks at the audience and then she climbs up on the top of the toilet

408
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,800
paper and then she's singing with this giant turd.

409
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,680
And I'm like, wow, how fast can I get to this?

410
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,000
Wow. I saw I saw her in Vegas.

411
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,200
It was a tour, not a Vegas residency.

412
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,880
But there was a long was this the song was Swish Swish,

413
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,280
which had kind of a basketball veneer.

414
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,520
And she just did a long basketball shooting contest with a dad from the audience

415
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,480
as the music just kind of do.

416
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
Uh huh. Just like simmered for a while.

417
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,240
And then I swear, like 15 minutes, it took forever to get the results

418
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,560
of the dunks or the shots in.

419
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,720
But it was great. It felt like now we're watching double their live.

420
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,000
Well, that's fun. Yeah.

421
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,160
Katy Perry's maybe a little a little theme parky.

422
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:15,400
If she gets silly from the pictures of this nonsense show, it seems like

423
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,360
the set is amazing.

424
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,120
Yeah, the sets are made like changes a lot, too.

425
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,440
I sent both of you guys a link.

426
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,760
We just had to talk about Babymine.

427
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,880
And if you want to talk covers of Babymine, there's nothing better.

428
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,280
And I hate to go to classic rock again, because I guess it's classic at this point.

429
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,520
But nothing is more terrifying than the image of this man singing Babymine,

430
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,600
I think holding his own son on stage.

431
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,520
I don't have it yet.

432
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,760
Jason, you have it.

433
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,520
Professional wrestling promoter Billy Corrigan.

434
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,760
He's doing a baby of mine at the Wells Fargo Center of Philadelphia.

435
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,680
And he's wearing a circus like circus ringmaster jacket.

436
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,240
He's got black makeup on his eyes.

437
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,840
He's holding a baby.

438
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,800
And then he sings Babymine.

439
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,440
I mean, it's so sinister.

440
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,120
Jimmy Chamberlain playing the mandolin.

441
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,760
I do like classified smashing pumpkins as classic rock, because Billy Corrigan

442
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,320
is what, 88 years old?

443
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,400
Well, you got to like throw the Foo Fighters and Smashing Pumpkins at this point,

444
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,920
because it's like 25 years at least at this point.

445
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,360
It is classic rock.

446
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,440
The Pearl Jam, I've heard Pearl Jam and like classic rock stations at this point.

447
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,120
Yeah, sadly.

448
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,800
So the song resonates beyond that.

449
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,120
You could you could pull out of it, but otherwise, maybe we want to bail on

450
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,080
the majority. I want to bail on the majority.

451
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:55,960
Dumbo. Yeah, I kind of forgot that there was such a clown element to it, too.

452
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,040
I'm never happy about that.

453
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,760
I forgot that that's why Dumbo has the hat, right?

454
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,600
It's that it's initially part of a clown costume as they make him perform

455
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,440
terribly dangerous stunts, diving off a building on fire.

456
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,320
Geez. Yeah.

457
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,520
And then you've got the horrible element of Dumbo also where the

458
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,040
clowns are apparently because at one point the clowns say,

459
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,040
hey, we got to go threaten to strike.

460
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,720
Let's go get a raise from the boss or else we're going to strike.

461
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,200
And apparently that was Disney himself taking a jab and striking animators.

462
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,000
Had to get it in.

463
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,800
A specific clown who there is a silhouette of is a specific animator.

464
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
I don't know who. I can tell you who.

465
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,360
Oh, is it the guy who animated Goofy?

466
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,160
Like he was he was one of the big union leaders, I believe,

467
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,440
and was always butting heads with him.

468
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,280
Oh, OK. Hmm.

469
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,800
What a fool. Yeah.

470
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,000
Didn't he got his?

471
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,520
Dumbo. Yeah.

472
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,640
Really stuck it to that little guy.

473
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,880
Literal clown. Great job, Walt.

474
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,520
This the movie itself, I realize now holds like it's in the same spot

475
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,720
of my eye to follow that bird is because of a similar the similar

476
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,480
things that happen to the characters.

477
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,800
Sad makeup trapped in pages.

478
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,640
Yeah, it's like a movie that's all the sad bird, the blue bird part.

479
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,800
Mm hmm. Yeah.

480
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,960
So yeah, Dumbo was not in heavy rotation, but Pan was as a child.

481
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,160
Mm hmm. Sure. I loved Pan as a kid.

482
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:25,240
I think now that I think the issue with all of these, I think,

483
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,240
I was OK with them being around when I was a kid

484
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,760
because there weren't that many movies.

485
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,560
That is true. More movies.

486
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,800
We don't need to do these anymore.

487
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,840
I'm starting this. I got a kid.

488
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,440
He's not going to see any of these.

489
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,080
Well, not Disney. Not going on.

490
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,560
Could you do you should really show your own Disney?

491
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,600
Like, what do they call the collection from the vault?

492
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,520
Like the diamond?

493
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,640
What are they are they calling it anything anymore?

494
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,800
They used to call the diamond collection, but you have to pair it down

495
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,960
to what you like in the diamond collection.

496
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
So you should say this is out. This is in.

497
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,960
This is out and see how many last seem how many are left. Sure.

498
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,840
Well, I don't know if it's mainly if it's got a the primary thing,

499
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,120
if it has a little boy who wants to be a little boy forever

500
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,760
and my little boy doesn't get to see it.

501
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,880
I don't want you learning this perversity.

502
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,960
Well, so what about I mean, it seems like in the boss baby sequel,

503
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,400
he's an adult who has to return to being a baby again.

504
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,480
That's what the trailers have led me to believe.

505
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,120
The only boss baby content I've really consumed, by the way,

506
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,000
is Jane got me the boss baby cameo for Christmas

507
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,040
where the boss baby wishes you a holiday,

508
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,280
where it's like woosh.

509
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,880
It's like the birthday boy sketch woosh, where it's like a video.

510
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,160
I would like to put down the rules for the Scott Diamond

511
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,200
Disney collection that you can put boss baby into it,

512
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,040
even though it's not a Disney movie.

513
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,080
You can add movies to Disney's diamond collection, despite them not being.

514
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,680
They are. OK, OK. I could still pull them into it.

515
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,200
Yeah, because you're the one who's on it going through this.

516
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,920
Now with the child where you are going to see these movies and decide

517
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,880
so you can get to curate your own. Yeah.

518
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,760
I think I'm more less concerned with what's in the vault

519
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,320
and more concerned with the vault itself and making sure that it's unopenable.

520
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:11,880
OK, it is that you have to get retina scanned and provide a drop of blood.

521
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,040
Like there's got to be so many layers to make sure that you never see.

522
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,800
You're describing a nuclear waste site where like they put up those signs

523
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,080
that are meant to last a thousand years that say like,

524
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,040
this is not a place of honor.

525
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,520
This is do not go here.

526
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,040
What if it's like a movie day and it's like you didn't catch

527
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,200
when that they were going to show a Peter Pan Disney?

528
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,240
Are you going to like picket the school afterward?

529
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,920
Yeah, I think I think I'm throwing a fit as if they were like whatever

530
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:43,160
whatever people do that is reacting to whatever they think critical race theory is.

531
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,680
Right. That's what I I don't want critical pan theory taught in schools.

532
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,680
OK, this is my biggest issue as a parent.

533
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,600
You'll be at a school board meetings

534
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,040
like crying your eyes out like don't show the children pan.

535
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,920
You know what it does to them like little green unitards

536
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,280
destroy little brains.

537
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,080
Boys shouldn't be lost like shouldn't be lost.

538
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,200
Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot, you will be going.

539
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,680
We will not relent on this,

540
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,840
which is great when you find yourself saying to teachers, we will not relent.

541
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,880
You're the good guy.

542
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,120
You're definitely the hero of the story.

543
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,680
Yeah, always. Yeah.

544
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,600
Yeah. Famously villainous teachers. Yeah.

545
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,160
The man overpaid. Yeah.

546
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,120
They've always have been.

547
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,480
OK, yeah, look, it's all out.

548
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,160
These are these are out.

549
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:38,680
But what what Dumbo did succeed in doing, I think, like

550
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,000
I think in the history of of the animation studio, it is

551
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,440
it was a success for its budget.

552
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,240
It didn't have the issues that Fantasia had in the band.

553
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,560
I think Pinocchio, like budget overruns it.

554
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,280
It worked. And I think set up Disney for success,

555
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,160
even though then after Dumbo, they made all this weird like war compilation

556
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,440
movies that were not exactly cruising in terms of like quality movies.

557
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,240
Yes. But interesting fact about Dumbo, six weeks later, Pearl Harbor is bombed.

558
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,120
That is the timeline.

559
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,440
Like I you know, in the way the history just gets so condensed.

560
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,120
It didn't occur to me that like, oh, I was supposed to go see Dumbo today,

561
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,960
but I'm waiting here with the president has to say about

562
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,360
the Japanese attack on the Pearl Harbor base.

563
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,040
Well, pulled off of the time cover.

564
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,640
That's the fact about that.

565
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,480
The Dumbo is supposed to be on the cover of time and then there

566
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,480
and then Pearl Harbor happened and Wow, replaced by General MacArthur.

567
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,480
Wow, wow, wow. Mm hmm. Yeah.

568
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,480
What a time.

569
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,600
I guess I guess history can't be worse

570
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,000
and weirder than it is now.

571
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,520
So, yeah, well, anyway, point is big popular character.

572
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,400
When they start conceiving Disneyland, we have to have big popular characters

573
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,320
front and center. And and this is a big one.

574
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:06,960
So it's not an opening day attraction because although well,

575
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,920
now I've seen several things about this.

576
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,440
It is credited as opening a month later,

577
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,080
August 1955, because

578
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,880
there were issues with the elephants being too heavy.

579
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,600
Yeah. Construction issues.

580
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,160
I saw that too.

581
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:27,600
At all the other parks, it is an opening day attraction at Disney World,

582
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,560
Tokyo Disneyland, Euro Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai.

583
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,560
Yeah. Disneyland.

584
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:38,240
Yeah. Always like a big major opening day thing.

585
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,720
I think it was supposed to be for Disneyland.

586
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,000
I read a little bit of stuff that if you watch the opening day special

587
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,120
and I went and checked on this when when the kids are all running

588
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,520
and almost injuring themselves and everyone around them

589
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:59,520
to get to the Fantasyland rides in that special, apparently Dumbo's in it.

590
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,960
There was a Dumbo, one of the most terrifying original costumes.

591
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,560
Like a freak of nature.

592
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,680
If you look at that black and white photo, Dumbo apparently runs up

593
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,720
like into the direction of the Dumbo ride, but the camera stopped short.

594
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,920
They don't show it yet because they were still having trouble.

595
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,680
Now, I've also seen that they did attempt to run it on opening day

596
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,080
and that it resulted in the ride stopping really quickly

597
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,880
and people having to be rescued with ladders.

598
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,960
Step ladders come out and it was just a rough month

599
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,680
until the thing could actually get going.

600
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,040
Some of the issue of what happened here.

601
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:42,040
And I never knew this till doing all research that the ears were supposed to flap.

602
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,240
Yes, that's a weird thing.

603
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:50,280
And apparently for a decade or so before they did a switch out,

604
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,240
the ears still were on a little swivel point.

605
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,480
Like it was like if they had figured it out and gotten the mechanism working,

606
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,560
the ears could be flapping.

607
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,480
But then around the mid 60s, they said, screw it, that's never happening.

608
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,000
And then they just replaced him with unflappable ears.

609
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,320
Right. And there was no time when it would like the ears were like twitching

610
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,680
oddly or anything or like they weren't flapping.

611
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,720
They were just it seemed like something was wrong with them.

612
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,360
I got a thing. I mean, Dumbo, it's funny because I feel like every generation.

613
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,600
It's it's so iconic.

614
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,120
It's kind of glued in every generation, but it's changed so many times.

615
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,800
It's moved locations.

616
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,680
They've changed the mechanisms.

617
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,640
They've painted the elephants like they've done all of these changes.

618
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,760
They've doubled it.

619
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,320
Yeah, there's a lot of different things.

620
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,920
Probably a lot of changes, you know, considering the simplicity of it.

621
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,960
So once they they got rid of the mechanism that made the ears flap,

622
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,640
which took the vehicles down from 800 to 700 pounds.

623
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,240
So that was a little easier to get them up in the air.

624
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,240
Still a little dicey, apparently the beginning.

625
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,680
And still there was a problem that lasted for the first

626
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,680
couple of years of running it.

627
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,440
This is from the Disney History Institute.

628
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,360
That goes into that company, Aero, that built a lot of those early rides.

629
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,760
Yeah, this was an issue that they had when starting to run this thing

630
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,040
on the advice of a NASA engineer.

631
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,160
The Aero team used a combination of oil and nitrogen

632
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,160
in the hydraulic system for this ride for added power.

633
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,520
When they asked Ed Morgan, one of the owners of Aero, about this process,

634
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,760
he explained that oil and nitrogen combined

635
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,560
helped the ride run and gave it the power that it needed.

636
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,680
But it also created a weird foam, like a foam would bubble up

637
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,120
from the center of the ride or under the elephants.

638
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,240
I'm not exactly sure where the foam anyway, it would run.

639
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,720
And in front of guests, there would be a weird foam.

640
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:52,120
And so just again, there's a photo you can look up, I think, of this guy,

641
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:57,560
one of these classic, you know, Fred Mertz kind of guys.

642
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,120
Short, short, short. All right.

643
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,600
Eddie had to go remove the foam many times per day,

644
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,840
sometimes as often as between every ride cycle.

645
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,280
Dumbo's down.

646
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,680
Got to go take this weird foam at this nature.

647
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,760
Wipe the foam off of this elephant.

648
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,160
And the Aero people called this process milking Dumbo.

649
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,600
That was just part of the reality of Dumbo.

650
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,040
As you had to milk.

651
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,720
So so it seems like that would suggest it's on his undercarriage somewhere.

652
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,600
Yeah, possibly. Yeah.

653
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,840
If it's him, which is very nice.

654
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,360
I mean, if it's not at that center point, if it's somewhere in the like,

655
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:39,760
if every single Dumbo is sprouting weird foam

656
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:45,040
and does the foam ever because the rides up in the air and it's with spray,

657
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,520
it ever. Yeah. Is it ever like a Dumbo foam party going on?

658
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,240
Yeah. Oh, that's fun.

659
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,320
If it was out of his trunk, it would be awesome.

660
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,360
Oh, sure. Yeah.

661
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,800
That would have been a happy accident.

662
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,800
And they would have just I mean, of that going, is the foam

663
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,320
toxic? Yes. But right.

664
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,840
Yeah. The idea of it is oil.

665
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,360
All the parents standing around, if they're not riding, just smoking cigarettes.

666
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,600
Hell, some probably smoking cigarettes on the ride.

667
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,360
It's just like foam, just like little mini fireworks

668
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,840
is placed from airborne foam, catching fire from like long lucky strikes.

669
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,480
Long Virginia.

670
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,360
Bill. Yeah.

671
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,760
Cruella DeVille. Penguin style.

672
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,840
Hunter Thompson kind of cigarette holders just causing fires.

673
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,440
So, yeah, I mean, obviously coming out of the trunk.

674
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,960
That's that would be good.

675
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,600
Obviously anywhere else, probably a little a little weird.

676
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,800
My mouth. Dumbo's rabid.

677
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,960
Not good. Yeah. Yeah.

678
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,440
Dumbo's shitting foam. Not good.

679
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,680
Just confusing.

680
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,520
Yeah. Upsetting that anything's coming out of his butt.

681
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,440
But also what makes you foam at the butt?

682
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,160
Not something that you want to happen to you.

683
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
Some sort of new

684
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,160
some new disease from something that'll happen in a few years, I think.

685
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,960
Probably. That's well, Delta Cron, unfortunately, the combo.

686
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,560
It makes you foam out of your. Yeah.

687
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,000
But home out of your ass. Yeah.

688
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,920
That's otherwise fine.

689
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,280
You can see you actually don't have to social distance anymore.

690
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,680
You just might have to apologize for all the foam coming.

691
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,360
Excuse me. Have to excuse myself to the bathroom.

692
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,080
I'm extra. I'm foamy today.

693
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,280
It's a little foamy.

694
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,960
I'm going to go milk myself.

695
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:28,480
The weirdest fact about the early days of Dumbo I saw was that

696
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,720
because, you know, there's that kind of Disney rule that like,

697
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,000
well, you can't have five Mickey's or 10 Mickey's in one room.

698
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,520
Like there's one Mickey.

699
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,440
Hmm. But the origin.

700
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,440
So that idea applied to the original Dumbo.

701
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,120
There's only one one Dumbo.

702
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,280
So it was going to be elephants like everyone would ride in.

703
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,280
You know, now 16 was 10.

704
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,680
And we're painted pink like the hallucination

705
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,600
elephants from Dumbo's drunken revelry.

706
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,120
Yeah, yeah.

707
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,800
And because there's many pink elephants.

708
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,200
Yeah. In the pink elephants on parade sequence, so that they had to justify that.

709
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,080
There's again, when these they're making up these rules.

710
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,760
So you have these rides where Snow White can't be in the Snow White ride

711
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,200
because you're Snow White.

712
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,720
All these things that nobody they had to learn that nobody's thinking about them.

713
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,480
Yeah. And they're thinking too hard. Right.

714
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,840
But it makes it an extremely different ride if you if it is part of the

715
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,400
the psychedelic sequence that, by the way, comes from

716
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,600
champagne mixed with water.

717
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,040
Yeah. Slightly champagney water causes Dumbo to trip

718
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,240
and the mouse to write.

719
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,440
Yeah. Both in on it.

720
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,840
Very much a gag of its time.

721
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,760
But like as a theme park ride that would last forever,

722
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:55,400
like they're like we are essentially like we're condoning like kids

723
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,960
and get a little older.

724
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,120
You're going to see the pink elephants, you know.

725
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,640
The pink elephants are more fun than like Pleasure Island.

726
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,240
The pink elephant. Yeah, they are.

727
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,320
Yeah, they are more fun.

728
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,920
But that I think I'd probably mention on the Pinocchio episode

729
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,760
that hide it all DD and actors like for me, I think that is actually what

730
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,080
well thought of act like you're frivolous.

731
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,560
Well, except for your for Russell's implicit and that

732
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,600
the special six. Yeah.

733
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,440
The special six.

734
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,440
They were their own team. Yeah. Yeah.

735
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,280
Fred McMurray. Right.

736
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,160
He was in one of them.

737
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,480
Harvey Korman. No fool.

738
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,400
The rest fools. Yeah. Yeah.

739
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,720
Mm hmm.

740
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,200
The ride was even going to be called 10 10 pink elephants on parade.

741
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,760
That was the actual title.

742
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,080
And I didn't know that they were so committed to this that in the lead up

743
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,600
to Disneyland opening, I actually didn't know any of this before

744
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,040
that they were starting to do the promotional blitz, making people aware.

745
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,920
It's funny just that there was ever a time now they'll promote a new ride.

746
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,160
But it's funny that at one point they had to promote Disneyland entirely.

747
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,840
Hey, everyone, Disneyland is coming. Yeah.

748
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,120
And there was a Thanksgiving parade in Detroit, Michigan.

749
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:13,040
And then the Rose Parade in Pasadena in in January

750
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:18,160
1955, that both of these parades had floats involving

751
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,480
pink elephants spinning around.

752
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,400
That was and that was the only ride that they depicted.

753
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,440
So this was the main way they were putting their foot forward.

754
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,280
Come to Disneyland, where there is a spinning ride based on the pink elephants.

755
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:36,200
And then like a trailer that has a scene that then is not in the film.

756
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,280
Got there and there were no pink elephants.

757
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,400
It's almost like a curse.

758
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,520
Like I feel like when they were promoting Star Wars Galaxy's Edge,

759
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,680
they're like, we have a groundbreaking brand new ride, nothing like it.

760
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,200
And it's like, if you come out with that ride out front,

761
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,960
like that ride is getting delayed.

762
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

763
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,000
Just can't or all those, you know, any that the Harry Anderson special

764
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,440
where he promotes all of those things that the higher I don't think one of them

765
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,640
is just like the thing after thing after thing.

766
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,200
Yeah, I feel like Universal actually made these days have it right

767
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,520
where they just like start building and everyone like pretty much knows what it is.

768
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,840
But they don't even say it.

769
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,280
And then like six months before maybe or less, they go, oh, by the way,

770
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,720
it is that thing you thought it was.

771
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,480
Mm hmm. I mean, they keep doing that.

772
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:26,080
Velocicoaster and and Mario, they just sort of don't acknowledge.

773
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,440
Yeah, they they kind of I think it to Hollywood of a kind of acknowledged.

774
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,840
Yeah, there's a Mario now construction wall.

775
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,800
They're on the and it's like coming.

776
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,360
Yeah, but like for a year or something, it was like being built without confirmation.

777
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,960
This is what I do in my life to possibly a crazy degree.

778
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,880
I try to not. Oh, yeah. But anything.

779
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,240
It's like I told as few people as I could about the baby.

780
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,480
Well, yeah, sure. It happens. Sure.

781
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,920
No, yeah. You have to manage expectations for everything

782
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,080
because life is full of disappointment and pain.

783
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,160
Yeah. That's just the reality.

784
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,680
I do think Universal is I haven't watched it yet,

785
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,920
but there's that making a velocity coaster that they uploaded to Peacock.

786
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:11,120
Yeah. And it's like that is smart because I feel like Disney has scaled back

787
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,480
on those kinds of specials.

788
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,520
Oh, it's and throw it on.

789
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,680
You will really enjoy it.

790
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,720
It is like wonderfully flat.

791
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,360
I say this as a compliment that it is not.

792
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,240
I think Disney now would try to dress it up and do like sketches

793
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,880
and a bunch of crap you don't need and musical numbers.

794
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,440
It is just like, you know, just people talking.

795
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,280
And then we did that.

796
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,480
Mike Mario Lopez being inoffensive.

797
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,680
I yeah, that's great.

798
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,360
A lot of parks.

799
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,680
Universal did it with, I think, last coaster, maybe Hagrid's.

800
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:49,840
But I think it was Holiday World when we were talking about some of the Sally

801
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,040
Dark rides, more parks to have started on their YouTube channels,

802
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,880
like strapping a GoPro and a ride vehicle and recording the whole ride

803
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,520
and putting it up on their own YouTube channel.

804
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,840
And I'm like, oh, yeah, absolutely.

805
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,880
Do that, please. Yeah, yeah.

806
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,920
There's no reason to not like spoil.

807
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,000
Like, I guess I think the only rides you wouldn't want to spoil

808
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,920
is if there really is a thing at the end where you don't want to reveal

809
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,440
how it's done or there's anticipation on that first ride.

810
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,200
But if it's a, you know, if it's a roller coaster or especially roller

811
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,480
coaster, yeah, yeah.

812
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,640
Yeah. Spoilers don't necessarily factor.

813
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,160
Are you guys Mario Kart fresh? Are you fresh still?

814
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,400
I have not watched. I don't know.

815
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,560
I'm not seeing a single frame of video.

816
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:39,240
I've seen like a photo accidentally, but I have not watched the video.

817
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,880
I have a word I've seen the queue, seen that big Bowser.

818
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,200
But yeah, I don't really know.

819
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,880
And I imagine you can't capture it very well anyway.

820
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,160
Right. Given the goggles.

821
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,760
Yeah. But this is, I think, a big thing about Dumbo and saying that they

822
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,480
figured out maybe with this ride more than any is

823
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:04,280
what you're saying about, let's just show the whole ride

824
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,360
and post a nice video of it.

825
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,160
I think the promotion abilities of

826
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:16,520
just like I think with Dumbo, they created something

827
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,240
Instagrammable before Instagram. Yeah.

828
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,600
You know what I mean? Like, it's probably the thing that people came back

829
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,680
from Disneyland with is a picture of me on the on.

830
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:31,160
It's me sitting in Dumbo or my kids sitting in Dumbo or my friends

831
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,600
sitting in Dumbo. And then there's, you know, pictures of notable people

832
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,560
through the years on it.

833
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,560
I think like I feel like maybe Dumbo did a lot of heavy lifting for sure.

834
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,280
I mean, it's obviously and then there's some practical reasons for it

835
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,560
just because it's like it's easy to take a photo of somebody in the ride vehicle

836
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,760
when you're outside of it. That's part of it.

837
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:55,440
Yeah. Yes. Like you would maybe consider the teacups equally iconic,

838
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,120
a silly thing. You get to sit in a big teacup, right?

839
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,120
To sit in an elephant, but harder to take photos of.

840
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,640
Yes. You feel more rushed when you're getting on that thing,

841
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,720
like it's going to start moving. So I better strap in.

842
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,920
And then everyone can go on it. Yeah, everyone can go on it.

843
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

844
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,840
And even your biggest scaredy cats

845
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,360
can go on it and not make it go up that high.

846
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,800
Yeah, yeah.

847
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,400
Let's talk about that aspect of it, because I don't know.

848
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,960
I don't know this if other rides of this nature, which, by the way,

849
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,960
like my temptation would be to call it a spinner ride.

850
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,960
Yes, there's some things similarly a spinner ride.

851
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,840
But apparently the term is aerial carousel.

852
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,800
Right. A term I will not ever use because it's clunky.

853
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,720
And I don't think even aerial carousel.

854
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,160
I what I want to throw out is the term is round and round.

855
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,680
It's a round and round. Oh, that's nice. Oh, that's cute.

856
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,360
Aerial carousel is strangely beautiful, but it feels like the aerial carousel.

857
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,880
Very elegant. It feels like too much.

858
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,960
Too beautiful. Too beautiful.

859
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,960
Yeah, like baby, baby.

860
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,120
I don't hear it all the time. It's a fragile phrase.

861
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,600
Yeah, we all got a little wistful just hearing those words.

862
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,560
Aerial carousel. Let's not do that to ourselves.

863
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,240
It's it's a round and round.

864
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:12,920
What was my point?

865
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,920
Oh, the the ability to control the vehicle.

866
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,720
I don't know if Disney did that first or if that was an ability

867
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,480
that other rides like this had already.

868
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,360
But I think that's key to its success.

869
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,720
The feeling that for a kid, especially, that they can control it.

870
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,120
They can do it to their liking.

871
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,280
And it's not an interactive ride to the degree that other things

872
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,240
have been interactive rides.

873
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,760
But it does. Yeah, it does guarantee that you can have a slightly

874
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,640
different experience every time you do it.

875
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,040
Yeah, I'm trying to remember.

876
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,680
I mean, it was a local park.

877
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,520
I'm trying to remember what the first one of what my first round

878
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,080
and around was.

879
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,680
But I definitely had the same element of controlling it.

880
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,440
And that, yeah, as a kid, especially, you're like, wow, like this

881
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,840
because you can't drive a car yet.

882
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,040
You know, there's a talk of Tony Baxter always has a transformational

883
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,600
experience of blah, blah, blah.

884
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,000
I made it look so stupid there.

885
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,920
That's not what I meant.

886
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,680
But like driving on the Autopia or something, but like controlling

887
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,880
a vehicle and movement is a big deal as a kid

888
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,920
because you see adults doing it.

889
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,120
So it always felt like I have such power now.

890
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,280
Yeah, like the power.

891
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,160
I was also scared of it and would often not go very high

892
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,160
because I was initially pretty freaked out by this and still kind of

893
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,080
a little unnerved going on it, to be honest.

894
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,960
OK. Oh, interesting. Yeah.

895
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,600
Oh, yeah. I guess.

896
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,200
Well, yeah, our relationship with it today is maybe a question.

897
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,840
Yeah. How often do you go on Dumbo?

898
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,240
Not very often. No, no.

899
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,560
Jason. Yeah.

900
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,480
A once in a blue moon.

901
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,920
Maybe every couple of years.

902
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,320
Every year.

903
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:50,160
I, of course, went all the way up like TJ Collett.

904
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,600
I went all the way up as a kid.

905
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,280
Like I wanted to be a high up.

906
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:53,760
You're the height.

907
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,680
And I also wanted to be the movement of going up and down.

908
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,160
I want to go high up and then I want to go back down and then up.

909
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,360
So I'm like.

910
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,400
I hate to completely derail you on this real quick, but I just had a thought

911
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,560
that something I thought of over our last few weeks.

912
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,840
If I have a bachelor party in Las Vegas,

913
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,360
will you jump off the stratosphere?

914
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,640
Oh, that's a good.

915
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,720
That's a good question.

916
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,280
I mean, I think we have to judge what the other activities will be.

917
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,080
You know, like what else are we doing?

918
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,320
You know, because we're going to have a big meal right beforehand.

919
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,400
I probably would.

920
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,240
But it's going to require some planning.

921
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,200
Yeah, yeah. But you're open to the idea of it.

922
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,480
I am open to the idea.

923
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,800
I'm not opposed to the idea.

924
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,480
OK, great.

925
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,160
That's all I have to figure out how many times we're going to watch.

926
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,640
I lost my M in Vegas, the 3D movie at the.

927
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,920
Yeah. M&M store.

928
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,200
When will you so like what?

929
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,480
Making sure that we slot, you know, minimum three viewings of that.

930
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,320
Right. Right. And if we have time to.

931
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,000
I know I didn't see it last time.

932
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,280
I was staying across the street and I considered it.

933
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:54,320
You have to see it frequently because to see how much it is faded.

934
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,920
Yeah. Dark. The projector is right.

935
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,760
If you if you only see it once every five years, it'll be so jarring

936
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,840
how much it has gotten dark and blurry.

937
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,760
Well, and down the block now, there's an actual thing.

938
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,360
There's the fly vague.

939
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,360
I forget what it's called.

940
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,040
There's a flying theater attraction.

941
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,800
Like a soaring. Yeah, like a story.

942
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,680
Oh, I'm like a different shows in there now, like in between a target

943
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,400
underneath an olive garden.

944
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,320
Next to weird. Yeah.

945
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:28,280
It's the block where it's like, well, the bottom floor of this is a Marshalls

946
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,560
and the top floor of this is a hard rock cafe.

947
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,240
Like it. Yeah.

948
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,720
I kind of love it. Little.

949
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,320
Yeah, it's very confusing, but I kind of love it.

950
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,080
OK. Well, good. Thank you for confirming that.

951
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,240
So it depends. You got to carve it out, though.

952
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,000
Yeah, that's fine.

953
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,440
Obviously, like that would be the highlight of the thing.

954
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,960
If Jason jumped off the stratosphere.

955
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,280
Well, but it's your thing.

956
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,800
Like, I mean, you're doing that for me.

957
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,400
That's what I want. Yeah.

958
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,840
Yeah. Nothing would make Mike happier.

959
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,280
Yeah. You doing this.

960
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,200
I would need to get trial contacts as I want to be able to have crystal clear

961
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,240
vision for it.

962
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,160
So you have a writer, huh?

963
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,120
You have a writer for.

964
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,880
Well, I'm just talking about the prep.

965
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,800
I had to do.

966
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:12,040
You know, I don't think either way you'll be up there and wind is just flapping

967
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,280
like crazy or like visions going to be tough.

968
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,880
No matter if you think it's I don't want to take time.

969
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,400
I want to talk you out of it.

970
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,200
Yeah, I don't know.

971
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,360
I mean, I would definitely pay the upcharge for the like

972
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,080
we're going to strap a camera to you. Wow.

973
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,160
And so you get the video.

974
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,360
Oh, we need that for them.

975
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,800
We need that. 100.

976
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,360
Can we do a live show at the top?

977
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,520
Maybe it's not for the bachelor party.

978
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,360
Maybe it's like a live show at the top of the stratosphere.

979
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,280
And then the end of it is you jump off.

980
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,000
There's all see.

981
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,680
I think you're you're getting hat on a hat territory.

982
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,000
Yeah, I think I would need I would need time to prepare.

983
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,480
There is, though, is a hat on a hat.

984
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,240
It is true. Right on top of a hat like shape.

985
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,640
There's also all those rides up there.

986
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,160
That's true. Yeah. Yeah.

987
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,160
OK. Well, we'll talk about it. Yeah.

988
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,520
But you were a kid who who cranked the thing up as a child.

989
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,160
Oh, yeah. And there was also like multiple

990
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,520
like knockoffs at the Jersey. Sure.

991
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,800
Either elephants or spaceships or whatever.

992
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:10,560
And so, like, yeah, I think I was maybe and maybe continue to be a

993
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,440
up and down, like probably primary.

994
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,520
I make my round and round and up and down.

995
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:20,040
I I don't think I want to just go straight to the top and stay there.

996
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:23,760
I think like the back and forth is fun, but maybe you don't go all the way down.

997
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,480
It takes a little bit.

998
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,680
And it's 90 seconds.

999
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,960
The only every every second counts.

1000
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,720
So I don't want to waste time all the way on the bottom.

1001
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,440
And then you got to consider I think Dumbo is pretty smooth.

1002
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:38,440
But other rides of this nature, you could get kind of stuck.

1003
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,000
Like if the mechanism is great, like on the weird Elmo one, I went to.

1004
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,920
Oh, yeah. Sea World.

1005
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,400
If it's not that responsive,

1006
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,440
maybe you do just want to stay all the way up at the top.

1007
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:48,880
Yeah, there would be.

1008
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,560
That's that's interesting because they do have memory.

1009
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:54,320
And I don't know where it's from again of like where you would try to push it up

1010
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:57,600
and it would take about five seconds for it to respond.

1011
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,760
And then that would like really throw me as far as because like if I got too scared,

1012
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,240
then it would take a couple of seconds to come down.

1013
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,280
And that felt like the longest ride possible.

1014
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:09,720
A big problem I think I have and even when I say I'm a nerves by now,

1015
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,920
I'm not like that unnerved by it, but it's on an angle.

1016
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,320
And there's still part of me.

1017
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,280
And maybe it's because I'm kind of tall.

1018
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,240
That makes me feel like since it's on an angle, a little bump because it's bumpy.

1019
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,040
It's not the most smooth ride still.

1020
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,480
Like I feel like I could fly out of it a little bit.

1021
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,480
There's still a feeling of being a little prone, like a little bit.

1022
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,320
You know, there's a seatbelt on it.

1023
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:34,680
But especially when you're up the highest, you're kind of tilted toward the ground.

1024
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,840
So if you're on the inside of Dumbo, it's like I'm leaning.

1025
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:42,000
You can feel your like gravity taking your body a little bit.

1026
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,600
So that's the only reason I say sometimes I feel a little bit unnerved being in it.

1027
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,240
And maybe that's why I don't go on it all the time.

1028
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,360
Also, I don't. It's mostly for children. Sure.

1029
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:56,520
There are incidents of like, you know, the arms cracking or like stuff cry.

1030
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,680
Everyone just kind of scrapes and bruises and, you know, checked out

1031
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,960
and then went about their business.

1032
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,360
You know, well, but that not with the new that's like that's why they replaced it

1033
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,800
entirely. Yeah.

1034
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,160
Is that there were two incidents in a short amount of time.

1035
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:17,200
So it was I think the same one from 55 to 83 when they redid all of Fantasyland,

1036
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,160
then same one from 83 to 89.

1037
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,800
And then there was an accident and then another accident in 90,

1038
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,960
which was the arm snap and clean off.

1039
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,800
Yeah. That's an accident you don't really come back from. Right.

1040
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:34,400
And so they figured maybe we need to have a new Dumbo entirely.

1041
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:39,480
And in a very rare circumstance, I can't imagine when this would ever happen again.

1042
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,040
They had a spare. They literally.

1043
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,880
They had a beautiful, more innate spare. A better one.

1044
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,240
A better one built for Euro Disney.

1045
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,720
But that was going way ahead of time.

1046
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,920
Way ahead of time. Yeah. Yeah.

1047
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,720
They were so early on that.

1048
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,920
So it was just sitting around.

1049
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:59,720
So they just patched in this new Dumbo and made a second one for Euro.

1050
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:04,560
Yeah. And they water water features have been added over the years.

1051
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:10,320
For a long time, the Magic Kingdom did not have the water,

1052
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,520
you know, fountains didn't have the water effects

1053
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,720
because the utility doors were underneath so they couldn't run pipes.

1054
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,280
And then when they moved Dumbo in the early 2010s,

1055
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,880
they were able to match it to all the others.

1056
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,600
They had that part of moving.

1057
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,840
It was to be in a spot where you could have water.

1058
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,440
I well, I think and of course, they duplicated it in Florida.

1059
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,280
Yeah. So Florida, there's a little more to do.

1060
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,080
They'll say this just before getting to the Florida one.

1061
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:41,440
I think some of what stops me from going on

1062
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:46,720
the Disneyland version is very long line without a lot going on.

1063
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,560
Now they put some shade in.

1064
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:53,440
It's a little better than it was, but still it's like a great thing

1065
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,320
to do with no line, which is why the last time I did it was in horrible rain.

1066
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:01,680
When the park was clearing out at night, it was ended up being awful.

1067
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,400
I got so soaked, so soaked waiting for it.

1068
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,960
And then it's building up water inside.

1069
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,240
It was pretty crazy. I wouldn't recommend it.

1070
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,600
But it's one of those I kind of only do with no with no.

1071
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,560
Yes, that's yes.

1072
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:16,400
Though I'm trying to think the last thing the last time we went on was

1073
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,120
midnight, walked by it.

1074
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,760
Hey, yeah, that's a good.

1075
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,600
That's how you do it.

1076
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:25,240
That's like that Dumbo as a childless adult.

1077
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,560
You go on Dumbo when you walk by and you go, hey, no line.

1078
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,960
Yeah, that's like the only time you do it.

1079
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,360
Yeah, because you know what it is.

1080
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,480
You're not going to nothing about this experience is going to surprise you.

1081
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,160
Yeah. And then you can get upwards of half an hour.

1082
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,680
Wait on this thing.

1083
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,960
I would be way more depending on the day. Right.

1084
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:52,400
So that's the big obstacle for me getting on it and probably for other people,

1085
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:57,280
which is why in Florida, they've re thought how lines work.

1086
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,680
Like, was this the first example of a virtual queue or at least one

1087
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:01,920
that the first one is?

1088
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,440
Yeah, modern day Disney virtual queue.

1089
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,200
Well, this this was in 2012.

1090
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,920
It opened as part of their, you know, fantasy land redo.

1091
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:15,120
So right around the time of the rise of like interactive queues,

1092
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,120
which only lasted a few years before they're like, all right,

1093
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,440
then everyone's got a phone to distract, put stuff on their phones.

1094
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:29,960
I was down there in the summer of 2012 and didn't fully know what they had done.

1095
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,480
I knew they moved it and doubled it.

1096
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:38,120
But then, like, was very impressed and shocked by like the play area

1097
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,200
and the the Chili's beeper. Oh, yeah.

1098
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,720
Which is what it is.

1099
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,760
A the actual thing is a it's like a ticket.

1100
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:51,280
And like you've been invited to see Dumbo's performance.

1101
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,240
He's about to go on.

1102
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,920
And it is a ticket.

1103
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,880
Am I correct that Timothy the Mouse talks to you

1104
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,560
well from the beeper or is it just a beep?

1105
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:05,840
I think it just vibrates when you're like like when your table's ready.

1106
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:09,760
I think it's a video where it's like maybe they have not kept this up.

1107
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,800
But where I think that they're I think the intent was that there's a little

1108
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,040
Timothy. Oh, maybe they don't.

1109
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,080
Maybe they just they bought excess from the Cheesecake Factory.

1110
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:21,040
Yeah. My my memory that it vibrates.

1111
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,360
But there was an announcement.

1112
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:25,000
So there's this big and this is where I was referring to.

1113
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,240
Like the circus stuff comes into play because there was a massive indoor play area

1114
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,240
and there was an announcement there in a video I watched where he's like,

1115
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,680
Hello, Circus Performers.

1116
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,480
And it's like, wait, we're performers now.

1117
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,880
OK, OK. The children are.

1118
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,560
This is the idea. OK.

1119
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:47,600
Like you're not necessarily you if you're crawling around in the in the nets,

1120
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:52,960
if you're going up and doing little aerial tricks, I think that is meant to be.

1121
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,600
Well, so you're like the parents are the are like along the wall,

1122
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,000
maybe having a sit.

1123
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,240
But the kids are the acrobats, I think is the notion.

1124
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,160
Wow. That's now I say this.

1125
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:08,360
Had I watched a video about it, you went there in person and their subtext

1126
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,200
was maybe not conveyed, which is a frequent issue.

1127
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,480
I think it was like 1030 at night and it was reasonably empty.

1128
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,160
So I was just kind of like, oh, this is smart.

1129
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,680
Kids love play areas.

1130
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,160
And watching the video back, I was like, are there kids who are just like,

1131
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,240
I don't really care about riding the ride again.

1132
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,040
I just want to go back to that play area and climb around.

1133
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,240
Yeah, probably. Probably. Yeah.

1134
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,600
It seems like a good one.

1135
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:34,160
There's that building on fire, which I don't like in the context

1136
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,440
of it's going to hurt Dumbo.

1137
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,280
Yeah, but I like it in the context of a thing for kids to do.

1138
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,920
There's clown firefighters.

1139
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,840
Uh huh. There's Dumbo spinning around the ceiling, flying around the ceiling.

1140
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,520
Yeah, it seems nice.

1141
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:51,040
It seems like they did a good job without like a mega budget, I bet.

1142
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:55,480
And and the idea like creating a little experience that you get to have.

1143
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:00,240
That's fun and fills up the time instead of you're just doing back and forth

1144
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,560
and back and forth and seeing nothing. Yeah.

1145
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:05,200
And then there's two Dumbo. I think that's pretty cool.

1146
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,480
Why would there only need to be one?

1147
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,960
I feel like if there were not an issue of space in Disneyland or all of them,

1148
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,360
you know, they should do it in all of them.

1149
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,080
It's it's trying to. Yeah.

1150
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:17,080
And they successfully did it in other because they have room in Disney World

1151
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,080
to do it out here.

1152
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:21,000
They've changed the queue recently to make it a little nicer.

1153
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,240
There's no room to do something major with it. Right.

1154
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,960
They demolish all of Mickey's Toontown Fair.

1155
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,000
That's where a lot of this is on top of now.

1156
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,760
Right. Yes. Right. Right. In Florida. Yes.

1157
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:36,360
But yeah, there's not a lot of room unless they were to move Dumbo to like Toontown.

1158
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,040
But that's a construction war zone right now. Yeah.

1159
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,360
Which probably doesn't make sense to do it either.

1160
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,640
But I guess they were trying.

1161
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:48,760
They probably I'm trying to think like they all the other like iconic Disney rides,

1162
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:53,240
I guess, other than teacups, have a lot more themed of a line

1163
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:56,080
of a themed experience feeling like you're walking through it versus,

1164
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,240
yeah, what you're saying, Dumbo is just like switch back,

1165
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,560
switch back and can be very long. Yeah.

1166
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:04,800
And sucks a little of the magic out of it, probably waiting.

1167
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,920
Well, Alice is like that, too.

1168
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,600
But a very satisfying ride at the end. Yeah, that's true.

1169
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,680
Yeah, that's true.

1170
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,200
Yeah. Oh, yeah. You got nothing there.

1171
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,040
The other ones that you at least have a little indoor.

1172
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,880
You get to write, like, you know, peaks of the dungeon.

1173
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,560
You go in their little house kind of first before.

1174
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,640
Yeah, that kind of keeps you in it. Motivated.

1175
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,160
Yeah, right. You need to be motivated.

1176
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:29,000
Al is probably one of the best classic Disney movies.

1177
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,040
Holds up as a movie.

1178
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,200
Beautiful. Yeah.

1179
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,360
I have no problem with that.

1180
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,360
Yeah. We did the episode.

1181
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,960
I was like, oh, I loved Alice in Wonderland as a kid.

1182
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,160
Like, I completely forgot how much I liked it or loved it.

1183
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,080
I think it's part of why you could maybe just bail on Dumbo entirely,

1184
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:49,440
because I think there's better like psychedelic trippy animation

1185
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,440
in Alice and Heffalumps and Woozles.

1186
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,800
I will say I'm a big Heffalumps and Woozles fan.

1187
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,480
What about like a Disney movie that sort of retcons out the original version?

1188
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,520
So it was like Dumbo teams up with Peter Pan teams up.

1189
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,960
Like any of the movies you don't like, you take the character out

1190
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,880
and you combine them into like a team up movie where it's just fun.

1191
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,720
As I said, I like Dumbo.

1192
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:14,800
So, yeah, I mean, Dumbo, like I think, look, Peter Pan needs a wardrobe change.

1193
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,480
OK, fine. He needs to happen.

1194
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,920
He needs an attitude change.

1195
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,920
What do you dress Peter Pan up in this version, this hypothetical version?

1196
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,400
What's he wearing?

1197
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,760
Just a suit. OK, all right.

1198
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,560
He can wear that's my problem with Hook is that I think he had it right to begin with.

1199
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,760
He shouldn't have missed his kids baseball games and everything,

1200
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,200
but he was dressed appropriately for his age.

1201
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,760
I don't want to see Robin in the in the unitard.

1202
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,120
Y'all in banger rank.

1203
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:45,840
I think he he he should have combined aspects of his adult life

1204
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,600
with his former free spirit.

1205
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:52,000
So, yeah, dress Peter Pan should be dressed like banning.

1206
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:55,000
Oh, you got your wish, but it's one of those suits they wear in Hawaii

1207
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,840
where the pants are very short, where it's a little shorts.

1208
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,360
Goes with a blazer, a blue blazer compromise.

1209
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,720
You have to. Yeah, you got it.

1210
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,000
That's a good compromise.

1211
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,480
I guess I can manage that.

1212
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,160
I have to see it on paper.

1213
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:10,800
But like Magnapie's friend, who was always wearing the suits, I feel like.

1214
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,560
I like that. Yes. Yeah.

1215
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:18,320
Why? Why am I more like I'm more OK with it on a 70 year old man than on a child?

1216
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:21,880
Well, as on this podcast, we're more comfortable with anything on a 70 year old man.

1217
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:26,120
Yeah, that's just the more comfortable when talking about 70. Yes.

1218
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:31,160
I where were we besides the most expendables?

1219
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:36,000
I don't I don't want to just be cynical for the sake of being cynical,

1220
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,000
but I was like racking my brain of like, why didn't they do more

1221
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,760
cues like this for like kids rides and stuff where it's like

1222
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,320
you wait in a play area and they call you when it's your turn.

1223
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,960
And I was like come up with was like, well, it was probably a little expensive.

1224
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,400
And then also they couldn't figure out a way to monetize it.

1225
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,240
You know, they couldn't scale it to like, what can we add on to this?

1226
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:02,360
You know, like the answer obviously is to do what restaurants do

1227
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:06,000
and have the buzzers feature ads for local real estate agents.

1228
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,560
The way things are going at Disney right now, I wouldn't

1229
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:15,120
put it in some lady in a blazer with houses and Lama Rada.

1230
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,840
They they've they've been cutting some corners on things.

1231
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,200
A little bit. Yeah.

1232
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:24,840
If old Bobby can get a couple more dollars space here.

1233
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:31,800
Yeah. Now, there's something I knew about none of this.

1234
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,840
I don't know if you guys did it all.

1235
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:38,560
This what has happened where there's the it's called the Storybook Circus area.

1236
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:43,320
Yes. The new that the little Dumbo zone in Florida now.

1237
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,760
There was talk in the mid 70s

1238
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,600
of a Dumbo specific area

1239
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,960
that was the plan of Tony Baxter.

1240
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,760
Do you guys know about this?

1241
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:59,320
I think we maybe I don't say to keep going.

1242
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:02,880
Dumbo's Circus land was was the notion here.

1243
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:09,480
And as part of his, the whole big reroute that he wanted to do with Discovery Bay,

1244
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,440
he I'm trying to think of the he basically like

1245
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:16,960
Tony was so up on all of the expansion pads.

1246
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:22,320
I feel like he, you know, he wanted to do stuff in what became Galaxy's Edge.

1247
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:25,320
And that's that's what Discovery Bay would have been.

1248
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:30,760
And he also was trying to do this little Dumbo area

1249
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:36,760
in what became Videopolis and then Fantasyland Theater and a little bit of Toontown.

1250
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:40,600
Basically, the idea here was that

1251
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:46,440
Fantasyland is where the cartoon characters live, the classic cartoons.

1252
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:50,280
But shouldn't those mostly be regal?

1253
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,440
Doesn't it make the most sense when that space is devoted to

1254
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,920
princesses and King Arthur and all that?

1255
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:01,520
So what if we separate the Fantasyland ideas

1256
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:08,200
and kind of all the random characters who don't make sense in in a kingdom?

1257
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,960
Now they just, you know, now they've just said fuck all with all that.

1258
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,920
And Winnie the Pooh is just in Fantasyland Magic Kingdom.

1259
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,200
That doesn't match at all.

1260
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:20,760
But Tony, with his wanting to make everything themed, of course,

1261
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:24,160
he was going to build this little area, kind of.

1262
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,960
It's as I said, like Videopolis, small world.

1263
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:32,320
And it would have been a circus where so they would have moved Dumbo.

1264
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:36,400
That's part of it. Right. And then a what was the ride called?

1265
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,480
I'm looking at Circus Disney.

1266
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,520
Is the name of it.

1267
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:45,520
And it would have been a ride where all kind of all of the characters,

1268
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:48,920
they aren't using are part of the circus.

1269
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:53,800
So suddenly like Baloo, Baloo is not really anywhere in the parks, particularly.

1270
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:57,400
So he's in this all the bears bongo, all these things that we don't really

1271
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,000
they aren't trying to service bongo.

1272
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,840
So this is like Toontown before Toontown, essentially.

1273
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:05,400
All the whimsical Toon characters are in one spot hanging out.

1274
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1275
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:13,880
And yeah. And to that end, another thing would have been a Mickey attraction

1276
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:18,960
that would have been black and white and the vibe of the old slapstick

1277
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,680
mayhem kind of silent peony,

1278
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:26,720
like a ride that is taking you into the early Mickey movies.

1279
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:33,000
And that would have been a wild mouse in the dark, save for clips of the old movies.

1280
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,880
So it's like a crazy hijinks, you know,

1281
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:40,720
like the little stunts that Mickey's doing in the early days,

1282
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,120
but where you wouldn't have known where any drop is coming.

1283
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:47,520
Right. All of Space Mountain called Mickey's madhouse.

1284
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:50,120
Whoa. Yeah, that's pretty good.

1285
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,600
It is good. They've essentially done this with the Joker.

1286
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:55,480
We've come across in terms of Batman rides.

1287
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:01,160
The Joker, a person who makes sense to have a madhouse or be stuck in one.

1288
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:02,480
Right, though.

1289
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,680
I mean, I had to change the name of that, I think, at this point.

1290
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,720
But it's a fun sounding thing.

1291
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:12,760
Yeah, no, it sounds yeah, it sounds like it.

1292
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,000
And that also sounds like kind of like Runaway Railway.

1293
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
It's like all this stuff is sort of precursor ideas.

1294
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:22,400
They ended up with like now there is a circus tent thing.

1295
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,960
It's just not this full circus ride.

1296
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:29,000
But that notion of separating the circus and having a circus zone, they did

1297
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,640
a crazy early Mickey vibe attraction.

1298
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:37,040
They did. One thing they didn't do, though, they were basically like.

1299
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:40,480
So he Tony also wanted a way to

1300
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:45,080
you could walk around the corner and get to that area, or

1301
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,960
he wanted there to be a way to the ties together Discovery Bay

1302
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:54,520
with its inventors and Jules Verne and all that with the circus area.

1303
01:06:54,520 --> 01:07:00,000
So he wanted to do something called Professor Professor Marvel's Balloon Descent.

1304
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,240
And this was a little hotter balloon ride.

1305
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,440
That's a ride in and of itself.

1306
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:08,520
But it's also like a second skyway, basically, that takes you up over a hill

1307
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,600
and gets you into this circus zone.

1308
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,320
But Professor Marvel is a Wizard of Oz thing.

1309
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:20,120
One of these Tony, you know, I feel like he was pushing for something Oz related.

1310
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,760
And then there's the James Franco movie.

1311
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,720
And maybe this is the chance. And there's still no Oz.

1312
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:30,040
Anyway, there's like this kind of famous photo of Tony working on the model

1313
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,720
of Discovery Bay, you might recognize this picture.

1314
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:36,520
And where his hands are and what he's working on is this.

1315
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:40,480
I just don't know how I missed this for so long, but there you see balloons

1316
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,800
and you see a new location of Dumbo and Circus Tent.

1317
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,480
It's a little modest zone.

1318
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,840
And I miss this. This picture looks familiar.

1319
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,760
But yeah, I didn't realize that's what this is.

1320
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,000
There's also I'm looking at it.

1321
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,520
It says there was an unnamed Pinocchio attraction,

1322
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:57,440
which was a predecessor during Journey that would have included

1323
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,920
Stromboli's Theater in the Queue, where guests could watch puppet

1324
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:02,440
performances while waiting to board.

1325
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:03,840
And who doesn't love that?

1326
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:09,920
Yes. Yes. Malicious puppet performances where there's a vibe.

1327
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:13,120
There's something something off about this.

1328
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,920
Why does this puppet theater smell?

1329
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,600
Why do I hear people screaming in the back?

1330
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:23,440
Mm hmm. Tony said they were pumping in secondhand smoke the whole time, too.

1331
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:26,440
That was going to make it more authentic to the film.

1332
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:29,520
But yeah, there's a lot of these interesting photos here. Mm hmm.

1333
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:31,960
They all look very cool.

1334
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:34,600
I am I am imagining modern day

1335
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:39,120
height of summer holiday crowds trying to navigate some of these pathways.

1336
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:42,600
Oh, you wanted to think about the scale of some of these. Yeah. Yeah.

1337
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,240
It wouldn't have been an easy way to do it.

1338
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:49,200
But as a kid, I would always feel you'd always get an extra thrill

1339
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,840
when you would see a character that was newer or more.

1340
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:57,680
Yeah, I guess just newer or fresher from a movie immediately.

1341
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:01,520
So it would be nice to have something and not that this would be it.

1342
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,000
But like Circus Disney or something where you're like,

1343
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:07,320
all the characters are here that aren't in other rides,

1344
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:08,760
because I want to see all of them.

1345
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,080
And that's what Marvel that's what you got to give Marvel

1346
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:14,960
credit for for their land is because like they got like weird

1347
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,280
like Loki comes out like a day after the show premieres.

1348
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:22,560
Loki in multiple outfits, multiple outfits, multiple versions of Loki,

1349
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,680
the one in the jumpsuit, the regular one.

1350
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,840
Yeah. Like as a kid, that would be so thrilling.

1351
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:30,760
Shang-Chi, the Eternals Hawkeye, like everyone.

1352
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:34,960
Yes, it seems like that's so so just having a spot in Disney

1353
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:40,680
to like park people without rides would like still they still need to kind of do

1354
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,920
that, obviously, like walk around characters is the easiest way.

1355
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,480
But sure. A ride, a permanent ride.

1356
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:48,640
Do you like if Robin Hood was in the park, we want to see Robin Hood.

1357
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,080
Yeah, you know, we did.

1358
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,120
Robin would have he would have ended up in this.

1359
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,600
Yes, exactly. Yeah.

1360
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:59,280
Oh, yeah, we we met Robin Hood in the whole gang back in the Big Thunder Ranch area.

1361
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,040
But they're not these brag.

1362
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:04,680
Well, have you ever seen Robin Hood?

1363
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,160
It's very exciting.

1364
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,200
Yeah, I don't send.

1365
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,680
And you had a Hawkeye.

1366
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:13,320
You had, oh, yeah, a Target shirt on David Hawkeye.

1367
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:18,240
Yes, logo years before the years before it inspired the show.

1368
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:21,760
The comic and they were doing like gags of like shooting out like

1369
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,800
like Target, we're going to shoot an arrow and that was confused at their bit

1370
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,520
because they were like pointing at like Robin was going to shoot me.

1371
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,120
And I was like, oh, wait, what?

1372
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,520
And then he like grabbed me and like was positioning me.

1373
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,000
And I was like, what is he talking?

1374
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,120
And I went, oh, I have a target on my shirt.

1375
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:37,640
Yeah. Oh, very hot.

1376
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:40,040
When you were wearing, I forgot what I was wearing.

1377
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,360
And yes, we all do.

1378
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:43,680
So Robin Hood was going to shoot you.

1379
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:45,000
He's going to kill me. Yeah.

1380
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,800
Robin Hood was threatening to kill me.

1381
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,400
And I loved it.

1382
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,960
But I can't send him out.

1383
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,200
Yeah, I guess that's true.

1384
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,080
The arrow people.

1385
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:55,560
So, yeah, that's that's a cool.

1386
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:56,960
Never. Yeah, that.

1387
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,360
Yeah, I never knew about that zone.

1388
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:02,440
I would love to see like all the artwork that exists.

1389
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,560
If that area was around, it might be feel a little out of date now.

1390
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,120
Or maybe they would have done something to it.

1391
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,840
But I like we look at those balloons.

1392
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,440
It would have felt so 70s.

1393
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:14,600
It would have felt like 70s knots, which is a compliment to me.

1394
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,400
There's a vibe to 70s knots.

1395
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,480
That is what it's attractive.

1396
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:21,040
I think at Disneyland specifically, it would have been changed already,

1397
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,840
I'm guessing, to not have that vibe.

1398
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,040
Yeah. Disney World, who all bets are off.

1399
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,920
But Disneyland, I think, would have been changed.

1400
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:30,080
I love you said Tony Baxter is always up on the plots of land.

1401
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,960
And he still obviously was when we interviewed him two years ago.

1402
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,120
Implied all these zones.

1403
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:39,080
And was was he implying the weird stuff they're thinking about now?

1404
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,240
That's what I have every parcel of land.

1405
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:42,280
Yeah. Parking lot.

1406
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:43,480
Did we talk about that already?

1407
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:44,960
Probably we did. But we might have made that connection.

1408
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:49,080
There's the expansion loose plans that we don't even know what the status of that.

1409
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,240
Well, I got to know Disneyland forward.

1410
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,960
I signed up for every possible email, like update on it.

1411
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,040
That anyone could do.

1412
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:01,240
But they were like mainly eyeing like Anaheim residents.

1413
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,480
And there was like update on Disneyland forward.

1414
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,240
We have an exciting presentation.

1415
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,240
I was like, oh, yeah, here we go.

1416
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:12,240
And it was just that we're going to do a digital screening of the first episode

1417
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,760
of a show we call the Imagineering story.

1418
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,200
And I'm like, are you kidding me?

1419
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,800
Like you just like log into this like

1420
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:24,960
zoom or this live chat to watch the first episode of a show

1421
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:29,000
that you have on your streaming service and probably upload it to YouTube

1422
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,320
for free or something like what?

1423
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:32,960
What is this?

1424
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,560
They all Anaheim hasn't voted out real quick.

1425
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,720
The Disneyland forward thing is they put out this big like hypothetical map

1426
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:42,440
of a major expansion of both Disneyland and California venture.

1427
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:45,640
But basically, they were just putting it together to tell Anaheim,

1428
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:49,400
just give us blanket approval to make whatever we want on the land we own.

1429
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:52,480
So it can be a hotel, it can be a ride, it can be whatever we want.

1430
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:54,520
Yeah, like they they own the land.

1431
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:58,520
They can kind of do whatever they want, but they need to get the zoning tweaked.

1432
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:01,040
Yes, exactly, because they don't have necessarily this parts

1433
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,080
next to the hotel aren't zoned for a theme park yet.

1434
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,760
So they just want to sign off on all of it.

1435
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,480
But they haven't even voted on that, right?

1436
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:07,760
I don't think so.

1437
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:13,600
And it also like those were real blue sky plan because like it's a little insane

1438
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:19,040
where it's like, OK, so it were both parks would now wrap around the Disneyland hotel.

1439
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,440
There'd be bridges going over the roads.

1440
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,520
And like here there was little doodles if you squint like,

1441
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,840
it's like, is that Avatar? Is that Wakanda?

1442
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,040
Yeah, I love it. Rides everywhere.

1443
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,920
I love it, too. Using Mishmash.

1444
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,720
Why is that hotel sticking out of the middle of the theme park?

1445
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:38,680
Yeah, so it's certainly

1446
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,280
for it's new.

1447
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:45,400
I've never considered like this, but it's also like, OK.

1448
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,480
Are you saying you don't think it's going to happen?

1449
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:49,840
Well, no, it's going to happen in some form.

1450
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:53,120
But if they build, if they did everything in that concept art, it's like,

1451
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,200
this is the most densely.

1452
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:58,920
Well, didn't they say it was like, we'll complete all this by like 2050 or something.

1453
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,880
Wasn't it like some crazy long timeline?

1454
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,800
It was probably like at least a 10 or 20 year plan, because there was also like,

1455
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,200
we're going to build Disney Springs on top of parking lot.

1456
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,400
Right. And we really we got very excited.

1457
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,800
The idea of Gideon's being built. Oh, sure.

1458
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,800
Yeah. Jock Lindsay's and yeah, everything.

1459
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:18,040
So now you're you're excited about possibly a bakery

1460
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:22,520
that along line closer to where you live, but still still a big drive

1461
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,720
where then you go and wait in a two hour line.

1462
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:26,960
That's right. Perhaps longer.

1463
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:31,760
Thrilled in like 18 years at like at least.

1464
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:36,720
When I'm in my late 60s, I I'm going to be so excited to wait in a line.

1465
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,400
It's what I what I will be at a point where they're like,

1466
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,640
you really should not be eating these cookies.

1467
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,560
Your body does not agree with this.

1468
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,240
Mr. Sheridan, you cannot go to this Gideon's one more time.

1469
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:50,120
Your doctor Gideon's will kill you.

1470
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:52,080
Your doctor is calling you over and over again.

1471
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,880
I know where you are. I heard about where you are.

1472
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:57,640
There's a surveillance thing now.

1473
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,720
We're doctors. Yeah, someone.

1474
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:03,080
Someone is scanning the line daily now.

1475
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:06,320
There's like a like a futuristic helicopter trying to get Jason to

1476
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:10,360
like doctor has sent like a retrieval helicopter to get him from

1477
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:13,000
to get him from the Gideon's line.

1478
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,720
Jason has our laser gun shooting at it.

1479
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,320
It's the far future, folks.

1480
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:20,160
So far future shooting at the doctor's helicopter.

1481
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:24,680
Now you have to get you get deployed as in a Seinfeld esque manner.

1482
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,440
Kramer can't go to the.

1483
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,000
Oh, right, right. The grocery store anymore.

1484
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,560
Well, right, because they're not.

1485
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:35,240
Yeah. So it's like in the future, you have to have a certain like

1486
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:39,360
blood glucose level or like blood pressure to be able to purchase cookies.

1487
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,240
That's how the future is.

1488
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:43,320
So Jason's is off the charts.

1489
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,360
Mine is still a little more manageable at the time.

1490
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,800
That's the future. Michelle Obama wants.

1491
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:50,320
Exactly. I will not eat your healthy snacks.

1492
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,680
And don't you teach my kids that. Right.

1493
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:55,120
So so I have to go purchase them.

1494
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:58,920
Now, generally, the future they monitor you eating.

1495
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:02,040
You have to when you purchase it, it makes it like ties it to your social

1496
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:05,600
security number and then the sort of implants you have in your stomach.

1497
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:08,520
It registers to make sure that's the food you're eating.

1498
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:10,640
But Jason, I have to figure some way out.

1499
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,840
I have to like regurgitate the cookie into his mouth.

1500
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,400
Taking a very blade runner.

1501
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:18,720
William Gibson has this is a cyber universe.

1502
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:21,040
Cyber to our future.

1503
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,560
This is when Disney is completed their Disneyland forward.

1504
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:29,720
So Mike's 300 page graphic novel, Gideon's 2062,

1505
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:34,280
that ends with me throwing up some cookies into Jason's mouth

1506
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,640
in her older age.

1507
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,080
Yeah, it's like beautiful.

1508
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,440
It is like people are reading the graphic novel thing.

1509
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:45,160
Like, I don't know where this is going, but the artwork is so good.

1510
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,680
This could be the next dune.

1511
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:47,760
This looks fantastic.

1512
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,760
And then they get to the last page and it's

1513
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,440
this about two older men

1514
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,040
exchanging ground up.

1515
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,480
Look, this is the this is what Joe Rogan is a warning is against.

1516
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:03,040
That's all I'm saying.

1517
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,640
This is what he's daily warning.

1518
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,800
Yeah. Cookie regurgitation scenario.

1519
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:10,000
Anything anything left?

1520
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,320
I have just a little like I think maybe one one thing to mention about Dumbo is the

1521
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:20,480
as we talked about, we did an episode about the Skyway a while back and

1522
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:24,320
the Skyway buckets being among the most desirable auction.

1523
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,440
I guess. Yeah.

1524
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:29,400
And probably maybe maybe number one again could be,

1525
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:33,920
you know, could be neck and neck with Mad Tea Party having a teacup.

1526
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,320
But I don't know. Probably is Dumbo.

1527
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:37,280
I would think the one that you'd most want to own.

1528
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,560
I think so.

1529
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:42,040
Yeah. So thirty thousand dollars mentioned for.

1530
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,440
I mean, a long time ago.

1531
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,080
Yeah. This long time ago.

1532
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:49,920
I looked up the the most recent that I'm aware of.

1533
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:55,880
Big public sale of a of a Dumbo, which is that the that's from Disneyland

1534
01:17:55,880 --> 01:18:00,280
Gallery, where we did a show with with old Richard Kraft, who we know.

1535
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,600
Richard Kraft, I think in the early 90s,

1536
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:07,000
before his agent career had taken off.

1537
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:09,680
So he did not have the money to do this.

1538
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:13,080
He had to like he was at an auction knowing what his cap was.

1539
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,720
It went way past the cap.

1540
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:18,360
Bought it. Bought a Dumbo for thirty five thousand dollars.

1541
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:23,000
Kept going higher and higher and higher with a bidder on a phone

1542
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:26,240
who was rumored to possibly be Michael Jackson.

1543
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,360
Kraft stuck it out. He got it.

1544
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:33,960
Years later, does the gallery in the abandoned sports authority

1545
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,800
sets the price at 150 K, ends up going for four hundred and eighty three K.

1546
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,320
Geez, we from a thirty five thousand dollar

1547
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:46,920
lord, and that is one item that was sold at that.

1548
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,000
Do we know who bought it?

1549
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,480
I don't think we don't know.

1550
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,920
No, no, no. Tree buyer Michael Jackson from beyond the grave.

1551
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,720
Maybe it was Michael Jackson.

1552
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:57,640
Yeah, he celebrated by doing the thriller dance.

1553
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,840
We do know that John Stamos owns one.

1554
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,000
The other major Disney collector.

1555
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,000
There's this was this is I think also from the those specials

1556
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,320
that they were doing. Yeah.

1557
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,640
Well, in early Zoom years, years.

1558
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:12,720
I think that's correct.

1559
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:15,400
Yes. Early in early early pandemic Zoom years.

1560
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,160
So big celebrities would make a point, I think, of like,

1561
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:21,440
let me choose the most plain room in my house to do this thing

1562
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,120
and pretend that I'm a normal human being.

1563
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,600
John Stamos is on a Disney special.

1564
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,320
He's like, I'm going to show the elephant.

1565
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,320
I got to show up.

1566
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:30,280
An elephant. And if you had an elephant, why wouldn't you?

1567
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:34,000
Yeah, I wonder how much could you get like like a Nick Offerman

1568
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,600
to build that for you or something like maybe not even a non-sola.

1569
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,960
Like how much could you actually just have somebody fabricate one?

1570
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:44,080
Hmm. Ten grand fiberglass.

1571
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,760
Yeah, I don't know. That's a tough thing.

1572
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:46,880
Twenty grand. I think.

1573
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,920
Yeah, maybe that's too tough. Pretty specialized.

1574
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:53,200
But then don't it isn't some of the appeal that, oh, of course, that money.

1575
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:57,000
Well, then it was they like this was in the park.

1576
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,080
Yeah, for sure it is.

1577
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:01,360
I'm just saying, like, if you wanted to at least have the vibe.

1578
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,320
Yeah, maybe. Yeah.

1579
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:06,720
You could still get it for a normal crazy amount of money,

1580
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,080
not an insane, crazy amount of money.

1581
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:11,000
Mm hmm. You're a fiberglass artisan.

1582
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,760
Yeah. Big scale.

1583
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:15,800
Let us know if you do giant fiberglass sculpture.

1584
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:18,560
How many fiberglass artisans are there in the audience?

1585
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:22,560
Because maybe they're so are there podcasts for you?

1586
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,200
Are there podcasts that are all about sculpting fiberglass?

1587
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:25,920
Oh, there's got to be. There are.

1588
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:26,640
That's interesting.

1589
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:28,600
That's a piece of an interesting thing, because we've talked about,

1590
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,920
like, what piece we would want to own from the parks.

1591
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:34,720
But if the option was just have somebody build one for us,

1592
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,760
that would be a hell of a lot cheaper.

1593
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:39,400
And it's like if you could have somebody build you an original Rex.

1594
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:44,200
Yeah. Like that would cost one 20th of the.

1595
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:48,800
I guess I don't need to know that it was actually from the park. Yeah.

1596
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:52,400
But it'd have to be so good, though.

1597
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:58,000
Right. I think I worry you'd be able to tell it's got to be just perfectly.

1598
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:00,320
Yeah. I mean, we met on the end.

1599
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:03,560
The last that 80s night, Lindsay and I went to, we got to take a photo

1600
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,120
up close with Rex. Mm hmm.

1601
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,840
Very exciting. Bragging again.

1602
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,480
Yeah. So sorry.

1603
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:11,160
Sometimes I have to drop the names.

1604
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,960
I have a couple of things as we wrap up.

1605
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,160
The one big historical anecdote I kept saying about this ride

1606
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:20,720
was that Harry Truman, when visiting the park, refused to ride this ride

1607
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:23,440
as the elephant is a symbol of the Republican Party.

1608
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:26,920
He was a Democrat, took a stand, would not ride the elephant ride,

1609
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:30,200
dropped two atomic bombs on Japan, but he took a stand on this one.

1610
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,240
That could sully his whole legacy.

1611
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:34,560
Could as well as a legacy of the man who bombed

1612
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:36,600
in a horrific way.

1613
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:41,560
There was also the Disney Parks blog, which used to update a lot more

1614
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:46,400
in the 2010s, had like an anniversary post about Dumbo.

1615
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:50,160
And I just saw this very funny comments on it.

1616
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:53,880
Dumbo ride is certainly a favorite.

1617
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:55,360
We are Disneyland regulars.

1618
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:59,280
After 15, about 15 years ago, my then three year old nephew

1619
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:03,800
was so excited to choose his Dumbo that he didn't see another child

1620
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:07,560
run into him accidentally bumping him into the water of the ride.

1621
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,320
Fortunately, a good Samaritan jumped the fence.

1622
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:14,400
And fished Martin out by his collar.

1623
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:18,280
Thanks go out to that man and everyone else who saved the day.

1624
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:23,960
Every time we pass the Dumbo ride now, we recall how nice everyone was that day.

1625
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:27,960
Oh, now a couple of things going on there.

1626
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:32,920
One, that's about a foot of water under that ride.

1627
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:37,400
And two, man, if you're going to hop the fence, get in the water.

1628
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:39,880
Why are you fishing them out like a stray cat?

1629
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,320
Where are you picking them up with the collar?

1630
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:44,880
Yeah, you can grab them.

1631
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,600
Just grabbing the kid like, come here.

1632
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:49,000
You like grab them by the scruff.

1633
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,760
I'm going fishing.

1634
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,200
Yeah. Wow.

1635
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,800
I've never seen anything like that happen.

1636
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:56,360
No, that's that's pretty that's pretty dramatic.

1637
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:00,840
Did I say on the podcast that I saw a kid lose a tooth on the Incredicoaster?

1638
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:03,960
I don't think so. This is very dramatic.

1639
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:07,840
I was there solo a couple of months ago and I was in the single rider lines.

1640
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,840
I was on like the other side and not where you normally load from.

1641
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:17,280
But so I'm watching people get off and there is a kid just like screaming

1642
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:22,000
bloody murder and and like clearly bleeding from the mouth.

1643
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:24,360
It was really like, what happened here?

1644
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:27,560
Oh, my God. And then it turned out it was a tooth miss.

1645
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:32,640
And watching a dad go and scramble and like, stop, stop.

1646
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:36,480
And like they wouldn't let them let the train go because like,

1647
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,640
we have to find the tooth.

1648
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:41,160
Wait, OK. So you were waiting to launch.

1649
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:44,040
I wasn't on the ride yet.

1650
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:49,280
OK, I was. Yeah, I was waiting to be called up to go on the elevator and and go around.

1651
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,200
And I'm watching this very dramatic situation.

1652
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:55,440
Oh, wow. I watched the mother be called.

1653
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,600
It's like, oh, no.

1654
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,200
It was like, boy, there was a height for five minutes.

1655
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,360
This is one of the craziest.

1656
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,440
They're the only thing I've ever seen.

1657
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:08,160
You know, that's there are little plays that happen all during the day,

1658
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:11,360
especially when you're an older gentleman going alone.

1659
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:14,960
Mm hmm. Nothing to do but watch when you don't have to watch your own.

1660
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,760
I did almost the exact same solo Disney Day

1661
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,920
last year back when things were a little better, where I think I went to I went

1662
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,160
to California Adventure.

1663
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:26,160
I drank a beer. I went on a credit coaster.

1664
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:29,400
I did some work on my computer and went back to the Marvel area.

1665
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,400
Drank a beer as well, went to Guardians and went home.

1666
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:35,840
Just shut it, chilled out and did a little work.

1667
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:40,880
But I saw the craziest child crying

1668
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:43,400
and their parents trying to force them to go on Tower of Terror,

1669
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:45,480
the Guardians Tower. No.

1670
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:48,200
And I've seen this happen a couple of times, but never this dramatic.

1671
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:50,480
And what you're saying, like, this was just a scene.

1672
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:53,400
And it was the same thing where you were like this.

1673
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:54,960
What am I watching here?

1674
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,400
This child is going to lose their mind.

1675
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:01,600
And these parents are not allowing this child to get out of this.

1676
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:05,840
And an employee had to come up and tell them like, you can just switch.

1677
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,800
You can do a child switch, basically.

1678
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:11,080
And they had to be talked into it.

1679
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:14,400
They were and that was not they know we need you.

1680
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,280
I couldn't believe this.

1681
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:18,920
This child was melting down.

1682
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:22,240
And as a child who didn't melt down, but wanted to, is it like,

1683
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:27,720
you know, and melted down recently in a in a escape room situation.

1684
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:31,000
I felt felt for the kid.

1685
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,680
But like it happens a lot when you're especially with not with anyone

1686
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:39,400
where you're just noticing like this something scary playing out basically.

1687
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,120
This is crazy. Yeah.

1688
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,600
Dairy. They should be taken away.

1689
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,040
Disney should have taken the kid away.

1690
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:48,120
Well, I felt like being like you should get as the property of the Disney company.

1691
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,120
You want to get out here?

1692
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:53,240
I'm not to live with me. I'm just saying I'll help.

1693
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,640
I'll help with the situation because these parents are being assholes.

1694
01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:00,360
I also can't what I can't like, look, I'm I'm I'm new to this

1695
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:02,680
and I'm new to tantrum.

1696
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:06,880
Tantrum is very new for for my kid in the last month or so.

1697
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,040
We're heading to the two year old point.

1698
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:15,760
It's just they make it so unpleasant when they you're trying to get them

1699
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,640
to do something that they don't want to do that.

1700
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:20,280
So far, it has been like, oh, come on, you want to.

1701
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:21,800
OK, I'd screw it here.

1702
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:22,840
Give them the give them the thing.

1703
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:23,840
Yeah, right. Take them out here.

1704
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:27,560
I mean, we have about like it's a it's a one exchange.

1705
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:30,080
We got about five seconds in us before we just relent.

1706
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:33,840
Yeah, I it's hard for me to imagine you are going to go up.

1707
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:37,680
You're getting in the tower that lightning is hitting.

1708
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:41,120
That's full of ghosts and screams.

1709
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:45,760
Yeah, it's like like or Pat Bennett hit me with your best shot.

1710
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:47,800
It's going to play loudly. Yeah.

1711
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,000
And try to write that.

1712
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,680
Yeah, it's a less scary one, but that doesn't make it.

1713
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:55,560
You're going to go up into this tower and appreciate some loud classic rock.

1714
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:57,840
Yeah, well, it is now.

1715
01:26:57,840 --> 01:26:59,840
Look, I can get behind that logic, but

1716
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:04,600
yeah, if it was like Pinocchio or something, OK, yes.

1717
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:07,200
I go look, oh, the kid probably won't be so scared.

1718
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:10,080
Maybe and you know, this is a kid who gets a little scared

1719
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,320
and then like is OK on the ride.

1720
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:12,160
That's a phenomenon.

1721
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:14,440
But that was not the case with this child.

1722
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,560
Yeah, this child was crying

1723
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:20,360
at 100 from the time we got loaded into the numbers.

1724
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:23,440
And I was like, no, what are we going to do?

1725
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:26,360
Please. And like employees negotiating with the parents.

1726
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,120
And maybe they didn't understand what they were talking about.

1727
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:31,960
I don't know. But it was like and they had like two.

1728
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:34,000
There were two parents. There were a couple of kids.

1729
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,520
So it was like one of the parents cannot go on it.

1730
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:39,680
I hate being I hate being that per like adult being like,

1731
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,440
you don't need to go on this. You're an adult.

1732
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,520
And then be like, well, what's your problem, pal?

1733
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:47,080
Who are you with? I'm alone.

1734
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:49,360
Yeah, just doing some work down here.

1735
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:53,040
Yeah, it's a little hard to like pull a child screaming that much.

1736
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,800
It's like, all right, let's do the halt method.

1737
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:58,160
You know, are you hungry, angry, lonely or tired?

1738
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:59,360
Which is it, pal?

1739
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:00,960
You know, the kid could talk also.

1740
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,920
It was not like a two year old.

1741
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:05,640
No, but I mean, Scott, you can take some comfort in the fact

1742
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:07,840
that they call it the terrific twos, right?

1743
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:09,200
Oh, yeah. Oh, boy.

1744
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:12,080
That's the universal term applied.

1745
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:15,440
They call it. That's true.

1746
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:17,280
Yeah, I can't wait. Yeah.

1747
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:20,720
From recent implications, it'll be a terrific year.

1748
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,120
Anything else before we go out?

1749
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:26,800
I've got a little I've just got some photos of some

1750
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:29,120
some dignitaries who've been on the trash.

1751
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,040
But Mike, were you heading?

1752
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,720
So I was just going to say, did it did it ever?

1753
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:35,000
And I think it did a little bit bother me as a kid.

1754
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,080
Did you ever think about it that you're inside the animal and on top of it?

1755
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Ah, hmm.

1756
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,240
Yeah. So what happened here?

1757
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:45,280
Was he like a big chunk was carved out of him?

1758
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:48,720
Yeah, I'm not saying it was like, oh, I was so preoccupied with it as a kid.

1759
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:52,840
I was not. But it was a little bit like, oh, we should be on top of Dumbo,

1760
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,480
not inside Dumbo.

1761
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:59,320
Well, the ride doesn't necessarily hold up under a narrative.

1762
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,800
No. That might be true.

1763
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:06,160
No. And I guess it should be like they should have built something on top of Dumbo

1764
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:08,680
for you to sit in. But that would have made it a bit heavier.

1765
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:14,640
So I understand why we're just like sitting in a hollowed out carcass of Dumbo.

1766
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:20,080
Dumbo and his six his 15 brothers have all been strapped to poles

1767
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:25,880
and scraped of their organs, but not their brains.

1768
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:29,080
So they can still understand what's happening to them anyway.

1769
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:30,080
Get inside him.

1770
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:33,840
There's future technology that has condensed their entire body

1771
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:37,200
into a tiny little ball, and it can be held in their neck now.

1772
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:40,000
So Dumbo is alive. OK, because this is the future.

1773
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,120
Everything he needs is packed into his.

1774
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:43,560
Exactly. This is the future.

1775
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,560
They've condensed it. And now he can still be happy.

1776
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:48,960
He loves it. But he is connected to a big rod.

1777
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:51,640
And you can sit inside where his organs used to be.

1778
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:53,720
But he likes it. He loves it.

1779
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,520
He's got a big smile on his face.

1780
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:57,040
Don't you see? Yeah.

1781
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:00,600
Now, and but depending on where you're going on this ride,

1782
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,280
his mouse friend is holding a whip.

1783
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:05,960
In some places, it's not a whip anymore.

1784
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:08,440
It became a feather. But if there is a whip, don't worry.

1785
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:11,320
The mouse is small and the whip is smaller.

1786
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:15,840
So and their friend, their friend, he's probably not going to use it.

1787
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,120
Yeah. It's just there as a reminder.

1788
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:19,720
So not pleasurable.

1789
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:22,280
It's, you know, you expect.

1790
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:25,000
Yes, it's a symbol of like, oh, animals and circus.

1791
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:28,840
It's not practical, though, but it needs to communicate something.

1792
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:32,440
It's either it's soft or he'll use it softly.

1793
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:35,200
I assume he just like drapes it and rubs it.

1794
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,880
Don't worry about Dumbo and his clones.

1795
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:41,960
Yes, it's the future and he's copping cloned.

1796
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:44,320
This is a dark, dark ride.

1797
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,080
It is a dark really, really quick.

1798
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:50,120
Just I was like, this is going to be fun pictures of people you wouldn't expect.

1799
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:51,960
Oh, right. Going on Dumbo.

1800
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:54,520
Here's the the most most interesting ones I've found.

1801
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,560
Here's here's old Kevin Costner.

1802
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:00,520
And this is kind of where, you know, again, you're you're a sitting duck

1803
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:01,680
when you're on that ride.

1804
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:05,000
Others, the celebrities can sneak in and out of Disney rides.

1805
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,280
But there people are going to see.

1806
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:09,760
I mean, some of these are posed photos. Right.

1807
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:13,840
But that's I also read that some of the appeal of I think Walt

1808
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:18,080
talked to a carnival person, a guy who did a park called Kittyland.

1809
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:20,960
That used to be where the the Beverly Center is now.

1810
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,400
And his thing was the rides should

1811
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:28,200
the rides should advertise themselves, you know, like you like.

1812
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:31,600
If you if you have a ride where there's people on display

1813
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:35,160
having a good time, that's going to make people want to go have a good time.

1814
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:39,760
And so, again, just the photo op in the tableau, I think, is important with this ride.

1815
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:42,400
So look, Costner's having a great time.

1816
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:44,720
Christian Bale's having a good time.

1817
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,400
I see him at Disneyland, right?

1818
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,680
Like he's a cameo machine.

1819
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:50,160
It's nice to see him out of it.

1820
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:53,200
But was, you know, has been part of the Disney family before.

1821
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,040
And Newsy, yes, indeed.

1822
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,680
He's coming back. He's in the new Thor.

1823
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:59,640
Oh, I didn't know that.

1824
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:02,040
Tim Tebow was Tebow.

1825
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:05,880
I had there's a Chicago mayor, Richard Daley.

1826
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:08,400
What's the deal with Richard Daley?

1827
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,240
Is he good? They're all like corrupt.

1828
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:11,880
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.

1829
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:15,480
It's a it's a mixed bag here in the early 80s.

1830
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:18,480
Michael Jackson on the Dumbo attraction.

1831
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:21,320
And then some 30 years later, Dr.

1832
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:23,560
Conrad Murray, the man.

1833
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:24,920
What?

1834
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:27,880
Right. Ultimately involved in death.

1835
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,200
Oh, I don't know.

1836
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:32,280
I think this is this might have been it's credited to some.

1837
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:34,240
This might have been a paparazzi situation.

1838
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:37,320
I don't think that Conrad Murray proudly like

1839
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:40,880
brought a private photographer.

1840
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:44,360
Well, I think he was getting out his like last couple of jollies

1841
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:48,080
because six months later, he was like, OK, so it's after the thing.

1842
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:51,880
There was I think it was between trials going on.

1843
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:56,400
He would he would be in jail within six months of this photograph.

1844
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:58,000
That's really bizarre.

1845
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:02,040
Isn't that a real that's a you know, time goes round and round.

1846
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,400
I was wondering, like, which who does Scott have in here?

1847
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,360
Because he's going to have a really good one that I don't know.

1848
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:10,560
Is it like and that really I would like stars from Kevin?

1849
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,560
I would start a Conrad Murray.

1850
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:13,680
I would not have bet that.

1851
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:16,720
Well, Kissinger and Ted Kaczynski in the same car.

1852
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:19,480
Who would have thought the same element?

1853
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:22,760
So look around you the next time you're on Dumbo.

1854
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:24,760
You never know if you'll spot

1855
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:29,680
one of the greatest pop stars of all time or a man who will be responsible for

1856
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:33,280
the demise of one of the greatest pop stars.

1857
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,440
She was one of the Dumbo.

1858
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:40,360
Yeah. So hey, after on the note of Dr.

1859
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:44,640
Conrad Murray, it's a weird photo to like, I don't know.

1860
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:46,600
How can it not be a weird photo? Yeah.

1861
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:53,720
What is a normal photograph of this doctor convicted of manslaughter?

1862
01:33:54,720 --> 01:34:01,040
Well, hey, on that note, you survived the first podcast, the ride of 2022.

1863
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:03,400
More fun to come.

1864
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:08,280
More criminally convicted doctors to come, probably.

1865
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:10,480
That's what we're OK. Yeah.

1866
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:13,360
More Conrad Murray talk, more Brian Setzer talk.

1867
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:18,360
How can we get you salivating for what else is to come this year?

1868
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:22,960
Yeah. Oh, I want to say that I bought a bought a package of hot dogs, Jason.

1869
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:24,200
Nice. First time.

1870
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:27,120
First time in other than when we tried to make the Ronto wraps.

1871
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:29,400
I didn't buy hot dog. There was like a sausage.

1872
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,280
But I just I thought of Jason.

1873
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,440
I went, you know what?

1874
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:34,200
This is my every couple of years I go.

1875
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:36,520
I buy hot dogs as often as I go on Dumbo.

1876
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:38,560
Wow. And I did buy.

1877
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,400
They were like boars head.

1878
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:42,600
Oh, they're in the hot dog game.

1879
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:43,880
That's a name you get.

1880
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:45,680
Yeah, they're in the hot dog game.

1881
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,920
So I did do that.

1882
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,600
Anything particularly inspire you?

1883
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:54,200
It was one of those situations where I was hungry.

1884
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:57,560
And for some reason, I was doing stuff I just don't normally do.

1885
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,280
I don't normally buy ice cream.

1886
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:00,640
I bought ice cream.

1887
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:02,320
Maybe it's because of maybe the world.

1888
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,000
I don't know what's affecting me exactly.

1889
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
But I was like this big break we've had.

1890
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,200
You're the big break. You're craving Jason.

1891
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:10,880
That might be it. You're buying Jason's ice cream.

1892
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,800
I got I got hot dogs.

1893
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:13,720
Maybe I haven't.

1894
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:15,680
Yeah, I haven't heard Jason talk in a while.

1895
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:18,080
So that's it. Oh, I missed you, too.

1896
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:22,720
I was I went back east to see family and immediately put on five pounds eating,

1897
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,240
eating immediately.

1898
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:27,360
Yeah. Like the first day of the holidays. Yeah.

1899
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:34,240
Yeah. Jason missed Mike so much he bought 20 expensive Ninja Turtles and ate them.

1900
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,200
There's your pounds right there.

1901
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:44,760
It is I have been racking my brain for the last few days because they're Marvel has a deal right now

1902
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:50,600
where they're unlimited per the Marvel Unlimited, where you get digital access to that shadow.

1903
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:53,480
Can you figure you get a welcome kit?

1904
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:58,200
And I was like, OK, it's marked down to 70 for the year subscription.

1905
01:35:58,200 --> 01:35:59,560
And you get this welcome kit.

1906
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:06,280
Could I I did a very Mike math of like, if I get it, could I flip the welcome kit for 70 dollars?

1907
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:07,960
You get this. The answer is yes, you can.

1908
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:09,000
Probably. Yeah. Answers.

1909
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,440
Yeah, probably. But it is a cool kiddie pride.

1910
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:14,760
It is cool. But I have some complaints.

1911
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:15,960
But we'll see.

1912
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:20,560
Well, there is there's a more traditional kiddie pride from Excalibur toy that just came out that I do have.

1913
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:21,560
Oh, I like that.

1914
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,880
She's got the more blue outfit, not the kind of normal X-Men outfit.

1915
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:33,240
Yeah. OK, if you want to stay up to speed on all of our probably less me, but in collective wheeze

1916
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:38,280
purchases of Marvel figures and hot dogs, then follow us on the socials at podcast.

Go there now. Meet our new friend, Jay Bigga.

1921
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:56,600
I really say if you were not on the second gate, I would hate to miss out.

1922
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:57,640
Yeah, the audience. Yeah.

For five dollars a month, you can get three extra episodes and the whole back catalog.

1924
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:05,440
I don't usually give the hard sell on it, but I would say that the audience seemed like

1925
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:09,600
they really enjoyed the last patron episode with a big reveal at the end.

1926
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:14,240
So if you ever thinking about trying it out, you can try it out and you get the new ones

1927

and you get the old whole years, multi year worth back.

1928
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:23,120
If the tease of a horny white rapper from 2004 does anything for you.

1929
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:26,080
Yeah, just like my bow tie spun.
