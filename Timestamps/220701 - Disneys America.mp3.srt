1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Warning. The following podcast contains barn buffets,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
smokestack admiration,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
fun war shows,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and most importantly, bad ideas.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's the never built Disney's America theme park on today's podcast, The Ride.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,800
Welcome to podcast The Ride, the theme park podcast that dares to record meaningless artificial

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,880
pablum just five miles away from sacred cultural grounds.

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,500
And by that I mean Jay Leno's garage.

11
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
I'm Scott Gardner, I Jason Sheridan.

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Hi.

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,500
And Mike Carlson, hello.

14
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
I'm here, yes.

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Jay Leno's garage to me is church.

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:14,500
And would it surprise you to know that just 24 hours ago I was explaining everything I know about Jay Leno to Zach Reno.

17
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,500
Hmm.

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,500
It's not without a microphone present.

19
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
Not even with our audience having to.

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,500
No audience.

21
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Big dog garage included.

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,500
The obsession with cars, all the Mavis stuff that's public.

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,500
He didn't know any of it?

24
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
None of it.

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,500
No.

26
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,500
He doesn't know a lot.

27
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
He had a different childhood.

28
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Zach Reno is a friend of the show, sang the city walk.

29
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,500
He is now.

30
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,500
Well, he saved his status by being interested in all this.

31
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,500
He wasn't interested.

32
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,500
He turned you away.

33
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,500
Wasn't interested.

34
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Uh oh.

35
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,500
I don't know what to think now.

36
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,500
But it sounds like he sat patiently and listened to you, which is all we ask of anyone, including our listeners.

37
00:01:53,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Yeah, he sat patiently because you were in a garage in a stacked parking spot and he had to wait for you to finish so you would back out because you were blocking his car.

38
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,500
And I'm done.

39
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
Okay. See ya.

40
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:17,500
So, so yeah, no, I just explained that I said the phrase or I said the sentence, I need to get to Jay Leno's garage within like 24 hours ago I said that.

41
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,500
So you're right.

42
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
It is a holy experience.

43
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,500
Well, some of our my funny or die friends, our friend Andrew Grissom, right?

44
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Perez had been there.

45
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
They've been to the we will figure it out.

46
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,500
We'll find out.

47
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,500
And we said this on air that that's our desires to get to Jay.

48
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
Oh, well, I said it yesterday.

49
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,500
24 hours ago I said we need to get to Jay and I don't know if we've put it out there.

50
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,500
I think we have.

51
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:45,500
I feel like I'm not even asking the audience to do anything because I think it's a matter of just finding the right number.

52
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,500
I think we have to find a phone number to his home.

53
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Just leave a quick message.

54
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:58,500
When we were writing Moonbeam City, my friend Tommy Blacha just got the desire, just didn't even announce what he was doing.

55
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,500
He just picked up a phone dialed number for Big Dog Productions, which maybe we'd been looking up and he just didn't even say the plan.

56
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Just there was a phone there.

57
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Bing, Bing, Bing.

58
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Nice woman picked up and said, Hey, guys, call for Jay.

59
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,500
And she absolutely would have put us through if he'd been there.

60
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
Like there was not even a suspicious.

61
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Who is this?

62
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Right.

63
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Just like I think it was like, I think he's out driving.

64
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
And we went, oh, sounds like Jay.

65
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,500
All right.

66
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
I'll come back later.

67
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
We need.

68
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Yes.

69
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Show no fear.

70
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
Act like you've been there before.

71
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
Act like you belong there.

72
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
Oh, yeah.

73
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Always use any hotel lobby or hotel amenities if you're casual about it.

74
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Absolutely.

75
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
That is a great thing about hotels in general.

76
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Yeah.

77
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
They can mill around.

78
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Public private spaces.

79
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
So there's some wiggle room.

80
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,500
A lot of people coming through as opposed to people calling Big Dog Productions, which is maybe not that often.

81
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
So I think it wasn't that.

82
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,500
Yeah.

83
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,500
But Jay, I've seen him on all these podcasts.

84
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
He does every podcast now.

85
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,500
He doesn't look like he's happy to be there necessarily, but that's fine.

86
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
He doesn't have to be happy to talk to us.

87
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Has he not?

88
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,500
If he did dough boys, it'd probably just be like, yeah, I really like food.

89
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
They don't really like eating.

90
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Well, I got to find other stuff to talk about.

91
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Scott, I hate to correct you on this because I just watched a full Howie Mandel interview with Jay Leno.

92
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,500
Thanks.

93
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:27,500
Where Howie Mandel and his daughter talked to Jay and Jay explains that what he likes to eat is pizza, hot dogs and hamburgers.

94
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Oh, OK.

95
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,500
So actually a perfect guess.

96
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,500
So I don't want the dough boys to scoop us, but I would be happy.

97
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Yeah, we'd all be happy.

98
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Yeah, I know.

99
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,500
We'd be well begrudging.

100
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
It's like, yeah, no, I'm happy for him.

101
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
I'm really happy for him.

102
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
No, they got Jay and look.

103
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Yeah.

104
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
They're the guys.

105
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
They did it.

106
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,500
They're the guys.

107
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,500
You know, like you just turn around and you like kick the wall like silently.

108
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
God damn it.

109
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Toe boys.

110
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Oh, you should be better dreams of your life.

111
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
You bottle it all up and be nothing but nightmare.

112
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Be better.

113
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
And I'm slapping myself if you can hear it.

114
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
Be better as podcasters.

115
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
So so do it to ourselves.

116
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
It's yeah.

117
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
He pizza, hot dog, hamburgers.

118
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
He does not eat vegetables.

119
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
That's what I was.

120
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
Yeah.

121
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
He has a high, but I know he doesn't drink coffee.

122
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Yeah.

123
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
OK, we have to put a stop to this.

124
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,500
I knew I was getting myself in the trouble with a Jay Leno reference.

125
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Yeah, big problem when you bring it up.

126
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
What I was saying was that it's and it's actually true.

127
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,500
We are the distance from Jay Leno's garage.

128
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
This is going to help people find us.

129
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
But we in what direction?

130
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
That I can't say.

131
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:35,500
We are the same distance away from where Jay Leno keeps all his cars as a Civil War battlefield

132
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,500
was to today's topic, which is Disney's America.

133
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,500
We are celebrating a very happy Fourth of July weekend.

134
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Oh, yeah.

135
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,500
I absolutely know.

136
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
I think we're all.

137
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
Everything's going great.

138
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,500
We're feeling great.

139
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,500
We're optimistic.

140
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,500
This episode was recorded in April.

141
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
It's fitting.

142
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:03,500
We're talking about a canceled Disney project right as, you know,

143
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
Disney's America, right as America.

144
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:11,500
America is wrapping it up, coming to a coming to a stop.

145
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Yep.

146
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:18,500
Yeah, they got through their their process happened a little a little faster.

147
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:28,500
This was a project that was announced, planned, quietly announced and then taken back very quickly.

148
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
And I feel like this is a big one.

149
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,500
This is like a big part of lore that we talked about.

150
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:41,500
I feel like it hasn't even come up in little ways on the show so much here and there, but nothing, nothing major.

151
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
Yeah. Yeah.

152
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Haven't tackled the whole thing and probably also one of the biggest unbuilt projects you'd have to think.

153
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
Yeah.

154
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,500
A completely separate part in a place that does not have a Disney presence.

155
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Exactly. Yes.

156
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
Yes, as opposed to Westcott.

157
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Right.

158
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Or like some idea of a Disney World Park that wasn't done.

159
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:11,500
Yeah, this was their idea to enter into a whole market that they clearly have not entered into that being near Washington, D.C. in Virginia.

160
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,500
And if you live around there, have been there, you've noticed there is no Disney Park there.

161
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
It really is.

162
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
It really is.

163
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:28,500
If this would have been built and had been a success, would they have just started building parks five miles from other historical sites around the world, around America?

164
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,500
There's a lot of places where horrible things have happened.

165
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
That's right.

166
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,500
And maybe the land is less desired and it is just fields.

167
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:47,500
I suppose, like, hmm, I'm trying to think how often I believe the Alamo is just kind of right next to like a TGF Fridays.

168
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Like I remember being shocked when I went there, like, oh, it's here.

169
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Like, I thought it was down the middle of a field somewhere, but it's kind of right near bullshit is what I recall.

170
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,500
But usually, yeah, there's some, you know, they're out in the boonies, these sites of terrible things.

171
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Yeah, exactly.

172
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,500
So, yeah, who knows what would have happened if Disney had this had been a success?

173
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
But little parks everywhere.

174
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:19,500
I my dad mentioned this a while ago and I asked him about it over the weekend because I knew we were recording and he said, yeah, your mother and I were really looking forward to this park.

175
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,500
And I was like, oh, because it would have been two hours away, two hour away drive.

176
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,500
And he's like, well, that and we had joined the Vacation Club by this point.

177
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:34,500
And, you know, we also, you know, we like to go in, you know, we do the museums and stuff in D.C.

178
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,500
But almost more importantly, you could just do it.

179
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
He's like, you can do it.

180
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
If you're going down Virginia, you just do a loop.

181
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,500
You had a Busch Garden, she had a Kingston Minion, and then you could have this.

182
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,500
And I'm like, oh, this is where it comes from.

183
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
This is where I got it.

184
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
Yeah.

185
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
So wow.

186
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,500
Absolutely proximity proximity.

187
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,500
It could have been a way worse idea.

188
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,500
And he was still been like, well, that being said, we can hit all the parks.

189
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:06,500
I'm sure there was just like a 500 word like, you know, piece in that like, yeah, no, he was in the Philadelphia Enquirer or something.

190
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:13,500
But reading the detailed descriptions of the leaked pamphlets, things that we presume, which I have gone into.

191
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
Yeah. Yeah.

192
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:26,500
No, there's there's a lot of odds and ends out there and a lot to parse through, including who we were all checking out the executive summary of rezoning application.

193
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Am I right, folks?

194
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:42,500
Which I learned is essentially just the brochure reformatted to be 28, 8, 11 pages with like two paragraphs on each page, because executives are not the brightest.

195
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Don't like to do a lot of reading.

196
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Yeah.

197
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
You read the what's the name of it again?

198
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:55,500
This is the executive summary of rezoning application when I was just searching for Disney's America documents.

199
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,500
And it's kind of the same concept art that's everywhere else.

200
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:05,500
There's just a little more detail about the economic benefits and the environmental impact.

201
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Gotcha.

202
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:12,500
But it is like 20, 20 pages with maybe a few paragraphs on each page.

203
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:19,500
Most of it big pictures and the description of like, you know, Ebbets Field recreated.

204
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Right.

205
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:26,500
OK, so a lot of dry copy, which we'll be reading in full to you, the listener.

206
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:33,500
This is let me I'm going to I'm going to say a strong phrase that I think is a phrase like I was like, I recall people saying this.

207
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,500
And if I Google it, are there results about this?

208
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:42,500
And this is not necessarily an accurate phrase of what this park was, but it certainly went around.

209
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,500
And that is the idea that Disney was going to build a Civil War theme park.

210
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Yes, definitely was said it got boiled down to that.

211
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Like that was the broad strokes if you weren't paying a lot of attention to it.

212
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,500
Not really accurate, but a little.

213
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,500
That would have been kind of part of it.

214
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Certainly not the only part of it.

215
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,500
Not the whole park, just the nighttime spectacular.

216
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:14,500
Just yes, they're they're phantasmic was battleship real battleships was a real battle.

217
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,500
The Merrimack monitor.

218
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,500
That is one of the most that is one of the weirdest things.

219
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,500
There's so much of all the weird things.

220
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
First off, let's let's talk about the elephant in the room.

221
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,500
This is probably the darkest source material.

222
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:35,500
American history, the darkest source material for a Disney attraction.

223
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,500
It is darker than with Snow White where a girl is poisoned.

224
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
The ride was too scary.

225
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Oh, have you ever been a Latin American country trying to have a Democratic election?

226
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,500
You don't know fear.

227
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:59,500
The thing is, though, for like guys like Eisner and of course, Walt, like American history was like such a fun,

228
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:05,500
vibrant story that was like less dark than the history of the X-Men or something like.

229
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Yeah, yeah.

230
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
It was just all.

231
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,500
Yeah, triumphs.

232
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,500
And there was some sadness, but hero, mostly old guys out on the front.

233
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Yeah.

234
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,500
So so ultimately, you know, these guys were like, yeah, this is the best source material ever.

235
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,500
This would be amazing.

236
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:27,500
They pulled a lot from I mean, Americana in history was always a part of Disney's TV.

237
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,500
Yes, of course.

238
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Movies and the parks, because there, of course, was American Adventure and all the presidents by then.

239
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:43,500
And I almost feel like if we like it, this idea probably made more sense to us kids

240
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,500
who had been to the parks and stops to appreciate the oh, yes, the well, they tell the tale.

241
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
Yes.

242
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,500
A burgeoning nation.

243
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:56,500
And but if you didn't know that they had done anything in this regard at all, you probably just went, huh?

244
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,500
What are you talking about?

245
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Like, and they're going to get that so wrong, like unbelievably wrong.

246
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,500
Yeah.

247
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
And they probably would have.

248
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:12,500
But then some of the trouble seems to have come from going to overboard and saying, you know, it's going to be warts and all.

249
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
We're going to show all the warts.

250
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:19,500
And then you go, why do I want to go on a vacation and see all the warts go on rides about warts?

251
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:26,500
Yeah, it gets tricky because it's like, you know, there's probably room for the more fantastical version of American history.

252
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:33,500
If the most of the population understands most more of it understands more of what actually happened.

253
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Yeah.

254
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:41,500
I mean, I think you hit the nail on the head, Mike, because I was using the phrase Americana in my notes, too, because it's dead on for Americana.

255
00:13:41,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Like, it's dead on for the high school history book version, the kind of rose color, rose tinted lenses version, you know, of stuff that you often see at museums or battlefields or national parks that that sort of thing.

256
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
Mm hmm. Yeah.

257
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,500
The raw superhero version of American history.

258
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,500
We aren't going to we aren't going to start talking about Howard Zinn, are we?

259
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
That the kind of episode we're doing.

260
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,500
I truthfully only ever got a few chapters in in college.

261
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
I did not finish.

262
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
No, but no, I look, I wouldn't.

263
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,500
We're not talking about books.

264
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,500
We're too dumb to read books on this podcast.

265
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,500
Jason, who reads books, who reads sometimes usually the Lord's it over us.

266
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Yes.

267
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,500
There are paperback books or mystery novels, and he's reading them at a pool.

268
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Finish a great record thriller an hour before I got here.

269
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,500
But yeah, all that to say that somehow better than describing everything.

270
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,500
You know about Jay Leno, your listening friend?

271
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
I don't know. You the listener can be the judge of that.

272
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Yeah.

273
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:51,500
But yes, all that to say you enter in a weird thing where it's like either do the fun version is what like people on vacation want to do.

274
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:57,500
But then you run into the problem of like you're really making this look like in a way that people like you're not making this realistic.

275
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,500
You're not showing anybody.

276
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:05,500
So if you do that, then it sucks because there's a horrible tragedy and sadness and monstrosity.

277
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
Astrosity is committed in the history of America.

278
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,500
So like how do you how do you make that work?

279
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,500
You can't make that work.

280
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:18,500
And it especially doesn't work when we really learn the soft version of all this stuff in school.

281
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,500
So it's like it's impossible.

282
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,500
It's like an impossible equation to make the complete correct formula.

283
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,500
I think so.

284
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,500
And I think they only started to get worse at figuring it out as they went.

285
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:38,500
But I think this is the you know, the history of this has gone over a lot and we'll we'll certainly go into it.

286
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:50,500
But what I would like to bring to the table and just you know what we can do, I think, especially about Disney's America is really think about would we have liked anything here?

287
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
Would anything would any aspect have worked?

288
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,500
Because I think we'll try to piece what we can.

289
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Yeah.

290
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,500
From concept art and from what the brochures said.

291
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:06,500
And we do have to remember this is imagineers on fire in the mid 90s.

292
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
We're getting checks from Eisner.

293
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,500
And it seems possible that there'd be a thing or two.

294
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
There's absolutely something we like.

295
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,500
I'm not I'm not.

296
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Oh yeah.

297
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,500
I'm as far as thrills and chills and imagineering.

298
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,500
When you see some of these pictures, you go, well, this looks like it would have been a fantastic ride.

299
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Yes.

300
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,500
Some of them would have been a fantastic ride without the context.

301
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
And then some of them, I think the context was fine.

302
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,500
I think it's like, oh yeah, that seems like it would have been an Epcot or that would have been somewhere else.

303
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,500
And sure.

304
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
Yeah.

305
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:48,500
If it wasn't look, these like patriotic attractions in previous parks like Epcot got to come out without being scrutinized by a bunch of historians and people mad in newspapers and stuff.

306
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,500
And as soon as you run anything through that lens, it all seems sort of awful.

307
00:16:53,500 --> 00:17:00,500
And also, if I could add, like in an alternate dimension where this got built, you know, we'd all have been there.

308
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
We all would have.

309
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Your dad was already making the plans.

310
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
Well, we live.

311
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:12,500
This other version where we've all oddly been to this part of Virginia to Prince Andrew County.

312
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
Is that it?

313
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
We've been there a ton.

314
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,500
And that's like a big part of our life.

315
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
Well, every once in a while, we got to go to Virginia.

316
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Right.

317
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Industrial revolution.

318
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
Oh, man.

319
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:48,500
I think about in our lifetime, how many moments in our past, the recent past in history, history sense, how annoying this place would have been after the 2000 election in the aftermath of 9 11 in the patriotism of flourished the Iraq War, any presidential election.

320
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,500
And nowadays it would just be a war zone.

321
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Oh, my God.

322
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:59,500
Just picture the beat red, like used car lot guys just going like, keep all the parks closed.

323
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,500
But you gotta open to America.

324
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,500
Like in the middle of the way, come on.

325
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:12,500
There would have been a there would have been a break in and an attempted coup for the closed park if it had remained closed during covid.

326
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
Oh, yeah.

327
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
In the same way that might have happened there.

328
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:22,500
A shaman who broke into the Disney's America and sat in the industrial revolution car.

329
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
Go make it go.

330
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Go make it go.

331
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
That's a quick thing.

332
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,500
I don't want to forget about the the closure.

333
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
His park.

334
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,500
They were estimating it would have been closed two months of the year.

335
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,500
And then they bumped that up to four months of the year.

336
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Well, that's the final blow.

337
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Yeah.

338
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Well, yeah, that it does not feasible ultimately, weather wise.

339
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,500
And they got it wrong the first time they looked at it.

340
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Yeah.

341
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,500
I also just want to say this is not this park is not in Prince Andrew County.

342
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
This is in Prince William County.

343
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Very unfairly.

344
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Somebody's got a name to this area of the country after I didn't even think about it.

345
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Disgraced.

346
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,500
We are recording this on the day of Ghulain sentencing.

347
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,500
Yeah, that's what you got on the brain.

348
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,500
That phrase was bouncing around.

349
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,500
But let me not disparage this place as being Prince Andrew County.

350
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Haymarket.

351
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Haymarket, Virginia, adjacent to the Manassas battlefield, the site of the first and second battles of Bull Run.

352
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:30,500
Yeah, the first major battle of the Civil War, seemingly.

353
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
So they ended up there.

354
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,500
Well, so, OK, why does this happen at all?

355
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,500
We are in we set our scene in a post Euro Disney world.

356
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Eisner is still enthusiastic about expanding the theme park empire, but wants to figure out how to do it cheaper.

357
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:57,500
We cannot keep making increasingly more and more expensive and fancy magic kingdoms.

358
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:03,500
We have to find a way and in an effort that eventually turns into I don't know, it's like a club where kids go.

359
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
It eventually gets whittled down to that.

360
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,500
But at this point in time, is there a way to do kind of a halfway a place?

361
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,500
That's nice. But let's be reasonable here.

362
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Is there like what if the Disney store sold you a grilled cheese sandwich?

363
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,500
What if you could buy paintings near a Disney store?

364
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Yeah.

365
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
What if you could learn about time shares near a Disney store?

366
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,500
The Disney Decade starts up here and then gets to the time shares.

367
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500
Time shares? I don't know.

368
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Also like America, Disney really the the rise and fall of Eisner's empire.

369
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
It's going to be very similar. Yeah.

370
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:49,500
So he's trying to figure out what are different types of regional experiences that we can do in different types of markets that we can cut into.

371
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,500
And I think somebody in the operation encourages him to go check out Colonial Williamsburg.

372
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,500
Have you guys been to Colonial Williamsburg?

373
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Hell yeah, brother.

374
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,500
No, I have not.

375
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,500
Oh, multiple times. You say I would have been in this as a kid or even now.

376
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,500
I have been to the Betsy Ross's house multiple times.

377
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
I've been to Ben Franklin's house multiple times.

378
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:18,500
I think four times to the Gettysburg battlefield, the Valley Forge battlefield, Plymouth plantation.

379
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Do you just it's it's just in the air.

380
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:29,500
It's just if you grow up in the northeast, it's, you know, a long weekend trip or it's a day trip or it's your field trips.

381
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Sure. Yeah.

382
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:36,500
So yes, Plymouth Williamsburg was usually lumped in.

383
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,500
It's very close to Busch Gardens and it's a little farther from King's Dominion.

384
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,500
But still, you do that with the family that stuff.

385
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,500
And as a kid, what was your were you into it?

386
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
Do you think this is the boring stuff?

387
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,500
I want to go back to Disney.

388
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,500
I mean, I was a pretty nerdy kid.

389
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,500
I was pretty bookish kid and I like the historical stuff.

390
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:00,500
I did like it, but I knew it wasn't Busch Gardens and I knew it wasn't Disney World.

391
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,500
And I was like, oh, this isn't I like this, but it's not Disney World.

392
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,500
And it's not that my Hanna Barbera friends aren't here like they were a few days ago.

393
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Where's Yogi?

394
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:18,500
So if you combined Williamsburg into some rides, I mean, yeah, you are the exact target audience.

395
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:23,500
Age wise, demeanor why interests wise, you're the target audience for Disney's America.

396
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:32,500
So part of Colonial Williamsburg, not just that it's this preserved historical town and it's got the little activities and here's what life was like back then.

397
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
But also you can stay there.

398
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
That was a trip I did as a kid.

399
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,500
Like you can stay in little cottages and like in a colonial house.

400
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:46,500
So Eisner starts thinking, how do we do this exactly near them and undercut them?

401
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:54,500
You know, the mini premise of California Adventure, which is like, what if we have all the things California has, but we have it?

402
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,500
Right.

403
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
Maybe people don't do the other thing.

404
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:03,500
Not realizing you can't replace the ocean or Hollywood in general.

405
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,500
Yeah.

406
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,500
So they start looking into that.

407
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
But weather is the first thing they were.

408
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Ironically, weather is the first thing.

409
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,500
This isn't going to work.

410
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
And it wasn't near enough to an airport.

411
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,500
That's a big thing for them.

412
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
So they look at a lot of sites.

413
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,500
They land at in the Washington, D.C. area.

414
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:28,500
And because that's a big hub and is the fifth biggest tourist market at the time right behind Vegas.

415
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,500
And it was kind of underserved in a theme park fashion.

416
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,500
So makes sense.

417
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:43,500
They go to Haymarket, Virginia, a town that was entirely set on fire by the Union Army in 1862.

418
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,500
Why it was bugging me why I knew that turn the Haymarket.

419
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,500
Yeah, right.

420
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,500
Haymarket fire.

421
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,500
Haymarket fire.

422
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,500
Yeah, because it should be noted the Union Army lost both battles of Bull Run.

423
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,500
Yeah.

424
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,500
Well, as they say that later.

425
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:04,500
But yes, there's a lot of things represented where the right side did not win.

426
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
Yeah.

427
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
Well, and to that.

428
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,500
OK.

429
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:14,500
So the big thing in the area, the Manassas battlefield, the bull run happens here.

430
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:19,500
This is the place where Tom, these General Thomas Jackson became Stonewall.

431
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:25,500
That name happened because they held firm and it was a place where 868 soldiers died.

432
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,500
Sure. Horrible bloodbath.

433
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
Sure. Place.

434
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,500
But Disney doesn't build there.

435
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,500
Let's underline that very strongly.

436
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
OK.

437
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,500
He is not building on top of the battlefield.

438
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,500
Yeah.

439
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,500
This will come up many times.

440
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:46,500
They instead choose a site that oddly is owned by Exxon.

441
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
Exxon is part of this.

442
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,500
I don't know why they bought a bunch of land there.

443
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:57,500
I don't know why nobody was mad that they bought a bunch of land there and then was mad at Disney instead.

444
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,500
But so they did.

445
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:06,500
They buy up all the land secretly repeating the Disney World's formula.

446
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:17,500
The Sure to Succeed Again Now formula of not being transparent about the biggest company in the world buying up land and what it might do to the surrounding areas.

447
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
To get it cheaper.

448
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
Yes.

449
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,500
Yeah.

450
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:26,500
In an instance of history doesn't always repeat itself, but it does rhyme.

451
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:32,500
Universal's Epic Universe being built on land that was once owned by Lockheed Martin.

452
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,500
Oh.

453
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,500
These big companies.

454
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
That's what that was?

455
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
Wow.

456
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
It's like all these companies buying houses now.

457
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,500
I mean, I think just bad evil companies buy things all the time.

458
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,500
They're just buying land.

459
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,500
They are owning as much land.

460
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,500
Trading them between each other.

461
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Trading them between each other.

462
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,500
Yes.

463
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,500
And we only like it if they build fun rides there.

464
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,500
Otherwise, we look down on the entire thing.

465
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,500
But there's one thing you could do for us.

466
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,500
And that's a ride where the monsters come out.

467
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,500
We will hug the boot and not be mad at it.

468
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,500
We will be mad at it if we go woo.

469
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500
If we can go wee, that's what we like.

470
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
Then we're not mad.

471
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:17,500
So they buy up this land and start the plans of a ...

472
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,500
Now here's where we start to go awry a little bit.

473
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,500
This is a park.

474
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:27,500
It's definitely a park, but it's also just kind of a general resort facility that will have a couple of things.

475
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,500
And in judging, would this have been good or not?

476
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:37,500
I saw that Disney spokesman described it as a six to eight hour experience.

477
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
This is a red flag.

478
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
This is like ...

479
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,500
Because they tried to open MGM Studios that way.

480
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:54,500
And in a way, they were kind of hoping maybe you might get away with it on some of those cheapo on early California Adventure or the Disney Studios Paris Park.

481
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,500
Like, it's fine, right?

482
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
It doesn't have to be a full day.

483
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,500
It doesn't have to be an eight to 12 packed with 100 rides.

484
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,500
We can get away with that, can't we?

485
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,500
The answer is no, they can't.

486
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,500
Yeah, it would be interesting.

487
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:16,500
I mean, when the parks are close to the other parks that are much better, that's extra bad because you have something to immediately compare it to.

488
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,500
But I guess, I don't know, if it's in a new spot ...

489
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Oh, if they're resetting the expectations.

490
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,500
What your expectations are.

491
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:29,500
This is like this hybrid that's like a living museum or something.

492
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,500
Perhaps.

493
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:39,500
And the idea seemingly is that it would be ... or at least what they suddenly started saying once they got caught and people were not immediately thrilled that they were moving in.

494
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,500
It was like, well, you do this and then other stuff.

495
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,500
Then you take a bus to Gettysburg.

496
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,500
Yes.

497
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,500
And then you get like, it's one of five things and you'll still do the real history.

498
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,500
You'll do the stuff.

499
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,500
Maybe you stay at our hotel.

500
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
Maybe that's a deal we can cut.

501
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:07,500
To put it in perspective, the budget allocated was $650 million, which is 1.05 billion in modern terms.

502
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,500
So this park would cost two rise of the resistances.

503
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:17,500
That is about also 650 million at the time.

504
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,500
That is half the budget of Euro Disney.

505
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,500
Oh boy.

506
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:26,500
And I believe they alluded in the defunct land video, which everyone go check that out.

507
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,500
There's very good defunct land about this.

508
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:34,500
That like Disney's already starting to see the budget overrun in Euro Disneyland.

509
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,500
Yeah.

510
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,500
Yeah. Oh, definitely.

511
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
Yeah.

512
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,500
And then it becomes a counterpoint to everything that's happening that they're trying to sell you on.

513
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:47,500
They're trying to sell Virginia on we're going to do what we do and we're going to do it here.

514
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Well, what about what's happening in Paris?

515
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
Haven't you lost a billion dollars?

516
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,500
That's a whole weird cultural Chernobyl.

517
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
They started throwing eggs at us.

518
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,500
What are we going to do?

519
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,500
And then they really ended up in the same.

520
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:09,500
I mean, for Eisner, who this is like a kind of a one-two punch of his dreams of affecting the culture, right?

521
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:14,500
And like leaving not just some frivolous spark, but like something that matters.

522
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,500
That's a part of the fabric of the society where we he was like.

523
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,500
Trying to be this this kingmaker and culture effect, right?

524
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:27,500
Which I'm sure. Yeah, because he he want you know, he was he was doing the intros for things on Disney TV.

525
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,500
So he kind of had a waltz, a little idea that he was waltz and he's going to do the same thing.

526
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:39,500
And basically what he meant is that a bunch of people would go here and leave with a plush of Donald Duck and a tricorder head.

527
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,500
That's essentially what he's going to do for the world.

528
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,500
The world with this part.

529
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,500
But I'm sure that is the reality.

530
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:55,500
But I'm sure in his head, yes, no, very fantastic because he loved he wrote a book about how much he loves going to summer camp growing up.

531
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:03,500
He loved Chateau Quoi, the adult education place that was a big influence on like the Disney Institute being built.

532
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,500
Yes, he is.

533
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,500
Look about summer camp magic book about summer camp.

534
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:12,500
I'm trying to figure out if he'd know it's the the audiobooks only four hours long, but it does say abridged.

535
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,500
And I can't tell if he reads it.

536
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,500
Are you upset by the abridged?

537
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,500
You have a full thing.

538
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,500
I'm a completist.

539
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,500
I like unabridged.

540
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,500
I, you know, especially listening to audiobooks.

541
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,500
I'm sure the things missing might be the photographs.

542
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,500
Don't get me wrong.

543
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,500
I want him to describe photographs on the book if he would if he wouldn't mind.

544
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,500
Yeah, here's my little shorts.

545
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,500
When we swam, we had to wear little red shorts.

546
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,500
Previous years, they made the boys swim naked and not sure when the policy changed.

547
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,500
Only the Chicago boys were comfortable with it.

548
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
They were told this will make you feel at home.

549
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Strip naked.

550
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,500
The Chicago boys did it without asking.

551
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,500
Without being asked.

552
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
There you go, the Chicago boys.

553
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Is this what you want, sir?

554
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
They said this is the Chicago way.

555
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,500
Chicago boys.

556
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
There they go.

557
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
Stripping naked yet again.

558
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:19,500
So here, you know, and we could do this in any order we want, but just, you know, because there is all of the, there's the back and forth at how this was perceived and the fact that this, they were not welcomed with open arms and a lot of people were mad and it didn't get built.

559
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:26,500
But I just want to make sure that we devote substantial time to what the hell was this going to be.

560
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,500
Because you do have concept art, you do have some breakdowns of what it is.

561
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:35,500
There's even a whole other version where it all changes a little bit.

562
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:44,500
But just to, because we have to, as Theme Park fans, we have to judge this as a Theme Park or whatever the hell they were going to try to call it.

563
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,500
So let's step through these things.

564
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,500
Does this, do these things sound fun to us?

565
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,500
Sure.

566
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:57,500
You enter through, and also if anybody, you know, I have the brochure in front of me.

567
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,500
If there's any particular copy or anything anyone wants to read.

568
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,500
Sure.

569
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:09,500
But let's, we start our journey at Crossroads USA, meant to represent the 19th century.

570
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,500
It's their main street.

571
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,500
It's where you enter the vivid tapestry of American history.

572
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:25,500
An 1840 train trestle bridge marks the entrance to this territory and supports two antique steam trains that visitors may board for a trip around the nine territories.

573
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,500
That's one thing to point out. It's not lands. It is territories.

574
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
Disney's America has territories.

575
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,500
Yes. And there's a train, there's a steam, there's two trains.

576
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,500
So Jason has to be like, well, at least there were two trains.

577
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,500
There's not enough steam.

578
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,500
There's steam, of course, because it's back in the old days. So it's still steam like the Disneyland train.

579
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,500
There's steam.

580
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
You're a fan of steam.

581
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:53,500
I'm a fan of steam. I'm not really wild at how dirty everything looks in the concept art.

582
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:59,500
Or just how many pictures have smokestacks in there like, ah, imagining America.

583
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,500
Get some smokestacks in there, my man.

584
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,500
That's an important point. I mean, are we seeing industry way back in the background?

585
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,500
I think so.

586
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
Is that the rise of industry?

587
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:15,500
You're right. It does seem, yeah, this town is not, Crossroads isn't a good town.

588
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:25,500
Like any old town is not good. Like there's, you know, like people are, like horrific things happen every day in Crossroads USA in reality.

589
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,500
But you know, this art maybe is too indicative of what it would have been like.

590
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:36,500
By the time this, you know, got fully planned and built, it would have been a much, I think, shinier presentation.

591
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:41,500
They would not really let this look like it might have been back then.

592
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:46,500
There's a Disney, the Disney coat of paint that would have absolutely been here.

593
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,500
And then this and all the smoke would have just been, I think, steam.

594
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,500
It wouldn't have been putting smoke into the air, but putting steam in it would have looked cool.

595
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
More steam. Can't complain about that.

596
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,500
There was a Burbank Water and Power that just pumps, like, what looks like steam out.

597
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,500
It looks like the world is ending literally from the five.

598
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Like, if you're looking at the five.

599
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,500
And I don't know what that is.

600
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,500
No, never asked.

601
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,500
Maybe it's smoke, maybe it's steam.

602
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,500
I don't know.

603
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,500
It looks scary as hell, but I forget about it.

604
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,500
And then when I'm coming out of Flappers, I see it again.

605
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,500
Flappers Comedy Club.

606
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,500
Take a tea.

607
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,500
Randomly trips to Flappers.

608
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:21,500
When J. performs at this place called Flappers right by downtown Burbank.

609
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,500
We got boats putting around.

610
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,500
They do boats.

611
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
Hotel rooms.

612
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Yeah. So this is the colonial Williamsburg idea where there's lodging here.

613
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
There's little suites to stay at.

614
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:41,500
So we still, at this point, have not had a proper hotel in the theme park.

615
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,500
This is the first time that there are going to be scattered.

616
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,500
And this is actually a little interesting.

617
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,500
In a way, like, Grand Californian isn't really staying in the park.

618
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,500
It's staying on the border of the park.

619
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:59,500
But this would have truly been, like, there's an upstairs room above the Tri-Corner Hat shop.

620
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,500
And you stay there.

621
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,500
Like, people actually...

622
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:11,500
Which, this gets you into that Westcott territory of you're in a Disney park that is closed.

623
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,500
And then what do you do?

624
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,500
That's weird.

625
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,500
And don't you have to pay admission to get in?

626
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,500
So going in and out is weird.

627
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,500
Like, can you...

628
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:27,500
It would just feel weird to, like, go down to the Walgreens and then come back and have to enter a Disney park at 2 a.m.

629
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,500
Yeah, it's a good...

630
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,500
I bet that there would be, like, one turnstile or whatever you would call it now that you call it.

631
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,500
What do they call it now that it's not a turnstile?

632
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,500
It's not a touch point?

633
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,500
A touch point?

634
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,500
A tap point?

635
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,500
What the fuck?

636
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,500
A tap point?

637
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,500
Well, turnstile is...

638
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:47,500
That indicates you're turning because you're using that, like, mechanism that, like, is used on a subway.

639
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,500
But now that it's just you tap in at Disney World I'm talking about.

640
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,500
It is a...

641
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,500
Okay, it's a touch point.

642
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,500
It's a Jason Therese touch point.

643
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
Oh, man.

644
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,500
We're going to use that all the time.

645
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,500
Touch point.

646
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,500
We're going to use that phrase all the time.

647
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:09,500
So, yeah, so now that it's a touch point, there would be one touch point lying open at all times that you would scan in.

648
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:14,500
And it probably would start, like, at 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. is when, like, the new day would begin.

649
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:19,500
So I bet your ticket lasted from 7 a.m. to the next 7 a.m.

650
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,500
Okay.

651
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,500
I might... this is a guess.

652
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,500
Mm-hmm.

653
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:29,500
Yes, it would be funny, like, going to that touch point at 4 a.m. if you wanted to leave the park and come back.

654
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,500
Or there might be a different exit for the hotel.

655
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,500
You want to see Peter Pan today?

656
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,500
Well, first you got to stop at the touch point.

657
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,500
Hey, quick stop at the touch point.

658
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,500
Oh, my magic band isn't scanning at the touch point.

659
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:49,500
Okay, yeah, no, we'll... no, I'll be there, yeah, just, like, 315, meet me at the touch point.

660
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,500
315 at the touch point?

661
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Yeah, yeah, 315 at the touch point.

662
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,500
Okay, just want to make sure.

663
00:36:53,500 --> 00:37:00,500
Is there only one touch point at the front of the park, or are there touch points anywhere that you use a band, like, getting on a ride?

664
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,500
I think any of them are considered touch points.

665
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,500
But they're only touch... only Florida has touch points.

666
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,500
We are supposed to be getting magic bands out here.

667
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,500
Yeah, we do.

668
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,500
No, no, no, it's complicated enough.

669
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
I don't want these fucking things.

670
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,500
You're anti-magic band?

671
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,500
I think I... isn't it more complicated?

672
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,500
You'll still be able to use your phone app.

673
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,500
Okay.

674
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,500
I think if you want, you'll have the choice to use your app or magic band.

675
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,500
All I know... I don't know much about this.

676
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:39,500
I just know that in my periphery, suddenly everybody's got these wristbands at Disney, and suddenly getting into Disney World parks is a two months ahead of time.

677
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Oh, well, that's a different...

678
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,500
Insanely complicated operation.

679
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,500
That's a different story.

680
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,500
These don't go together. These are...

681
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,500
I don't think that has anything to do with magic bands.

682
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:52,500
Magic band is actually... I mean, it's tracking your every movement and your heartbeat, and it knows everything about you.

683
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,500
It knows every touch point.

684
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500
It knows your deepest fears and your deepest desires.

685
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:02,500
But other than that, it's really kind of a pretty easy way to get your Fast Passes and then to use a touch point to get in the park.

686
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,500
So I don't think that complicates it so much.

687
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,500
It actually makes it a little simpler from having to fumble with your phone and get your Fast Pass out.

688
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,500
Because your Fast Pass is immediately just on your magic band. You just scan it and...

689
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,500
Okay.

690
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:20,500
I guess that doesn't sound so bad, but their association with touch points makes me not a fan of them.

691
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,500
Yeah. Sure. It was the last time I was there.

692
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,500
Did at least once a day mine and my fingerprint not work.

693
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:32,500
And they had to come flag someone down with an iPad and go like, okay, do it on the iPad.

694
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,500
All right. And one more time.

695
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,500
And let's try one more time.

696
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,500
And then eventually it worked.

697
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,500
I don't want to get onto a big tear here.

698
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,500
However, the theme park thumbprint operations.

699
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,500
Oh, we haven't even really...

700
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:50,500
Why? Why? It's probably a whole episode, but like, yeah, Universal, a mess.

701
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,500
Never does it work. Never. And why do they need it?

702
00:38:54,500 --> 00:39:01,500
How is this better than showing an ID or just showing that I have a fucking ticket for their park that I paid for?

703
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:07,500
Like Lockheed Martin owns the patent on like a thumbprint tech or a fingerprint technology.

704
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,500
They were having dinner with the president of Universal Resorts.

705
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,500
They made some sort of a shady $500 million deal.

706
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:23,500
And that's why we have to like be go through like police questioning or police IDing to get into Universal now.

707
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,500
Yeah, I don't really know the answer to it.

708
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:32,500
Disneyland, just what they look at our annual pass and they see if our face looks the same.

709
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,500
That's all they do. So it seems like it works.

710
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:43,500
It works. There's look, is there a Mission Impossible way of breaking that code by printing a complicated mask and putting it on?

711
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:50,500
Probably. However, I mean, that's like generally the brief look at the face does its job.

712
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:56,500
You know what? It is weird. Like here, touch this point. Touch this dirty little point.

713
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,500
It's a dirty little point. A thousand people have touched it before.

714
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:05,500
Put your finger on the dirty little point and scan into Universal Studios.

715
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:11,500
Yes, it is weird. It's everyone has touched it. You know, everyone has touched it.

716
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:19,500
It's weird. Everyone has no choice but to put their dirty little finger in this one little area.

717
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,500
And there's not even room to move around. It's so it's so stuck in this.

718
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,500
It's like not even a big area for your finger to imprint.

719
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:30,500
Well, it's not universal. It's different. It's a feeling poles.

720
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,500
You got to put your finger on the feel. Oh, yeah. Right. Right.

721
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:43,500
It's not confused the brands. Yeah. So I am not pro fingerprint, but I am mostly pro Magic Band.

722
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,500
OK. I would say I love the touch point.

723
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,500
You love touch. It really makes it opens up the space when you're going into the park.

724
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,500
I feel in Disney World. Love the touching points.

725
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:02,500
So unclear how the type the touch point system would have been figured out for your stay in Crossroads USA.

726
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:08,500
The next in my list is over here. I'll go I'll go off of their brochure.

727
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:13,500
President Square, which represents 1750 president square.

728
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,500
I don't know why that makes me laugh so much. But it feels like Baker's Square.

729
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:22,500
It just feels like the Simpsons version of it. We're going to President Square.

730
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:31,500
Yeah, they they kind of inadvertently with this pitch came up with the America Town restaurant from the episode of The Simpsons where they go to Tokyo.

731
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:39,500
Mm hmm. Yeah, it's it feels like the parody of it for President Square, even though it's not even that funny of a it's not that funny.

732
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:45,500
I don't know why I'm laughing. Well, the idea I mean, a place where like I mean, it's like Avengers campus.

733
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:50,500
You meet all of the president. Right. Hey, John Tyler down here.

734
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:57,500
Calvin Coolidge. Calvin Coolidge is wearing his casual outfit on Thursday from five to nine.

735
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:03,500
Then he changes back into his presidential suit. Like first term Grover Cleveland or second term Grover Cleveland.

736
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,500
Wow. Andrew Jackson's wearing footy pajamas.

737
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:15,500
The presidents operate on like a baseball team's system where it's like, well, on some days they wear their home uniform.

738
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,500
Some days they wear away. Other days they were throwback.

739
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,500
Sure. From the future.

740
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:26,500
Whether they're dressed as angels as they are today in heaven.

741
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:34,500
Was there any there was it was there was no talk of keeping President Square in a tight timeline like Galaxy's Edge, right?

742
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:39,500
Where it would only have been 50 years out of all the all 200 plus that America's been around.

743
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:45,500
It's only the newer president, only the newer presidents, which is everyone's favorite president.

744
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,500
Yeah, right. They were. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

745
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:53,500
I think we can all agree no matter what side you're on, the best presidents have been the last four or five.

746
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,500
Yeah, only the best.

747
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,500
Well, yeah, not a lot of newer stuff now that you say that.

748
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,500
I guess not. I will hear.

749
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:08,500
So the President Square celebrates the birth of democracy and the patriots who fought to preserve it.

750
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,500
OK, so that's that would that would take you up to the mid 90s.

751
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:16,500
Not so much today through the magic of audio animatronics technology.

752
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,500
Guests may meet these American heroes in Hall of Presidents.

753
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:28,500
The Hall of Presidents is here and potentially, according to different sources, I saw that's just it's fully moved.

754
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,500
We've robbed the people of Disney.

755
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:40,500
Maybe it's possible they could have done a copy, but that's a lot of robots to remake, rebuild or replicate it.

756
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,500
They hadn't gotten that far in the decision making process.

757
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,500
Oh, wow. That's interesting. Yeah.

758
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,500
If they if they had to ship them all and then what would have gone there?

759
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,500
I mean, that's still like you would would you re theme the whole like Liberty Square and Disney World?

760
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,500
Because what do you do? What's the point?

761
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,500
What's the point? If it's not fun?

762
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, not that.

763
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,500
That's not what it wanted. So that's fine.

764
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,500
I'll say it for us, say it again.

765
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:11,500
Sleepy Hollow Dark Ride, Ichabod, legend of Ichabod, of the Headless Horseman chase.

766
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,500
Sounds good, but there's not room for that there.

767
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,500
I mean, that's a good idea for a ride. Maybe it's a big theater.

768
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,500
It is. You're not going to get out.

769
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:24,500
And then you think if it's a smaller dark ride, maybe, you know, it's like a toad size or that's fine.

770
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,500
That's fine. Yeah. Hey, Madcap.

771
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,500
That's not bad. Hey, they shared a movie Ichabod and Mr. Toad.

772
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,500
That's true. Yeah. Yeah.

773
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:35,500
Yeah. Spider-Man and Transformers fit into pretty compact sound stages.

774
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,500
I bet they're bigger though. Maybe I'm wrong.

775
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,500
They probably are.

776
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,500
Okay. Well, we'll take a look.

777
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:46,500
Yeah, put the Headless Horseman in everywhere.

778
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,500
Yeah, sure. No, that is a good, that's a fun, scary property.

779
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,500
Surprise he's not in this park.

780
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:56,500
That's like a fun, there's not a lot of American folktale stuff or tall tales.

781
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,500
I would say zero. Yeah.

782
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,500
It's all literal. Yeah, like why not?

783
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,500
Why did they need to decide on that?

784
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:06,500
It's only it's real historical figures. Yeah. Yeah.

785
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,500
And that's it. That would have maybe gone away quickly too.

786
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:14,500
Once the park was opening in a huge disaster, like, I'll bring some fun in here.

787
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,500
Cut one of the president's heads off or something and say he's the Headless Horseman.

788
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:27,500
I feel like they'd get trapped like with Hall of Presidents with this park in general and like the Hall of Presidents now, they can never demolish it where people would be apoplectic.

789
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,500
Well, they can demolish it right now.

790
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,500
The Hall of Presidents? I think they could maybe demolish it now.

791
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,500
You think so? I think so.

792
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:40,500
Yeah, because think about like who's going to be like, whoa, they're taking it out because of Biden.

793
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,500
Yeah, I don't think. I don't think anybody's fighting that.

794
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,500
Look, I voted for the guy, but.

795
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,500
You know, they're tweeting about it and then that's the end of it.

796
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,500
Yeah, no, no, no.

797
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:54,500
There's I think that's my feeling is that like they're not going to be too much if they go, oh, by the way, it's closed.

798
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,500
We're working. We're repairing it again.

799
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,500
Oh, it's taking forever.

800
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,500
Oh, oh, you know what, by the way, oh, some parts.

801
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,500
Oh, we don't have them. Oh, it's over.

802
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,500
It's gone.

803
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:14,500
In an unprecedented move, we've teamed up with our competitors at Universal Studios for the Hall of Presidents presented by the Minions.

804
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,500
The Hall of Minions.

805
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,500
That sounds good.

806
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,500
Hey, that's good.

807
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,500
Minion heads instead.

808
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,500
Yeah.

809
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,500
Keep them in the fun.

810
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:25,500
And you got like, yeah, you got powdered wig minions and 1920s minions.

811
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,500
Yeah.

812
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,500
It could be the Hall of Precedents, which sounds even worse.

813
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:36,500
That sounds like there are there are titles of what comes later that are about as dry as the Hall of Precedents.

814
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,500
I would say.

815
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:44,500
Also, recent history has shown us that precedent means nothing as opposed to vibes.

816
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:50,500
Jason, as I said, as I made the light joke, I went, oh, what a dark thing to say right now.

817
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,500
Let's get out of it.

818
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,500
Let's get away from it as fast as we can.

819
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,500
Oh, good. Well, we'll get away from it and go into the Native American.

820
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,500
Oh, come on.

821
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,500
Do we skip it? Do we skip it?

822
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,500
Oh, no. Okay. All right.

823
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,500
No.

824
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,500
Let's well.

825
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,500
There's an insane detail in it.

826
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,500
Okay. Yeah.

827
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:08,500
That kind of undoes whatever good intent was there.

828
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:17,500
Is that in the middle of the Native American section, which I believe would at least partially hit on the Trail of Tears?

829
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:26,500
Like they didn't say would hit the wildest thing is that what they were going to put in Native America was a Lewis and Clark rift ride.

830
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,500
Mm hmm.

831
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,500
In Native America.

832
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,500
What?

833
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,500
I guess they were like, well, those are some fun.

834
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,500
That's some fun.

835
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,500
America IP is Lewis and Clark to throw in there.

836
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,500
So let's do it.

837
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,500
We can all look.

838
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,500
Yeah.

839
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,500
Hey, they're making a fun movie about them with Chris Farley.

840
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,500
That's right.

841
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,500
Is that way?

842
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,500
No, they're like equivalents, right?

843
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,500
They're like, yeah, they're not.

844
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,500
No, they're not.

845
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,500
Lewis and Clark.

846
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,500
They're like thereabouts.

847
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,500
Yeah.

848
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,500
Yeah. Yeah.

849
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,500
So they were like, these guys are going to be hot.

850
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,500
These characters, these real life people were going to be hot.

851
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:04,500
Well, probably if anybody's mad that it's Lewis and Clark and there's bad things in that history, we'll change it to the almost heroes characters.

852
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,500
Right.

853
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,500
As soon as that's a big hit.

854
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,500
Do we know the names of the almost heroes characters?

855
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,500
Do we dare look it up?

856
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,500
We don't.

857
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,500
Feel free.

858
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,500
I'm going to look it up.

859
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,500
It's really fascinating.

860
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,500
And you could keep, you could even keep talking.

861
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,500
And if it's not good, I won't even say it.

862
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,500
If it doesn't make me laugh, I won't say it.

863
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,500
We can move on to the not fully cooked Civil War fort.

864
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,500
Uh huh.

865
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,500
The next not fully cooked land.

866
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,500
Um, OK.

867
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,500
Yeah.

868
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,500
So this is all right.

869
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:34,500
The Civil War fort allows guests to experience the reality of a soldier's daily life.

870
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,500
Fun.

871
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,500
Insanity.

872
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,500
Yeah.

873
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,500
OK.

874
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,500
Yeah.

875
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,500
Let's real quick.

876
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,500
In the old 200 years ago.

877
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,500
Why?

878
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,500
Like.

879
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,500
Yeah.

880
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,500
I don't know.

881
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,500
That's the problem with these.

882
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:54,500
You go to the fields and you think about, you reflect and you're mournful, but you don't

883
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:58,500
get to find out like how bad the shoes were they had to wear.

884
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:04,500
This is an experience that is solely for going to like a historical site.

885
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:09,500
Somewhere as a kid you're like, as Jason was saying, you're a little antsy for a real ride,

886
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,500
but like you were like trying to like put yourself back there.

887
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:16,500
But as a kid you can't visualize what like going through horrors are like.

888
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,500
Which is why.

889
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:22,500
Look, the it's probably inappropriate to put it there, but the Lewis and Clark rap ride

890
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,500
is something like is there has there been one thing in the list so far that we're like

891
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,500
sounds good.

892
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,500
Well, the train train, but there's rain.

893
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:34,500
They've had train rain or I like honestly, I'm pro the smoke coming out of the stacks.

894
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,500
You guys were like the you walk in and see a lot of smoke and you're excited.

895
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,500
Yeah.

896
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,500
Reminds you of going to flappers.

897
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,500
It reminds me of flappers.

898
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,500
And I like the idea that there's a chimney sweep that has to go up and go to work.

899
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,500
So yeah, so at least the other raft.

900
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,500
There you go.

901
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,500
At least.

902
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,500
Yeah, that will give you a little thrill.

903
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,500
Yeah.

904
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,500
Yeah.

905
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,500
Reality of a soldier's daily life.

906
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,500
Not so much.

907
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:02,500
Then we go into Disney's Circle Vision 3D 360 to transport you into the center.

908
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,500
I mean, first of all, it loses me right there.

909
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,500
I don't know how you guys feel about these three sixties.

910
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,500
I think these are all bummers.

911
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,500
I think this is a genre of bummers.

912
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:14,500
I'm probably making somebody mad is one that I don't know is kind of a little fun.

913
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,500
I like the timekeeper one.

914
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:27,500
But in general, those are like I have to stand to get when you're a child, the most tired being on the planet and like I have to just hold a rail.

915
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,500
I don't get to sit.

916
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,500
You can't.

917
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,500
They're so mad at the 360.

918
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,500
They're too high to lean for a kid.

919
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,500
Yeah.

920
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,500
I remember.

921
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,500
Do I put my my little soft neck on this?

922
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,500
Do I do?

923
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,500
I just sit.

924
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,500
Probably somebody will yell at me.

925
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:47,500
I certainly don't sit on the rail because then somebody will definitely yell at me.

926
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,500
Probably my mom.

927
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,500
I hate the idea.

928
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,500
I did not like we've never talked about a 360 movie.

929
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,500
Yeah, I don't.

930
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,500
I don't.

931
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,500
I'm sure I saw a 360 movie when we when I was a kid and we went to Disney World.

932
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,500
But I have seen them as an adult.

933
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,500
And it's a great.

934
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,500
It sounds great, doesn't it?

935
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,500
It sounds fun to have a 360 movie.

936
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:12,500
But the reality of it is it's superfluous.

937
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,500
It doesn't work.

938
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,500
It doesn't make sense.

939
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,500
Show me what you want me to look at.

940
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,500
I don't need to be jerking my head back and forth.

941
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:23,500
That gets old after like two tries where you go, oh, I can turn around and I can see behind you.

942
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,500
Then you stop.

943
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,500
You stop doing it because they do kind of direct you.

944
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,500
They do.

945
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,500
Because how do you not?

946
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,500
I mean, the filmmaker, given that assignment, is like, OK, yes.

947
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:36,500
But there's a reason why you point one way when making a movie.

948
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,500
I'm going to kind of sort of guide this in one direction.

949
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,500
It should be like IMAX.

950
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,500
It should be like 270 or something.

951
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,500
280.

952
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,500
Not 360.

953
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,500
We don't need all the degrees.

954
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,500
We don't need all the degrees.

955
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,500
Too many degrees, folks.

956
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,500
Too many degrees.

957
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,500
I like them.

958
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,500
OK, I don't get them much thought.

959
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,500
And their hours are so odd nowadays.

960
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:57,500
I haven't seen them.

961
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,500
I don't need them to go away.

962
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,500
I don't make a point of them.

963
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:13,500
I think it was kind of killing two birds with one stone back in the day where they could develop a new technology, test it out, put it somewhere in the park where they can build the theater from scratch.

964
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:20,500
I think at their best, these sorts of like theme park movies like Impressions de France, they end up a little odd.

965
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:27,500
Like they end up absurd or unique like they've stumbled into being an art movie.

966
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:37,500
But then at their worst, they're more like, oh, I was telling you guys earlier about Harmonious Live and I thought the actual show with all the singers and performers and stuff was great.

967
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:42,500
There was also a weird short film in there narrated by Kristen Bell.

968
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:53,500
That's one of those Disney things where they try to use shots of people from many of many walks of life doing many activities.

969
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,500
And they try to have something for everyone but not offend everyone.

970
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,500
And there's just a bunch of nothing really.

971
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,500
Yeah. So it ends up becoming like a thing an alien made.

972
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:06,500
So I think that here is a book report about humans and Earth.

973
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:21,500
But all that said, they might have been on to something because eventually the Gettysburg Visitor Center built a massive new visitor center, which does include I don't think it's a full circle vision, but like a 180.

974
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,500
Okay, I like 180. Sure.

975
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,500
180 is good.

976
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,500
I think it's longer.

977
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,500
Yeah, it's longer.

978
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:32,500
I could use a few more degrees, honestly, because then I'm really immersed more.

979
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,500
Sweet spot is somewhere.

980
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,500
180 not enough.

981
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,500
250ish, 240.

982
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,500
240 is where I feel like it's right.

983
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,500
But 180 is good.

984
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,500
I'm into 180.

985
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,500
Okay, we're getting there.

986
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,500
Yeah.

987
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:49,500
This boy, if there are circle vision stands in the audience, we have lost them all.

988
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:55,500
I think Jason honestly gave the biggest insult to circle vision by saying, I don't even really think about it that much.

989
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,500
Wow.

990
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,500
That's so dismiss.

991
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,500
I mean, that's so dismiss cold.

992
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,500
That's like Chuck.

993
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,500
Spoiler alert.

994
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,500
Better call Saul when Chuck tells Jimmy, you know, he doesn't care about him.

995
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,500
I don't even care about you.

996
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,500
Oh, I thought you were going to say I paid them the biggest compliment.

997
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,500
No, no, you're probably do like them the best.

998
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,500
No, I know.

999
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,500
But I can't remember outside seeing.

1000
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,500
I think I saw the Canada one like eight or ten years ago.

1001
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,500
You know?

1002
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,500
Yeah, yeah.

1003
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,500
I would rather have people talking about me in a slightly negative way than somebody go.

1004
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,500
I don't even think about it ever.

1005
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,500
You want to be negative.

1006
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,500
Have you guys seen Fantastic Planet?

1007
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:28,500
No.

1008
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,500
Don't get me started.

1009
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,500
I don't know what you mean at all.

1010
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:39,500
It's the movie that's in the land pavilion where the Lion King environmental movie used to be.

1011
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,500
Oh, yes.

1012
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,500
Oh, and where symbiosis was.

1013
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,500
Yeah.

1014
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,500
Yeah.

1015
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,500
Oh, that's I mean, clearly we're playing in the territory of all these things.

1016
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,500
This is what this park is going to have.

1017
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,500
Oh, yeah.

1018
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,500
All my favorite aspects of all these.

1019
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:58,500
So, yeah, you get to go into the center of Civil War combat.

1020
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,500
That's great.

1021
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:05,500
And then outside, you may encounter an authentic reenactment of a period battle.

1022
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,500
More battles.

1023
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,500
OK.

1024
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:13,500
I mean, at least I mean, yeah, this is something it could be potentially be somewhat historically

1025
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:21,500
factual and also, I guess, is something to look at if I'm just basing purely on like, you know, something visually interesting.

1026
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:26,500
Whoa, that guy had to throw down his fat back and hard tacked and like start firing his rifle.

1027
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,500
Mommy, mommy, the soldiers hard tack.

1028
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,500
Can we get hard tack and fat back?

1029
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,500
No, Jason, we already have some at home.

1030
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,500
You know that.

1031
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,500
We're always stuck.

1032
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,500
We get them involved from Cosco.

1033
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,500
You have your hard tack at home.

1034
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,500
Oh, this one's coughing a lot.

1035
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,500
Oh, no, he's the sick one.

1036
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,500
He's still his toe.

1037
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,500
He's on death's door.

1038
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,500
Look away, Jason.

1039
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,500
Look away.

1040
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,500
This is too real.

1041
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,500
You're for a stubbed toe at that time.

1042
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:56,500
Writing a letter to his wife on the battlefield.

1043
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,500
This is the end of I.

1044
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,500
So he talked.

1045
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:10,500
But the big the big centerpiece of this is alluded to earlier, a thrilling nighttime spectacular based on the historic confrontation between the

1046
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:19,500
monitor and the Merrimack, a real life battleship battle that is being presented as a spectacular as their

1047
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:28,500
so has Mick or they're like, you know, when Universal had one that was like a ripoff Miami vice, like that was the first one in Orlando is like the fake

1048
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:34,500
Crockett and to these like guys with the ripped shirts are going to ride around and speed boats in this one.

1049
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:38,500
It is real warships firing at each other.

1050
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:43,500
The lights are out and it's time for the reenactment warships.

1051
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,500
They're shooting the hell out of each other.

1052
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,500
Funny as hell.

1053
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:57,500
Yeah, I don't know who didn't even if it was just presented in like and then at night we sit and quietly watch a reenactment of the battle of the like even

1054
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:06,500
that's a different presenting presentation of it versus and then prepare to be dazzled by the lights and spectacle of two battleships as they shoot

1055
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:12,500
colorful fireworks out of the top of their whatever they call them of Merrimack Tasbeck.

1056
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:17,500
Hey, look at those battleships like here we go.

1057
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,500
Like this crazy.

1058
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,500
It looks like these two parts of the country are getting along.

1059
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,500
Let's see how it goes.

1060
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:28,500
Oh, there's an alien that jumped alien woman that jumped out of the bushes.

1061
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,500
Hello there.

1062
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,500
I turned brother against brother.

1063
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:39,500
Look how does these two battleships dazzle you with a firework display like you've never seen.

1064
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:43,500
America was nothing but love until I showed up.

1065
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:47,500
I planted the seeds of hate in this otherwise perfect nation.

1066
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:50,500
I don't even know what they're fighting about.

1067
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,500
This is hard to tell.

1068
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,500
I'm not sure.

1069
00:57:52,500 --> 00:58:00,500
We've stumbled on the best twisted idea for this whole place is explain away every bad thing that ever happened in America with an alien woman that won't tell you her name,

1070
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:16,500
which if you don't know, we're talking about we did an episode on a cut show called Splash Tackle where an unnamed like Rita repulsed type pops out of the up top bushes wreaks havoc on Nikki and you know of your business.

1071
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:20,500
I real quick side note, I completely forgot to text you.

1072
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,500
And I guess we should really do this on Singap but I have to do it now.

1073
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:30,500
So we talk about on this episode and this is a good ad for the second gate go to patreon.com where we have a bunch of bonus episodes.

1074
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:40,500
But we talk about how Mickey has guards in this particular Epcot show and they have Mickey silver like big chrome chrome on their chests and on every limb of their body.

1075
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,500
Yes, they're on stilts the intense, which we made.

1076
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:47,500
We posted the videos of cards and then all it's stomp stomp stomp.

1077
00:58:47,500 --> 00:59:00,500
Yes, and it's so crazy because like wasn't making of guards and why are they like he's comfortable with his face being like the image as they use like their Mickey clubs to beat people like season seems a little very dystopian dystopian and grisly.

1078
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:04,500
Here's what I noticed as I'm driving by the Disney lot on the gate.

1079
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:08,500
Instead of spikes, they have little Mickey.

1080
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,500
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

1081
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,500
Yes.

1082
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,500
So that's in the real world.

1083
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:17,500
If you try to get in there, you could get impaled on Mickey's metal head.

1084
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:25,500
But I made that point in the episode that the you know the the soldier should have told Mickey think you're going to want to spear right.

1085
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:29,500
Yeah, impaling is going to go better right with a sharp point.

1086
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,500
I don't care.

1087
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:34,500
It's my face because you wanted to play into the thing we wanted to bludgeon is what I said.

1088
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,500
I want to bludgeoning is better.

1089
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,500
But yeah, kind of fence.

1090
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,500
Bludgeon themselves.

1091
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,500
If you bludgeon them, they can't have an open casket funeral.

1092
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,500
Good fellas.

1093
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,500
Joe Pesci's mother and good fellas.

1094
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,500
Ugly corpses.

1095
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:57,500
But I drove by and I was like, oh my God, look, look, it's little metal head protecting the protecting the empire with his metal weapon.

1096
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,500
With it.

1097
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,500
And it seems more friendly.

1098
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,500
Which one?

1099
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,500
It seems more friendly than spikes.

1100
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,500
It seems less.

1101
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,500
Oh, yeah.

1102
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,500
Come on in.

1103
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,500
Come get a closer look.

1104
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:08,500
It rips my chest open.

1105
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,500
It is seem nicer.

1106
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,500
You're right.

1107
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,500
It's like as I fall on it trying to scale the fence.

1108
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,500
God, I have not thought about how fun it is.

1109
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,500
So funny.

1110
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:20,500
Protecting the border with big blunt Mickey.

1111
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:26,500
Drive by if you're in Burbank, drive by the Disney studios and see Mickey's face protecting the empire.

1112
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,500
Mickey's head, I should say.

1113
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,500
Wait, this is so again, let me.

1114
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,500
All right.

1115
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,500
Look, I looked up some some stats.

1116
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:45,500
If you can believe I didn't have the Civil War stats already in my brain, the battle this is based on the first time that iron clad warships fought each other.

1117
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,500
Right.

1118
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,500
After this, there were no more wood ships.

1119
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:51,500
Everyone rushed to build their warships out of iron.

1120
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,500
And it was considered a draw.

1121
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,500
However, the Confederates lost seven.

1122
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,500
Seven soldiers died.

1123
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,500
Union lost 261.

1124
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:11,500
So it's a draw where astronomically more of the side that I feel like we are rooting for.

1125
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,500
I think that's right.

1126
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,500
I believe you are correct.

1127
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:22,500
So so yeah, it was it was historically it's listed as a draw is what you're saying or they were going to present it as a draw in the Disney show.

1128
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:28,500
I think well, the ships in real life, the monitor and the Mirama both survived.

1129
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,500
OK, so that's why.

1130
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,500
So that's it's considered a draw now.

1131
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:37,500
Oh, yeah, sure. We lost 200 people, human beings.

1132
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:41,500
But if you're just going off of ship numbers, it was a draw.

1133
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:47,500
So which is maybe look, this is an issue that they have in general with this.

1134
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:53,500
But with anything, Civil War and the part if you're depicting something where the Confederacy wins, that doesn't feel great.

1135
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,500
Certain battles they did.

1136
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,500
So that's going to come up.

1137
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,500
Right.

1138
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,500
Well, this it's like maybe that's why they picked this one book.

1139
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:08,500
We have we know that the nighttime spectacular has to be a real battle or has to be with feelings died.

1140
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,500
But we are.

1141
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:15,500
Well, can we soften the blow by at least making it not a sweeping Confederate victory?

1142
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,500
Yeah, I see. I see what you're saying here.

1143
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:25,500
Yeah, that's it feels like people really rack their brain and try to solve this equation of like, how do we make it?

1144
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,500
Still, they came up with one of the funniest things I've ever heard.

1145
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,500
I feel like Eisner.

1146
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:37,500
This is it's it's this it's that great Eisner hubris where he didn't think there was the possibility of a wrong answer.

1147
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:42,500
Yeah, this was still he had not had a it was all hits at this point.

1148
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,500
So he's like, whatever it is, is going to be great.

1149
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:49,500
He just kind of threw out. We got to blend history and fun figured out.

1150
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,500
You will. You always do. Love you.

1151
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,500
Imagineers. This came back.

1152
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,500
I'll be their front row.

1153
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,500
Never occurred. This might be weird.

1154
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1155
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:06,500
Yeah, I believe he said he thought they'd be like picking them up and putting them on their shoulders like they'd be celebrated.

1156
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:15,500
But the reality is when you just in the metaphor, when you throw something against the wall to see what sticks, there's going to be stuff that doesn't stick.

1157
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:20,500
And maybe there is no sticking.

1158
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:21,500
Yeah. Or sometimes there's no.

1159
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,500
In this case, truly, that is the end of the story.

1160
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,500
There was nothing stuck.

1161
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:32,500
Did I say, by the way, that this is all this thrilling nighttime spectacular is over Freedom Bay.

1162
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,500
That aspect.

1163
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,500
Another like Simpsons joke or something.

1164
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,500
Yeah. Freedom Bay.

1165
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,500
So, yeah.

1166
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:49,500
So I really was the idea that like there would be like purple fireworks or something shooting out or were they going to, I guess, keep it realistic.

1167
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:52,500
And it would just be like plain.

1168
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,500
Oh, I see what you're saying.

1169
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:59,500
Yeah. Just like the colors of flares shot out of the Titanic.

1170
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,500
What would get people to rescue them?

1171
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,500
So would they be red or would they be yellowish?

1172
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:05,500
I suppose.

1173
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:11,500
I mean, I guess the boat battle at the Pirates of the Caribbean looks pretty good.

1174
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,500
You're right.

1175
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:14,500
That's a good point.

1176
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,500
That's exciting to be between.

1177
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,500
I don't know.

1178
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:19,500
Yeah.

1179
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,500
Yeah.

1180
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:31,500
But yeah, I guess I'm saying like it feels like it feels like this would be a Disney fireworks show because they're not going to fight like it's not real combat between two subs.

1181
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:34,500
It has to just be explosions.

1182
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:39,500
Oddly, the monitor and the Merrimack fired all kinds of colors out of the shit.

1183
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,500
I was built into these new warships.

1184
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:46,500
And weirdly, they fired it up in the pattern of one big circle and two tiny circles.

1185
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,500
Oh, wow.

1186
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:48,500
Historically accurate.

1187
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:56,500
Closer to like that Penguin sub from the Batman 66 show probably where they could shoot multiple colored weapon or weapon charges or whatever.

1188
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,500
That'd be a water spectacular.

1189
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:01,500
Oh, yeah.

1190
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,500
So this is straight.

1191
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:05,500
The Civil War aspect is very strange.

1192
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:10,500
Can we think of like, what would you put here?

1193
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:18,500
Say you're imaginary and Michael Eisner is just like, like he threw the words at you that we just said and he was like, figure out what the nighttime show is.

1194
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:22,500
And you're like, what would you what could you even possibly do here?

1195
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,500
It's over.

1196
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:24,500
OK, we'll go for it.

1197
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,500
I was going to say, I got it based on something I've done in the past.

1198
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,500
It's Fourth of July every night.

1199
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,500
Yeah, same way.

1200
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,500
New Year's Eve every night in Pleasure Island.

1201
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,500
Fourth of July every night at Freedom Bay.

1202
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,500
That's great.

1203
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,500
Yes.

1204
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,500
Freedom Bay.

1205
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:42,500
It's always Fourth of July.

1206
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:51,500
Philadelphia always they shoot off their fireworks down by the Delaware River, you know, and so like there's plenty of cities and towns that shoot off the fireworks over bodies of water.

1207
01:05:51,500 --> 01:06:00,500
The best fireworks for the fireworks I ever saw were it might have been Cape Cod or somewhere, but they used the old war cannons and that was part of it.

1208
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,500
And that was neat.

1209
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,500
That was cool.

1210
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,500
That's all you have to do.

1211
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:04,500
It doesn't have to be a real battle.

1212
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:05,500
That's insanity.

1213
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:13,500
Also, they were going to have the I think the next one in the order is an Ellis Island kind of area, which I think would have had a Statue of Liberty.

1214
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,500
So why is it not just fireworks over the Statue of Liberty?

1215
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:21,500
Why did it ever enter anyone's mind that a real battle has to be portrayed?

1216
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:27,500
Yeah, yeah, I don't I don't know, because again, it's filling the role of phantasmic because that was the language they used.

1217
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:34,500
We have not brought up one possible way to take this, which is that all of the soldiers are Disney characters.

1218
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:39,500
Well, look, I think Chip.

1219
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:49,500
Yeah, I you know, Scott, you would have been an award winning editorial cartoonist in 1994.

1220
01:06:49,500 --> 01:07:02,500
Because there are some very tedious newspaper cartoons from this time period of like Mickey like shitting on the Constitution or if you have that, send that to me.

1221
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:05,500
I would like to see that there's an amendment for you.

1222
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:08,500
This one's for you, G.G. Allen.

1223
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:13,500
I think was there one with Abraham Lincoln and his big stovepipe hat as a Mickey ears on it?

1224
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:16,500
That's pretty funny. That's pretty cute.

1225
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:20,500
That's kind of every possible every monuments nobody cares about.

1226
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:22,500
They're putting Mickey ears on it.

1227
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,500
Yeah, the worst defiling I ever.

1228
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,500
This is what they want to do.

1229
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,500
Literally put a Mickey hat on everything.

1230
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,500
They should have gone the other way.

1231
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:38,500
As I said, they should have like justified everything by just making them all Disney characters and completely rewritten American history.

1232
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:44,500
And then we have involved a lot of like giant fish and crabs.

1233
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:47,500
And yes, living candelabra.

1234
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,500
Uh huh. Yeah, yeah.

1235
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:52,500
All of the Beauty and the Beast characters would be involved as well.

1236
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:55,500
So the We the People.

1237
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,500
Can I read from the brochure on this?

1238
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:09,500
Framed by a building resembling Ellis Island, We the People recognizes the courage and triumph of our immigrant heritage from the earliest native settlers to the latest political refugees.

1239
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:20,500
This I think they actually like it does sound a little severe for a theme park, but this does sound nice.

1240
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:21,500
It sounds uplifting.

1241
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,500
It sounds inspiring.

1242
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:24,500
It's not again.

1243
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:30,500
Nowadays have the chunk of the country would be apoplectic about this idea.

1244
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,500
Yeah.

1245
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:39,500
And it's not presented like it's that doesn't say like you're going to go on a rip roaring ride through the immigration process or something, which is it doesn't seem right.

1246
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:40,500
Like the spectacular.

1247
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,500
Yeah, I'm saying that.

1248
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,500
Yeah, they're presenting it in the right way.

1249
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:48,500
I mean, I know more Ellis Island was just like, do you not you know enough consumption?

1250
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:49,500
OK, good.

1251
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,500
Your name is now Stephen Harry Stephen.

1252
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:53,500
On you go.

1253
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,500
Stamp.

1254
01:08:55,500 --> 01:09:05,500
Well, you're right that this might have been just kind of a nice, like subtle nod to the immigrants who have added to the fabric of America.

1255
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:11,500
But then you have to then there was the turn that happened at some point in time where it was we're doing it with the Muppets.

1256
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:12,500
It's gonna be the Muppets.

1257
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:15,500
Yeah, there was the introduction of the Muppets.

1258
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:25,500
Which made I don't know which could I even am seeing somewhere said that that's inside the Statue of Liberty that you go see a 3D Muppet in the immigration movie.

1259
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:26,500
Yes, really.

1260
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,500
I missed this completely.

1261
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:29,500
Now we're talking.

1262
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:30,500
Well, sure.

1263
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,500
It was the Statue of Liberty.

1264
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,500
Is it like Miss Piggy?

1265
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:38,500
No, I think it is the normal Statue of Liberty from the outside.

1266
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:42,500
OK, you go inside and it's full of riffraff.

1267
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:46,500
How much better if that was like a six story Miss Piggy Statue of Liberty?

1268
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:49,500
Yeah, yeah, certainly.

1269
01:09:49,500 --> 01:10:00,500
But again, the offense that might have been taken by you have put mouse ears on Lincoln and put a pig's face on a woman's face on this gift from France.

1270
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,500
Right.

1271
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,500
Where is the biggest fake Statue of Liberty?

1272
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,500
Is it in Vegas?

1273
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,500
Oh, that's interesting.

1274
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,500
Is that that big?

1275
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:07,500
Oh, in New York, New York?

1276
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,500
Or is it like a Lego one?

1277
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,500
Yeah, right.

1278
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:20,500
Is there because I always I don't know that I ever thought about it in the theme park way, but I always kind of was fascinated by the end of Ghostbusters 2 with the Statue of Liberty walking around.

1279
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:23,500
That's your that maybe that's your spectacular.

1280
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:24,500
The end of Ghostbusters 2.

1281
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,500
Oh, now.

1282
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,500
OK, Jackie Wilson.

1283
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:30,500
Oh, yeah, that would all be awesome.

1284
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,500
I love the end of Ghostbusters 2.

1285
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,500
Yeah, yeah.

1286
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:34,500
I don't know.

1287
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,500
Disney doesn't own it or whatever, but I don't know.

1288
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:36,500
Figure it out.

1289
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,500
Yeah, figure it out.

1290
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,500
And figure out how to make a giant Statue of Liberty that walks around.

1291
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:41,500
Oh, man.

1292
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:42,500
After Life 2.

1293
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,500
Do you think the Statue of Liberty is going to walk again?

1294
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:47,500
It's a little Easter egg that the fans might recognize.

1295
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:51,500
Do you remember that there was a big statue?

1296
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,500
Somebody they go over the Statue of Liberty.

1297
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:58,500
There's a big like somebody put a big sheet over it and they pull it off and they go, it's the Statue of Liberty.

1298
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,500
I remember it from the second movie.

1299
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:02,500
Oh, I mean, the second story I heard.

1300
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:06,500
I think it's Statue of Liberty.

1301
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,500
I think we'll see.

1302
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,500
I mean, we're giving this idea away for free.

1303
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,500
So yes, put it in there.

1304
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:16,500
Which dead people will be reanimated in the next?

1305
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:20,500
America's dying to know which bodies will be puppeted around.

1306
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,500
There's no telling.

1307
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:28,500
So yes, Statue of Liberty walking around is a great idea if they could figure that out.

1308
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,500
Yeah, well, I don't think they were going to do that.

1309
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,500
But yeah, I know I'm saying you're your idea.

1310
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,500
Yeah, they should have done it.

1311
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,500
Something with the Muppets, maybe.

1312
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,500
I don't know.

1313
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,500
Sure.

1314
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,500
I mean, they have that history thing now that's fun.

1315
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,500
Where do we go from here?

1316
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,500
Enterprise.

1317
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,500
Enterprise.

1318
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:58,500
Another extremely grim, darkest that Lewis and Clark and the Industrial Revolution, two of the actual rides, probably two of the grimmest.

1319
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:06,500
But the Industrial Revolution ride that took you over like a big thing of lava might have been cool.

1320
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:15,500
So yes, it's like about, all right, so it's industry and ingenuity and innovation, the old factories and blah.

1321
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:20,500
But then, yes, you're probably the only thing in the park that sounds kind of exciting.

1322
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:21,500
Yeah.

1323
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:25,500
The Industrial Revolution, a high speed adventure through a turn of the century mill.

1324
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,500
That juxtaposition.

1325
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,500
But that's what you like about it.

1326
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,500
This is what we don't get anymore.

1327
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,500
This is what we'll never get from Disney or Universal.

1328
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,500
Well, yeah, this original IP.

1329
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:39,500
The IP isn't a Marvel movie.

1330
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:42,500
It's the Industrial Revolution.

1331
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,500
It's a time in American history.

1332
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:45,500
Great. It's a concept.

1333
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:48,500
It's an idea and it's a thrill ride based on it.

1334
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:49,500
Fantastic.

1335
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,500
Like I think fantastic, honestly.

1336
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:52,500
Yeah, yeah.

1337
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:53,500
I'd be excited about this.

1338
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:59,500
And then, as you said, culminating in a narrow escape from its fiery vat of molten steel.

1339
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:00,500
Yes.

1340
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:07,500
They kept pushing this at every turn that you and you come face to face with a bunch of molten steel with a big pot.

1341
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:14,500
I'm not sure that this was something that would happen on a daily occurrence at a factory where like your head would just breeze by.

1342
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,500
I mean, you get close.

1343
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:16,500
I guess that's true.

1344
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,500
People were probably getting killed because of unsafe labor conditions.

1345
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,500
But no one wanted to build the ride.

1346
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,500
The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire escape.

1347
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,500
It's a good point.

1348
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:28,500
Ride it out.

1349
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:40,500
That really they would have had to figure out how to square that circle where it was like the ride is about you almost dying in a factory 150 years ago, which is a very real possibility.

1350
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:43,500
If you lived back then in one way or another.

1351
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:44,500
Yeah.

1352
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:45,500
Yeah.

1353
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:52,500
So gradually die from whatever you're breathing or with your encounter with a fiery vat of molten steel.

1354
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:57,500
And I wonder, I always I'll say this.

1355
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,500
I don't know. I've said this before.

1356
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:06,500
I'm a sucker for when they do like either steam and water with light behind it to make it look like it's some sort of fire.

1357
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,500
Like, oh, yeah.

1358
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,500
Like, oh, yeah.

1359
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,500
Big Thunder.

1360
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:15,500
And then when they updated it out here and I've seen it, I guess, Harry Potter, the dragon.

1361
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,500
When you get blasted by the dragon.

1362
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:24,500
Well, I'm probably saying this because it's like these are more steampunky, but it's in the that makes it in the world of 1800 stuff.

1363
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:30,500
But I really like in Disney Sea, Journey to the Center of the Earth and 20,000 Leagues into the Sea.

1364
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:40,500
So if it was anything like like that just makes me think, OK, we know Disney built cool stuff with 1800 or that Geyser Mountain probably would have been cool.

1365
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:41,500
Yes, yes, yes.

1366
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,500
I think this would have been pretty great.

1367
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:53,500
I like knowing that if like if you if you try to imagine the vibe that unbuilt things had or things that were built have or and Big Thunder is kind of an 1800.

1368
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:59,500
Like, I think this one with with that team at that time would have been pretty fantastic.

1369
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,500
Sure. Yes, yes.

1370
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:07,500
It's got all the things that like people who like this stuff like in 2022 ago.

1371
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:08,500
I can't believe this is here.

1372
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,500
I can't believe they made this thing.

1373
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,500
It's legitimately fun to go on.

1374
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,500
The effects are cool.

1375
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:15,500
Like, it just checks.

1376
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,500
It seems to check all the boxes.

1377
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:21,500
Yeah. That of something we would be like, well, that park was a terrible idea.

1378
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:22,500
But you know what?

1379
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:26,500
That one ride, the Industrial Revolution ride was really good.

1380
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:38,500
And you're going to love if you like this, if you like that orange light with the white like, you know, fabric blowing to simulate fire, you're going to love the mascot of Disney's America, Mrs.

1381
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:39,500
O'Leary's cow.

1382
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,500
Oh, yeah.

1383
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:43,500
Mrs. O'Leary's cow gets up to in Chicago.

1384
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:53,500
Do you think, though, that, you know, that Disney, if again, this was a success, they could have built a whole O'Leary's cow amusement park in Chicago area at this point.

1385
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,500
Oh, we're in the fire land.

1386
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,500
Clareland.

1387
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:57,500
Mrs. O'Leary's cow.

1388
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:59,500
Or she's friends with Mrs. O'Leary's cow.

1389
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:00,500
Okay.

1390
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:03,500
And she like does something to help or hurt.

1391
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:04,500
I guess help.

1392
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:05,500
She would have to help.

1393
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:08,500
She doesn't start the fire that burns down most of Chicago.

1394
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,500
Cow town.

1395
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,500
It's a play.

1396
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:13,500
A bunch of cows, some fictional and one real.

1397
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:14,500
Yeah.

1398
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:15,500
Horses there.

1399
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:18,500
Horse, horse, collar and the other, you know, trying to sleep with the cows.

1400
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:19,500
Yes.

1401
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:20,500
Yeah.

1402
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,500
Yeah.

1403
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:22,500
He's trying to make love to the various horses.

1404
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,500
That's right.

1405
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:28,500
So, yeah, you then get it.

1406
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,500
So here we that's something.

1407
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:37,500
If nothing else, if nothing else, industrial revolution, you get to a ride where you escape poor conditions.

1408
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:38,500
Right.

1409
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,500
Like a Knott's ride.

1410
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:40,500
Yes.

1411
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,500
That's another one.

1412
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,500
Yeah.

1413
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,500
Yes.

1414
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:44,500
Misery.

1415
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:49,500
I don't know if it would have had that aspect that you look at hundreds of people with horrible

1416
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:50,500
lives.

1417
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,500
Yeah.

1418
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:52,500
Yeah.

1419
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,500
And they're not sure.

1420
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,500
And those Knott's rides we're talking about, which are Timber Mountain, Log Ride and the

1421
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:56,500
Minecart.

1422
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,500
I never remember the full name of it.

1423
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,500
What is it called?

1424
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,500
Calico.

1425
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,500
Calico.

1426
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:02,500
Yeah.

1427
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:07,500
But yeah, you see animatronics of people who probably are like 30 years old that look 80

1428
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:09,500
years older than the hard lives they've lived.

1429
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,500
They look miserable.

1430
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:16,500
It's legitimately, they're both scary, I think, especially if you're a kid.

1431
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:17,500
Yeah.

1432
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:18,500
And they creak.

1433
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,500
They're so rusty.

1434
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,500
They're rusty and that's an accident.

1435
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:22,500
Genuinely scary.

1436
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:23,500
Worry.

1437
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:24,500
This tunnel is too narrow.

1438
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:27,500
If they have to get us out of here, it's going to take a long time.

1439
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,500
Yep.

1440
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:29,500
Yep.

1441
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:30,500
We're going to need jaws of life here.

1442
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:33,500
But that at high speed, great.

1443
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:36,500
So now I'm thinking maybe we're cooking with you guys.

1444
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:43,500
We'll see if we take that into Victory Field, which is simultaneously, I mean they namechecked

1445
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:46,500
the Wright Brothers early on in the descriptor.

1446
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:49,500
But then it's also kind of, so this is 1930 to 1945.

1447
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:57,500
So it's Wright Brothers, it's early flight, but then it's also World War II, which I don't

1448
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:00,500
know what World War II attraction is.

1449
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:07,500
You at least are in, you're in the territory of exciting aerial ducking and diving, but

1450
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:10,500
kind of with the specter of this is a real thing.

1451
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,500
There's a bunch of Nazis.

1452
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:13,500
Talking about Nazis.

1453
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:14,500
Yeah.

1454
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:21,500
Which though, I guess in their favor, Nazis have been portrayed in media and fictionalized

1455
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:28,500
so much, even though Nazis in a Disney park is probably not a good idea.

1456
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:33,500
It's certainly been portrayed more in a variety of ways.

1457
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:39,500
Well, I think they skirted it because I saw one thing that said one of the concepts would

1458
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:45,500
have been the world's first dueling inverted coasters and it would have been called dogfighter

1459
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,500
and it would have been biplanes.

1460
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:49,500
So we're back in World War I, baby.

1461
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:52,500
Just the Kaisers, the troops.

1462
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:55,500
Do Americans know why we joined World War I?

1463
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,500
No, I don't.

1464
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,500
I know we got in pretty late.

1465
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,500
Yeah, I know.

1466
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,500
Yeah.

1467
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,500
So.

1468
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:03,500
A bit more attention to two glazed over one.

1469
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,500
Not sure.

1470
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:08,500
Bunch of weird old inbred royal families fighting each other over territory.

1471
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,500
That's what I think it was.

1472
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:13,500
Could Snoopy be on the ride with the World War I flying ace?

1473
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,500
That was the character, right?

1474
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:16,500
I mean, yeah.

1475
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:17,500
Oh, the red Baron.

1476
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,500
Yeah.

1477
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:21,500
I think those theme park rights are booked up.

1478
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:22,500
Wait, wait.

1479
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,500
Red Baron was the same as the World War I flying ace?

1480
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:25,500
Those are two separate characters.

1481
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,500
Am I wrong?

1482
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,500
Wasn't the red Baron though?

1483
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:32,500
Wasn't the red Baron who the World War I flying ace was fighting in peanuts?

1484
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,500
Oh, he's not the red Baron.

1485
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,500
And you never saw the red Baron? Am I incorrect?

1486
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:37,500
I'm not 100.

1487
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,500
I mean, I'll look it up here.

1488
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:40,500
The red Baron.

1489
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:41,500
Red Baron.

1490
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:44,500
I mean, you talk amongst yourselves while I do this.

1491
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:45,500
OK. Oh, yeah.

1492
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,500
Well, I'm seeing Snoopy versus the red Baron.

1493
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:48,500
There you go.

1494
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,500
I bet this is a very common.

1495
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,500
This is a Frankenstein Frankenstein's monster.

1496
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,500
Yeah, for sure. Yeah.

1497
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,500
So I don't think you ever see the red Baron.

1498
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,500
I'll say this about those little Snoopy.

1499
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:05,500
If you've ever seen these little pieces of parts of the I forget which movie or even which show that that's in.

1500
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,500
But they're very upsetting to me.

1501
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:08,500
I never liked them.

1502
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,500
They're like silence.

1503
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:17,500
Snoopy is like having a dog fight on top of his dog house with an unseen red Baron character as a kid.

1504
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,500
I did not know anything about history.

1505
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:22,500
I was confused and the whole thing was upsetting to me.

1506
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:26,500
Why are they getting away from these these cute giant headed children?

1507
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,500
Yeah, I like the giant headed children.

1508
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:35,500
I like Snoopy, but I do not like seeing him in a dog fight in World War One, which I understand the creator is much older than me.

1509
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,500
Yeah.

1510
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:42,500
But now other ideas of rides, you know, it's unclear what I mean, that sounds really good.

1511
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,500
Dogfighter sounds pretty great.

1512
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:58,500
I saw a mention of a VR aided parachute jump from a World War Two fighter jet, which sounds sort of like VR aided parachute jump from a World War Two fighter jet.

1513
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:03,500
That sounds like a precursor of the sort of the idea for the Avengers.

1514
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:04,500
Yes.

1515
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,500
But he ticket.

1516
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:07,500
Yes, certainly does.

1517
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,500
Mm hmm.

1518
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,500
Which you have another thing that will never happen.

1519
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:12,500
Will not happen.

1520
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:17,500
Yeah, yeah, it's like the Avengers one looked like it was going to be started in a Quinjet.

1521
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,500
And then I just burped.

1522
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,500
Then you then you fell out of it.

1523
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:35,500
You parachuted of some like some super like super scientific parachute or something and then fought the villains in some like big maybe 360 circle vision style.

1524
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:36,500
Too many degrees.

1525
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,500
Maybe too many degrees, honestly.

1526
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,500
So if it wasn't too far.

1527
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:43,500
Yeah, maybe that's why I got canceled because there were too many degrees.

1528
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:47,500
Yeah, you've been protesting the Madison Square Garden sphere.

1529
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:50,500
That's the MSG sphere coming to Vegas.

1530
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:53,500
Yeah, the test one that's over by the Burbank Airport here though.

1531
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,500
You got wrecked because I was on top of it.

1532
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:56,500
That's right.

1533
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:57,500
You were taking the pieces off.

1534
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:01,500
Yeah, I was mad that this could be 360.

1535
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,500
Now, here's another.

1536
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:05,500
I mean, and we'll get into this a little later.

1537
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:15,500
But I it all some of the history that's attributed to this park is the idea that some attractions were developed for that found homes elsewhere.

1538
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,500
And I don't know.

1539
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,500
I can't find the exact documentation of it.

1540
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:26,500
But but certainly some sources say that Soren was potentially a concept for this part.

1541
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:27,500
I saw that.

1542
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:28,500
Which a pretty cool.

1543
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:29,500
Pretty cool.

1544
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:30,500
Let's think about that.

1545
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:35,500
If it had Soren, which kind of saved California Adventure a little bit.

1546
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:36,500
Yeah.

1547
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:37,500
So Soren was the big.

1548
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:41,500
Really all on the back of Soren when that was the major thing that they had.

1549
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,500
So you got Industrial Revolution.

1550
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,500
You got your raft ride.

1551
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:46,500
Yeah.

1552
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:50,500
And then you have a Soren over Civil War battlefields.

1553
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,500
Like, that's the only issue.

1554
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,500
Yeah.

1555
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:57,500
Or is it is it a World War Two fight?

1556
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:58,500
Yeah.

1557
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:00,500
Kind of mushing up Soren for your life.

1558
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:02,500
World War One and two.

1559
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:06,500
Probably some of the California like commercial aviation probably in there.

1560
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:07,500
What's going through?

1561
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:09,500
Maybe they go through every war.

1562
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,500
They go through every aerial war.

1563
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:16,500
But up until today's and then they update it with the same soundtrack though that we have now.

1564
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:17,500
Yeah.

1565
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:22,500
Well, if you look at it, did everyone pull this this one?

1566
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:29,500
There's kind of one drawing with like each land kind of just in colored like I saw a different one.

1567
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:30,500
Basic one.

1568
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:40,500
It all conveniently stops right at the the World War Two, the victory of World War Two basically like 1945.

1569
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,500
It seems to be the most recent.

1570
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:43,500
Oh, yeah.

1571
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:44,500
Yeah. Yes.

1572
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,500
It's not a more recent history.

1573
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:47,500
Yeah.

1574
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,500
So they they've just taken off the board like the complicate.

1575
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:57,500
They've taken off the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, women's liberation, like all of the later 20th century recent history.

1576
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,500
They're like, we're not going to touch it.

1577
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:04,500
There's got to be an up caught for this place, you know, in the in the future plans when they're talking about building it.

1578
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:06,500
So they have to leave some on the table for later, Jason.

1579
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:15,500
I look the 2010s were going to be, you know, full build out was going to happen in like 2015, 2017.

1580
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:21,500
The imaginers were so excited about Vietnam theme park attractions, but they're like, we can't do it yet.

1581
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:25,500
We need to wait for that second park before we can we can find the fun.

1582
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,500
I want to play the two songs.

1583
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,500
I want to play.

1584
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:29,500
I'm running on now.

1585
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,500
I'm running on now.

1586
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,500
Two Vietnam songs.

1587
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,500
Yeah. So right there.

1588
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,500
It's a reverse galaxy's edge.

1589
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:39,500
Honestly, it's not future stuff.

1590
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:40,500
It's past.

1591
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:42,500
They cap it there in the past.

1592
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:43,500
Yeah.

1593
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:47,500
We're getting towards one that really breaks my brain.

1594
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:52,500
And it is this not the land in general state fair.

1595
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:57,500
We are finally at we need an excuse to get some rides into this.

1596
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,500
Right. There have to be rights here.

1597
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:02,500
So it's so now this is very familiar.

1598
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:10,500
We're at like it's a recreation of an old pier of Coney Island type with a big Ferris wheel and a wooden roller coaster.

1599
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,500
OK. So again, sounds familiar.

1600
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:15,500
This eventually becomes Paradise Pier.

1601
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:22,500
This is the beginning of this Eisner premise of like just a place with rides for God's sake rides that we can not.

1602
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:28,500
We don't have to invent the basic mechanism of what the ride is.

1603
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:33,500
You don't have to change like physics as we know it in order to accomplish something innovative here.

1604
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:40,500
Just the cheapest rides come up with some bullshit to explain why we have cheap rides here in the past.

1605
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:43,500
19 20s. Yeah. Great. Fantastic. All right.

1606
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:46,500
Few. All right. Start building these basic rides.

1607
01:25:46,500 --> 01:26:05,500
Then we get to oh boy amid a backdrop of rolling cornfields fans may have a hot dog and take a seat in an authentic old fashioned ballpark and watch America's legendary greats gather for an exhibition all star.

1608
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:08,500
Now this I love.

1609
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:12,500
All right. All right. Yeah. This is so funny.

1610
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:16,500
I don't know about you, Mike, but the older I get, the more baseball I watch.

1611
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:19,500
It's something that's clicked in my biology.

1612
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:23,500
That's I don't have that yet, but I do like going to a baseball game.

1613
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:25,500
If baseball is on, I will watch it.

1614
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:28,500
It was the first thing I ever wanted to do for a living.

1615
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,500
I probably lasted six months. It probably didn't last very long.

1616
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:41,500
Probably also ended after I realized there's I'm not a good athlete and they pulled me out after I pitched one inning in first grade and it ruined my confidence for another decade.

1617
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:50,500
I thought I was doing fine. My memory is I was pitching the first inning because like my parents were like, let him pitch one of the innings because he really wants to be a pitcher.

1618
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:53,500
So I pitched in the inning and then the coach is like, all right, great.

1619
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:56,500
You did great. Back to right field.

1620
01:26:56,500 --> 01:27:01,500
Back to right field. And I remember being like, what? I thought he said, OK, no, no, no.

1621
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:04,500
He's coach standards. Impossible. Coach is a real nice guy.

1622
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:07,500
I will say that. But yeah, so no baseball.

1623
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:10,500
But I like baseball and I would watch it if it's on.

1624
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:15,500
But I am not watching more yet. I'm trying to keep up with all the professional wrestling I watch.

1625
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:20,500
Oh, sure. There's too much already of that sport that I enjoy.

1626
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,500
So but this is this is fantastic.

1627
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,500
We have this. This is a big premise to unpack.

1628
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:28,500
This is so this is an athletic event that is a theme park show.

1629
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:31,500
Yes. How does this work? I don't know.

1630
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:35,500
What do you mean? Because it can't be scripted.

1631
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:38,500
Right. But it's hired.

1632
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:45,500
It's hired baseball players. So is this just like, is it truly just a baseball game?

1633
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:50,500
It cannot. It can't be a baseball game. Yeah, there is no way baseball game.

1634
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:53,500
Well, you know what? You can probably script a baseball game.

1635
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:56,500
It just has to. It can't be a full length game.

1636
01:27:56,500 --> 01:28:01,500
I guess professional wrestling has taught us you can script most that you can, you know, yeah, you lock stuff out.

1637
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:04,500
Sure. Now, it is pretty hard to aim a baseball.

1638
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,500
Yeah, that's the issue in wrestling.

1639
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:09,500
There's not a an item that you don't have.

1640
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:13,500
Like, yeah, unless maybe there's a way to throw.

1641
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:18,500
But if there's like an air cannon that's hidden in front of the catcher or the ump

1642
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:26,500
that like they pretend to throw the ball and then the guy pretends and then there's like a sound effect of a bat cracking like a stunt show.

1643
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:30,500
You're saying it's a simulated. Don't worry, folks. They're not actually playing baseball.

1644
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,500
Right. Well, but they will. Yeah, they'll shoot a ball out.

1645
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:37,500
But it's coming out of like a ho it's coming out of like a piece of PVC pipe or something.

1646
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:44,500
And it's shooting it so we can get it in a pinpoint like pinpoint exactly where they want it to like the like throwing the Spider-Man robot.

1647
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,500
They can get it where they need it for the story.

1648
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:51,500
So when babe when the babe comes out, because you know, the babe has to close this thing, there's no way.

1649
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:55,500
Here's the other premise. This is an all star game in the 30s and 40s.

1650
01:28:55,500 --> 01:29:01,500
So, yeah, that implies it's the best baseball players from old baseball.

1651
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,500
Yeah. Playing together.

1652
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:10,500
Now, I don't know where anyone like the exact years any of these players played like Ty Cobb, Billy Bruce.

1653
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,500
I don't know, but I assume they're there.

1654
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:15,500
How many can we name the end of the list?

1655
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:19,500
Jackie Robinson, Joe Jackson.

1656
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:24,500
Yeah. Yeah, I know some more Chicago Cubs, but I don't think they're going to tell you right now.

1657
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:28,500
Ty Cobb's first one cut. They're not dealing with Ty Cobb.

1658
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:31,500
History's most racist man. Ty Cobb.

1659
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:32,500
Oh, is that right?

1660
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:41,500
I believe there's it's in the Ken Burns documentary because Ty Cobb comes up a little bit.

1661
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:43,500
He comes up a few times.

1662
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:50,500
And one of the times is a guy in the stand calls him some sort of slur.

1663
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:57,500
Ty Cobb climbs in the stands, starts beating the man up and someone says, stop, stop.

1664
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:01,500
He's crippled. And Ty Cobb's response was like, I don't care.

1665
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:08,500
Ah, yeah. So kind of a villain who still has a number of baseball accolades named after him.

1666
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:16,500
But if that if that happened in this in this show, it would be like the Vader of the show.

1667
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,500
Boo boo Ty Cobb.

1668
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:25,500
All right. Let's boo the cheating Chicago White Sox team from that one season.

1669
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:33,500
This I I'm trying to really wrap my head around what they would do because the theme park show 20 ish minutes, right?

1670
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,500
15, 20 minutes.

1671
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:39,500
They have games that are what at minimum eight hours, eight and a half.

1672
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:45,500
Yeah, I guess you could maybe get like a 30 minute show at a theme park.

1673
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,500
Forty five is pushing it. It better be really good.

1674
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:50,500
Like the Aladdin show California Adventure.

1675
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:52,500
If you want to go that long.

1676
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:54,500
But what if they were thinking beyond this?

1677
01:30:54,500 --> 01:31:00,500
What if they were like, we're just going to we're going to play full baseball games with people?

1678
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:01,500
There's no way.

1679
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:03,500
Yeah, who would little league?

1680
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:07,500
That's your entire get two games, two or three, two, maybe three games.

1681
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:11,500
And if they played like six innings or so, maybe they did baseball.

1682
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,500
Do they always play nine innings?

1683
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:15,500
Usually. OK, it's been historically been nine.

1684
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:20,500
Well, I know that. But I'm saying like in the old days, was there ever a time when they played two innings?

1685
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:22,500
Well, yeah, conveniently. Yeah, they looked it up.

1686
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:25,500
And yeah, it used to be used to be one.

1687
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:29,500
And there was a buzzer that everybody after 10 minutes, everybody got one at bat.

1688
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:32,500
And they also sang a song before they swung.

1689
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:37,500
Yeah, they saw a song that introduced them and who they were and what team they were on.

1690
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,500
All right. I got a pitch for the show.

1691
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:43,500
I think it'll work. You get all the man.

1692
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:46,500
You get the mascots, you get baseball mascots.

1693
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:53,500
OK, you get Mr. Met, you get the Philadelphia Fanatic and they tell you the history of baseball and a pepper's ghost.

1694
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:57,500
It's mixed in with pepper's ghost scenes on the field.

1695
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:59,500
Big plays on the field.

1696
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:10,500
So that's how you replicate it, because some players can like Babe Ruth calling a shot like some players can hit a ball like to a certain part of the stadium.

1697
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:14,500
And they are usually a once in a generation talents.

1698
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:16,500
They're like Babe Ruth or Shohei Otani.

1699
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:22,500
So they can't you're saying somebody can't do the Babe Ruth shot exactly three times a day.

1700
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:25,500
That's why the pipe is the PVC pipe is there to shoot the ball out.

1701
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:30,500
Yeah, some sort of energy, some thrust, some sort of air blast.

1702
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:41,500
Yeah. So and but a PVC pipe can also shoot the ball in the same part of the stands and everyone lines up early to get in that same part of the stands because every show you shoot out the ball.

1703
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,500
Someone gets to go away with a free souvenir.

1704
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:46,500
That's Disney, though. They're not going to do that.

1705
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:48,500
This isn't a Chuck E. Cheese show on the pier.

1706
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:49,500
They're not going to give things away.

1707
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:52,500
One baseball, like four or five baseballs a day.

1708
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,500
It's up, Jason.

1709
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:55,500
It's like those coins.

1710
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:58,500
It's like they give you a little souvenir coin or something.

1711
01:32:58,500 --> 01:32:59,500
Maybe, maybe.

1712
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:03,500
But they also could do it where, like, you don't see everybody in, like, right field in the bleachers.

1713
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:05,500
And that's where the ball goes.

1714
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:06,500
So they could collect the ball at the end.

1715
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:07,500
Yeah.

1716
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:08,500
So I don't know.

1717
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:09,500
I could see it either way.

1718
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,500
I could see going either way.

1719
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:15,500
It's also dangerous to shoot a ball into the stands.

1720
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:16,500
That is very true.

1721
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:17,500
Yeah.

1722
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:21,500
Now, my father caught a foul ball at a baseball game a few years ago.

1723
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:22,500
Wow.

1724
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:26,500
And if he hadn't caught it, it would have given one of us brain damage.

1725
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:27,500
It was.

1726
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:28,500
We were behind home plate.

1727
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:29,500
He didn't want to.

1728
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:30,500
He had no choice.

1729
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:33,500
We were behind home plate and the thing shot up, which is a big net.

1730
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:34,500
That way? Oh, God.

1731
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:35,500
There's a big net there.

1732
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:36,500
Whoa.

1733
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:39,500
And it went straight and it came straight down on us.

1734
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:40,500
Wow.

1735
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:41,500
And he bare handed it.

1736
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:42,500
Geez, really?

1737
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:43,500
Yeah.

1738
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:44,500
Hey, that's a good dad moment.

1739
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:45,500
Pretty good.

1740
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:46,500
Wow.

1741
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:47,500
Wow.

1742
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,500
When I was a kid, that was my problem with baseball.

1743
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:56,620
I had seen like one or two news reports about like a child died after getting hit by a baseball

1744
01:33:56,620 --> 01:33:57,620
in a little league game.

1745
01:33:57,620 --> 01:33:59,380
And I was like, that's going to happen to me.

1746
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:00,380
I'm not graceful.

1747
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:02,260
I'm not good at catching these fly balls.

1748
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:04,340
I'm really not good at it.

1749
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:08,180
They don't often come very far into the outfield.

1750
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:13,120
And I was just like, I'm either going to get killed or I'm going to watch one of these two

1751
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:15,100
coaches kill each other.

1752
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:18,100
Did you play sport like baseball, Scott?

1753
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:20,100
Yeah, I made it to like coach pitch.

1754
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:21,100
Okay.

1755
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:22,100
What year is that?

1756
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:23,100
I did.

1757
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:24,100
kindergarten?

1758
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:25,100
No, like second grade.

1759
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:26,100
Okay.

1760
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:27,100
I guess that's about where we were at.

1761
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:28,100
Maybe.

1762
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:30,100
Did you ever see two dads almost go at it?

1763
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:31,100
No, because I did.

1764
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:32,100
Oh, boy.

1765
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:33,100
Oh, yeah, I saw.

1766
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:34,100
I did too.

1767
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:35,100
It's like at one year.

1768
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:38,100
It's like every other game.

1769
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:39,100
It did.

1770
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:42,100
It's so funny because it was so upsetting to see as a kid.

1771
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:44,100
And thinking about it now, it is so funny.

1772
01:34:44,100 --> 01:34:45,100
And doesn't make any sense.

1773
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:48,100
Anybody like any tooth damage?

1774
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:53,100
There wasn't any like like beating within the inch of someone's life, but it was just

1775
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:55,100
like screaming and I don't know.

1776
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:57,100
So maybe some pushing.

1777
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:01,100
And then it's funny now to imagine that those guys are younger than me right now.

1778
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:02,100
Yes.

1779
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,100
Yeah.

1780
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:04,100
Yeah.

1781
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:06,100
Like what was going on in their lives?

1782
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:12,100
I think it's funny that sports come up so seldom on the show that this this is essentially

1783
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:16,100
is like baseball has come up as a topic.

1784
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:17,100
Let's do well.

1785
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:19,100
Let's all do our baseball.

1786
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:23,100
Yeah, I I we have to have talked about based.

1787
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:25,100
No, I guess we probably didn't.

1788
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:26,100
Think about it.

1789
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:27,100
When would we have talked?

1790
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:30,100
Have I talked about my favorite player was Andre Dawson on the Cubs?

1791
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:35,100
I watched the Cubs like hardcore for a year when I was like in first grade and I loved

1792
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:37,100
Andre Dawson and I was so excited.

1793
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:42,100
I met I mean, we met Mark Grace from the Chicago Cubs to at Woodfield Mall, which I believe

1794
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:44,100
I brought up on the Woodfield episode.

1795
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:45,100
All right.

1796
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:46,100
All right.

1797
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:47,100
It came up via malls.

1798
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:50,100
It did end up there and horsed in their via malls.

1799
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:54,100
So thank God it was through some of the nonsense.

1800
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:58,100
But we got to we got to talk to some of my engineers who worked on this and figure out

1801
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:03,100
what the hell I want to know everything about how they were going to do baseball game history,

1802
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:05,100
baseball games, ghost base.

1803
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:08,100
They were going to do field of dreams every day, dreams every day.

1804
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:10,100
That's that's a home run.

1805
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:11,100
If I can steal.

1806
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:14,100
I mean, it is if you can figure it out.

1807
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:15,100
What is it?

1808
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:17,100
I think it was going to be from the cornfield.

1809
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:18,100
You walk out of the cornfield.

1810
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:19,100
No, sure.

1811
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:21,100
You build baseball diamond in the cornfield.

1812
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:23,100
But then what's the show?

1813
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:24,100
What do they do?

1814
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:25,100
I think there was going to be songs.

1815
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:26,100
This is what I think.

1816
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:27,100
There's a lot of songs.

1817
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:28,100
There's a lot of routine.

1818
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:29,100
You do the seventh inning stretch.

1819
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:31,100
You do take me out to the ballgame.

1820
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:34,100
There's so many rituals associated with baseball.

1821
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:39,100
It's a compressed baseball game like right field, right field.

1822
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:44,100
I'm aiming for the sad like it's like Les Mis or something.

1823
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:47,100
We're going to the right field.

1824
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:48,100
Yeah, I don't know.

1825
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:50,100
I think there were going to be songs.

1826
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:51,100
That's my guess.

1827
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:53,100
You're going to do right fielders anthem.

1828
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:54,100
Everybody.

1829
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:58,100
So there's less playing and more an original song about every position.

1830
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:00,100
The concessions sell themselves.

1831
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:02,100
I mean, the concessions are gold mine.

1832
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:03,100
Oh, yeah.

1833
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:04,100
You do hot dogs.

1834
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:05,100
You do cracker jacks.

1835
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:06,100
Disney.

1836
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:08,100
Ice cream and the little helmet cups.

1837
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:11,100
They didn't sell that back then, though, in the nineties.

1838
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:13,100
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1839
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:14,100
Period.

1840
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:16,100
That doesn't matter.

1841
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:19,100
You think they would sell the little plastic helmets nowadays?

1842
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:20,100
I think they would.

1843
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:21,100
Well, not back then, though.

1844
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:22,100
Blue sky.

1845
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:23,100
I bet they weren't going to do that.

1846
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:25,100
They would sell it the old fashioned way.

1847
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:26,100
That's my guess.

1848
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:27,100
Yeah.

1849
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:28,100
But maybe I'm wrong.

1850
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:31,100
It feels very Galaxy's edge where they wanted to remain period appropriate.

1851
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:32,100
OK.

1852
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:33,100
That's my guy.

1853
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:35,100
That's just from reading some of the material.

1854
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:36,100
This is my guess.

1855
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:38,100
It's a lot of like, you know, like Jason has a nice idea.

1856
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:39,100
What if there is helmet?

1857
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:41,100
No, that is too fun.

1858
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:43,100
No, we can't do it.

1859
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:44,100
No fun.

1860
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:51,100
And speaking of that mentality, family farm, family farm pays homage to the working farm,

1861
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:52,100
the heart of American visitors.

1862
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:54,100
See how crops are harvested.

1863
01:37:54,100 --> 01:37:57,100
Learn how to make homemade ice cream or to milk a cow.

1864
01:37:57,100 --> 01:38:01,100
Oh, no, no.

1865
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:03,100
Now that's not a touch point.

1866
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:04,100
I want you don't want to.

1867
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:05,100
Yeah.

1868
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:09,100
Jason, I think would have liked the cow part because Jason loved the animals as we talked

1869
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:10,100
about Big Thunder Ranch.

1870
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:11,100
I did.

1871
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:16,100
Was one of his favorite places they got rid of and they had was it a cow there or was it

1872
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:17,100
a horse?

1873
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:19,100
I mean, the horse at Disneyland, obviously, but they had goats.

1874
01:38:19,100 --> 01:38:21,100
Yeah, they had didn't they have one cow?

1875
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:22,100
Am I crazy?

1876
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:24,100
I think they would kind of rotate.

1877
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:25,100
Yeah.

1878
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:26,100
People in and out.

1879
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:28,100
So I think that Jason would have been involved in this.

1880
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:33,100
Now, Scott, I think you're talking about a section of a park where you would learn how

1881
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:34,100
to live with the land.

1882
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:41,100
And I think maybe this is what is triggering you here is that this is a very similar to

1883
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:42,100
buy some house.

1884
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:46,100
There'd be a house like a sad looking boy and a dog.

1885
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:47,100
That's right.

1886
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:50,100
And there's grain waving and waving in the wind.

1887
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:54,100
And the same from the it's the other side of the field of dreams.

1888
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:56,100
The side of the field of dreams.

1889
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:58,100
It's grain on this side and corn on that side.

1890
01:38:58,100 --> 01:38:59,100
All right.

1891
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:00,100
You can repeat the grain.

1892
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:03,100
And if you look closely when you turn around when you're walking, you can see the baseball

1893
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:07,100
players come back through and walk on the other side of the grain.

1894
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:08,100
Go back to hell.

1895
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:14,100
Vloggers like vloggers would just be furious of like Disney has had another fumble.

1896
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:21,100
Again, the mites have come for the grain at the corner, bordering these two territories.

1897
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:23,100
Just put some fake ones in.

1898
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:24,100
Yeah.

1899
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:27,100
Michael Eisner demanded real grain.

1900
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:28,100
I will say this.

1901
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:33,100
The description of this, though, does not excite me like baseball, like historical baseball

1902
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:34,100
players playing a game or anything.

1903
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:35,100
There's nothing.

1904
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:36,100
The word hootenanny in the barn.

1905
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:38,100
The for the phrase doesn't appear anywhere.

1906
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:40,100
You're missing something.

1907
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:41,100
You're missing something.

1908
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:45,100
We have it's not as crazy as we're going to do daily baseball games.

1909
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:49,100
But there is a there's this talk of maybe a barn dance.

1910
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:50,100
And there is talk of.

1911
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:51,100
Oh, OK.

1912
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:55,100
If there wasn't already the insanity of a baseball game, we'd be meditating on this

1913
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:59,100
more, which is that there would be a show you would basically you would get to visit

1914
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:01,100
a country wedding.

1915
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:03,100
You go to a wedding at the.

1916
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:04,100
I do.

1917
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:05,100
I go to a wedding in a barn.

1918
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:06,100
I do like that.

1919
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:09,100
That is, I do enjoy the sound of it.

1920
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:10,100
Yeah.

1921
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:14,100
You want to sit at a wedding, an old wedding in a barn of people you don't know.

1922
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:15,100
Well, OK.

1923
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:16,100
What does that mean?

1924
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:18,100
What are we dealing with here?

1925
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:19,100
Are they all performers?

1926
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:22,100
Are they actually hosting real weddings every day?

1927
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:25,100
It can't be because it's in the past.

1928
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:29,100
They can't unless they can find enough people who want to do period weddings every day,

1929
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:31,100
which may be they might be able to.

1930
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:33,100
I think this is a show in the show.

1931
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:38,100
We have the show that is baseball and the show that is wedding, the show that is wedding.

1932
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:40,100
But it's a country wedding.

1933
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:41,100
It's a country.

1934
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:43,100
And it's a barn dance.

1935
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:45,100
The barn dance related to the wedding.

1936
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:46,100
It might be after that.

1937
01:40:46,100 --> 01:40:53,100
And I think it's possible that a buffet that happens after is technically the catering of the wedding.

1938
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:56,100
So this is like a Tony and Tina's wedding.

1939
01:40:56,100 --> 01:41:01,100
So if we're in that territory, imagine a Disney, Tony and Tina wedding.

1940
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:02,100
This sounds better.

1941
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:03,100
Jason put it like that.

1942
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:04,100
Yeah.

1943
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:11,100
When the Imagineers located in Glendale, California, were coming up with real, authentic country weddings.

1944
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:21,100
So maybe it's like the Hoopty Doo review, which is in Florida, which is like a barbecue thing and a southern show.

1945
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:22,100
Maybe it's like this.

1946
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:23,100
That's fun, right?

1947
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:25,100
I think that I've never seen either.

1948
01:41:25,100 --> 01:41:26,100
I think it's fun.

1949
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:29,100
I'm surprised I haven't seen it because it seems like it's right up my alley.

1950
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:34,100
So if it's fun like that, then yes, this sounds like a great idea.

1951
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:40,100
Now, is it possible they just want to show you exactly how an old wedding was and how like maybe they're doing a full Catholic ceremony

1952
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:49,100
in the church and you have to go through an hour of like the scripture, which if you've ever done this, I assume you have the full Catholic in the church wedding.

1953
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:50,100
Probably.

1954
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:52,100
It takes blocked it out.

1955
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:53,100
You know what I'm talking about?

1956
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:54,100
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

1957
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:59,100
It's like we've all been to weddings where like it's not the ones we have the fake ones we all do or somebody's friend.

1958
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:01,100
Yes, somebody's friend does it.

1959
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:02,100
They make a little joke.

1960
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:03,100
That's not what weddings are.

1961
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:04,100
No one is speaking Latin.

1962
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:12,100
But I've even I've even been in a church for a wedding where my friends have been like cut off, like telling like the priest, like we don't want this.

1963
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:14,100
We don't want you to talk about this.

1964
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:18,100
Let's just say a couple of the nice passages and then let's get the show on the road here.

1965
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:21,100
We're in the church for my family and that's it.

1966
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:22,100
Let's get us.

1967
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:29,100
But then I've also been to the ones where they do the full like mass, the full like Catholic mass before the part of the wedding.

1968
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:31,100
Yes, I think that's the full of the real.

1969
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:42,100
If you're doing a real Catholic wedding, I think I think, correct me if I'm wrong, audience, that you do kind of a full mass beforehand and then the wedding goes on and boy, it drags.

1970
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:44,100
That is because that's an hour right there.

1971
01:42:44,100 --> 01:42:45,100
Exactly.

1972
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:46,100
Then you have to do other.

1973
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:51,100
Then it's the wedding and then you go to a different place to enjoy yourself.

1974
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:59,100
So if they're trying to be appropriate, like period appropriate, perhaps they would do the full mass here.

1975
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:00,100
I don't know.

1976
01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:01,100
I'm not exactly sure.

1977
01:43:01,100 --> 01:43:06,100
I don't know that a full mass is really a part of a country wedding.

1978
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:14,100
Well, as I said, I said, I shouldn't assume I don't know the religion of these country people that would hypothetical.

1979
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:15,100
Oh, it's something bad.

1980
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:16,100
Oh, they're bad.

1981
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:17,100
Maybe it's a full.

1982
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:21,100
Is there a full Baptist like ceremony before the actual wedding itself?

1983
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:22,100
I don't know.

1984
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:23,100
I don't know.

1985
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:31,100
There's a section where somebody's relative shames the bride and groom for having looked into each other's eyes before before getting married.

1986
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:33,100
The preacher is.

1987
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:36,100
Wait, did you did you guys watch that?

1988
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:38,100
I remember watching this as well.

1989
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:41,100
The pandemic, the Robert Pattinson Tom Holland movie.

1990
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:42,100
Oh, God, what is it called?

1991
01:43:42,100 --> 01:43:47,100
It's based on like some dark series, a really dark writer.

1992
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:52,100
And it's like in the like middle of like the border of Kentucky and another state.

1993
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:57,100
And that is the one where Robert Pattinson said, I do not need a dialogue coach.

1994
01:43:57,100 --> 01:44:01,100
And he's a preacher and the voice he comes out with.

1995
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:03,100
It's kind of like it.

1996
01:44:03,100 --> 01:44:08,100
So like like Scott Townsend doing the Queen of England sort of.

1997
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:13,100
But he's like a fire brimstone kind of con man preacher.

1998
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:14,100
All right.

1999
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:15,100
And that's what that's what it should.

2000
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:17,100
I mean, that would be a hell of a show.

2001
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:19,100
It should be like Uncle Baby Billy.

2002
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:20,100
Oh, yeah.

2003
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:23,100
Doing the wedding from Righteous Gemstones.

2004
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:25,100
Yes. So there's a version.

2005
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:28,100
There's a fun version and there's a less fun version.

2006
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:29,100
So who know?

2007
01:44:29,100 --> 01:44:30,100
Again, we don't really know, right?

2008
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:31,100
Like we didn't.

2009
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:32,100
We know these.

2010
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:37,100
And like, OK, these details are all out and readable.

2011
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:39,100
But who knows what would have been cut?

2012
01:44:39,100 --> 01:44:40,100
Who knows?

2013
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:44,100
I don't think they were exactly doing the math yet of how these shows are going to work.

2014
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:45,100
It might all have been cut.

2015
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:49,100
Yeah, it feels like what would have happened was basically it's just like a dining hall

2016
01:44:49,100 --> 01:44:51,100
buffet style.

2017
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:54,100
There'd be a stage and it'd be like, here you are.

2018
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:56,100
We're at like Judy's Wedding.

2019
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:58,100
We're here with for.

2020
01:44:58,100 --> 01:45:01,100
It's like it's more of a backstory than that's my guess.

2021
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:05,100
That feels like the easiest way to do it from like moving from one venue to the dance hall

2022
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:06,100
and to this.

2023
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:09,100
That seems that seems like that would have been cut.

2024
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:15,100
Here is the concept art from that executive summary of the farm.

2025
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:17,100
I don't know if it's in the brochure.

2026
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:21,100
And while I think it's a nice picture, it's not the most inspiring piece of theme park

2027
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:22,100
concept art.

2028
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:29,100
It is just a painting of a farmhouse and some fields and a barn.

2029
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:33,100
It's well, we it's not might be not the nicest land you've ever seen.

2030
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:34,100
Right.

2031
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:35,100
We make a good, honest living here.

2032
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:36,100
This is definitely.

2033
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:37,100
This is definitely.

2034
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:41,100
Yeah, they probably had to illustrate it like that because they wanted to show like this

2035
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:42,100
is realistic.

2036
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:44,100
We're doing it real.

2037
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:46,100
It's not like Mickey's barn.

2038
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:47,100
It's not Mickey's.

2039
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:50,100
No, it's not for some reason.

2040
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:51,100
Higings happen.

2041
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:54,100
You think like a big hose has comical leaks in it.

2042
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:58,100
No kids get shot in the face and get cooled in the summer.

2043
01:45:58,100 --> 01:45:59,100
No, no, no.

2044
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:00,100
Silo is used to store grain.

2045
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:03,100
There's nothing wacky going on here.

2046
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:07,100
A thrilling through line where every other whole family is like, is grandma's pie going

2047
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:09,100
to cool in time for dinner?

2048
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:13,100
The cousins are coming.

2049
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:14,100
And then a surprise where.

2050
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:16,100
For two towns over.

2051
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:20,100
Surprise twist where some visitor named Jason takes it.

2052
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:23,100
Sneaks away with it.

2053
01:46:23,100 --> 01:46:24,100
No, no.

2054
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:27,100
They carved code.

2055
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:29,100
They carved hobo code in our fence post.

2056
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:31,100
That's how we knew to get the pie.

2057
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:36,100
Jason faces off with a crafty coyote over the pie.

2058
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:41,100
So this one sounds familiar to you as well.

2059
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:45,100
You know, early California adventure at a farm.

2060
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:46,100
Is it a crazy fun farm?

2061
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:53,100
No, it's a farm that you look at and appreciate what farmers had to do and have to do to this

2062
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:54,100
day.

2063
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:57,100
So a lot of these odd Eisner ideas are born here.

2064
01:46:57,100 --> 01:47:00,100
And maybe as a result of all this, Eisner's and.

2065
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:03,100
Everything that we just said, I didn't are genuinely.

2066
01:47:03,100 --> 01:47:10,100
I mean, he was portraying this and his biography, this old second chapter about it.

2067
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:12,100
Like this completely was a passion.

2068
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:14,100
This is like a home run.

2069
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:18,100
It loves every bit of it dying to get it done.

2070
01:47:18,100 --> 01:47:25,100
So we got it and they came in to Virginia with model full plan.

2071
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:27,100
All right, here you go, everybody.

2072
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:29,100
How much do you want to make?

2073
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:30,100
How much do you love it?

2074
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:34,100
Boo, tomatoes, boo.

2075
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:38,100
Instant bad reaction.

2076
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:44,100
And here's where it gets odd is that, OK, the response, because it seems like as time

2077
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:49,100
went on, because they're like, all right, the city was not mad that they quietly bought

2078
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:51,100
up the land city.

2079
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:54,100
I think happy that's going to bring jobs.

2080
01:47:54,100 --> 01:47:55,100
Sure.

2081
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:56,100
It's going to be good for the for the area.

2082
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:58,100
This is a good thing.

2083
01:47:58,100 --> 01:48:02,100
Residents, I think, happy for the same reasons this could be.

2084
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:09,100
And residents, I think, had tried to make a mall happen on the same property on that

2085
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:10,100
Exxon land.

2086
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:16,100
And it fell apart because a bunch of historians and people trying to preserve the grounds,

2087
01:48:16,100 --> 01:48:19,100
you know, got angry at it and then it didn't happen.

2088
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:27,100
So if that happened for some mall that is not, you know, related to a firebrand like

2089
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:32,100
lightning rod kind of company, imagine what happens when the Disney name is attached.

2090
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:39,100
Yeah, it's it sounds like there's so much if you watch there's a great defunct land

2091
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:43,100
video, of course, about this topic that we are featured in.

2092
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:46,100
And I will be honest with all three of all three of you.

2093
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:49,100
I'm also, by the way, think there's an extra host that's not here.

2094
01:48:49,100 --> 01:48:52,100
I forgot that we are in this video.

2095
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:54,100
It was so long ago.

2096
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:55,100
Different world.

2097
01:48:55,100 --> 01:48:57,100
I go, oh, yeah, there's a defunct video.

2098
01:48:57,100 --> 01:49:00,100
I should just kind of watch this in the background while I'm just to refresh some of this stuff.

2099
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:02,100
And the first voice I hear is my own.

2100
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:03,100
It's you.

2101
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:04,100
Your eyes.

2102
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:05,100
Your eyes.

2103
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:06,100
I'm Isner.

2104
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:07,100
I think I did a bad job.

2105
01:49:07,100 --> 01:49:09,100
Honestly, I think my voice is a little better now.

2106
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:12,100
It's not great, but I really was like, I hate I hated how I sounded on this.

2107
01:49:12,100 --> 01:49:16,100
But I was trying to be Eisner and you beat me out.

2108
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:17,100
We both.

2109
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:19,100
Yeah, yeah, we both sent her both.

2110
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:22,100
I don't think I had a choice.

2111
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:26,100
I was pervert Senator Congressman Larry Craig.

2112
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:27,100
That's you.

2113
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:30,100
Yes, I was I was watching it again and I was like, who is Jason again?

2114
01:49:30,100 --> 01:49:34,100
And then Jason is Larry Craig, Larry Craig, the wide stance man.

2115
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:36,100
You don't remember the wide stance man.

2116
01:49:36,100 --> 01:49:37,100
I don't know.

2117
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:38,100
There's a bathroom stall thing.

2118
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:39,100
It was a bathroom stall.

2119
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:42,100
It was like cruising in an airport.

2120
01:49:42,100 --> 01:49:45,100
You know, it seems harmless nowadays.

2121
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:47,100
No, it was a yeah, it was quaint.

2122
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:48,100
Well, that's fine.

2123
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,100
That's a good part.

2124
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:51,100
That's at least a meaty part.

2125
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:54,100
So, yeah, I mean, the video is great.

2126
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:55,100
Takes you through all of it.

2127
01:49:55,100 --> 01:50:01,100
But so one important thing about when this happens, I mean, undeniably,

2128
01:50:01,100 --> 01:50:08,100
Eisner is inspired by Ken Burns and that we are in the wake of Ken Burns Civil War.

2129
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:15,100
It's Ken Burns mania out there, which means it wasn't just Ken who got some fame off of this thing.

2130
01:50:15,100 --> 01:50:20,100
The historians, the historians are rock stars or as much as you can be.

2131
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:22,100
For being a Civil War historian.

2132
01:50:22,100 --> 01:50:28,100
So David McCullough and Shelby Foote are, you know,

2133
01:50:28,100 --> 01:50:31,100
recognized once in a while when they're going to the market.

2134
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:32,100
Right.

2135
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:34,100
But these are suddenly more than ever.

2136
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:36,100
These are names that are trusted.

2137
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:40,100
And when these people got on board with the rebellion,

2138
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:44,100
with the people who the group that is trying to stop this thing from getting built,

2139
01:50:45,100 --> 01:50:53,100
they lend so much, you know, credence and weight to everybody's making these impassioned arguments

2140
01:50:53,100 --> 01:50:56,100
that are essentially like this is the end of all of America.

2141
01:50:56,100 --> 01:51:01,100
If we let this like as if this is like the ultimate battle for our culture.

2142
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:04,100
Like the hyperbole of these people was totally insane.

2143
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:05,100
Yeah.

2144
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:07,100
David McCullough and what's the other one?

2145
01:51:07,100 --> 01:51:12,100
Doerr's Curran's Goodwin kind of perennial nonfiction bestsellers.

2146
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:15,100
Doerr's Curran's Goodwin used to be on The Daily Show a lot.

2147
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:23,100
She wrote that team of rivals book about like Lincoln filling his cabinet with a bunch of rivals.

2148
01:51:23,100 --> 01:51:31,100
So, yeah, did you catch the bit about Disney's attempt to show where we can do American history?

2149
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:36,100
We're pretty good at it where they showed them the American adventure and Epcot.

2150
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:38,100
And they're like, well, what do you think?

2151
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:41,100
And they were like, no, that was the best.

2152
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:42,100
That was your attempt.

2153
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:44,100
They were warmer towards the Hall of Presidents.

2154
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:48,100
But just the idea of like, we got this in the bag.

2155
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:50,100
We're going to show them the American adventure.

2156
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:55,100
Yeah, things it was deep into the process and things are going badly with the historians.

2157
01:51:55,100 --> 01:51:57,100
And Eisner's like, but you know what?

2158
01:51:57,100 --> 01:51:58,100
You don't know.

2159
01:51:58,100 --> 01:52:04,100
And he now makes a point in his book, like which had not been updated since 1982.

2160
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:08,100
All presidents went over better because it was the latter day version with Maya Angelou

2161
01:52:08,100 --> 01:52:11,100
and acknowledge some of the darker stuff.

2162
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:19,100
Eisner's book says that first stop of that little trip of like, see, we can do real stuff was the making of me.

2163
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:28,100
The Martin Short film that we did a picture and episode about that's a Disney sex ed film, which I was trying to remember the.

2164
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:30,100
That's OK. So they thought, all right.

2165
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:33,100
So historians, you're going to calm down about this.

2166
01:52:34,100 --> 01:52:41,100
And then they sat him down in a theater and watched to watch Martin Short say, remember that sperm my dad had.

2167
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:45,100
Senator Larry Craig's like, oh, I like it.

2168
01:52:45,100 --> 01:52:48,100
Tell me more.

2169
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:55,100
I like and all the when reading about the historians, it really makes it seem like they're the avengers of historians.

2170
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:59,100
Like they've teamed up like they say they teamed up, which makes me like.

2171
01:52:59,100 --> 01:53:09,100
And then the historians were presented in the historians to me and maybe just because I have comic book brain, but they feel like the watchers or the like the Eternals or something.

2172
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:14,100
Oh, yeah. The historians are here to stop the Disney company.

2173
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:17,100
And I mean, they they helped, certainly.

2174
01:53:17,100 --> 01:53:23,100
You know, it was in the in the end game Infinity War that was Disney versus everyone else.

2175
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:26,100
I would say the historians did help the team.

2176
01:53:26,100 --> 01:53:29,100
They did come through those portals at the end and helped.

2177
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:37,100
And they're facing off against like a handful of Congress people and Governor of Virginia.

2178
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:40,100
Sure. The people on Disney side. Right.

2179
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:43,100
Some local residents. Yeah. Yeah.

2180
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:47,100
Well, the whole the campaign was kind of mounted by this.

2181
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:50,100
Now, this is some of the issue, I think, that I have with it.

2182
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:52,100
All right. You know, look, we went through it.

2183
01:53:52,100 --> 01:53:55,100
A couple of those rides sound OK, but this place sounds pretty annoying.

2184
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:59,100
And I am sure there would have been the issue of why are we trying?

2185
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:05,100
We're getting a firework show out of this horrible conflict with very serious issues at the core.

2186
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:08,100
But there would have been those problems with this place.

2187
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:14,100
And that's what public perception like that's the hill that this all died on.

2188
01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:32,100
But I do think that a big aspect of the campaign against Disney's America was wealthy property owners being concerned what this would do to their property value and to that like, is it going to make a bunch of trash pop up around here?

2189
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:36,100
Right. I mean, I saw the term NIMBY not in my backyard.

2190
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:39,100
That is kind of the and this is Eisner's point.

2191
01:54:39,100 --> 01:54:41,100
And can you take Eisner at his word? And should you?

2192
01:54:41,100 --> 01:54:57,100
Possibly not. But what he comes down to in his book and any time it comes up is like, well, what I didn't realize is that there were these incredibly wealthy families all over Virginia and that they went and called the historians and, hey, can you help us get this thing out of here?

2193
01:54:57,100 --> 01:54:59,100
And then so maybe it was like a not in good faith.

2194
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:03,100
They didn't care so much about the like philosophical issues.

2195
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:08,100
Just like I would not say I know the motivations of the Eternals or of the Avengers or the X-Men.

2196
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:21,100
I don't know the motivations of the historians, but I will say anytime something happens in this country, if you just dig a little bit, it's usually because some very rich people either didn't want something to happen or did want something to happen.

2197
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:23,100
So I will believe that.

2198
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:27,100
That's a story seems plausible for that.

2199
01:55:27,100 --> 01:55:30,100
That story seems plausible for that reason.

2200
01:55:30,100 --> 01:55:41,100
Well, I think just commercially and culture, Disney was shorthand for commercialization for like entertainment run amok capitalism run amok.

2201
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:47,100
Sure. Yeah, that is less of a concern nowadays because everything is everything is everything is just everything is run amok.

2202
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:48,100
Disney owns everything.

2203
01:55:48,100 --> 01:55:49,100
Yeah, Disney owns everything.

2204
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:51,100
Yes. Yeah, we are well past amok.

2205
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:57,100
Yeah, we're well past like there's tact and we can all agree this was good.

2206
01:55:57,100 --> 01:55:59,100
This is our respectful.

2207
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:04,100
Soon as soon as you to put that song in the iPod commercial, it was all over.

2208
01:56:04,100 --> 01:56:08,100
As soon as Vertigo was in that iPod commercial.

2209
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:09,100
You think it was?

2210
01:56:09,100 --> 01:56:11,100
I thought you meant putting the album on the.

2211
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:13,100
No, that was after that was after.

2212
01:56:13,100 --> 01:56:14,100
Yeah, yeah.

2213
01:56:14,100 --> 01:56:15,100
I'm talking about.

2214
01:56:15,100 --> 01:56:16,100
Hello. Hello.

2215
01:56:16,100 --> 01:56:18,100
We're at a place called Vertigo in that.

2216
01:56:18,100 --> 01:56:20,100
I think it was that song.

2217
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:27,100
Yeah, that early with the black and fluorescent like people in the is that what you're talking about with the dancing?

2218
01:56:27,100 --> 01:56:30,100
There was there was but there were dancing in all the iPod commercials.

2219
01:56:30,100 --> 01:56:31,100
I feel like.

2220
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:33,100
OK, but I don't know.

2221
01:56:33,100 --> 01:56:34,100
I could be wrong.

2222
01:56:34,100 --> 01:56:36,100
That might not have been the end of everything.

2223
01:56:36,100 --> 01:56:38,100
Yeah, I don't believe so.

2224
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:44,100
But I just remembered it being a big moment when like a band was going to use their song for a commercial or something.

2225
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:45,100
What? Oh, yeah.

2226
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:50,100
So the you're saying the perception was that you two was to it's all finally selling out.

2227
01:56:50,100 --> 01:56:53,100
You two had sold out this extremely.

2228
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:56,100
Could I get a quick rogue punk band?

2229
01:56:56,100 --> 01:57:03,100
Yeah, yeah, that's they were they had been completely pure up until that point and then it was all over.

2230
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:14,100
I in comparing and contrasting then and now like so there's like quotes about what this thing was going to do that were just so.

2231
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:16,100
Melodramatic.

2232
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:31,100
Here's one conservative columnist Charlotte Allen says that Disney's America will bring about nothing less than the certain destruction of all that is left in northern Virginia of a traditional family and church centered rural way of life.

2233
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:32,100
Huh? Huh?

2234
01:57:32,100 --> 01:57:34,100
This is going to destroy.

2235
01:57:34,100 --> 01:57:36,100
Then I was like, what's up with Charlotte Allen?

2236
01:57:36,100 --> 01:57:38,100
I never heard that name before.

2237
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:39,100
Looked it up.

2238
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:40,100
Looked it up. Looked her up on Twitter.

2239
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:46,100
I can't tell you how many times she has retreat retreated Scott Adams in the last three.

2240
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:47,100
Oh, my.

2241
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:48,100
Oh, wow.

2242
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:50,100
Every day, Scott.

2243
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:54,100
There is a new Dilbert centric issue in America.

2244
01:57:54,100 --> 01:57:55,100
Oh, my gosh.

2245
01:57:55,100 --> 01:57:58,100
Yeah, like evolution denier.

2246
01:57:58,100 --> 01:58:01,100
Besides all the expected transphobic racist stuff.

2247
01:58:01,100 --> 01:58:09,100
So she probably wasn't upset that like it was going to make history look too kind to to like the presidents and stuff.

2248
01:58:09,100 --> 01:58:18,100
She was probably worried that like like the they would sell Little Mermaid with the penis cover or something like she was probably worried for like that weird puritanical thing.

2249
01:58:18,100 --> 01:58:19,100
I'm guessing this is my guess.

2250
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:20,100
I don't know her.

2251
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:21,100
I just know she retweeted.

2252
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:22,100
Scott Adams is new information.

2253
01:58:22,100 --> 01:58:23,100
Yeah.

2254
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:24,100
Yeah.

2255
01:58:24,100 --> 01:58:26,100
So she was worried Disney was going to corrupt.

2256
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:34,100
It's one of those that I love that there's so little culture on that side of things that everyone has to pretend they love Dilbert.

2257
01:58:34,100 --> 01:58:37,100
Now we love Lee Greenwood and Dilbert.

2258
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:38,100
We're fine with that.

2259
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:41,100
We have we don't need Beyonce on our side.

2260
01:58:41,100 --> 01:58:45,100
We prefer to read Dilbert and then go far.

2261
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:50,100
We've got Dennis Miller and Adam Carolla.

2262
01:58:50,100 --> 01:58:53,100
Hollywood is quaking in its boots at this new.

2263
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:54,100
Oh, Jason.

2264
01:58:54,100 --> 01:58:56,100
What is it called?

2265
01:58:56,100 --> 01:58:57,100
The Gina Carana movie.

2266
01:58:57,100 --> 01:58:59,100
Something on the prairie.

2267
01:58:59,100 --> 01:59:00,100
Everyone calls it the Gina Carana.

2268
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:02,100
Something on the prairie is what it's called.

2269
01:59:02,100 --> 01:59:04,100
I think it's all quiet on the prairie.

2270
01:59:04,100 --> 01:59:06,100
It's called Gina is Back.

2271
01:59:06,100 --> 01:59:07,100
Gina is Back.

2272
01:59:07,100 --> 01:59:09,100
Scared Hollywood.

2273
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:10,100
No, we don't.

2274
01:59:10,100 --> 01:59:13,100
Should we stop thinking about her the second this?

2275
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:17,100
There are hundreds of movies no one's ever heard of made every day here.

2276
01:59:17,100 --> 01:59:21,100
We are supposed to be scared because you made a sub red box.

2277
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:22,100
No one cares.

2278
01:59:22,100 --> 01:59:27,100
I mean, just so articles are just insane.

2279
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:30,100
You know, could there have been some problems with this?

2280
01:59:30,100 --> 01:59:32,100
Would this have been on the weaker end of Disney Park?

2281
01:59:32,100 --> 01:59:33,100
Very possibly.

2282
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:36,100
But like, oh, my God, I would.

2283
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:42,100
Frank Rich was writing about how this is going to bring prostitutes and drugs to the area.

2284
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:45,100
Yeah, famous Disney byproducts.

2285
01:59:45,100 --> 01:59:48,100
Yeah.

2286
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:58,100
And then he says, Will Colonial Williamsburg itself, a doctored imitation of history and a precursor of Disneyland, add audio animatronic Colonials to its cast of actors?

2287
01:59:58,100 --> 02:00:01,100
Which I say that sounds awesome.

2288
02:00:01,100 --> 02:00:05,100
You go to Colonial Williamsburg, it's a colonist robots walking around.

2289
02:00:05,100 --> 02:00:06,100
Great. Yeah.

2290
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:07,100
What would be the problem?

2291
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:08,100
Yeah.

2292
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:09,100
Yes.

2293
02:00:09,100 --> 02:00:10,100
Be better.

2294
02:00:10,100 --> 02:00:11,100
Yeah.

2295
02:00:11,100 --> 02:00:13,100
Look, they were ready.

2296
02:00:13,100 --> 02:00:18,100
I don't think this would have sunk the country.

2297
02:00:18,100 --> 02:00:21,100
No, this would have been something to laugh at constantly.

2298
02:00:21,100 --> 02:00:23,100
Yeah. Like, is it still there?

2299
02:00:23,100 --> 02:00:25,100
There's something that was hilarious.

2300
02:00:25,100 --> 02:00:27,100
There's still the Industrial Revolution.

2301
02:00:27,100 --> 02:00:30,100
The actors still have to do the baseball shows.

2302
02:00:30,100 --> 02:00:34,100
This is for people in the stance that the night time spectacular.

2303
02:00:34,100 --> 02:00:36,100
It's down to one battleship.

2304
02:00:36,100 --> 02:00:39,100
The other one's been broken for 10 years, but they're still pretending it's there.

2305
02:00:39,100 --> 02:00:40,100
It's been in B mode.

2306
02:00:40,100 --> 02:00:41,100
Only one ship.

2307
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:45,100
They just say it's there in the distance, but you can't see it.

2308
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:46,100
You hear sound effects.

2309
02:00:46,100 --> 02:00:48,100
You hear it, but you can't see it.

2310
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:49,100
Hold the ship up.

2311
02:00:49,100 --> 02:00:50,100
I'm trying.

2312
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:55,100
But yeah, no, this wouldn't have rotted our brains any more than hundreds of other things

2313
02:00:55,100 --> 02:00:57,100
that rotted our brains as kids.

2314
02:00:57,100 --> 02:00:58,100
No, no.

2315
02:00:58,100 --> 02:01:03,100
And like with as proof of that, the whole thing.

2316
02:01:03,100 --> 02:01:07,100
OK, so again, let me go back to a point from the beginning.

2317
02:01:07,100 --> 02:01:15,100
By the time this got to America at large, and what is it that plastic Disney wants to do?

2318
02:01:15,100 --> 02:01:19,100
They want to build on top of a Civil War battlefield.

2319
02:01:19,100 --> 02:01:25,100
Even these historians are writing like they want to remove real history and place put synthetic history.

2320
02:01:25,100 --> 02:01:26,100
Wrong.

2321
02:01:26,100 --> 02:01:29,100
This was some plot of land that Exxon had.

2322
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:32,100
They weren't going to do anything to the battlefield.

2323
02:01:32,100 --> 02:01:34,100
They were not going to touch it.

2324
02:01:34,100 --> 02:01:43,100
Really strange that that became but like as Eisner talks about, that was when you lost the battle of perception, you're sunk.

2325
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:47,100
And he should have got up in a press conference and look Exxon hoped there was oil under here.

2326
02:01:47,100 --> 02:01:48,100
There wasn't.

2327
02:01:48,100 --> 02:01:49,100
So they sold us.

2328
02:01:49,100 --> 02:01:52,100
This land is not the land that you think it is.

2329
02:01:52,100 --> 02:01:53,100
Yes.

2330
02:01:53,100 --> 02:01:54,100
Yeah.

2331
02:01:54,100 --> 02:01:55,100
Should have like he should have.

2332
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:58,100
Eisner should have got out there in the way that Jay should have got out there.

2333
02:01:58,100 --> 02:02:01,100
Jay Leno early on when he was having a few with Letterman.

2334
02:02:01,100 --> 02:02:05,100
Howie Mandel says he should have gotten out there and defended himself against David Letterman.

2335
02:02:05,100 --> 02:02:06,100
That's what how he's very insistent on it.

2336
02:02:06,100 --> 02:02:08,100
That's what Eisner should have done here.

2337
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:15,100
Should have gotten out ahead of it and drawn a big picture, a big map and shown where everything was and defended himself.

2338
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:17,100
Yeah, he did.

2339
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:18,100
Is the issue.

2340
02:02:18,100 --> 02:02:21,100
He said some stuff that got him in hot water.

2341
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:23,100
I would say Jay.

2342
02:02:23,100 --> 02:02:26,100
Jay Leno was right to not defend himself in the early 90s.

2343
02:02:26,100 --> 02:02:29,100
You're saying Jay's point won.

2344
02:02:29,100 --> 02:02:32,100
I don't know why Howie Mandel is backseat driving.

2345
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:33,100
You should have fought Letterman.

2346
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:34,100
Why?

2347
02:02:34,100 --> 02:02:35,100
He won.

2348
02:02:35,100 --> 02:02:37,100
Why are we going over this again?

2349
02:02:37,100 --> 02:02:40,100
And mainly, Mike, why are you watching it?

2350
02:02:40,100 --> 02:02:44,100
I've recently upped to the amount of punishing content I've been watching.

2351
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:45,100
It has been.

2352
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:53,100
If listeners think you've heard too much about Club Random, we get a new alert personally handed to us from Mike every week.

2353
02:02:53,100 --> 02:02:56,100
Oh, John McEnroe's on.

2354
02:02:56,100 --> 02:02:58,100
John McEnroe's on Club Random.

2355
02:02:59,100 --> 02:03:01,100
I don't know what happened.

2356
02:03:01,100 --> 02:03:06,100
Oh, whatever Charlotte Allen thought was going to happen to Virginia.

2357
02:03:06,100 --> 02:03:08,100
It's happening to your brain.

2358
02:03:08,100 --> 02:03:09,100
Something's wrong with my brain.

2359
02:03:09,100 --> 02:03:14,100
I feel like we were just talking about John McEnroe just being a guy that's around.

2360
02:03:14,100 --> 02:03:16,100
Yeah, we talked about in the CalPACUS episode.

2361
02:03:16,100 --> 02:03:17,100
Yeah.

2362
02:03:17,100 --> 02:03:20,100
And then days later, that's why I sent it.

2363
02:03:20,100 --> 02:03:21,100
Yes.

2364
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:22,100
Yeah.

2365
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:23,100
Yeah.

2366
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:26,100
Because recent McEnroe discussion, recent McEnroe.

2367
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:27,100
No.

2368
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:30,100
Okay, so no, Eisner, he went on the defensive big time.

2369
02:03:30,100 --> 02:03:45,100
He, when the notion of these historians who he's going up against comes up, he says to the Washington Post in the same interview where he said the thing Jason brought up of like, oh, they were going to be raising up, everybody's going to be raising us above their shoulders.

2370
02:03:45,100 --> 02:03:46,100
Yeah.

2371
02:03:46,100 --> 02:03:51,100
Then he says, I sat through many history classes where I read some of their stuff and I didn't learn anything.

2372
02:03:51,100 --> 02:03:52,100
It was pretty boring.

2373
02:03:52,100 --> 02:03:55,100
I guess I can say that I object to some of their stuff.

2374
02:03:55,100 --> 02:03:59,100
So Eisner does go, oh, the historians have a problem?

2375
02:03:59,100 --> 02:04:00,100
Snooze, boo.

2376
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:01,100
Yeah.

2377
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:05,100
We make rides where you get to sit on an elephant.

2378
02:04:05,100 --> 02:04:06,100
Okay.

2379
02:04:06,100 --> 02:04:09,100
So you want to come at me and say we're the problem?

2380
02:04:09,100 --> 02:04:14,100
Michael Eisner gives the most Homer Simpson like response to the historians.

2381
02:04:14,100 --> 02:04:15,100
Also, yeah.

2382
02:04:15,100 --> 02:04:16,100
Boo.

2383
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:20,100
I got to ask, Mike, which ones did you read?

2384
02:04:20,100 --> 02:04:21,100
Tell us.

2385
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:27,100
Because when I was in history class, we were all reading the same bullshit whitewashed history textbook that everyone else wants.

2386
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:32,100
You know that he was reading the books of the people he's fighting against.

2387
02:04:32,100 --> 02:04:33,100
That's madness.

2388
02:04:33,100 --> 02:04:38,100
Now there's some revisionist history from Michael, but it all put him on the defensive.

2389
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:43,100
And there was a full page article in one of the big newspapers with a big picture of Eisner.

2390
02:04:43,100 --> 02:04:44,100
I'm sorry.

2391
02:04:44,100 --> 02:04:45,100
A full page ad.

2392
02:04:45,100 --> 02:04:48,100
The picture of Eisner that said the man who would destroy history.

2393
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:54,100
Little did they know if they just waited a little longer, we'd have a few of those.

2394
02:04:54,100 --> 02:04:56,100
It's a different CEO.

2395
02:04:56,100 --> 02:05:00,100
It's a different 90s CEO who would be the man who would destroy history.

2396
02:05:00,100 --> 02:05:01,100
Yeah.

2397
02:05:01,100 --> 02:05:02,100
The man who would destroy history.

2398
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:05,100
Sounds like a great novel like the Jason would read.

2399
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:06,100
Like a great kind of pulpy novel.

2400
02:05:06,100 --> 02:05:08,100
Sounds like the man who sold the world.

2401
02:05:08,100 --> 02:05:09,100
Yeah.

2402
02:05:09,100 --> 02:05:10,100
Sure.

2403
02:05:10,100 --> 02:05:11,100
It's a very cool title.

2404
02:05:11,100 --> 02:05:12,100
It is a cool title.

2405
02:05:12,100 --> 02:05:13,100
If they haven't.

2406
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:16,100
But now they have to go fight with Congress.

2407
02:05:16,100 --> 02:05:23,100
This group is powerful enough to, now Congress has to hear about it and they have to talk to somebody named Senator Dale Bumpers.

2408
02:05:23,100 --> 02:05:26,100
And then, and that's all right.

2409
02:05:26,100 --> 02:05:28,100
We all punish ourselves with it.

2410
02:05:28,100 --> 02:05:32,100
Did I watch the full five hour C-span?

2411
02:05:32,100 --> 02:05:33,100
I did not.

2412
02:05:33,100 --> 02:05:35,100
That seems awful.

2413
02:05:35,100 --> 02:05:36,100
There's some fun quotes.

2414
02:05:36,100 --> 02:05:38,100
I feel like Perjurer did for his video.

2415
02:05:38,100 --> 02:05:39,100
He for sure did.

2416
02:05:39,100 --> 02:05:45,100
He had that odd run about like a guy saying, I don't know if Mickey's going to wear blue or gray.

2417
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:47,100
That was Jason's line in it.

2418
02:05:47,100 --> 02:05:48,100
You read that part?

2419
02:05:48,100 --> 02:05:49,100
Larry, that's Larry Craig.

2420
02:05:49,100 --> 02:05:50,100
Oh, no kidding.

2421
02:05:50,100 --> 02:05:51,100
Okay.

2422
02:05:51,100 --> 02:05:52,100
Okay.

2423
02:05:52,100 --> 02:05:54,100
So this is bad.

2424
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:57,100
This is just awful for PR.

2425
02:05:57,100 --> 02:06:01,100
Frank Rich is yelling at him and David McCullough is yelling.

2426
02:06:01,100 --> 02:06:04,100
It's just not going great.

2427
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:07,100
Over the course of this, one odd thing that happens.

2428
02:06:07,100 --> 02:06:11,100
So one of the things that they're getting hit with is it's going to be sanitized whitewashed history.

2429
02:06:11,100 --> 02:06:21,100
So an Imagineer, Bob Weiss, who is a major figure today and in Imagineering Story, he goes on the defensive and he says, this is not a Pollyanna view of history.

2430
02:06:21,100 --> 02:06:26,100
We want to make you feel what it was like to be a slave or what it was like to escape through the Underground Railroad.

2431
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:27,100
Oh, yeah.

2432
02:06:27,100 --> 02:06:31,100
Everyone pretty quickly started tugging on their shirt collars for that one.

2433
02:06:31,100 --> 02:06:43,100
Everyone was like, and pretty quickly, the slave attraction or museum was caught.

2434
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:47,100
The question is, was there even going to be such a thing?

2435
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:52,100
Had they even gotten so far as to figure out, like, is there literally, you are a slave?

2436
02:06:52,100 --> 02:06:53,100
I mean, I hope not.

2437
02:06:53,100 --> 02:06:54,100
That doesn't sound...

2438
02:06:54,100 --> 02:07:02,100
Again, it's a thing that you could do in a museum and it would be very affecting and moving in a museum, but really weird to do it in a Disney.

2439
02:07:02,100 --> 02:07:07,100
Right, because you're getting charged like a hundred dollars that's going into Disney's pocket and then you're buying a turkey leg.

2440
02:07:07,100 --> 02:07:10,100
Yes, the for-profit nature of it.

2441
02:07:10,100 --> 02:07:20,100
Yeah, if they want to do some really expensive, highly Imagineered thing that gives you a nice history lesson and puts you back in that period.

2442
02:07:20,100 --> 02:07:21,100
All right, sure.

2443
02:07:21,100 --> 02:07:25,100
But you're buying Donald in the Tri-Corner hat on the way out.

2444
02:07:25,100 --> 02:07:27,100
Like all of that stuff surrounding it is what makes...

2445
02:07:27,100 --> 02:07:31,100
Why did they not just do, it's an old timey town?

2446
02:07:31,100 --> 02:07:35,100
Why do they ever think they needed to do any of this or tackle any of...

2447
02:07:35,100 --> 02:07:38,100
Like these are only hornet's nests.

2448
02:07:38,100 --> 02:07:39,100
Well, they got...

2449
02:07:39,100 --> 02:07:40,100
It's what we've been saying.

2450
02:07:40,100 --> 02:07:41,100
The hubris starts.

2451
02:07:41,100 --> 02:07:42,100
It starts there.

2452
02:07:42,100 --> 02:07:49,100
And then as they start running into like the reality of all of this, they try to keep correcting.

2453
02:07:49,100 --> 02:07:52,100
And then you end up with this like, what are we doing here?

2454
02:07:52,100 --> 02:07:53,100
What?

2455
02:07:53,100 --> 02:07:54,100
Oh, a thousand percent.

2456
02:07:54,100 --> 02:07:55,100
Well, to get into that, yes.

2457
02:07:55,100 --> 02:07:58,100
This Bob Weiss quote ruined everything.

2458
02:07:58,100 --> 02:08:01,100
He's obviously still a major Disney figure, so he was not thrown under the bus.

2459
02:08:01,100 --> 02:08:02,100
But he left.

2460
02:08:02,100 --> 02:08:03,100
But Eisner...

2461
02:08:03,100 --> 02:08:04,100
He left after this.

2462
02:08:04,100 --> 02:08:05,100
Oh, really?

2463
02:08:05,100 --> 02:08:06,100
He was one of the main people.

2464
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:07,100
Oh.

2465
02:08:07,100 --> 02:08:10,100
And if you recall, he started his own company.

2466
02:08:10,100 --> 02:08:11,100
Remember?

2467
02:08:11,100 --> 02:08:12,100
No, this guy's in Imagineering Story.

2468
02:08:12,100 --> 02:08:13,100
Bob Weiss.

2469
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:14,100
Did he leave and come back?

2470
02:08:14,100 --> 02:08:16,100
No, no, I'm saying he left.

2471
02:08:16,100 --> 02:08:23,100
And I always heard, I forget where I read that, he left to like, let the heat die down.

2472
02:08:23,100 --> 02:08:28,100
He was senior vice president, so he could easily start his own consulting company.

2473
02:08:28,100 --> 02:08:32,100
And then that one dive video we found was credited to Bob Weiss' productions.

2474
02:08:32,100 --> 02:08:33,100
Was his company?

2475
02:08:33,100 --> 02:08:34,100
Oh, that's interesting.

2476
02:08:34,100 --> 02:08:35,100
Yeah.

2477
02:08:35,100 --> 02:08:40,100
And then eventually does come back and I think helps save some other projects.

2478
02:08:40,100 --> 02:08:41,100
Oh, that's crazy.

2479
02:08:41,100 --> 02:08:42,100
Okay, okay.

2480
02:08:42,100 --> 02:08:47,100
So, they recently kind of retired into a consulting business, you know, when they kind

2481
02:08:47,100 --> 02:08:50,620
of put people out the baster and they're going to be a consultant or they're going to be

2482
02:08:50,620 --> 02:08:51,620
a liaison.

2483
02:08:51,620 --> 02:08:52,620
Oh, sure.

2484
02:08:52,620 --> 02:08:53,620
Yeah, yeah.

2485
02:08:53,620 --> 02:08:54,620
Yeah.

2486
02:08:54,620 --> 02:08:59,220
Well, he got sort of like, railroaded on this and Eisner said, that's a person who does

2487
02:08:59,220 --> 02:09:00,780
not usually talk to the public.

2488
02:09:00,780 --> 02:09:04,060
So, they told us and him.

2489
02:09:04,060 --> 02:09:08,060
So now they have to start going, well, okay, we can't just say stuff like that if we're

2490
02:09:08,060 --> 02:09:09,460
not going to and that doesn't say...

2491
02:09:09,820 --> 02:09:13,300
So, anything that we present to the public now has to be much more manicured and they

2492
02:09:13,300 --> 02:09:17,900
had to really start thinking of these things through the lens of history.

2493
02:09:17,900 --> 02:09:23,300
One big thing, the name, the name itself, Disney's America was trouble for them because

2494
02:09:23,300 --> 02:09:27,620
that implies like ownership or it's our version of America.

2495
02:09:27,620 --> 02:09:31,220
They thought that they were, like people were going to be like, Disney thinks they own America?

2496
02:09:31,220 --> 02:09:32,220
Yeah.

2497
02:09:32,220 --> 02:09:35,060
Like, which is, I guess they do in some ways.

2498
02:09:35,060 --> 02:09:36,060
So...

2499
02:09:36,060 --> 02:09:37,060
Oh, yeah, sure.

2500
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:38,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2501
02:09:38,060 --> 02:09:39,060
So, you don't want to invite that.

2502
02:09:39,660 --> 02:09:45,060
But they have to start backing off of that and we end up with, they, Imagineers keep

2503
02:09:45,060 --> 02:09:50,260
developing and it turns into something else and now it's called Disney's American Celebration.

2504
02:09:50,260 --> 02:09:56,380
Some of the thought behind all this is, okay, we have to look at, like they're looking at

2505
02:09:56,380 --> 02:09:57,700
each attraction one by one.

2506
02:09:57,700 --> 02:10:00,900
They go, okay, can we have the fun?

2507
02:10:00,900 --> 02:10:07,180
But also, like is it insulting to not deal with the issue at the foot here?

2508
02:10:07,300 --> 02:10:09,220
Like the Lewis and Clark ride.

2509
02:10:09,220 --> 02:10:13,060
We can do that, but maybe we should not also be talking about manifest destiny.

2510
02:10:13,060 --> 02:10:14,060
Yeah.

2511
02:10:14,060 --> 02:10:15,060
As part of it.

2512
02:10:15,060 --> 02:10:16,060
No, it doesn't sound right.

2513
02:10:16,060 --> 02:10:21,540
That seems like a little heavy to tackle in a queue for a you will get wet ride.

2514
02:10:21,540 --> 02:10:25,140
Yeah, a ride where you're going to get your pants wet.

2515
02:10:25,140 --> 02:10:26,900
Like you don't need...

2516
02:10:26,900 --> 02:10:30,900
But other ones, they determined, you know what, we cannot figure out this balance.

2517
02:10:30,900 --> 02:10:35,940
This is in Eisner's book, The Industrial Revolution, the roller coaster.

2518
02:10:35,940 --> 02:10:41,860
They decided it would trivialize and even demean the attempt to portray the steel mill

2519
02:10:41,860 --> 02:10:42,860
realistically.

2520
02:10:42,860 --> 02:10:45,500
I mean, this is what are we doing?

2521
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:47,580
Again, what are we doing here, folks?

2522
02:10:47,580 --> 02:10:49,940
I mean, that's what you lose?

2523
02:10:49,940 --> 02:10:55,780
We're a little bit concerned about the portrayal of Native Americans and stuff, but we're actually

2524
02:10:55,780 --> 02:10:58,580
very concerned about the steel mills.

2525
02:10:58,580 --> 02:11:01,020
We don't want to offend the mill.

2526
02:11:01,020 --> 02:11:02,020
The mill itself.

2527
02:11:02,020 --> 02:11:03,020
The building.

2528
02:11:03,100 --> 02:11:08,260
The buildings will be offended, which we care more about, which I guess is really...

2529
02:11:08,260 --> 02:11:10,660
Isn't that just capitalism, baby?

2530
02:11:10,660 --> 02:11:11,820
The production, you know?

2531
02:11:11,820 --> 02:11:16,100
I mean, if they really want to talk about positives coming out of the Industrial Revolution,

2532
02:11:16,100 --> 02:11:19,620
the organized labor movement, the five day work week with the weekend.

2533
02:11:19,620 --> 02:11:22,220
It sounds like kick ass rides.

2534
02:11:22,220 --> 02:11:24,420
It sounds like kick ass rides.

2535
02:11:24,420 --> 02:11:28,780
And also while Disney has benefited from those things, is people will have more leisure time

2536
02:11:28,780 --> 02:11:30,180
and more money.

2537
02:11:30,340 --> 02:11:34,580
They also in house aren't the craziest.

2538
02:11:34,580 --> 02:11:36,380
They're not really wild about unions.

2539
02:11:36,380 --> 02:11:41,020
Fire, you know, here's what I say, unionized manageneering.

2540
02:11:41,020 --> 02:11:44,220
They have that reputation where they hire a bunch of people for projects and then they

2541
02:11:44,220 --> 02:11:45,220
fire them all.

2542
02:11:45,220 --> 02:11:47,580
They've been getting away with that for way too long.

2543
02:11:47,580 --> 02:11:50,900
Oh yeah, the whole history of it for sure.

2544
02:11:50,900 --> 02:11:55,300
So we start changing it into American celebration.

2545
02:11:55,300 --> 02:11:56,300
No more...

2546
02:11:56,300 --> 02:11:59,780
We don't want to offend the mill.

2547
02:11:59,780 --> 02:12:02,220
It all just becomes like...

2548
02:12:02,220 --> 02:12:06,140
And some of this comes from Jim Hill and there's a Collider article that I think Drew Taylor

2549
02:12:06,140 --> 02:12:07,140
wrote.

2550
02:12:07,140 --> 02:12:12,140
There's details about this and we don't have time to go through all of this, but like literally,

2551
02:12:12,140 --> 02:12:14,100
I don't know how they make these calculations.

2552
02:12:14,100 --> 02:12:17,460
It's not the little colonial town you enter anymore.

2553
02:12:17,460 --> 02:12:23,220
Now you enter through an area called democracy and then it has things called America, a user's

2554
02:12:23,220 --> 02:12:28,780
guide, the American free speech forum and the American hall of fame.

2555
02:12:28,980 --> 02:12:29,980
What?

2556
02:12:29,980 --> 02:12:30,980
What's happening?

2557
02:12:30,980 --> 02:12:32,260
Why would you want to do this?

2558
02:12:32,260 --> 02:12:37,100
And then they stop referring to them by the like crazy roaring 20s kind of names and it

2559
02:12:37,100 --> 02:12:42,900
just becomes family, creativity and fun, work.

2560
02:12:42,900 --> 02:12:48,020
All right, so I think we did everything there is to do in service and sacrifice.

2561
02:12:48,020 --> 02:12:52,940
Do you want to go have lunch at work?

2562
02:12:52,940 --> 02:12:57,340
Well can I read the streets of America, the food options?

2563
02:12:57,340 --> 02:13:00,140
This is truly one of the weirdest presentations.

2564
02:13:00,140 --> 02:13:02,500
Chicago, Chicago style pizza.

2565
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:05,460
Los Angeles, Hispanic and fast food.

2566
02:13:05,460 --> 02:13:09,220
New Orleans, Cajun, New York City, Jewish deli food.

2567
02:13:09,220 --> 02:13:11,100
St. Louis, barbecued ribs.

2568
02:13:11,100 --> 02:13:13,700
San Francisco, Chinese.

2569
02:13:13,700 --> 02:13:14,700
What?

2570
02:13:14,700 --> 02:13:18,940
This again, you've tried to, you've broken it down too far.

2571
02:13:18,940 --> 02:13:23,060
This park, I think a big thing about this park, it shows the limits of like everything's

2572
02:13:23,060 --> 02:13:24,060
a story.

2573
02:13:24,060 --> 02:13:25,620
Everything's an adventure.

2574
02:13:26,100 --> 02:13:31,620
Maybe, maybe go back to the drawing board, you know?

2575
02:13:31,620 --> 02:13:34,140
Where can you buy hard tech is what I would say.

2576
02:13:34,140 --> 02:13:35,900
Well obviously at the Civil War.

2577
02:13:35,900 --> 02:13:36,900
Oh, okay.

2578
02:13:36,900 --> 02:13:37,900
At the fort.

2579
02:13:37,900 --> 02:13:42,820
Where you'd sit in the bleachers for the battle of the monitor and the merry man.

2580
02:13:42,820 --> 02:13:44,660
You would just nibble on some hard tech.

2581
02:13:44,660 --> 02:13:48,060
I'm sure they'd get great wholesale prices at heart for hard tech.

2582
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:49,060
Sure.

2583
02:13:49,060 --> 02:13:50,060
Have you ever had hard tech?

2584
02:13:50,060 --> 02:13:53,860
I think I was shown to me at one of the many colonial.

2585
02:13:53,860 --> 02:13:55,820
I didn't say have you looked at hard tech.

2586
02:13:55,820 --> 02:13:59,140
I don't know if I've ever eaten hard tech.

2587
02:13:59,140 --> 02:14:00,140
Well let's get you some hard tech.

2588
02:14:00,140 --> 02:14:02,980
I know Fatback is just really fatty bacon, essentially.

2589
02:14:02,980 --> 02:14:05,660
Okay, we're going to get you some hard tech for Christmas.

2590
02:14:05,660 --> 02:14:06,660
Sure.

2591
02:14:06,660 --> 02:14:07,660
Okay.

2592
02:14:07,660 --> 02:14:09,780
It's like a thick biscuit?

2593
02:14:09,780 --> 02:14:14,460
Yeah, it's like a, it like lasts for a really long time.

2594
02:14:14,460 --> 02:14:15,460
Okay.

2595
02:14:15,460 --> 02:14:16,460
But I'm not going to give it to you right away.

2596
02:14:16,460 --> 02:14:19,500
I'm going to buy it, but I won't give it to you right away because it lasts so long.

2597
02:14:19,500 --> 02:14:20,500
Oh, that's fair.

2598
02:14:20,500 --> 02:14:22,340
I just want to test it.

2599
02:14:22,340 --> 02:14:24,380
So you'll get it for next Christmas.

2600
02:14:24,380 --> 02:14:26,500
Buy it this Christmas and give it next Christmas.

2601
02:14:26,500 --> 02:14:27,500
I can age it.

2602
02:14:27,500 --> 02:14:29,180
Do you want aged hard tech?

2603
02:14:29,180 --> 02:14:30,940
Like a year and a half aged?

2604
02:14:30,940 --> 02:14:32,980
Um, up to you.

2605
02:14:32,980 --> 02:14:33,980
You know?

2606
02:14:33,980 --> 02:14:34,980
I'll think about it.

2607
02:14:34,980 --> 02:14:40,300
One thing this was going to have was just the land, a new version of the land.

2608
02:14:40,300 --> 02:14:45,780
Again, what you were saying about, yeah, now I get to see a fire.

2609
02:14:45,780 --> 02:14:47,900
They just would have had a land.

2610
02:14:47,900 --> 02:14:51,660
This sounds even more boring than the life of America.

2611
02:14:51,980 --> 02:14:56,660
It shows the profound changes that can happen in a single day, a single year and in a thousand

2612
02:14:56,660 --> 02:14:57,660
years.

2613
02:14:57,660 --> 02:14:58,660
What is this?

2614
02:14:58,660 --> 02:15:00,020
Who is coming to that?

2615
02:15:00,020 --> 02:15:02,980
We're cutting the mine car coaster.

2616
02:15:02,980 --> 02:15:03,980
That's done.

2617
02:15:03,980 --> 02:15:08,660
We're putting in the life of America and then in work, there's a tour of factories like

2618
02:15:08,660 --> 02:15:09,660
Crayola crayons.

2619
02:15:09,660 --> 02:15:13,020
Well, like Ben and Jerry's.

2620
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:17,220
I mean, I guess seeing the Crayola crayon factory, I would go to once a week if it was

2621
02:15:17,220 --> 02:15:18,220
near here.

2622
02:15:18,220 --> 02:15:19,220
I guess so.

2623
02:15:19,220 --> 02:15:20,220
Yeah.

2624
02:15:20,300 --> 02:15:21,300
I was obsessed with that.

2625
02:15:21,300 --> 02:15:22,300
Mm hmm.

2626
02:15:22,300 --> 02:15:25,420
Like the Mr. Rogers video where they would show you how the crayons were made.

2627
02:15:25,420 --> 02:15:26,420
Oh, yeah.

2628
02:15:26,420 --> 02:15:27,420
That's not so bad.

2629
02:15:27,420 --> 02:15:28,420
That was in Pennsylvania.

2630
02:15:28,420 --> 02:15:29,420
One of them.

2631
02:15:29,420 --> 02:15:30,420
Oh, did you do it?

2632
02:15:30,420 --> 02:15:33,420
I am not sure if I ever got up there.

2633
02:15:33,420 --> 02:15:34,420
I don't think I did.

2634
02:15:34,420 --> 02:15:36,420
I think my brother did on a school trip.

2635
02:15:36,420 --> 02:15:37,420
You would remember.

2636
02:15:37,420 --> 02:15:39,420
Yeah, I would remember it.

2637
02:15:39,420 --> 02:15:46,580
Then you got Disney's America Live where you could listen to a 1940s era swing band concert

2638
02:15:46,580 --> 02:15:47,580
at the USO Bandstand.

2639
02:15:48,220 --> 02:15:49,220
Yeah, all right.

2640
02:15:49,220 --> 02:15:51,220
Losing some of the hosts, but not all.

2641
02:15:51,220 --> 02:15:53,820
Ben and Jerry's crayons and a big band swing party?

2642
02:15:53,820 --> 02:15:55,820
Jason Sheridan is going to be right there.

2643
02:15:55,820 --> 02:15:56,820
Yeah.

2644
02:15:56,820 --> 02:15:58,820
He would never move to the West Coast.

2645
02:15:58,820 --> 02:15:59,820
Dorsey Brothers.

2646
02:15:59,820 --> 02:16:00,820
He would not be in here.

2647
02:16:00,820 --> 02:16:06,260
I watch the Legends of Baseball play and I watch the Legends of Swing Swing.

2648
02:16:06,260 --> 02:16:11,340
Waving my little pennant that says Dorsey Brothers.

2649
02:16:11,340 --> 02:16:15,500
It's so funny that they were like, this thing evolved into being like way tackier.

2650
02:16:15,980 --> 02:16:17,980
Like tackier sounding to me.

2651
02:16:17,980 --> 02:16:18,980
Yeah, I guess so.

2652
02:16:18,980 --> 02:16:22,980
I think it's a cleaner name, Disney's American Celebration.

2653
02:16:22,980 --> 02:16:23,980
I don't know.

2654
02:16:23,980 --> 02:16:26,980
I think that's kind of a funky corporate.

2655
02:16:26,980 --> 02:16:31,980
Yeah, I get why the people were criticizing the other one, but I don't know.

2656
02:16:31,980 --> 02:16:32,980
I like it better.

2657
02:16:32,980 --> 02:16:37,980
Do you guys want to hear a little bit of thoughts from the man himself?

2658
02:16:37,980 --> 02:16:38,980
Please, of course, yes.

2659
02:16:38,980 --> 02:16:39,980
From Michael Eisner about this.

2660
02:16:39,980 --> 02:16:40,980
Sure.

2661
02:16:41,460 --> 02:16:45,780
I think we have one Terry Gross about this very issue and there's some interesting parts

2662
02:16:45,780 --> 02:16:47,380
of this discussion.

2663
02:16:47,380 --> 02:16:49,180
I love the words Disney's America.

2664
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:52,300
I think it describes exactly what it is.

2665
02:16:52,300 --> 02:16:54,140
It's a park.

2666
02:16:54,140 --> 02:16:58,420
It's a park that teaches history using Disney techniques.

2667
02:16:58,420 --> 02:17:04,900
I think the Museum of Tolerance or the Holocaust Museum more accurately in Washington uses

2668
02:17:04,900 --> 02:17:06,740
a lot of Disney technique.

2669
02:17:06,740 --> 02:17:08,900
A lot of Disney people worked on that.

2670
02:17:08,900 --> 02:17:14,980
All sorts of walkthroughs and use of multimedia effects.

2671
02:17:14,980 --> 02:17:15,980
That's what I thought it meant.

2672
02:17:15,980 --> 02:17:21,540
I didn't think it meant that Annette Funicello was going to be the Queen of America.

2673
02:17:21,540 --> 02:17:26,900
So it was a long walk to get to that.

2674
02:17:26,900 --> 02:17:27,900
Americanette.

2675
02:17:27,900 --> 02:17:28,900
Yeah.

2676
02:17:28,900 --> 02:17:34,300
I mean, again, we're finding ways to appeal to most people in this room.

2677
02:17:34,300 --> 02:17:35,300
Swing music.

2678
02:17:35,300 --> 02:17:36,300
Annette.

2679
02:17:36,860 --> 02:17:37,860
They didn't want to do it.

2680
02:17:37,860 --> 02:17:38,860
They didn't want to do Annette.

2681
02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:48,900
So he again, the issue is those things are not making Disney like massive amounts of

2682
02:17:48,900 --> 02:17:52,580
money and selling tacky plush.

2683
02:17:52,580 --> 02:17:53,580
Uh huh.

2684
02:17:53,580 --> 02:18:00,420
That like, sure, similar people work on museums and work on exhibits and work on things that

2685
02:18:00,420 --> 02:18:03,380
are imagineered in some way.

2686
02:18:04,260 --> 02:18:07,340
We did the Van Gogh thing that was been going around a couple months ago.

2687
02:18:07,340 --> 02:18:08,340
Oh yeah.

2688
02:18:08,340 --> 02:18:09,340
And that's very imagineered.

2689
02:18:09,340 --> 02:18:10,340
There's music.

2690
02:18:10,340 --> 02:18:15,100
There's like, it's presenting his art on the walls and like a movement.

2691
02:18:15,100 --> 02:18:18,260
And honestly, it was in 360 now that I'm thinking about it.

2692
02:18:18,260 --> 02:18:19,260
Oh, oh.

2693
02:18:19,260 --> 02:18:20,260
And I felt it was too much.

2694
02:18:20,260 --> 02:18:22,740
Honestly, I felt it was too much.

2695
02:18:22,740 --> 02:18:23,740
Too many degrees.

2696
02:18:23,740 --> 02:18:24,740
And I'm not doing this for the bit.

2697
02:18:24,740 --> 02:18:28,060
I remember going, it'd be better if it was like 240 or 250.

2698
02:18:28,060 --> 02:18:29,060
Wow.

2699
02:18:29,060 --> 02:18:30,780
But it was still pretty cool to see.

2700
02:18:30,780 --> 02:18:38,980
So his point is correct that similar people who do work can present historical moments

2701
02:18:38,980 --> 02:18:40,300
in a classy way.

2702
02:18:40,300 --> 02:18:43,380
It's just that this was not going to be it.

2703
02:18:43,380 --> 02:18:46,820
When he started getting real defensive, it became like, you know, we're not even going

2704
02:18:46,820 --> 02:18:48,380
to make that much money off of this thing.

2705
02:18:48,380 --> 02:18:49,380
We're doing this for you.

2706
02:18:49,380 --> 02:18:50,380
Yeah, right.

2707
02:18:50,380 --> 02:18:55,900
We've gotten pretty bad at a few things, okay?

2708
02:18:55,900 --> 02:19:00,540
So then, all right, we're already at Disney's American Celebration.

2709
02:19:00,540 --> 02:19:03,700
Now it's a swing band venue.

2710
02:19:03,700 --> 02:19:07,820
And then the news hits that it has to be closed four months out of the year.

2711
02:19:07,820 --> 02:19:12,220
Then he has a massive heart operation and Frank Wells dies.

2712
02:19:12,220 --> 02:19:18,060
And this is kind of documented in this very interview and in the purger video.

2713
02:19:18,060 --> 02:19:19,780
He just didn't have the heart for it.

2714
02:19:19,780 --> 02:19:23,940
He didn't have like the stamina for the fight at this time.

2715
02:19:23,940 --> 02:19:28,580
So they back down, but we're very like, we're going to not do it here, here, but we're going

2716
02:19:28,580 --> 02:19:29,920
to do it somewhere.

2717
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:33,320
So you didn't look, we're doing a historical park.

2718
02:19:33,320 --> 02:19:35,200
No, we are not backing down.

2719
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:37,320
And then, of course, years have gone by and they have not.

2720
02:19:37,320 --> 02:19:38,320
Yeah, yeah.

2721
02:19:38,320 --> 02:19:45,680
I think, I mean, Frank, maybe if he had lived, Frank, he was always like presented in all

2722
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:51,960
this material, like the good cop, essentially, Eisner's crazy cop.

2723
02:19:51,960 --> 02:19:57,120
So I wonder, yeah, like would he have talked Michael completely out of it or would he have

2724
02:19:57,120 --> 02:20:03,880
figured out a way to do it and have smoothed out relations with government and press and

2725
02:20:03,880 --> 02:20:04,880
everything?

2726
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:05,880
Who knows?

2727
02:20:05,880 --> 02:20:10,320
I'm just saying it's interesting to think about.

2728
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:12,440
But yeah, he never, he never got to see it.

2729
02:20:12,440 --> 02:20:15,040
I'd like to think he would have said stop.

2730
02:20:15,040 --> 02:20:16,040
Yeah, I sure.

2731
02:20:16,040 --> 02:20:18,440
Build some rides somewhere.

2732
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:23,480
I feel like it would have been very good too, because, you know, we talked about elements

2733
02:20:23,480 --> 02:20:28,320
of this showed up in the parks, you know, a lot in California Adventure.

2734
02:20:28,320 --> 02:20:32,920
There was the one proposed, like when Knott's Berry Farm was up for sale.

2735
02:20:32,920 --> 02:20:36,640
Yeah, they were like, oh, well, we could do this.

2736
02:20:36,640 --> 02:20:39,680
We could buy and do Disney's America there.

2737
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:44,040
A big reason being they had a recreation of Independence Hall and that seemed to be a

2738
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:45,040
big driver.

2739
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:46,040
And we are.

2740
02:20:46,040 --> 02:20:47,960
Look, they already have an independent.

2741
02:20:47,960 --> 02:20:52,280
We might as well buy it, redo all of it bit by bit.

2742
02:20:52,560 --> 02:20:55,320
Ghost town basically the same.

2743
02:20:55,320 --> 02:20:56,600
We'll keep another air.

2744
02:20:56,600 --> 02:20:58,240
Well, there's they have rapids.

2745
02:20:58,240 --> 02:21:00,040
We can make that the Lewis and Clark thing.

2746
02:21:00,040 --> 02:21:03,200
Mystery Lodge, like there's sort of the Native American.

2747
02:21:03,200 --> 02:21:04,200
Right.

2748
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:05,200
Yes.

2749
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:06,960
So and there's Johnny Rockets there.

2750
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:08,800
And that's an apple pie.

2751
02:21:08,800 --> 02:21:12,360
It's a perfect recreation of the 1950s.

2752
02:21:12,360 --> 02:21:14,960
And the Knott's family said no, basically.

2753
02:21:14,960 --> 02:21:18,120
No, this is I find the story fishy.

2754
02:21:18,120 --> 02:21:19,120
I find it really strange.

2755
02:21:19,120 --> 02:21:20,120
I agree with that.

2756
02:21:20,280 --> 02:21:21,920
No, Disney comes in.

2757
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:22,920
Here's money.

2758
02:21:22,920 --> 02:21:24,840
You know, what year is that?

2759
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:28,680
Do we know? I think they were in dire.

2760
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:32,320
They weren't in dire straits yet where they had when they said they were just

2761
02:21:32,320 --> 02:21:33,640
thinking about selling it.

2762
02:21:33,640 --> 02:21:36,040
They were like, yeah, mulling, mulling it over.

2763
02:21:36,040 --> 02:21:40,160
But they were maybe like they wanted Knott's Berry Farm to be kept.

2764
02:21:40,160 --> 02:21:41,640
We want to sell Knott's Berry Farm.

2765
02:21:41,640 --> 02:21:43,600
We don't want it to turn into some.

2766
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:48,800
Yeah, they wanted it pristine, much like the Manassas battlefield was kept pristine

2767
02:21:48,880 --> 02:21:52,760
by the National Park Service, which OK, so this brings me to this.

2768
02:21:52,920 --> 02:21:57,160
Perhaps my final point is the whole like we need to band together.

2769
02:21:57,160 --> 02:22:01,920
We the homeowners who don't even live in this county need to team up

2770
02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:05,880
with historians who don't seem to understand what Disney is actually going to do.

2771
02:22:06,120 --> 02:22:10,800
We need to protect our precious Manassas, which nothing is going to happen to.

2772
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:13,080
And something is happening five miles away from it.

2773
02:22:13,960 --> 02:22:16,800
I was like, what's going on over there today?

2774
02:22:17,560 --> 02:22:20,840
Two miles away, much closer

2775
02:22:21,360 --> 02:22:24,760
within two miles of the precious Manassas battlefield.

2776
02:22:24,960 --> 02:22:27,360
There is a golden corral and a cracker barrel.

2777
02:22:27,960 --> 02:22:31,280
So hell, yeah, like all that shit suddenly went out the window.

2778
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:33,840
Fountain, baby golden corral.

2779
02:22:35,080 --> 02:22:35,840
Oh, yes.

2780
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:37,400
I've never seen a commercial golden corral.

2781
02:22:37,400 --> 02:22:38,600
There's a big chocolate fountain.

2782
02:22:38,600 --> 02:22:39,680
I have never been.

2783
02:22:39,680 --> 02:22:42,720
I've wanted to go with Jason for many years and we've never found the time.

2784
02:22:42,840 --> 02:22:45,440
Oh, you got it. Haven't rushed back to Buffet's quite yet.

2785
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:47,360
We have not been back to the base.

2786
02:22:47,360 --> 02:22:49,280
Here, food area, big chocolate fountain.

2787
02:22:49,280 --> 02:22:53,320
I think maybe I heard they stopped running the fountain during Covid.

2788
02:22:53,320 --> 02:22:55,160
I hopefully it's back, though.

2789
02:22:55,160 --> 02:22:58,280
The only change they did shut off the valve.

2790
02:22:58,840 --> 02:23:00,880
We don't let you put your face in it anymore.

2791
02:23:00,880 --> 02:23:04,200
For some reason, yeah, they found there was a lot of Covid in the chocolate.

2792
02:23:04,360 --> 02:23:07,680
So they had to turn it off because it couldn't be.

2793
02:23:08,040 --> 02:23:11,920
It's better to have a still chocolate than moving chocolate.

2794
02:23:11,960 --> 02:23:13,520
Oh, yeah. It moves all the particles around.

2795
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:14,920
Exactly. It alive.

2796
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:20,480
There's also, again, closer to the field than Disney's America would have been.

2797
02:23:20,720 --> 02:23:24,200
There is a mall called Bull Run Plaza,

2798
02:23:24,600 --> 02:23:28,400
and that contains an Olive Garden and a trampoline park.

2799
02:23:28,480 --> 02:23:32,440
Oh, awesome. So and by the way, I'm not against any of these things.

2800
02:23:32,480 --> 02:23:34,240
I like all of this bullshit.

2801
02:23:34,240 --> 02:23:37,760
But like what how come those are all fine?

2802
02:23:38,320 --> 02:23:40,760
Much closer than this would have been.

2803
02:23:40,760 --> 02:23:43,320
There's a smaller footprint, I suppose.

2804
02:23:43,400 --> 02:23:45,160
They're just a closer footprint.

2805
02:23:45,160 --> 02:23:48,760
And also, if they're so like it's the synthetic history

2806
02:23:48,960 --> 02:23:53,000
and we are not preserving, oh, well, now Bull Run Plaza with the marshals

2807
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:57,480
and the TJ, that seems like it'll be a very nice tribute to those who died that day.

2808
02:23:59,120 --> 02:24:01,080
The park would have been bigger.

2809
02:24:01,080 --> 02:24:02,280
That's what I think.

2810
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:03,680
They would have been bigger.

2811
02:24:03,680 --> 02:24:08,360
I mean, they had all sorts of blue sky and RV park homes.

2812
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:11,840
Oh, yes. I guess you could argue they thought perhaps, yes,

2813
02:24:11,840 --> 02:24:15,960
this would become like Disney World and they would slowly take over DC.

2814
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:18,920
Oh, yeah. Yeah, possibly.

2815
02:24:18,920 --> 02:24:21,360
If you if it's like an infection, you know, if you let it,

2816
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:25,440
if you let it fester here for a little bit, they'll take over.

2817
02:24:25,800 --> 02:24:26,880
Don't worry.

2818
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:30,280
The bacterial infection didn't take, but the viral one did.

2819
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:35,920
And then where would we be at if Disney had fully imagineered all of Washington, DC?

2820
02:24:36,840 --> 02:24:40,280
Would it have been better than all those statues would be talking?

2821
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:42,000
We know that. Well, we'd like that.

2822
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:43,560
Lincoln would say hide.

2823
02:24:43,560 --> 02:24:45,560
That's true. Seems like more fun to me.

2824
02:24:45,560 --> 02:24:47,720
It does seem like more fun.

2825
02:24:47,720 --> 02:24:50,200
The fence outside the White House would have little Mickey

2826
02:24:50,200 --> 02:24:54,360
faces on it so you don't jump it because you get impaled on one of them.

2827
02:24:54,360 --> 02:24:57,160
As it will if Iger runs.

2828
02:24:57,160 --> 02:24:58,640
That's yes. That's a good point.

2829
02:24:58,640 --> 02:25:00,200
We're not out of those woods.

2830
02:25:00,200 --> 02:25:01,840
I hope he has those on his mansion.

2831
02:25:01,840 --> 02:25:02,840
Mansions.

2832
02:25:04,480 --> 02:25:05,800
I interested.

2833
02:25:05,800 --> 02:25:06,880
Is this there today?

2834
02:25:06,880 --> 02:25:09,120
If they built it, then is it there today?

2835
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:10,800
Is it radically changed?

2836
02:25:10,800 --> 02:25:14,360
Because I think Drew Taylor pointed out everything, everything that made it

2837
02:25:14,360 --> 02:25:18,760
into a park later, the farm and the the old timey

2838
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:21,960
theme park that like that all has changed.

2839
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:23,600
That we've like gotten rid of all that.

2840
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:25,680
Yeah. California Adventure.

2841
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:30,560
So it was a park that was only the stuff that was like, oh, we got to change this fast.

2842
02:25:30,840 --> 02:25:34,680
Yeah, it's a very good question because it's still I mean,

2843
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:39,720
river country, I guess, is the closest thing to a closed Disney park.

2844
02:25:40,920 --> 02:25:42,240
Right. Am I thinking of any?

2845
02:25:42,240 --> 02:25:43,880
Is there anything else? That's right.

2846
02:25:43,880 --> 02:25:48,000
That's like the closest thing to any like Disney ever admitting defeat, essentially.

2847
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:52,080
Yeah. And that is an obviously that crazy of a situation

2848
02:25:52,080 --> 02:25:55,200
because it's a couple like slides and it's not that big and whatever.

2849
02:25:55,280 --> 02:25:58,720
But they did let it rot, which there was, of course, video footage of which

2850
02:25:59,080 --> 02:26:01,000
they did not like getting out there.

2851
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:02,840
But they didn't protect it that much.

2852
02:26:02,840 --> 02:26:04,160
So obviously they didn't care so much.

2853
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:07,880
But it is an interesting question because I don't think

2854
02:26:08,760 --> 02:26:10,760
no Disney does not want to lose.

2855
02:26:10,760 --> 02:26:12,280
They do not want to close a park.

2856
02:26:12,280 --> 02:26:17,040
They don't want to have to level rides and like, yeah, that's the end game, isn't it?

2857
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:22,440
Yeah. And it's the optics of we're going to bulldoze the park called America.

2858
02:26:22,600 --> 02:26:25,960
It's like, yeah, I think they would have they would have been pouring money

2859
02:26:25,960 --> 02:26:28,240
into the sinkhole still to this day.

2860
02:26:28,760 --> 02:26:30,760
And like maybe it would have.

2861
02:26:30,760 --> 02:26:32,960
I don't know. I'm just imagining like, yeah, maybe they

2862
02:26:33,160 --> 02:26:36,400
maybe in some weird way, they end up like selling it to the government

2863
02:26:36,400 --> 02:26:41,200
and then it kind of becomes nonprofits and they stop running expensive stuff.

2864
02:26:41,560 --> 02:26:44,120
And then it's just like, oh, you kind of tour some of this.

2865
02:26:44,120 --> 02:26:47,560
The like buildings they've like put up there,

2866
02:26:47,560 --> 02:26:51,640
but maybe the budget's been way pulled back and they started building houses

2867
02:26:51,640 --> 02:26:53,600
on some of it. Sure. Yeah.

2868
02:26:53,600 --> 02:26:54,640
Like blank land.

2869
02:26:54,640 --> 02:26:59,200
They redo one of the rides to born on the Fourth of July mission.

2870
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:01,520
Access VA benefits.

2871
02:27:01,520 --> 02:27:04,920
Sure. They do. Yeah, they updated in that way, of course.

2872
02:27:05,240 --> 02:27:09,960
So, yeah, I feel like there's some there's some weird middle of the road solution

2873
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:14,440
that to where like technically it's still alive.

2874
02:27:14,440 --> 02:27:17,840
Exactly. That we did not close the park and we've never closed.

2875
02:27:17,840 --> 02:27:19,160
Never park. Never.

2876
02:27:19,160 --> 02:27:21,360
We technically still own some of this.

2877
02:27:22,320 --> 02:27:26,080
But it's it's just like we're just saving.

2878
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:27,480
It's just saving face.

2879
02:27:27,480 --> 02:27:29,680
We're just saving face. The buildings are operating.

2880
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:31,560
You can still buy a hot dog there.

2881
02:27:31,560 --> 02:27:34,920
You can you can the baseball stadium there.

2882
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:37,160
Real games are now played there.

2883
02:27:37,160 --> 02:27:40,080
You. Yeah, sure. It just is a genuine state.

2884
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:41,600
Yeah. It's just a stadium now. Yeah.

2885
02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:45,520
Or it's just like a little like where we won't we don't have anyone doing it,

2886
02:27:45,720 --> 02:27:50,400
but we won't stop you from putting on an old scratchy uniform around the bases.

2887
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:52,680
Well, that's great. You want to put on the show.

2888
02:27:53,360 --> 02:27:55,920
Disney dream weddings is like you go to the base,

2889
02:27:55,960 --> 02:27:58,760
you put on old timey baseball outfits and get married to home plate.

2890
02:28:00,680 --> 02:28:03,600
Why not? It's all a baseball.

2891
02:28:03,800 --> 02:28:05,680
Now it's all right. So umpire marries you.

2892
02:28:05,680 --> 02:28:08,960
Today, Disney's America would be mainly a baseball wedding.

2893
02:28:08,960 --> 02:28:11,960
Baseball chapel. Yeah. Baseball stadium chapel.

2894
02:28:12,400 --> 02:28:15,040
And the umpire what marries you? He's ordained.

2895
02:28:15,600 --> 02:28:17,880
Not pronounce you safe, but it's a.

2896
02:28:17,880 --> 02:28:21,200
They just rebuild. They build a new Casey's quarter.

2897
02:28:21,240 --> 02:28:23,960
Yeah. Yeah. The wedding. Casey's chapel.

2898
02:28:23,960 --> 02:28:27,240
Yeah. Casey's chapel. The wedding reception is hot dogs.

2899
02:28:27,400 --> 02:28:31,240
Casey at the what's the thing? Alter. Alter. Thank you.

2900
02:28:31,840 --> 02:28:36,640
Am I the asshole for having Casey and Mickey and Minnie at my wedding?

2901
02:28:36,640 --> 02:28:40,000
But not paying for the hot dog buffet.

2902
02:28:44,120 --> 02:28:45,400
Well, it might've been worth it.

2903
02:28:45,400 --> 02:28:50,120
It might've been worth it to build the most expensive baseball altar of all time.

2904
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,400
What an insane history though.

2905
02:28:53,400 --> 02:28:58,360
And thanks for going over it with us on this joyous 4th of July week.

2906
02:28:58,360 --> 02:29:01,880
At You Survive podcast, the first like marathon one in a minute,

2907
02:29:01,880 --> 02:29:07,440
but there's so much to go over and I hope it was,

2908
02:29:07,680 --> 02:29:11,200
I hope this was an educational, but fun.

2909
02:29:11,480 --> 02:29:15,440
Yes. A blend. I hope that it was, was both.

2910
02:29:16,120 --> 02:29:19,680
Historians aren't offended, but that it was, it was almost as fun as,

2911
02:29:19,800 --> 02:29:23,080
almost getting burnt by a vat of. Right. It was a me.

2912
02:29:23,480 --> 02:29:28,040
If it was a meal, it was not a full Leno hot dog hamburger meal.

2913
02:29:28,040 --> 02:29:30,840
There was some of that, but also a little vegetable in there.

2914
02:29:31,400 --> 02:29:32,440
So it was a good balance.

2915
02:29:32,440 --> 02:29:34,320
A little bit of what Mavis has to do,

2916
02:29:34,320 --> 02:29:37,320
which is putting a little bit of broccoli into Jay's hot dogs.

2917
02:29:37,480 --> 02:29:41,360
Or when Jay is sleeping, she drops a little broccoli in his mouth,

2918
02:29:42,600 --> 02:29:45,720
tiny pieces into Jay's mouth while he's sleeping.

2919
02:29:45,720 --> 02:29:46,560
Yeah.

2920
02:29:53,320 --> 02:29:54,160
Have you heard this?

2921
02:29:57,320 --> 02:29:58,160
Jay, you're having a nightmare.

2922
02:30:00,760 --> 02:30:05,440
You have heard about this. You have now Jay wake up. They haven't heard about it.

2923
02:30:07,600 --> 02:30:10,080
Wait, wait, wait. I didn't say that. Thanks. You can find us on the social.

02:30:28,760 --> 02:30:32,080
but we wanted to give you that we had to hit you with some Patriot,
