1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:28,300
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the second gate, the show where, you know, this is a crazy weekend

3
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,820
time and place to be doing this intro. I mean, the three of us were all just accused on national

4
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,700
radio of being members of the Communist Party. It's been a week, but we're going to try,

5
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,460
you know, we're going to try to get through it because we're professionals. We have vision

6
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,780
and clarity about what we're doing in the entertainment industry. Damn it. I'm Scott

7
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,260
Gardner, joined by Mike Carlson.

8
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,020
Yeah, I'm here and it's my dad believed in work of rights. Okay. So just, I guess tell

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,700
them I marked the box. I tell them it was an accident. I forget exactly what happened.

10
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:04,080
There's not a one of us that wouldn't have passed 2021, like moral judgment tests in

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:11,740
1953. We're all on the up and up by any, any internet spectrum. That goes for Jason Sheridan

12
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,740
too.

13
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:21,460
Yeah. I mean, you know, I think we're going to be okay when the head of the FBI and or

14
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,700
company saves us because we're making too much money for the latter.

15
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,900
Yeah, I guess that is what it boils down to. Yes.

16
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,380
If okay, say, let's just say, okay, we're first of all, we real quick, we're talking

17
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,380
about the Lucy movie that Aaron Sorkin made, but okay, that's neither here nor there. This

18
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:45,060
is all references to that. But if we were in the fifties, we would be on radio. And

19
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,580
I just like, what would be the podcast to ride like radio show in 1950? Like there was

20
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:56,020
no talk radio really back then. So I guess we would be doing like high jink humor about

21
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,940
like Ferris wheels and stuff. What'd you think?

22
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:05,260
Like a little radio plays. Right. Having like sock boy, I guess that would have worked.

23
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,500
Yeah. Like set at a carnival. Are we carnies?

24
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,340
Well, I think we may be different characters every week. I'm just saying, we probably have

25
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,260
to be narrative. We probably wouldn't be able to talk about like Coney Island's newest attraction

26
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,260
or whatever.

27
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:26,020
So we're, so we're kind of a bumbling carnival workers. Yeah, probably narrative podcast

28
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,020
with kind of with a live orchestra.

29
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,580
Yep. The three doofuses.

30
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,540
Three doofuses. Yeah, they work at a carnival. They're like the three stooges, but not as

31
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,540
good. That's where we would have been a poor man's rip off of the three.

32
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,060
Yeah, but they're confined to working in a carnival. I assume there were many three

33
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,700
stooges shorts where they had were at a carnival. I'm not the biggest stooge had I know some

34
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,660
comedy fans are. But I assume they they fucked up something in a carnival once.

35
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,700
Yeah. And maybe, you know, the head of a network was like, we noticed you guys kind of move

36
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:07,540
your faces a little when you're talking about the midway and we got a TV station we're

37
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,540
starting up. We're looking for people who can move their faces a little.

38
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,820
And you and especially with Jason, they would be like, you are the perfect man to advertise

39
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:22,100
our cigarettes. And we would really like it if you were the face of sort of our new

40
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:27,300
initiative to get people smoking more. Yeah. So I don't know. I'm just imagining it.

41
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,420
I'm just thinking about it. I think we get our theme park info out via the little the little scene.

42
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:38,420
OK, that's good. Now, fellas, we got to take care of this here. Mr. Ferris's wheel.

43
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:46,020
This was only invented 35 years ago. And there's only three in these contiguous United States.

44
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:52,180
I want a stuffed stuffed bear for my gal. I think it's cute. What do you two think?

45
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:58,580
Is the stuffed bear cute? Very cute is what I would say. Very cute. Yeah.

46
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,900
It makes me want to throw my guts up into a brine jar.

47
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,540
Cute at all. As long as that bear is stuffed with asbestos, fully approved by the American

48
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:16,900
Asbestos Council. Our sponsor, our sponsor, American Asbestos Academy, apparently is what

49
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:22,260
they're called. A lot of the terminology would be fine. You know, I fell on my seat again.

50
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:28,180
Yeah, we already again, the way that we pass all of the litmus tests of any era, we would

51
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:34,740
get a lot of many of our episodes could be just aired on the radio in 1951. Exactly. Except for

52
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:41,780
the J Bigga one. Yeah. Yeah. Everything else. Until 2022. Yeah. Perfectly moral and on the

53
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:48,900
up and up. Yeah, this is an episode about being the Ricardo's the film that is on Amazon Prime,

54
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:56,420
if you wish to follow along with us. And which will start, you know, we can issue like the soft

55
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,660
spoiler warning, because this will be from the perspective of people who've seen the movie. But

56
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:08,100
also this is, you know, I mean, like, Lucy and Desi don't die in a train crash or something. Like

57
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:14,180
there's only so much how how spoilery do you have to be when it's sort of based on real events?

58
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,980
Yeah, sort of. I looked up one or two anecdotes that I was like, Am I remembering this right

59
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:26,580
about I love Lucy? And I got so many results of like actual publications and zerg net kind of like

60
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:33,460
listicle publications all saying the same like, and Ricky gave him three strikes. And if he hits

61
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,260
all these drugs, all Wikipedia information I said on our I love Lucy episode, and I feel like

62
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,580
Sorkin just looked through it and was like, Oh, yeah, yeah, he told William Frawley, he can't be

63
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,620
drunk on set. And he like, yeah, so it's like all that that's all sprinkled throughout. Yeah, that's

64
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,980
a just if you if you haven't seen this movie and don't intend on seeing this movie. I mean, that's

65
00:05:53,540 --> 00:06:00,820
one big thing that struck me about it is that it's, you know, dramatic scenes lit dramatically,

66
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:06,980
but where it'll suddenly go into like, do you know what Desi has done for this show? Do you know that

67
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:13,140
he invented the multi camera system that allows us to shoot and not interrupt the viewing experience

68
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:19,460
for the studio audience? That's how much he cares. It really is just like, how can we leisurely drop

69
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:25,780
these little let's just like the three doofuses we want to get our info in there. Yeah, also like

70
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,700
all the hits from I love Lucy, like toss offline about vitamin A, Vegemin.

71
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:40,580
We're Lucy, the same week she was investigated by the House on American Activities Committee was

72
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,780
like, by the way, everyone, while we've got your ears, I'm having a baby. And Ricky's here to tell

73
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:52,260
you we're going to play it into that we're going to work it in the show. Yeah, of course, the same

74
00:06:52,260 --> 00:07:00,100
week, it must have been the same week. And of course, stomping the grapes. You see Lucy, Lucy

75
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,700
does like the Seize the Matrix, Seize the Matrix Code, takes the Limitless Pill when she thinks

76
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:14,820
of a good idea for a bit. Yes, that's that's true. He's he's condensed like all the greatest hits

77
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,940
of Lucy in front of the camera and behind the camera into one movie one week, essentially.

78
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:30,100
It's not the like whole life story type by a pick. It's more like his Steve Jobs movie. Right. Like

79
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:37,700
yeah, condense a bunch of stuff into one, you know, hot, hot, hot boiled. We have like, I don't know

80
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:43,860
what term I'm trying to use. Hot, hot, hot boiled week is a boiler pressure. Right. What's the term?

81
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,620
Have you ever hot boiled anything? I guess that means boiling. Yeah, it has to be hot. So yeah,

82
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:57,700
yeah. What hot dogs say? I'm no wordsmith. Pressure cooker pressure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like when

83
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,100
you're getting hot boiled in a pressure getting hot boiled in a pressure cooker like the cast of

84
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:09,780
Isla Lucy and the writers. Yeah, this kid, you know, boy, this was a week. Yep. I'd say I remember

85
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:16,340
that week. No problem. Yeah, I read so much of that. Then there was there was here's this let's

86
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:22,340
issue the hard spoiler alert. There was no week. This didn't there's not this week. Yeah, no

87
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:30,180
happened. And I don't know why. I don't have a problem with this formula being used for place.

88
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:37,140
It's something about being like there. Like it's like there. It's it's you're there. You're present.

89
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:47,220
We've got real this is happening in real time. But in movies like yeah, I the week, the condensed

90
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:56,180
week in this movie, this very eventful week is is it's definitely a choice. And there it makes a

91
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,260
lot of choice. It probably makes too many choices. I guess that's what I'll say about the movie. Like

92
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,860
I let out the biggest groan when I heard like the synopsis was like the House on American Activities

93
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:12,100
Committee like that's not even that in it that much. No, it's not the bigger groan worthy thing

94
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:20,020
is the documentary interview framing device about the importance of television.

95
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:25,380
On top of it, there's so many hats on hats on hat. There's so much going on in this week. Yeah,

96
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:31,140
don't forget. It's all a documentary, but not all of it. Some of it, the beginning and the end are

97
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:36,260
a documentary. It's a documentary, but they're not. It's not real documentary. It's not a real

98
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:42,660
documentary. And the the the people in the documentary scenes seem so much more scripted

99
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,940
than the people in the other scenes that aren't supposed to be like it is. It's the stiffest.

100
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:55,860
Just yes. And I understand is what you have to understand is I'm assuming they're being

101
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:01,700
interviewed for one of the dozens of TV is important documentaries that CNN pumps out.

102
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,620
But it doesn't because you look at the people in there and this is what I really quick in case

103
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,380
anyone's listening to this and has no clue what the hell and why we're doing this. It's because

104
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:18,660
we did an episode about Lucy attribute. That was a long one. It was a controversial episode because

105
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:24,180
I got some facts wrong and I was taken to task by that last year on a patron episode called gripes.

106
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,140
And this is just a natural extension of all that because we love Lucy and we wanted to see

107
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,980
what they were doing as far as keeping the Lucy legacy alive. That's right. Yeah. Well,

108
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:38,660
and being that it's sort of a late shifty movie, you know, way a little bit like less recent events,

109
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:44,340
but you know, extremely dramatic tellings of comedy tales. I think it's something that appeals to us

110
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:49,940
and I love Lucy's been in the air. And frankly, when we heard that there was a two hour product

111
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,980
that was full of I love Lucy misinformation, we were like, Hey, that's our territory.

112
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:08,740
Yeah, I, man, the Sorkin, I think about half hour in, I was just like, God damn, this dude cannot

113
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:16,100
help himself. There's so many Sorkin that for one thing, I'll say the biggest thing. And I'm going

114
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,460
to give the maybe the first compliment of this movie so far. I like a lot of the actors in this

115
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:27,620
movie and I do like a number of the performances. Yeah. Yes. I agree with that. Yeah. I think that's

116
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:33,540
maybe something you could say about many Aaron Sorkin products that it's all elevated by that.

117
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,020
It's always great perform. Maybe not always, but usually very good performers. Yeah. It kind of

118
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:43,700
helps you see, I think it, it makes the, it like they're, they're all watchable probably for that

119
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:50,100
reason. Um, again, maybe not all watchable. I've never tried the newsroom. I feel like I probably

120
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:56,260
should. I feel like I might love the newsroom and I, and I, and love is in imagine a number of quotes

121
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:03,380
around love. Yes. Yeah. I mean, I, my dad and I, we would every week we'd watch the West Wing when

122
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:08,740
I was like in high school. I think the West Wing is probably the thing people look, look on most

123
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,940
fondly. It's unnerving when actual politicians reference the rest swing. And it's like, folks,

124
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:19,860
this is, this is Superman and Batman politics. This is make believe this is, this ain't real.

125
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,860
When this guy was writing the show, he was out of his mind on any number of drugs.

126
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,180
This and sports night sports night, a lot of great performers in that too. Sports night aimed a little

127
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,980
lower. I think it made it. Yeah. Like, yeah, cause I kind of like sports night too. And it was just

128
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:42,420
trying to be like a fun watchable. It was not like we're going to save democracy or going to

129
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:49,140
save the planet. Yeah. And we're going to make, make sure everyone knows the power of entertainment.

130
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,500
Right. Yes. But how much it can change minds and hearts. I think the importance of television,

131
00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:00,020
probably the, maybe one of the least offensive surkinisms in this, the most glaring one is,

132
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:09,060
the men are all heroes and the women are heels. They make Desi, Javier Bardem is very good actor,

133
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:14,980
I think. And he's very charming as Desi, but very early on, I feel like they say Desi Arnaz is the

134
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:22,340
most charming man in Hollywood. And then on top of that, Mr. William Frawley, Fred Mertz himself

135
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:34,660
is the voice of reason. And Lucy and Ethel are very anxious and neurotic and complaining a lot

136
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:42,900
of the movie. I, that's a valid take. I will say that I saw another thing in it, which is kind of a,

137
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:50,500
I felt like I was being scolded by a big invisible finger throughout the movie as if like

138
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:58,580
and the scold, the, the, the, the message of the scold is now Lucy was the architect

139
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,740
of all of these sequences. Do you understand? Do you get that? And they would write these things,

140
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,300
but she was the one who made them better. And she would question the logic and she'd be right. And

141
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:12,340
she would redo the staging and she was a master of her art. Do you understand that? And the finger

142
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:18,660
is wagging so hard at me. And I'm like, no, I get it. I know I never look, I swear you can look at

143
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,940
you could read a transcript of everything I've ever said in my life. I've never said that Lucy

144
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:27,300
LePaul isn't a genius. Why are you so mad at me? It's all of you. You don't, you don't get it.

145
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,780
You don't give her the credit. And look, here's the writers. The female writer was the good writer

146
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:38,660
and her partner, the other male writer, he was a dope dweeb. He's the dope from white lotus.

147
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,580
You should see him and think dope. And you'd be right. Cause this writer,

148
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:52,740
I don't know. Am I crazy to feel, I felt like I was like the, this, this was being like, I was

149
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,900
being argued at and I'd never said anything to the argument.

150
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,460
Well, they definitely go back to that, that like plot point. She's like trying to perfect things.

151
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,540
And I definitely, it's like, it's definitely to prove, like to show you all Lucy was in

152
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:13,060
control here, but it's also like, I think to set up the last thing when she doesn't even go with

153
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,860
her idea at the end. Oh, sure. You know what I mean? So I, I, I agree with what you're saying

154
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,100
cause I definitely felt like we're doing this scene again. We're like, I go, yeah, we know

155
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,980
she was good at really good at what she was doing. Let's run it again. It's four in the

156
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:32,980
morning, but we're running it again. Damn it. Yeah. So I think both of you, your points are right.

157
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:39,300
Yeah. I mean, we were all being yelled at by this movie from various, from all perspectives.

158
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:44,420
Directions. Yeah. I mean, that's a big sorkinism though, that the hyper competent people,

159
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,700
best people are big pains in the asses and they-

160
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,460
Like, I wonder why.

161
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,020
The person writing the characters.

162
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,580
I wonder.

163
00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:00,580
And I think that, and that is he, he's, he wrote so many men that way. I think that's his idea of

164
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:06,820
like, aha, and now a woman is hyper competent and look, look at this.

165
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:13,700
Yeah. I wonder what it is. Cause it's like, Lucy doesn't get it. I look, I wasn't there as much as

166
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:21,540
I wish I was on set with the whole cast. I wasn't there. So I don't know if Desi was just a fun,

167
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:29,140
loving philanderer and Lucy was just a giant nag the whole time. I assume not. I assume that like

168
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:34,020
anybody, they have their, everybody has their moments, but it does feel like, and I don't know

169
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:39,060
if it's, it's a combination of direction script and even performance, I guess, where, yeah, like

170
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:47,300
you only get like a fun vibe from Desi and kind of even Frawley, but not that much.

171
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:55,060
He's not, he's, he's like kind of a grumpy guy, but yeah, he is like the wise old Frawley that you go

172
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,620
to, which I'm like, is that, was it, was that right? Was that, I'm sure he had some insight

173
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:05,380
being an old showbiz veteran, but yeah, Desi is the only one who gets to seem seemingly have any

174
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:12,660
fun smiles during the making of this comedy show. Well, if you could, now we've, we've alluded to

175
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:18,980
this on the show before, but like, can the listener imagine, would you be shocked to learn that I am a

176
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:27,140
big studio 60 fan, love studio 60. So, and I don't know how you guys feel about it. If you've had the

177
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:33,380
pleasure, but I just, I think I enjoyed this movie on that level, like, oh, we're back here. Oh yeah.

178
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:39,300
We're back to the making of comedy, which is a miserable slog. It is worse than almost any job

179
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:45,460
on the planet you could do. Everyone is, everyone's giving each other the cold shoulder and glaring

180
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:50,260
and it's little like back and forth repartee and little like every conversation is a little

181
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:57,940
chess match until you get knocked off the board. So, so much misery. It sucks. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

182
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:05,140
My, my studio 60 story is that that was the, when it premiered, I was here in LA for college. I was

183
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:12,980
doing the semester in LA and are, I had like a Monday night class and I think it was entertainment

184
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:20,580
law and everyone in the communication school knew like, Oh, take that required class in LA.

185
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:26,340
Cause it's really easy in LA. And this was cartoonishly like he would let us out halfway

186
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:32,820
through the clay. He's like, all right, let's call it there. And especially the, the week studio 60

187
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:39,300
was premiering. He's like, I know we all want to go watch studio 60. And so we're all thinking about

188
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:48,980
it. Everyone in this room. I think I, I watched the first few weeks as it aired before I tapped

189
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:55,860
out. If you'll recall what was going on at the time, everyone's like, Oh, I feel so bad for Tina

190
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:03,140
Faye, her behind the scenes comedy sketch comedy is mid season and studio 60 is going to beat them

191
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:09,140
to the punch. And it's the West Wing guy. I mean, it's going to be a slam dunk. Yeah. No way. The

192
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:17,220
little scrappy comedy one wins the big dog, which is insane too. It was also because everyone was

193
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:22,900
trying to intern on that show. Cause we were down the street from the set. They built this massive

194
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:30,340
set for studio 60 at Warner brothers. Okay. And they did not take any interns. Uh, uh, they, yeah.

195
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:36,740
So you could have, Oh my God. So you could have walked the spiral staircase. You could have seen

196
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:44,020
the NFL style giant board that just counts down to when the show comes out here. He's office. Oh,

197
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:48,420
to be in, Oh, to see all the cards to wow. Crazy Christians. It's really up there.

198
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:55,060
The Holly hunter talk show. I am, I had never worked for, I was in college when I watched this.

199
00:19:55,060 --> 00:20:00,820
I had never worked in any capacity in show business at all, but one episode in you went, Oh, this is

200
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:08,420
awful. Like I know this is wrong. How does he not know this is wrong? Has he never been,

201
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:14,980
I know this is wrong. Like I know how to, his show was like that. Maybe I guess, yeah, this was the

202
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:21,940
way, or at least it's what the West wing was in his head. Yeah. Which is, which would add up because

203
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:27,860
like, uh, Matt and Danny, the creators of this fake SNL, if you don't know what we're talking about on

204
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:34,980
this, on this dramatic show about a comedy show, they are, they are kind of like guru gods who

205
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,620
people just like try to bask in their presence for a minute and follow them down the hallway,

206
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:45,300
but then get called off to some regular person crap. But Matt and Danny, they're just spitting

207
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,180
wisdom. And, uh, and that's, I think that it probably is a window into like, this is what

208
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:55,060
he thought was happening while he was making the last one. Yeah, I'm, yeah, I'm, but Matt is half

209
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:59,940
of me and Danny is the other half. And this is what the head of the show would be like.

210
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:05,700
I'm going to make it more realistic by saying that it was two people. Yeah. People won't buy

211
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:11,220
that it was one. Of course it was one. There was only one. I did it all. Cause the one is written

212
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,860
out in the pilot. Cause he goes full network. Judd Hirsch goes full network. Oh yes, there was,

213
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:22,740
there was a Lorne initially to studio 60. Yes. And he, uh, he breaks under the pressure. Yeah.

214
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,900
He gives a speech cause I'll watch that speech every once in a while. And he says like,

215
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:32,020
there's a show on television where people compete to see who can be the most like Donald Trump.

216
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:39,460
You know, starting goes back and thinks about it. Yeah. Yeah. I called it. I called it. Also, uh,

217
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:45,380
probably seemingly didn't talk to his own cast. Cause if you'll recall some of the players,

218
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:53,140
Hughley coming off a very successful sitcom, the Seahawks, uh, uh, Nate Cordray coming off

219
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:58,980
of the daily show. Like these are different types of comedy that like, I'm sure they all, they have

220
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,620
stories, uh, Sarah Paulson. Oh, you thought like he was going to ask anyone like, Hey, was it like

221
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:09,540
the writer's room? What was going on? You know, like I think he's ever asked an actor. No,

222
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:14,820
I know. Well, someone's experience and perspective. Uh, no, well,

223
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:23,140
kind of, well, cause Sarah Paulson is who plays, uh, one of the leads, right? One of the stars.

224
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:31,460
Yeah. I believe it's based on Christian Shanaway. Yeah. Who's working. Dated. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah.

225
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:38,020
So the fully rounded view he has of an actress who he dated, who doesn't get to be around and say her

226
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:44,100
thoughts on the matter. Yeah. Um, that's also like, it's something we just thinking about the

227
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:49,220
Sorkin body work and it counts this too. He really captures the way that comedy is miserable to make

228
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:56,660
and flirting and relationships are mean and bitter and horrible. Like, you know, the way they

229
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:01,780
lay it back and forth between like a hundred percent lust and a hundred percent pure hatred.

230
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:06,180
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. The way all of us, we all have significant others, listeners who have

231
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:12,500
significant as you all, it all began for all of us and all of you, I'm sure. But with like the most,

232
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:17,780
the most vicious verbal sparring that has ever happened to you in your life. And then all of a

233
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:22,020
sudden, like, are you as hot as I am right now? Yeah. And then you, and then you started, uh,

234
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:29,300
furiously kissing at work. Yeah. It's always how relationships begin. Like, they don't ever really

235
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:36,740
get friendlier. You stay mean the whole time. Also this, these are, uh, by the way, uh, perks

236
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:42,500
for when he writes tech weirdos because, uh, especially social network, which I think is a

237
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:51,540
great movie. Uh, and then the jobs one, I think it's a very particular take. Like I think it's

238
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:56,420
very particular choice, but, um, if you want to talk about the ego maniacs, we want to talk about

239
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:03,300
like insane relationships. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

240
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:09,540
The better palette for maybe, or canvas rather for what he's his sensibilities. Yeah. You want

241
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:14,500
to hear a crazy quote that I found in an interview, which we can, there's maybe another applicable

242
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:24,580
quote about this movie, but, um, he was talking about, um, low expectations being maybe a benefit

243
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:30,340
to a project. And in this case it was in referencing that people were maybe skeptical of the trailer

244
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:37,460
and Nicole Kidman being Lucy, people were maybe not feeling, uh, initially. And so he was, they

245
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:42,340
were asking about, I think the Hollywood reporter was asking about, um, just, you know, what do you

246
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:48,260
feel about the reaction? And he said, I've found that you can really leverage low expectations.

247
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:52,500
I learned that with the social network, people assumed it was going to be a romantic comedy where

248
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,620
like Paul Rudd friends drew Barrymore and they fall in love. And I just thought, great, they're

249
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:04,340
not expecting what they're about to see. Who thought that? You don't go into a movie and think

250
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:12,260
that it's different stars and a different genre than it is who like, unless you like were on the

251
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:17,300
way to the theater and tripped and hurt your head and then you're like dizzy and maybe you catch a

252
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:23,300
glimpse of a Drew Barrymore poster and a Paul Rudd poster combined. Who on earth thought that's

253
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:28,420
what the social network is going to be? Also the social network, if I recall, had a very clear

254
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:37,060
tonal like a trailer, like a trailer that was very dark and very importantly featured that

255
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:42,740
three word phrase, a four word phrase directed by David Fincher. And I feel like that gives you

256
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,740
an idea of what you're going to see. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

257
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,740
That's just a point. That is a little wild. I don't think we've all maybe landed

258
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,820
our, these strong sorkin feelings. This is what I was hoping we were all going to come in. Oh yeah.

259
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:02,020
But, well, he just seems so out of it anytime he says anything.

260
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:07,140
Yes. Like, yeah. Well, including, I mean, so here's why I found it. And we, this was mentioned briefly

261
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:14,340
on the show, but let me say the actual quote about this movie. So, but as word got out that

262
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,780
I was making this film, what I discovered is that there are people who are really passionate about

263
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:22,420
I Love Lucy. For me, it's nostalgic. I remember watching I Love Lucy reruns from when I was sick,

264
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,700
homesick from school. It's not a show that if we took a fresh look at today, we'd think was funny.

265
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:34,420
Wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Yeah, of course. I mean, there's obviously, there's some like politics

266
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,420
to it or there's some, you know, gender roles or stuff that they even bring up in the movie,

267
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:44,020
but it's like slapstick vaudeville shit. It's people falling over. I think generations pass.

268
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:48,420
That's probably the only thing from era in a way that people pass down and yeah, it's, uh,

269
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:53,860
uninsidious. Doesn't that just reveal that like, yeah, for me, it was just like, I don't know,

270
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:58,660
like watching a commercial for a soup can. I was staring at the TV and then that'd be on. And then

271
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:03,620
I Love Lucy was on. I don't care. So then I started doing my research and I saw people care

272
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:09,460
about this show. Huh? Why would you do the project? I'm not sure. What universe would you

273
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:15,140
do the pro like, why would you make spend? That's a lot of time to spend something. You don't.

274
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:20,500
For some of you think does not hold up at all. Yeah. It's not even, uh, I think it is definitive.

275
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:26,420
It's not a show that if we took a fresh look at today, you mean what you're doing, a fresh look,

276
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:33,380
what thing you're doing is going to not show that the show is funny. You know, it's all serious

277
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:39,860
movie about somebody like, yes, beautiful minding how comedy works and that like, like, you know,

278
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:44,980
Lucy goes into some like forbidden zone. She has her or the dead zone or whatever she has, like

279
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,620
she's, it goes into a trance state and then comes out of it and goes, uh, Fred, you need to be in

280
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:57,220
a chair in this. He goes, all right, right. Again, loose. Uh, I, I'll give it a credit. Uh, again,

281
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:03,140
I'll give say something else positive. So the, the kitchen or not the kitchen, the dining room

282
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:08,580
scene, this is kind of a running thread. They're trying to get the gags right in this dining room

283
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:15,300
scene. Um, when they, they're, so they do it on set at like 2 AM Lucy summons all the actors and

284
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:23,460
walks them through it at 2 AM. Um, that did to a certain extent rang true to me having been involved

285
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:30,020
with directing live comedy and like putting up producing live comedy for a number of years,

286
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:34,500
that sort of like walking around and you're just kind of like everyone's muttering to themselves

287
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:40,340
and like, what if you go there? The big thing was missing was everyone going, I'm sorry. Uh,

288
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:44,740
Hey, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. This is taking so long. I'm sorry. I'm being a massive pain in the

289
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:50,740
ass. Like the constant apologizing is not in this movie. Just really appreciate you. Yeah, thanks,

290
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:55,860
man. I really appreciate it. I know we just need that one joke and then we're done.

291
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,900
Yeah. Do you think, I mean, I don't know, was Lucy not an apologizer? I mean, she does apologize

292
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,380
once in this movie and that says she doesn't be this maybe the first time she's done it

293
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:11,300
to the Tony Hale character. Yeah, that's true. Well, I mean, even if, well, I mean, she was the very,

294
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:16,020
one of the most famous people in America, maybe one of the most powerful people in America.

295
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,580
I could see her and Desi maybe not being apologizers, but the fact that those writers

296
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,660
aren't constantly like downing themselves and apologizing.

297
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,180
Well, they're all maybe with all those, the whole, that whole writing team is all just,

298
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:35,620
uh, Sorkin's split into like five or how many, four, how many writers? Three. Three. Is it only

299
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:39,860
three? Three in a writer's assistant. I think you're right. That's another good carry over from

300
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:46,100
Studio 60, a almost non-existent writing staff. I don't know why he insists on this, that all

301
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:53,460
shows are written by a couple. Yeah. Uh, so you think this is a quibi show? Shows have budgets

302
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:58,740
usually. Yeah. Besides PB. I mean, if it was like six PBC show, but they're doing like 24

303
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:05,300
seasons, like written by 23 people. Yeah. This is insane. Yeah. So he hates I Love Lucy. He

304
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:11,380
sees no value in it whatsoever anymore. Hates two of the writers. All right. The Alia Shotcat

305
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:15,780
character comes off very well. Yes. But the other way he does, he does not have good feelings about

306
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:21,460
Jess Oppenheimer. Yes. Really underlined. He's not the funniest guy in the, and when he kind of has

307
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:28,660
an edict, he's like wrong or, uh, Lucy and Desi have to go shut up. No, we're, we're taking over

308
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:36,100
even though let's go into some factual inaccuracies among the, the myriad of things adding to the, uh,

309
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,900
what was my phrase? The, the fat burner, the oil cooker, um, that's the correct phrase.

310
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:48,660
What I said, yeah. The many things in their hot boiler, uh, um, uh, is that, uh, Lucy is,

311
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:54,900
is pregnant with her second child. The first time this happened on the show, they covered it up.

312
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,540
They don't want to do that again. They want to incorporate it into the show and they demand,

313
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:04,260
they start saying, we are going to address this. This is, I mean, they, this had not happened

314
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:08,180
on a major TV show before somebody getting pregnant in real life and addressing it.

315
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:12,260
So there was a lot of need to dance around the subject and are people ready for that. And of

316
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:18,020
course they were, and that's all an extremely popular story. Um, but in the movie it's portrayed

317
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:24,260
as if they were the only ones who believed in it. Especially this, the Tony kale guy, Oppenheimer

318
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,820
was like over my dead, but no, they'll never go for it. Yeah. Apparently the real story is he

319
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:33,780
immediately was like, yeah, great. Let's do it. Yeah. So like, what is the need to make it for

320
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:39,540
else? Some people have to be naysayers and unpleasant in order to, yeah, it's like,

321
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,820
I'm trying to think there's, there's definitely a good reason example that doesn't do this of,

322
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,380
of a movie or TV show, but it's like one of those where you're like,

323
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:52,820
making TV is like, it's a job and it's not like soaring epic music 24 seven of an important

324
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:57,060
moment that happens. I understand he's like packed all what he thinks are important things

325
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:01,780
and is extra dramatize them. But like sometimes it's interesting to see everybody like sitting

326
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:08,580
around goofing around and like making jokes, like how a TV show would be made in real life,

327
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:14,500
unless it was some insane kind of production. Oh, sure. Yeah. So like he, he, he needs everything

328
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:20,100
to be conflict. He needs everything to feel like it's a, the most epic moments at all times.

329
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:27,220
Yeah. I mean, and to that point, when Lucy starts telling the cast and crew that she's pregnant,

330
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:33,380
everyone seems pissed. Like, like, like the writers are all like, fuck man. Like,

331
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:38,820
and eventually they have to go like, sorry, sorry. That was weird. I, I, congratulations,

332
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:47,220
I guess. Like what, what are you talking about? Like also probably that was probably enough. Like

333
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:57,540
if you want to play up the actual historical, the, the HUAC thing is so intense. I feel like

334
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:01,700
the, we're going to do that. We're having a baby and we're going to show it on TV. Like,

335
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:10,260
isn't that enough of like a drive, a dramatic device for a movie, like a 90 minute biopic?

336
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:16,500
Well, but you know that, I mean, for sure I was watching this and to Mike's question, why are you

337
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:24,340
making this if you don't like the show? And the answer obviously is this communist scare

338
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:29,780
house in American activity. That's completely why. And like I was thinking it while watching it,

339
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:37,140
obviously, like this is, this is such sorkin porn. This is exactly what he loves the most. And then

340
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,940
the same interview or the article says like, yeah, one of the things that captured his attention is

341
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,220
the fact that Lucy O'Balla had been accused of being a communist. Like, of course that's where

342
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,700
canceling in that one. Oh, there's a little bit of cancel stuff. Yeah. Lucy was going to be

343
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,740
canceled and I did go, Oh, okay. Got it. He was like, Lucy was going to be canceled. So I'm going

344
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:59,620
to use the Lucy movie. I don't know what to say that like we shouldn't cancel Joss Whedon. I don't

345
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:04,900
know what he, who he wants not canceled. I'm not sure. I'm just saying like that's, that is

346
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:12,020
definitely his hook. Yeah. But I think like that it can be that it's about like, you know, good

347
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:17,060
versus evil and witch hunts and the power of entertainment to overturn evil politics. This is

348
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:24,020
just right. Salivates over. Yeah. But he's, I, but I think, I think it is more about canceling,

349
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:29,300
like celebrities for stuff versus actual politics this time around. I could be wrong. That's an

350
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:35,940
interesting. I did write that down about an hour in of like, is, is he talking about culture? But

351
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:42,100
then also they're talking about how dangerous the house, not American activities, like accusations

352
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:48,100
are this movie is aggressively anti-communist. Yeah, no, that's what I'm saying. So like if it's,

353
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:54,900
if Lucy's the hero of the piece and she's still like, they, they don't make her a full like evil

354
00:34:54,900 --> 00:35:02,260
character, but why would Sorkin want to do it? Do a movie like this unless, cause he is a politics

355
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:09,620
are very centrist Democrat pie in the sky. Definitely seems like the guy who spent the last like five

356
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:15,460
or six years talking about like the respectable Republicans must have, there must be compromise

357
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:20,740
on them for them to behave in such a way. That is true. He's definitely probably like P tape guy.

358
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:25,860
Now we all wanted the P tape to be real. We all wanted to be P tape guys. Yeah. We wanted to be

359
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:32,420
that. Well, J big as a P guy where P tape guys for sure. Um, but he was definitely like Mr. Muller,

360
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:38,180
he had a Mueller calendar probably. And like took 365, took the days off of him and was like,

361
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:44,900
and this will this be the day Mr. Mueller? He was like planning a Mueller by a pick with like the

362
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:51,140
most like, you know, like upstanding trust where it's going to be like Josh Brolin or somebody has

363
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:56,900
like, you know, and he's like a, like the young gun Mueller, uh, you know, on the rise to eventually

364
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:02,420
like bring down a presidency. And then once like Mueller actually talked and kind of sounded

365
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:08,820
not cool and didn't do anything to help anybody. And then he's like, Oh no. All right. So I'll

366
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:16,340
crumple up my information Mueller biopic. So America's finest hero, hero of our times, the

367
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:23,140
Mueller story. Did he, uh, did he insert some more anti-communist lines into the movie after that

368
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:28,740
week last summer where everyone's like, we gotta help Cuba. And it's like, Oh, well that lasted

369
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:33,860
three days and we never heard anything about it again. It was very organic and normal and not at

370
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:39,460
all suspicious. But I, I, all to my point is I feel he's like, he's less interested in completely

371
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:44,180
going hard against communism and all that stuff in this movie. And he's more interested in the

372
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:50,900
witch hunt aspect. And when I saw cancel in the article, he said Lucy being canceled. Then I said,

373
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:57,060
ah, I think I know why he actually wants to do this movie is because of what he feels are, I

374
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:02,180
don't know, famous people being canceled or Tim Allen says something dumb and 40 people subtweet

375
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:06,740
him or on Twitter. I don't know. I don't know exactly what it is, but that's my guess. I don't

376
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:14,100
know for sure. Yeah. And then at the same time, he makes a hero out of the American weirdo media

377
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:21,700
who probably canceled the most actual people. Oh, Edgar Hoover. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Um, let's talk

378
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:28,660
about this. So this ending, this ending. Yeah, this is something. So that just to explain this

379
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:35,780
at the beginning of the film, uh, of course, at the moment when Lucy and Desi are madly making love

380
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:40,820
off camera so that we have not yet revealed that the actors don't really look like them so much,

381
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:46,420
like how long can we get into this movie without this show or radio for a while? And then maybe

382
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:52,180
you'll like be so ready to see somebody in this movie that you won't mind that they don't look

383
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:58,020
that way. Yeah. Um, but then on the radio, it said that, uh, it's been dug up that Lucy said she was

384
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:04,740
a member of the communist party and, uh, and this has to be like undone throughout the movie, like

385
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:10,500
the, I'm still not even clear on where this lands, that she checked the wrong box or it was

386
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:16,900
for her grandfather. It's unclear in the movie kind of even still like he doesn't even go that

387
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:22,420
hard on Lucy explaining. So yeah, uh, Desi adamant against it though. Like you can't say any fleet

388
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:27,060
communism and you, you know, we can't be sick because this is like, uh, this is like getting

389
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:32,100
canceled back then. Exactly. This is what imagine a pre-cancellation time. This is what would get

390
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:36,340
you there. And as they say many times in the movie, this would be the death for the show.

391
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:41,540
People are like saying goodbye to each other. Essentially. Like Lucy said, like if this doesn't

392
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:46,660
pan out correctly, she sort of says goodbye to, uh, Fred and Ethel. Like it has been a pleasure

393
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:53,780
doing business with you, sirs. Um, but anyway, it all culminates like we have to undo this. And even

394
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:59,700
though she'd been cleared by the committee, this is not true. She's not currently a member of the

395
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:04,340
communist party. There was still, it was going to come up in the media. There's going to be a big

396
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:11,860
store with red. They got the red ink out to say Lucy's a red. And, uh, uh, so we, we got to use

397
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:18,900
this bomb just like her hair. Yes. Uh, um, it's a Ricky or he said a thing in real life. I think

398
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,220
that is not in the movie. He said something in real life. Yeah. Yeah. He said, he said the only

399
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:27,620
thing right about Lucy's or hair, I think was the line he said in real life. Doesn't say this in the

400
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:31,620
movie though. Not in the movie. That seems so ready to go. I was, yeah. Cause I was looking at

401
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:35,140
stuff while I'm watching the movie and I go, okay, he's going to say this in the end. And then no,

402
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:41,460
that's not. Yeah. Um, anyway, uh, so it is this witch hunt going on and they have to defuse the

403
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:48,100
bomb. How do we do it? Well, during the pre show warmup where Desi Arnaz would usually play Babalu

404
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:55,220
and get the crowd hyped as we all would be watching Babalu. Uh, instead he's got to address the

405
00:39:55,220 --> 00:40:00,580
serious matter and say that this isn't true and get ahead of the story. And he ultimately does it

406
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:05,780
by putting a phone up to his microphone at a live studio audience to say, now was this,

407
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:13,220
do you test, do you swear that Lucy was, uh, has been cleared of all wrongdoing?

408
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:19,380
Yes, that is true. And now can I ask your name, sir? This I, my name is Jay Edgar Hoover,

409
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:28,580
head of the FBI. And it's really now, you know, of course scoff and everything, but it does

410
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:35,940
really show the lengths that, uh, that Desi would go to to protect Lucy and to protect the show.

411
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:41,780
And it's a very stirring climax, uh, uh, you know, after all the pressure of the film.

412
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:46,500
And I, it's, I think it's a really cool moment and it's only undone. I'd say a little bit by the

413
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:54,260
fact that it's bullshit. This did not happen. Then he did not get on the phone. This is like

414
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:59,940
the entire, the climax of the movie is a totally made up thing. And just immediately, this is the,

415
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,620
the, the benefit of getting to watch movies at home and not in the theater. You can just immediately

416
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:09,140
like, wait a minute. Like that, I don't know. You can, there's dramatic license. And then there's

417
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:15,540
Jay Edgar Hoover called the audience bullshit Santa Claus came down the chimney and said, hello,

418
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:20,740
uh, Lucy is not a communist. She's been nice this year. Not an anti-communist.

419
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,940
Oh, yeah.

420
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:29,620
Also that is ending number one of three because that's okay. Big dramatic conclusion, big happy

421
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:37,220
ending. That's, that's how you want to, you know, uh, wrap it up. No, right after this Lucy confronts

422
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:43,860
Ricky backstage, which she's been doing every 10 minutes in the movie about a news story of him

423
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:49,940
running around on her and running around and having an affair. And, um, you know, he brushed

424
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,460
it off of like, they use the wrong picture. That was from a charity thing. We were there together

425
00:41:54,020 --> 00:42:00,580
and I was buying, I was like, oh, this is nothing, but he is doing that again, an Aaron Sorkin thing

426
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:05,700
where a character will obsess about a thing. And then at the very end of the episode or the movie,

427
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:11,300
they'll go like, okay, you're right. All right, fine. Here's the truth. Like that, that is a

428
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:17,700
Sorkin ism and that happens in this movie because she catches him with a different, with like a

429
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:23,220
handkerchief with lipstick on it was hers. And then she found another handkerchief with other

430
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:29,300
lipstick on it. And his defense is like, they were just called girls. They were just hookers. I don't

431
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:36,420
know. And it's like, I looked into that the hooker stuff. All true. Yeah, that's true.

432
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:41,780
Scotty Bowers, if we know Scotty, do you know what I'm talking about? No Scotty Bowers is a guy who

433
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:49,300
like worked at a, like a Phillips station. And he basically was a male prostitute slash pimp.

434
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:55,380
So he had sex with like Spencer Tracy according to this book, by the way, this is in his book.

435
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:00,660
This character is another Ryan Murphy is in the Ryan Murphy thing. What's it called?

436
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:06,020
Hollywood. I think it's just called Hollywood. Yeah, whatever that that was. So he has like all

437
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:11,780
these stories of very famous people and him procuring prostitutes for them. Oh, okay.

438
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:18,900
Desi being one of them. And he said, Desi would tip very well, which is nice. And Lucy said,

439
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:24,980
one time Lucy saw Scotty at a party and came in and slapped him and said, like, don't you pimp

440
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:31,700
women for Desi or something? Wow. Wow. So yeah, that stuff. Yeah, good tipper invented the three

441
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:41,220
camera system. Yeah, Desi tips his prostitutes well. You should know that about him. There's

442
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:48,500
something that's related to Scotty that I kind of have to say. I'm so sorry about this, but

443
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,020
there's just something that I'm going to have to say. Well, I'm going to have to say a word

444
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,940
and I apologize if anyone has young children around here. I'm going to have to say some dirty

445
00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:01,140
stuff here. The second gate episode of completely there in Sorkin complaints. Yeah. Great entertainment.

446
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:06,340
It's about Spencer Tracy. Okay. So I'm just going to read these two paragraphs. And again,

447
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:12,100
I really apologize, but there's some terminology in here that I just have to read out loud.

448
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:16,260
Scotty Bowers said that Spencer Tracy, like many male celebrities of the 40s and 50s, used to pay

449
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:20,260
him for sex. As Bowers remembers it, he would go over to Tracy's house and Tracy would start

450
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:25,300
drowning himself for hours in scotch. Then Bowers would collapse into bed with the actor and the two

451
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,060
would fool around. Sometimes Tracy got so trashed that he would get up in the middle of the night

452
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:35,620
and urinate in the closet. A couple times, Bowers said he pee peed on me thinking it was the bathroom.

453
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:41,700
That's part of it. That's how drunk you fool around. I'm scandalized already. Okay. So now here

454
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:48,340
is a worse word here. Okay. Tracy had other vices too. He would not suck your cock. Bowers says during

455
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:54,180
a colorful interview at a Santa Monica hotel, he would chew your cock. That's not nice. It would

456
00:44:54,180 --> 00:45:02,420
hurt. So I, again, I apologize for the language, but that is a crazy way. That is a crazy sentence

457
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:08,180
I read earlier and I had to say it out loud to make other people hear it because I'm just imagining

458
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:14,180
the, uh, the Mickey's trailer, the corn on the cob with the typewriter. A long way.

459
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:21,300
Look, Spencer Trace. I don't know. I apologize to the estate of Spencer Tracy.

460
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:28,900
Chew. Chew is so. He called that Adam's rib. That's a great old movie joke, folks.

461
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:39,780
For any, any greatest generation members out there. Yeah. So I, uh, chewing your, is that just a virtue?

462
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:45,780
He's, he's so confused and closeted. He's and drunk. He's like, is this what you do? I don't,

463
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:53,620
you do when you're gay. I have no, I can't even begin to do a psychological assessment

464
00:45:54,260 --> 00:46:02,500
in this situation. I just thought the, what you'd say, you say, um, uh, yeah, that's what I said. I

465
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:08,260
didn't say ouch. It was, uh, I said, that's good. It was such an awful, so much me more with your

466
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:13,300
teeth. It was such an awful sentence. I had to make other people hear it. I'm so sorry.

467
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:18,260
Cause sometimes you read something like that and you just like, I have others and must know the

468
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:24,260
sentence exists. The listeners need to bear this burden for you and all of us. Wow. That's incredible.

469
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:30,020
So that whole, I, by the way, by the way, this is going to be shocking. I have this book in the

470
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:34,500
apartment and I have not read it. Jeez. When it has that. Cause I took it from my mother.

471
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:43,140
Oh, my dad, you know, she's read it. She has read it. My dad bought it. My dad bought it for him.

472
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:47,460
She's like, what is this? And then she read it cover to cover. Uh, yeah, it's like a Hollywood

473
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:52,180
Babylon kind of like gossipy. Yeah. Yeah. It's just like, you know, he's talking about getting

474
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:58,180
hookers for Katherine Hepburn and stuff. So sure. But your mom read those words. Yeah, that's true.

475
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:03,940
That's true. Try to like, whoop. No, no, no. Didn't see that. Next page, please. Yeah. Yeah.

476
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:10,580
Probably. So, uh, that book exists. That gentleman has passed away a couple of years ago. He was

477
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:14,740
like nineties, nineties, but he had been around forever. So full service. I think I've talked to

478
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:24,340
Ryan Perez about this book. Pretty sure. Um, so. Was buried. Never to be chewed on.

479
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:33,060
So Jason's trying to recover. He's trying to stay face. I don't know. I do so much. So again,

480
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:38,660
I'm so sorry. This is like, I will call that ending to the Lucy confronts. That's a during

481
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:47,300
an ending to is when Lucy, uh, says to Desi, don't gaslight me. And I looked up the, the movie that

482
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:56,420
that term, you know, kind of comes from released in 1944 based on the play for 1938. So those were

483
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:03,060
in the ether. The term, the terminology of gaslighting, like don't gaslight, like to a

484
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:09,060
said to a person that is the most anachronistic thing. And that is more anachronistic than the

485
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:15,860
documentary Trump era. Yeah. It's like, it's like if Jess Oppenheimer walked in and was like, Lucy,

486
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:23,460
you're a girl boss. Like, what are you, what are you doing? Yeah. Gaslight. Yeah. That's,

487
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:28,900
that's very recent. What? And the last two modern, yeah. If they had had someone in the

488
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:33,940
documentary portion, say that would have made more sense. Sure. Like, and especially if Lucy's like

489
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:38,660
at the height of like her anger, but then also in a weird spot. Cause she's like, I got to pull it

490
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:44,900
together. We have to do tape and episodes. Like I understand people being very conflicted in that

491
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:50,260
moment and very weird in that moment. The third ending is like the text on cards of like the show

492
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:54,260
ended. Then they got divorced and then there's a little more documentary people at the end.

493
00:48:54,260 --> 00:49:00,180
After all this, thank God, as much of that. Yeah. He kind of shows those cards, those modern cards

494
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:05,780
a little bit there really early on. There's a, there's a seriously. Yeah. There's a good,

495
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:12,180
not say that in there. Yeah. And there is definitely like, he is, he is writing dialogue

496
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:18,260
for like Desi Arnaz to quip. Like he's walking through the oval office or the whole, like you

497
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:22,260
can definitely sometimes you could, I mean, he's obviously like, that's his forte. He's good at it.

498
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,780
So like sometimes you didn't even pay them, but then sometimes you go, oh yeah. He's like writing

499
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:32,020
quippy. Oh, for Desi Arnaz and William Frawley, like as if they were on one of his old TV shows.

500
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:37,460
I mean, they really make them look good. I mean, like they were certainly very good entertainers,

501
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:42,820
but also their reputations are that they were massive assholes and they are heroes.

502
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:47,300
Frawley, especially Frawley. I think that's, you know, that's probably something that people

503
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:51,780
made people suggest that we do this episode. Yeah, right. There's a lot of love for

504
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:57,060
old William Frawley, Fred Mertz and I, I don't have a lot of Frawley material from this. I think that,

505
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:04,900
I mean, my, my main note is that JK Simmons doesn't look shitty enough. Well, I wrote down here,

506
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:10,420
jacked Bill Frawley. That's right. He's open real good shape. If you've seen the pictures,

507
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:15,540
we've all seen the pictures of JK Simmons, right? At the gym. Yes. No. Scott, can you Google,

508
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:19,940
are you on the internet? Can you just Google like, is he jacked in the tomorrow war? Yeah. Yeah.

509
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:25,780
He's pretty jacked. Jacked. Let's see if it's Jack. JK Simmons comes up. Okay. Yeah. But yeah,

510
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:30,820
look at him. He's like 66 years old or 65 years old. Look at those arms. My God. They,

511
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:36,820
Bill Frawley did not have those arms. No, and I don't, I don't have a problem. I mean, a lot of

512
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:41,780
the actors I think made the right choice of like, well, I'm going to do my interpretation

513
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:48,980
of this, this character. I mean, you know, the, the four stars of the show, you know, everyone

514
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:55,060
has an image of that. I don't know that a lot of people, you know, would know what like, oh, this

515
00:50:55,060 --> 00:51:00,660
is what Jess Oppenheimer was like in real life. I did, I did think kind of casting against type Tony

516
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:05,860
Hale being a little more aggressive in roles he's often given. And I liked him as that character.

517
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:12,660
Yeah. I'd say my problems are rarely with the actors in this movie. Yeah. Almost, almost never.

518
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:17,860
I think that Cole Kidman, who was awarded a golden globe for this role from an undisclosed

519
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:23,540
location, wherever they gave out the golden globes this year. The trail of breadcrumb, whatever the

520
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:33,060
witch's house were, they hid the golden globes. I think the, I think she's great as doing like Lucy

521
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:39,460
behind the scenes. I don't know that anyone is well served with the show recreation, the black

522
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:44,580
and white show recreatives decides that one gag where Fred and Ethel elbow each other at the same

523
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:52,580
time. I think JK Simmons and Nina, I want to say Arianda is that Arianda Arianda. I thought they

524
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:57,620
did that bit really good. I kind of, well, I don't completely, I don't just completely disagree with

525
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:03,700
that, but I think that Nicole Kimmins voice is good when she's doing like performance Lucy.

526
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:08,180
I feel like it's real accurate when she's doing like radio play Lucy. And then when she's like

527
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:12,100
shouting and talking to the audience, like, but then sort of like, she goes in and out of sounding

528
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:18,740
like Lucy to me when she's doing like regular scenes. But that's a hard line. It's a very hard

529
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:27,140
line going between what Australian and, and it's, and, and yeah, right. Right. First voice to like

530
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:32,580
script cigarette. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But then it's like also like my memories during watching this

531
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:38,180
are betraying me because I have watched, I have just mainlined hours of sick of seventies and

532
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:44,900
eighties talk show appearance, Lucy appearances where she's just tired and seemingly depressed

533
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:50,820
and her voice is so shot from cigarettes. So I was like, Oh, maybe I'm misremembering exactly

534
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:57,220
all Lucy's maybe spoke back during the making of this. Like the, the old Lucy is so, so much

535
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:01,860
stronger than yes. That's cause that's what you take it over your brain. When I think casual Lucy,

536
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:07,380
I think of that Lucy, a little bit more, uh, stone pillow era Lucy, which we've talked about before,

537
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:11,780
which might be future second gate. I never watched it. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't watched it.

538
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:16,820
Stone pillow. Stone pillow is a made for TV movie where Lucy is homeless.

539
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:28,260
Looks so like she's looks so broad and physical comedy despite having to be a serious,

540
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:38,180
like a red skeleton, like, uh, so yeah. So I always think of that, um, more so yeah, I'm not,

541
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:42,100
I would have to go back and see what Lucy sounded like exactly, but yeah, sometimes I feel like,

542
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:46,420
Oh yeah, she's actually doing a pretty good job with the voice. Um, and then sometimes I'm like,

543
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:52,500
yeah, she's a little lost in the woods on this. You know what I, I mainly, maybe I was rooting

544
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:56,900
for Nicole Kidman and wanted to enjoy Nicole Kidman in it in a way, because like,

545
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:03,700
you know, all that Twitter shit about like, how could it be Nicole? It's gotta be Deborah Messick,

546
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:10,820
Deborah Messick, damn it. Like, what do you imagine be okay. So by the time they are,

547
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:15,300
anyone tweeting about that is responding to the news of casting that is done. You're not

548
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:20,980
going to petition your way. You're not going to like make Sorkin. Although if anybody was dramatic

549
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:27,380
enough to do that, that he is like faxed the results of a Twitter poll. Yeah. Well, right.

550
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:33,140
America has spoken. We must do what we must do. But like so strange. Why and why are you fighting

551
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:38,820
so hard to overturn? I don't people like Nicole Kidman and then like Deborah Messing. I have

552
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:44,340
nothing against Deborah Messing, but like not really a movie star, right? Like a major television

553
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:49,300
star, one of the most major television stars. So why, and like, I know that there was an episode

554
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:54,580
of something where she dressed up like there's a Dharma and Greg episode because it's not the

555
00:54:54,580 --> 00:55:01,780
Will and Grace is the Dharma. Dharma is Jenna Elfman. I'm so sorry. I'll just say Jenna Elfman.

556
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:08,820
No, like there's already, you have your photo of her like she's red hair, Lucy red, Deborah red,

557
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:17,220
she's red now today. She is, but in all fairness, I'm a little surprised that Sorkin didn't cast her

558
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:21,860
because she's the same kind of pudding brained milk toast Democrat. Like I'm sure they shared

559
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:28,980
a table at like $10,000 a plate at like some like, like Gillibrand for president,

560
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:37,060
like some awful fundraiser, you know? She's the one who tweeted like so and so was even maybe

561
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:43,300
like Steve Bannon was like wanted a 50% tax on like, like multimillionaires. And she was like,

562
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:48,820
this is out of control or something. Oh my God. There was something really embarrassing. People

563
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:54,740
goofing on her where you were like, this isn't that unbelievable. I forgot that aspect. But look,

564
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:59,780
I'm actually surprised that this phenomenon is much older than the internet actually.

565
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:07,140
Like, I don't know if another thing I watch copious amounts of our old Batman press from 1989

566
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:15,860
and Michael Keaton on all the talk shows. Oh boy, Mike. And well, you show me your YouTube

567
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:21,300
history. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. We'll compare YouTube history. She was wasting more time.

568
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:26,980
Uh, but, but there was like a big uproar with Michael Keaton playing Batman. Oh, that's right.

569
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:34,260
Oh, that was like a comedian. Yeah. Like going to be a goof event again. Yeah. Adam. What? You mean

570
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:40,260
the very good Adam was thing. And then also like, how do you know that's not going to be that? What

571
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:44,100
are you? Yeah. Right. And it's not like there's much precedent even either. It wasn't like, oh,

572
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:48,900
there were like 10 like prestige Batman movies already. And they were, they were upset that

573
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:52,180
like, I don't know, like where did that come from? People were just like, people have always been

574
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:57,460
upset at like a famous character being played. I mean, he fledged every, you know, it happens all

575
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:01,940
the time. And I got, hopefully it'll happen with the character of Lucille Ball over and over again,

576
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:08,180
when many people portray her over the years. Um, and Bill, when Jason plays Bill Frawley,

577
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:13,780
in a couple of years, and he sings some of the old ones, there, there is like, as I was reading

578
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:18,260
about, there's a number of books about the making of, I love Jess Oppenheimer and his son, I think

579
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:24,020
wrote a book together. I think there's other, there might just be a book just about Frawley

580
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:28,980
and Vivian Vance. Oh, I wouldn't, I wouldn't agree with that. But like, I think there's very specific

581
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:36,020
and seemingly not a ton of it, not a ton of these source materials used for this.

582
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:40,500
In the same interview, Sorkin says there's a number of books about I love Lucy, but

583
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:44,580
they're not any good. They're written for the fans. And, uh,

584
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:50,900
this is written by not a fan at all who doesn't know very much other than just the greatest hits.

585
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:58,580
Well, the greatest hits and this communist thing that I am convinced now, look, I don't know,

586
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:05,940
I don't know what happened. I'm no expert on this subject, but my guess is my hunch is that this,

587
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:10,900
uh, the house on American activities, communist thing with them. I don't think this is like one

588
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:16,500
of the top 400 memories in Lucy or Desi's lives. I think they were on their deathbeds and this

589
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:23,140
didn't occur to them at all. No, I think this is a interesting anecdote. Sorkin was like,

590
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:29,140
ding, ding, ding, ding, ding Sorkin vision attack. This is the whole story is this.

591
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:34,820
That's what their lives were about. Two pages in LA confidential magazine or like, uh, three

592
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:40,500
sentences and a head of hopper, you know, uh, column, but like, yeah, I don't, there's so many

593
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:44,900
stories and then they do like, he's got this dismissive attitude in the press about it,

594
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:50,260
but then they do have all these facts of like, yeah, it's 60 million people or 30 million people.

595
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:54,980
Well, he has to respect the numbers. The respect and the department stores that you stay open late

596
00:58:54,980 --> 00:59:01,300
on Mondays, but then Lucy, they had to change the day. Yeah. I, I, yeah, he obviously,

597
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:06,180
when you're doing anything like this, that's like, if you were a dad, if any of us were adapting

598
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:10,420
this, we would have to pick like what we find the most interesting. And you're, you're right, Scott,

599
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:19,620
that this is just the most interesting thing to him about a gigantic TV star that has transcended

600
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:26,900
many generations syndication still to this day, people know who she is, laugh at her.

601
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:31,860
And the, the, the racial stuff and the mixed marriage there, it's in there, but it's not the

602
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:39,620
primary, it's like about as interesting as this one brush with J. Edgar Hoover that didn't happen.

603
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:46,820
Yeah. His number one thing is, uh, canceling celebrities getting canceled and using this

604
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:51,780
Lucy movie to make a point about it, that it was silly. I don't know. That's the, that's the,

605
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:57,220
the core of the story. And the also on that J. Edgar Hoover note. So the reality of that is that

606
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:02,420
he did like write a letter to the show and like, boy, I have to say this, like some stiff, like

607
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:09,460
the comedy on the program was some of the best executed comedy that I have witnessed in my,

608
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:14,660
in this week. And then, uh, a little subtext to their like, like a very end of this article,

609
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:19,460
I'm reading, uh, J. Edgar Hoover did keep a file on Lucy ball for the rest of her life.

610
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:25,220
Of course. So he's presented as that like, yes, thank you for the call.

611
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:32,180
Desi, anytime you need the FBI, I am here. Also, I will be following both of you forever.

612
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:37,780
I think he followed everyone. I think anyone, anyone got some publicity in America is like,

613
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:42,980
all right, time to open a file. Like I think the, I haven't watched the Leonardo DiCaprio,

614
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:49,700
J. Edgar Hoover. I think it is, uh, not well reviewed, but I believe, um, one of the things

615
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:54,500
it seemed to get right is that J. Edgar Hoover wasn't insane, man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just

616
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:59,540
wanted to look and see if J. Edgar Hoover lived long enough to see stone pillow and he did not.

617
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:05,460
Oh, geez. Going too soon. Out of the file. Yeah. Haven't got another angel. He died in,

618
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:12,740
he died in 72 and stone pillow was 85. Um, so. Cause he probably, probably could have gotten

619
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:19,540
that late in life, like juice from Nixon from like second Nixon administration. Yeah. I think

620
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:24,260
that's probably right. But, um, no, he bowed out before. If he knew stone pillow was coming a

621
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:29,860
mere 13 years later, he may have hung on just a little longer, Jay. Yeah.

622
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:36,820
Can I, if I remember, we used to write it down, but I just, what, one quick thing that,

623
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:40,740
that struck me too. I don't know if you guys, if this registered at all, that there's a lot of

624
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:47,140
several times in this movie, the name, uh, Damon Runyon is said. Oh yeah. Yeah. Um, that like,

625
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:51,300
you know, she has been Lucy's film career. She's going to do a movie. It's, it's written by,

626
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:58,260
well, I'm doing a Damon Runyon. Jesse, it's Damon Runyon. Um, I've never heard the name

627
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:03,700
Damon Runyon in my life. Again, I am not super educated. I don't know who this is. And I,

628
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:08,820
I'm so like, oh, this is the most. So I just Googled Damon Runyon, Aaron Sorkin. And if the

629
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:11,940
first thing I find is an interview where he says, well, William Frawley, you know, was kind of a

630
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:19,060
Damon Runyon character. Like you fucking, God, again, it Lou that Lucy met Damon Runyon is a

631
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:24,580
writer he admires. That's more important that we don't need to see the chocolate. We don't need to

632
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:29,620
write, right? No, but the family, like none of that matter. Damon Runyon needs the time.

633
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:36,020
Am I crazy? Is Damon Runyon the most famous? I don't, I, I think that, no, that I feel like

634
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:40,340
I've heard that name as a name. Like when I looked up Gaslight, I was like, oh, directed by

635
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:47,060
George Cukor. Yeah. It was George Cukor movie. Like he just wanted a journeyman, like kind of

636
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:51,860
writer, director. There were so many journeymen and like, you know, some would break out or some

637
01:02:51,860 --> 01:03:00,420
would, you know, have a second, a second wind in like the kind of a tour era of Hollywood or, or

638
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:04,980
you re-examine them like a few decades later and stuff. But like, no, I don't

639
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:09,940
blanking on Damon Runyon's contributions. And he goes way out of his way to get Edward R.

640
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:16,500
Murrow's name in there too. Oh, you gotta. That guy from CBS, one of the actors has one of my

641
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:21,940
favorite voices I've ever heard. He's like, has a real like voice like this. And I love it. I can't,

642
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:26,500
I should have, I've totally blanked on looking his name up. I really should do that. Cause I was like,

643
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:31,780
I kept being like, this guy's voice is great. I love this. Again, the character, the people,

644
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:36,980
the actors who fill out the smaller roles or fill out the support staff of I Love Lucy,

645
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:43,700
great cast. Yeah, sure. Really good actors. Honestly, I would love to watch just an I Love Lucy

646
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:49,700
behind the scenes of just the writers and J.K. Simmons and the woman who played Vivian Vance.

647
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:55,700
Well, yeah, Vivian Vance, I feel like she gets, she just seems like she's just mad all the time.

648
01:03:55,700 --> 01:04:00,180
And I assume she was mad about the things she's mad about in the movie, but she was friends with

649
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:04,740
Lucy. She hated William Frawley, supposedly, but she was friends with Lucy. So like there should

650
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:09,700
be a scene where they're like, she's not like just mad, you know, like there had to be times when they

651
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:14,020
were like happy, like, you know, there should have been a more of a get back. There should have been

652
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:19,460
a nine hours of seeing behind the scenes of I Love Lucy and, you know, seeing the good times

653
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:23,940
and the bad. Not just. Sorkin must be furious at get back. Oh, I bet he is. They showed that they

654
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:29,140
had fun together. That can't be right. Right. And also he's probably says, you know, if we really

655
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:33,780
look back at it, the Beatles music doesn't hold up. It's just, it's outdated. I think today,

656
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:38,020
if you took a second look at it, nobody would tap their toes to it. Right. It's not like the

657
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:47,860
Gilbert and Sullivan songs. It doesn't hold up like those do. I'm listening to a Beatles song.

658
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:51,540
I'm not laughing uproariously at all. Now Gilbert and Sullivan on the other hand,

659
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:57,140
I'm going to pause the tape every 10 seconds. I assume we know most of those songs, mostly from

660
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:04,340
the Sideshow Bob Cape Fear episode. Oh, yes. Absolutely. I know the names. Yep. Information

661
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:14,420
animal, vegetable, mineral, the very model of the modern age. That's all I know. Any other thoughts

662
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:21,220
on this on this film? Funny to watch an interesting watch. Yeah, an interesting watch. Spirit discussion.

663
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:26,020
It's a little long, but I mean, it's pretty, you know, it goes, it's not boring. It's interesting.

664
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:31,140
I was just going to say, yeah, not boring. Um, I, I don't know how you feel about being the

665
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:36,580
Ricardo's as a title. I have some alternate titles. I want to go ahead. Uh, Lucy, you've got some

666
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:45,300
explaining to do. I love the fellows. Uh, television is important. And finally women. Am I right?

667
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:53,620
Can you combine the last two, the last two, your titles combined? Oh, television important,

668
01:05:53,620 --> 01:06:00,420
comma women. Am I right? Yeah, there you go. Yeah. Oh, maybe some parentheses in there. Yeah.

669
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:04,580
This really is, I was watching it the whole time. I just kept saying like, I want more movies that

670
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:09,380
dramatize Lucy's life, but I would like some movies about her time with her second husband,

671
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:17,060
Gary Morton, who I'm also obsessed with watching interviews. Gary Morton is like kind of sleepy,

672
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:20,980
older comedian. Oh, actually he was younger than Lucy, but sleepy comedian who like when they're

673
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:26,420
doing interviews together, I'm like, Oh, this is Lucy. Really like this guy. Like, um, so if he

674
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:33,460
casts, so if Javier Bardem ends up being Desi, then who's, who's Gary, who's Gary Morton, the guy who

675
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:39,460
plays, uh, Jerry on parks and rec, what's that guy's name? Give that guy like maybe like a beard.

676
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:44,340
I forget his name. I knew at one point. Yeah. He's very funny on that show. Uh, what about a movie

677
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:51,060
where Desi is trying to decide between Gail Gordon and William Frawley for the role of Fred? Oh, but

678
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:54,260
sure. I mean, just that decision. I think, I think the decision was made because I think Gail was

679
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:59,700
unavailable because I believe this story. I, I read something where he was like really pushing for,

680
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:06,580
because Lucy was good. Yeah. Guys be careful. I know the gripes, the gripe makers are watching.

681
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:11,300
I know, I know. I was trying to have my bets there. This is Hollywood Babylon. This is all

682
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:16,180
rumor mongering. Who knows? Gail Gordon and Lucy got plenty of time to work together. Yeah. Yes.

683
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:20,580
And then Lucy, of course. So I just see, I would love a behind the scenes about every Lucy project,

684
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:26,420
I guess really also that existed. Sure. The Lucy show. Here's Lucy. What's that? She's in Mame. Oh,

685
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:32,020
Mame. Sure. Yeah. And then, um, of course life with Lucy, the last sitcom she did. Oh, that,

686
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:38,100
yeah. The kids, the kids that produce her credits, her kids, you know, her kids on this movie. I

687
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:43,380
learned her daughter is married to the guy who played like Spock's brother in Star Trek five.

688
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:50,740
And I got real excited about that. Sibak, I believe is the character's name and it's Star

689
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:55,060
Trek five. It's the worst Star Trek movie. It's the one Shatner directed. Uh, and it's the one,

690
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:58,180
have you ever seen this scene in Star Trek five, Scott, where they're all in central, like,

691
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:04,180
no, not like a national park and they like fall off a cliff and it's like Shatner, Nimoy, DeForest,

692
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:09,620
Kelly. You should see it because they're like Spock has like rocket boots and the effect is really

693
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:15,620
bad. And he like goes up and he like kept, you got it. Yeah. That was a story going around recently.

694
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:20,980
Who knows how true, you know, it is as like, you know, when you can fit it in an image to go on

695
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:27,380
Twitter or Instagram of like Lucy in the Desi Lu capacity was really pushing for CVCBS to make

696
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:33,380
this pilot called Star Trek. Yes, Lucy. Very. Yes. Lucy was a big part of Star Trek. Yeah. Um,

697
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:38,900
and yeah, they, they look, there are a lot of facts they should have crammed in to this. You

698
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:43,460
know, Lucy is going to make a show called Star Trek or she's going to be responsible because she

699
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:47,700
didn't make it, but there's like a whole, there's a convoluted way in which she has something to do

700
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:52,260
with Star Trek getting on the air. She's a star. Do you understand? There's going to be actresses

701
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:58,580
dressed up like her at theme parks, whatever those are. Yeah. Years in the future in the way that like

702
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:03,060
Ben and, Ben and Matt were like, you know, Kevin Smith kind of saved Goodwill Hunting. Well, Kevin

703
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:08,820
Smith and Francis, Francis for Coppola and Robin, they all kind of helped save it. Almost didn't get

704
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:14,020
made. Yeah. Um, I'm realizing now I have to make issue a correction. Uh, it's going to take care of

705
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:19,620
it now. The gentleman, uh, Lawrence Luckin Bill is, uh, married to Lucy's daughter still,

706
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:27,540
and he played Spock's half brother, Sibuk. So before anyone emails and is mad, yes, half brother,

707
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:34,260
not full brother of Spock. So that should take care of that. I think what I would like to see

708
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:40,500
Sorkin wise and we should be so lucky to get this. This is just, this is almost like if Sorkin cloned

709
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:45,860
himself in the 10th clone could do Sorkin's dream that there'd be that many Sorkin's walking around,

710
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:53,140
but like Sorkin, uh, doing a dramatic depiction of anything that's happened to us in the podcast,

711
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:57,780
the ride, you know, that moment right there that like, all right, thanks for listening everybody.

712
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:02,660
Half brother, are you kidding me? You know, if you're going to come in to these episodes and get

713
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:07,300
facts wrong, you make all of us look like fools. You understand that Michael, you're played by a

714
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:13,460
much shorter actor. That guy doesn't look like Mike at all. And our characters have sex.

715
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:21,620
We're too riled up. Uh, frankly, I've found many inaccuracies in some of the things you said. Are

716
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:26,260
you as hot as I am right now? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mike, can I chew your cock?

717
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:35,060
I don't know where to go from there. I don't know. I don't know either.

718
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:41,780
They condense, uh, uh, Mike getting, getting, uh, sunscreen in his eye and Scott getting a, um,

719
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:48,340
bug infested, Nimgaloo and me accidentally using my dad's, um, uh, Lowry rewards.

720
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:50,980
Oh yeah. That all happened in one long weekend.

721
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:56,500
Oh wow. Yeah. That's such a great deal. Oh, I remember that week. Oh, sure. I do.

722
01:10:56,500 --> 01:11:00,340
The entire podcast took place in one week. This is what I, that voice I just did is an,

723
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:04,900
is a older actress playing Aaron years in the future. That's right.

724
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:12,740
Just a few years before I divorced Scott, things were, there was a lot of pressure in our marriage

725
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:16,660
plus the whole Lowry's card thing. Yeah, it was a week.

726
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:23,940
I'll say. And he just admitted his desire to chew on Mike's cock.

727
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,300
It also sounds like Chuck E. Cheese doing the voice.

728
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:34,980
Yeah. Or what's the other, the like, yes, it sure does. What? He's not only has so many voices.

729
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:42,580
Who was it? Barbera or Hannah? I have both of them. Yeah. Um, hey, you survived podcast.

730
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:49,620
The second gate. Um, I mean, if this is, this is a guy in a way, a good ad for the movie. Yeah.

731
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:56,740
As fired up as you like Lucy at all or lover or just like this. Maybe, maybe.

732
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:02,980
Primarily, I guess, if you have never had interest in Lucy until you learned that there was something

733
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:08,900
involving Senator Joe McCarthy in her life. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. Most ideal. That's red. Yeah.

734
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:14,580
People are going to be salivating to see this now. Look, it's award season and, uh, you know, the, um,

735
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:21,620
uh, Oscars will be broadcast from area 51 this year. Totally secure environment.

736
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:28,660
Uh-huh. Hosted by the Brent Spiner character from independence day. Sure.

737
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:34,420
With a tentacle around his neck. I assume that's better than most of the jokes I've seen online of

738
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:40,980
like, who's the host of the Oscars in 2021? It's always like, don't you mean Deborah messing?

739
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:52,820
Hey folks, keep it tuned here to podcast the ride. The second gate, uh, where we've always

740
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:59,300
got plenty of cocks to chew on. I mean episodes to listen to. Ah, geez, we better wrap this up.

741
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:05,140
Yeah. I have nothing to say unless Jason wants to say that. Well, no, it's just if he, if it's not

742
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:10,340
too much work, if you put the typewriter corn eating sound effect. Yeah, just great. I do.

743
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:15,780
Anytime you talk. No, just at the end of the day, on the way. Okay. I'll see you. Or you

744
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:23,540
send me the file and I'll see what I can find. All right. And I'll edit it.
