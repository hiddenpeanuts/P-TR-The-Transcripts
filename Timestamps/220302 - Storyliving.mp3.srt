1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the second gate, the only Patreon podcast feed that helps you

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,400
compose the next chapter in the story of your life.

4
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,400
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Mike Carlson.

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,400
Hi, yes, I'm Mike Carlson and I'm a purveyor of stories.

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,400
I feel that stories help shape us and I'm trying to mold.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,400
I'm actually, you know what, I'm going to use a copy off of a Disney website to say

8
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,400
that here at Podcast the Ride, we want to inspire a better world through the power of

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,400
stories.

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,400
And I just want to say that I believe that and you're welcome, everyone.

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,400
Scott Garner, what do you think about stories?

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,400
Welcome to a podcast where you can live your life to the fullest and truly take pride in

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,400
every new episode to come.

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Now, that didn't answer your question about stories.

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,400
And stories, well, I don't know.

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,400
Of course, I'm all about storytelling and I always have been.

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,400
Each episode of the show is a new chapter in a podcast and in our lives.

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,400
And I love, it's my honor to tell stories with you two.

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Thank you.

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,400
I also want to say it's an honor as well, but I also want to say that the stories we

21
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,400
tell and specifically the stories about like Jason eating a hot dog are making the world

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,400
a better place.

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,400
You know, so that's what I like to think of when we're putting it out there.

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,400
We're kind of doing like really great work for the world.

25
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:49,400
I don't want to call our storytelling legendary, but you know, how else do you, I'm just

26
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,400
vocalizing what I'm sure our listeners are always thinking.

27
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Yeah, that's true.

28
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Yeah.

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,400
When we told the story about the Jason running off of the Mark Twain to get that Sunday,

30
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,400
you know, I think people like it kind of made the world better.

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Yeah.

32
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,400
And if we offered some sort of like apartment complex or like housing neighborhood, imagine

33
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,400
if we could infuse those stories of last minute ice cream, like Indiana Jones reaching back

34
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,400
for his hat as the temple wall comes down.

35
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Well, you know what I was thinking?

36
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Cause we're going to, we're talking about story living today.

37
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,400
The new, the new future boondoggle that Disney's planning.

38
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,400
Disney's newest endeavor that'll make you say what the hell is happening.

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
But they'll eventually abandon.

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,400
There's a lot of them going right now.

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Yes.

42
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,400
And story, they have whittled down the list of magic wishes, dreams.

43
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,400
They've whittled down the list of seven words to one recently.

44
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,400
It's all about story and I'm, I can't get, I'm not sick of it.

45
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
Well, they didn't get their story Jones.

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Cause that spaceship earth got canceled and that was all about storytelling.

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Right.

48
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Yeah.

49
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,400
How are we going to get story?

50
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,400
So what you're saying is the spirit of storytelling is on the loose and wreaking havoc.

51
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
They're trying to capture it.

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,400
That's why they have to like figure out all of these bases, these communities to trap

53
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,400
it in front of contain it, contain the madness.

54
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Sure.

55
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Lake Buena Vista to Kissimmee St. Cloud to Lake Nona.

56
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
It's ping pong around Florida.

57
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Soon to come to a neighborhood near you starting in the Coachella Valley of California.

58
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
Yeah.

59
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
They build a lake for this thing.

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
We got to dig our own lake.

61
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,400
It's taking over every lake we already have.

62
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Look, all I know is that so many great stories begin with either the phrase I'm building

63
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,400
a community in the desert or I'm starting a major construction park project in the state

64
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
of California.

65
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Those are always, you know, it's going to work out when you hear those at the top.

66
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
The most beautiful stories there are.

67
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
Yeah.

68
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,400
The Manson family and the big short.

69
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
That's right.

70
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,400
We at the Manson family, storytelling is at the heart of everything we do.

71
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,400
I'd also like to add that zibidizopdab, zibidizopdabadaboo.

72
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
Beautiful, Charlie.

73
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
Yeah, it's okay.

74
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
So yeah, if you, you don't know what we're talking about.

75
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Then congratulations.

76
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
Congratulations.

77
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
You avoided the discourse.

78
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,400
But Disney is like they've tried and done many times building a place for you to live.

79
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,400
There's some annoying terminology where it's like people that want to, what is it?

80
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
I'm sorry, I'm missing it.

81
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Jason, do you have it?

82
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,400
Like people that want to like live more Disney or something.

83
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
There's some sort of phrase like that.

84
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
More elements of Disney in their life.

85
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Like the magic, the Disney magic.

86
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
They want more Disney in their life.

87
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,400
They can come here and live in this new, like fresh, I don't know, vibrant community.

88
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,400
A place that forever inspires you to add wonderful new passages to your story.

89
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Who's brain has ever functioned like this?

90
00:04:49,400 --> 00:05:01,400
By the way, we're a podcast of three people who are, something wrong with us clinically as far as like the amount of obsession we have of the different topics we talk about and obsess over.

91
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400
And this is too much, folks.

92
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
This is too much for us.

93
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Because what is it?

94
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
It's also nothing, too.

95
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
It's nothing.

96
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:20,400
You watch the video that was posted and it's not like, okay, I wouldn't like to live in a place where Mickey and Tweedledum and Tweedledee are hanging around all the time.

97
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
That doesn't sound good.

98
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,400
But that's what I guess Disney magic is.

99
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
It's like a play there, look, it's them.

100
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,400
And this thing's shaped like a mountain.

101
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:40,400
But this is just a fine looking aesthetic for not elder living community.

102
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
But there is an assortment.

103
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
There will be a part of that.

104
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Maybe, but it's not all of it.

105
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
It's just housing development.

106
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,400
It's all of this run around to say, we're doing houses now.

107
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:03,400
It is the same language you would use when you're opening up an e-ticket ride to just talk about strip mall and a couple houses and some condos.

108
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:12,400
It's using the same flowery language that at least works when you're talking about a theme park or when you're talking about meeting a princess or something.

109
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Master plans community is the term.

110
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:21,400
This is like the wonderful stories you'll make when you get a burrito bowl at the Chipotle.

111
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:29,400
That's really what there'll be a Chipotle on site that you can walk to in front of our beautiful manmade lake.

112
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Which fine, do it.

113
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,400
But let's not dress this up more than it is.

114
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,400
No, it's just here's a looping image on their website of a couple.

115
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,400
It's gauzy and they're clinking glasses.

116
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
That's my takeaway.

117
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,400
They're building a place that can contain all the glass clinking that anyone could ever dream of.

118
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,400
You will be cheersing every couple hours at this place.

119
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
There will be a reason to cheer.

120
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
You'll bring that glass.

121
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,400
You'll have a champagne flute as you walk around town, cheersing your neighbors.

122
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
They're going to monitor you.

123
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,400
There's going to be a quota you have to fill every day.

124
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,400
If you haven't cheersed in a few hours, you got to make sure you do it.

125
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
They listen for clinks.

126
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,400
It's like the way that our phones monitor our steps.

127
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
However, that is tracked.

128
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,400
It's five clinks per day, if not more.

129
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Hopefully in your sleep.

130
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,400
Hopefully you wake up from a sound sleep at three in the morning, walk into the front of your house and clink glasses with somebody and then go back to bed.

131
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,400
And then somebody will knock on your door if you don't do it.

132
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,400
Somebody will be like, we've noticed.

133
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
We've noticed you have it.

134
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Are you OK in here?

135
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Grab a glass, sir.

136
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,400
It'll be a cast member because in the language of this place, they make it known that cast members are working here.

137
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:50,400
So using the same language from a theme park to describe, I don't know, the people that are like changing towels at the pool.

138
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
Will there be the whole company they call?

139
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
They call every employee a cast member.

140
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,400
There's also a giant asterisk next to those mentions.

141
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,400
And then I think like elsewhere they mentioned like and select third party vendors.

142
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
Oh, you know, that'll be like the.

143
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,400
The Citizen app secret police that they hire to monitor.

144
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Yeah, yeah.

145
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,400
Peter Steele's, is that right?

146
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,400
He's the guy behind Citizen, that app where you just.

147
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
Yeah, yeah.

148
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,400
The app where people go insane, where it's like, oh, what if Nextdoor was more insane?

149
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Yeah.

150
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:31,400
And in case you know what I'm talking about, there was like a plan to like literally like privatize a police force using the Citizen app, which I believe has been scrapped for now.

151
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:41,400
But that sounds like you were going to be able to like pay a fee for the secret Citizen police, which really sounds like bleak dystopia.

152
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:47,400
We're like, I have the better police or not the better police, the scarier police.

153
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Yeah, I mean, there's already facial recognition companies where, you know, whatever their initial intended, the technology was meant to be used for.

154
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:04,400
They've already started like selling it to police departments and the military and God knows what other sinister organizations.

155
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
Yeah, the Walt Disney Corporation.

156
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
I recognize your face.

157
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Soon, yeah, Mickey will recognize your face.

158
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
You'll think it's great.

159
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
He greeted me.

160
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Scott Gardner.

161
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Wow, knows my name.

162
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,400
You got a B minus in chemistry in high school.

163
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
I know everything about you.

164
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:35,400
I could have monitored every traffic can type blood type every red light you've run a negative.

165
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,400
Let's just like to get it out of their language just for us just to be clear.

166
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,400
And if you miss this announcement, yes, story living by Disney is this new venture.

167
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:52,400
I have to go to another website to get somebody to put it in plain English, just arbitrarily architectural digest wrote it up.

168
00:09:52,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Super fans can now call Disney home by buying an estate condominium or single family home within the one of the companies story living by Disney communities.

169
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,400
So they're going to be building developments across the country across the world.

170
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
I'm not totally sure.

171
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Yeah, so they're just like they want to they don't have enough and they want more.

172
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,400
They don't own enough land on the earth.

173
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
Yet all come.

174
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,400
Congratulations on describing all modern companies.

175
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
I understand that.

176
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
I mean, that is what all companies want.

177
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,400
They want more.

178
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,400
That is a descriptor of a company.

179
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
They want more.

180
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Disney presents capitalism.

181
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
That's true.

182
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
You're right.

183
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
More actively.

184
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Yes.

185
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,400
What if we get rid of the rides and the characters and the stuff?

186
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Yeah.

187
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Do you still is there enough left if it's just kind of generally we're going to say the words we're going to say magic and dreaming stories.

188
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,400
So that do you want to buy land from us now?

189
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Right now, if they were building like a theme park in the middle of the desert, then maybe we go, well, this is what they do.

190
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
They make theme parks.

191
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
So maybe we would be more OK.

192
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,400
But like this is like we would like to own where people live now.

193
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:10,400
We would like to use the nostalgia and the fun of the park like that because that's really what they're trying to do with all this language.

194
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:18,400
They're trying to manipulate you and to say like going, oh, I do love Disney because I like the movies, the actual substance of what the company is produced of.

195
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:28,400
The years and they're using it to manipulate people and thinking like I need to live in a house that Disney owns or I need to live on like I need to walk on concrete that they own.

196
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Like they're using that to their advantage to now make people feel like this will make them in the park all the time.

197
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:41,400
But there's not even like it build us a space mountain in there or something like like there's not even that.

198
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:50,400
Yeah, one thing because that used to be part of that that Burbank thing I'm obsessed with where that was going to be essentially a mall and studios.

199
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,400
But there was going to be the great movie writers, going to be a stupid restaurant with a ship teetering off the freeway.

200
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Yeah, they were still going to do the stuff, but that's not the vibe in 2022.

201
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,400
The vibe is boring and and generic music and.

202
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,400
You got it.

203
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Things that all that Disney stuff's too too cartoonish.

204
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,400
We don't like that. Yeah, I'm going to be like nice looking walls and a lagoon.

205
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Don't forget the lagoon. Hey, we got to talk about the lagoon, which they keep saying will be done with like cutting edge technology with crystal.

206
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Oh, yeah, it's it's a trademark. It's trademark.

207
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,400
I look it up. I went to the website of the thing.

208
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:42,400
If you are not familiar with local oddities of California, there is a place in California called the Salton Sea, which is what it sounds like.

209
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:48,400
It was an inland salt lake from like runoff from elsewhere.

210
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,400
Basically, developers tried to make this a vacation destination in the 50s and 60s.

211
00:12:53,400 --> 00:13:00,400
And for a little while it worked like people would come movie stars would come and they would have vacation homes until.

212
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:13,400
The environment of the desert said no, and the water started to essentially rot and kill all the fish.

213
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:20,400
And now it's an ecological disaster site filled with like empty shells of buildings that stinks.

214
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Right. Yeah. Urban explorers kind of go there, but it looks so little.

215
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Yeah, which is not far from it is this what they're planning to build.

216
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Yeah, this is in the I think this is in like this is around a bunch of like ritzy houses in the desert.

217
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Also, like this is in a different spot that's already sort of like a yes, not your know, it's surrounded by developments all around.

218
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,400
And it's just you know, we can we could step through kind of the video they put out and stuff like.

219
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:58,400
But just to say this, the specific one that they've announced that they haven't broken ground on, but that they own the land and they're planning to do something.

220
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,400
It's in Rancho Mirage, which is near Palm Springs. It's in that general area.

221
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Right. And it's called Cotino. So that is that's the specific.

222
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,400
So they're there. This is all Disney building a big Palm Springs development ultimately.

223
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,400
Yeah. More and more. But so it's all in C. Right. They're kind of near all that.

224
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Yeah, it's all kind of in the general area. Cotino, a takeoff on the scientific term for Cotino's Cotigri, Cotigria,

225
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:32,400
which is basically the scientific term for the the the smoke tree plant.

226
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:43,400
And so this is a reference inside a reference. The smoke tree ranch was Walt's Palm Springs Ranch that he would that you can now vacation out.

227
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:56,400
If you go to the statue in Disneyland, the partner statue, you can see the symbol on his tie is the smoke tree ranch like the Illuminati esque symbol, which is all over that ranch.

228
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,400
You can go see it. Yeah, I had no idea there was that symbol.

229
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,400
And apparently he wore a tie and a lot of the specials with this insignia.

230
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:13,400
That's the letters of the S.T.R. It almost I I'm almost like, did they implant this?

231
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Did this not exist until they had this plan like found this property like like Hans Dice?

232
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Oh, just added Dyson last Jedi. And they're like, you remember it, right?

233
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Is that what I forget? I don't even know about the dice. Yeah. They suddenly put Dyson.

234
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,400
Yeah, they just added the Dyson and then kind of acted like that was like something that he always had.

235
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,400
OK, yeah, I think it is like that. I don't believe it was on the partner statue.

236
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:47,400
I need proof. I need a photo from at least two years ago.

237
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Yeah, this was always the plan. But yeah, that's how they end up justifying.

238
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,400
Why are we and how that they need to look Disney build whatever you're going to build, do whatever you do.

239
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,400
But this is where it really as I'm watching the promotional video they put out,

240
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,400
the where I really started rolling my eyes that like in our first stop will be the Coachella Valley,

241
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,400
a land that Walt loved. It was a place that allowed him to escape and to dream.

242
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:17,400
Yeah, of course. All right. OK, somebody some intern go find two photos of Walt in the desert.

243
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,400
There's got to be a go find him on a burrow or something.

244
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,400
I like we all famously, of course, Smoke Tree Ranch.

245
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,400
We know it. We all know it. We've all always known it.

246
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Walt, there's no place more associated with Walt than the Coachella Valley.

247
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Of course, this is all feels fake. I think everybody is fake.

248
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,400
They made it all up. He loves seeing future islands at Coachella every year.

249
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,400
And he would go to the festival. Yeah, that's what most people associate Coachella with.

250
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Now you go see the big outdoor music festival and 100 degree weather and everyone's on drugs.

251
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,400
Walt, it was Walt. He loved it. Allowed him to dream.

252
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,400
I mean, everyone went to Palm Springs. Every rich person went to Palm Springs back then.

253
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
Yes, it wasn't like the streets.

254
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,400
The property is on is like the other rich guys.

255
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,400
I think it's at the corner of Bob Hope and Gerald Ford.

256
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,400
So literally two other old guy names on this Walt property.

257
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
So this is Rancho Mirage.

258
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:24,400
This is like one of the last undeveloped, like empty pieces of property they were saying in Rancho Mirage.

259
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Seemingly. Yeah, it is. It really stands out if you look at it on a map.

260
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,400
It is this just big block of sand. It's kind of weird.

261
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,400
Here, let me see. Let me see if I can do my little demonstration. I was going to do.

262
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Maybe I can't. Well, the you talk about like we'd be excited if they were building a park or something.

263
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,400
I can't get it done, but I compared these things side by side.

264
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:58,400
This is I'm showing you the land that Cortino is going to be on like top to bottom like like north south.

265
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:06,400
It is the exact height of the height probably isn't the word, but that's like as as long as the Disneyland property.

266
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:16,400
So you could fit all of the Disneyland property on here, including the parking garages and then have room for another sliver to add that other side of the street with the parking garages again.

267
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:24,400
And then there would still be more left. So imagine like a lot Disneyland and two sets of Mickey and Friends and Pixar and hotels and all that.

268
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Yeah, yeah. And then still a little bit more room. So this is a tight. It's like what is it? I think it's one hundred and sixty eight acres.

269
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:45,400
It's pretty pretty ginormous. Now there will be public areas like one of the web, one of the pages on the website or one of the blogs picked up on like I don't know if it was a pitch deck or like just a set of photos of like this vibe we're going for.

270
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:53,400
And they had photos of the boardwalk resort at Disney World. That's cool. Like, yeah, you can just go to the boardwalk at any time.

271
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Anyone can go there. You walk around, eat the restaurants, you know, see the little acts and stuff that I get. Yeah.

272
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Or like, I mean, there's a lot of these sorts of properties in Los Angeles and there's there's stuff going on.

273
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,400
And, you know, besides the absurd parking fees and garages.

274
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Well, hopefully it's like the wonderful worlds built for us by our future mayor Rick Caruso.

275
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Hopefully it's somewhat of the vibe of the Grove and the Americana and these places that are our eventual master has been deigned to give us.

276
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Yeah, it's it's I mean, it's just funny. I mean, Disney doing this is funny because there's a long history starting with Epcot, which of course Epcot was supposed to be an experimental prototype city of tomorrow with like Walt being the emperor of it.

277
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:54,400
And there was he had future some good ideas for it, some very bad ideas for it.

278
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Obviously, when he died, they didn't do it, but they did it with celebration and then abandoned it.

279
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:08,400
Basically now Golden Oak is that the newest one? Yeah. And I think they're all sold. Okay. Is that is it started or no? Golden Oak. Yeah. Million dollar homes.

280
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,400
That's been going for a while. Okay. So that there's that does exist something like this already. That's the that's the area north of Disney World a little bit.

281
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:27,400
Yes. These crazy McMansions. It's like they Jason to how is it the Four Seasons or the Ritz? Like one of the things is you get to use the amenities at the nice hotel next door.

282
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:35,400
I didn't even know there was that there. There was that level of fancy hotel. Now without here's the what is their connection to that?

283
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Do they fully own it or is it one of these were like they're hedging their bets and it's kind of us, but we don't do these nitty gritty parts.

284
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:50,400
Okay. So this is under the umbrella, seemingly of of experience Disney signature. What is it called?

285
00:20:50,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Yes, experience. It's like tomorrow is quoted. Mr. Tomorrow Daddy tomorrow as I call him is quoted. Yeah. So this is like respectful. I call him Zaddy. I really think you should.

286
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:12,400
You should take it a little further. I apologize. Disney signature experiences, which is the umbrella of the features of vacation club, Golden Oak, the cruise line, Alani.

287
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:24,400
That all kind of falls under that as opposed to like the theme parks, which falls elsewhere nowadays. But imagineering, you know, kind of works with a lot of it.

288
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:37,400
With a lot of it still involved in all this. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe we should let the man himself speak a little bit. Let me just play a little snippet of of Zaddy.

289
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:44,400
Let's we always want to let Zaddy talk. Let's just like I'm just going to let I don't know where to end this exactly.

290
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:53,400
But like let's let him very coherently explain the general idea of what is going on here.

291
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Disney has shared stories that have touched the hearts and minds of people around the world for nearly 100 years.

292
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:10,400
At Disney parks, experiences and products are jobs to turn dreams and stories into reality, into something that you can touch, taste and smell, something you can feel and experience and share with those you love.

293
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Disney experiences are magical because they start with great storytelling. They include quality that is unmatched anywhere in our industry.

294
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Of course, they're brought to life by our world class Disney cast members. And every time we reach a new horizon, we start to dream a little bigger and we look for new ways to tell our stories.

295
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:35,400
OK, we've all watched a lot of hours of shit like this. This is one of the most content free runs of ever.

296
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:43,400
Nothing. And imagery. Nothing like it's kids are hugging Pluto and a baby's blowing a bubble and slow motion running.

297
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,400
I what it's all just kind of like, all right, tell us what the what's the scam, bud?

298
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Do it. Spit it out. So I guess so. I guess this is experiences.

299
00:22:52,400 --> 00:23:02,400
This is this is all in one department now. Parks. We know parks. We know. I guess this is experiences, but it's also a lot of subcontractors involved as well.

300
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:12,400
What is what story are you? What is the story? Is there like a Disney Springs style or a downtown Disney like Pleasure Island story?

301
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:22,400
The way they. Yes, that's the that's what we like. It's a crazy old sea captain and he had an idea to get with the Bang Master and convert the fireworks factory.

302
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,400
This I can. It's all inane and crazy. But yes, what is the story of Cotino?

303
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:40,400
Right. The answer is, well, Walt once used to know. No, not a story. Yeah, not a story. Yeah, we need a fantastical story like the wall was a guy in Hollywood in the 50s who liked to go to Palm Springs.

304
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,400
Oh, really? Interesting. It just never told the story. Never heard this before.

305
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:51,400
Well, and you know, of course, he got that polo injury and he kind of had to change his leisure activities.

306
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,400
Right. Will you? Will they have a simulate like simulate how Walt got his polo?

307
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:06,400
We haven't talked enough about Walt's polo injury on this show. I believe that cover for in the narrative that does that lead to the theme parks?

308
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,400
Because then he starts tinkering with his little backyard trains and then eventually bigger and bigger.

309
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,400
That's a question. Without his polo. All right. Well, that's an episode to follow. Walt's polo injury.

310
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,400
And the polo grounds. Maybe put that on the next one we do. Yeah, that sounds fine. Yeah.

311
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,400
The polo grounds in the Coachella Valley, I think, are now where the Coachella Music Festival is.

312
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:36,400
That's right. Yeah. Well, he'd be really upset that all these young people are tripping and vomiting all over his beloved polo grounds.

313
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,400
He would have been mad that the old Coachella happened that we went to five years ago. He would have thought those youngsters.

314
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:48,400
Yeah, these long hairs. Yeah. The Rolling Stones. I kind of recall seeing hearing that name before I died.

315
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:55,400
Yeah, he cursed them out on his day. He said Kurt Russell and then he said, fuck the Rolling Stones as he died.

316
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,400
Send the assassination squad for Mark Jagger.

317
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:11,400
The Smithers have the Rolling Stones killed. Yeah. So there's no story. Is Pluto hanging out in here even?

318
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:18,400
Well, he's in the stock footage. I know. But so does that indicate that Pluto will be walking around?

319
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Is he Pluto, your mailman? Well, at least that's something.

320
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:28,400
I think in the first six months there will be characters and there will be activities.

321
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:37,400
What? You do? I think it tapers way down. I think it tapers way off because what they showed they were not good at with Celebration

322
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:42,400
and sometimes they're not good at with the parks is just upkeep. You got to keep doing this.

323
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,400
Like even slow seasons, you have to have shows and you have to stuff going on.

324
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,400
And they're just they don't have an interest in upkeep. Yeah, I don't know.

325
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,400
The Golden Oak thing, I guess. How long has been going? Couple of years now. A few years.

326
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:03,400
But the people there, it's all seven million dollars. That's just a very expensive, very, very expensive, which I think this is going to be very expensive too.

327
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Maybe less expensive than that. I think it will be less expensive because it's not at Disney World.

328
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:18,400
But I'm surprised we haven't said this phrase yet. The construction partner, DMB Development, a new boring company name for us up there with King Features.

329
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:27,400
Dave Matthews Band Development. I wish he was involved. She wakes up in Cortino.

330
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:36,400
If you look up, they're based in Arizona. If you look up other properties they have built, these are million dollar homes, million dollar condos.

331
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Yeah, this can be expensive. Yeah, it's going to be expensive.

332
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Hey, let's check in. If you search if you search DMB Development controversy, you get to learn that the former president of DMB Associates, which I guess is their old name,

333
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:03,400
DMB Associates, DMB Development, all kind of leads, all roads lead to Rome. So I don't know whatever crazy scheme they're doing with the names.

334
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:10,400
Karen Taylor Robson, currently running for the Republican nomination for governor of Arizona.

335
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,400
That can't be a good person to be in that position.

336
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:30,400
Taylor Robinson's campaign website highlights the issues she views as most important, including border security, election integrity, opposing abortion, and supporting veterans.

337
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:40,400
So the usual Republican gibberish is the usual culture war nonsense and lip service to veterans without improving their lives in any meaningful way.

338
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Small asterisk takes you to the bottom of the site. And by veterans, I mean cyber ninjas. We have to support the cyber ninjas who are auditing our election.

339
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:56,400
Even though they didn't find anything, they're going to try again and again. And even if they never find it, we know 2020, it was so rigged for us.

340
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Are there any pictures of her with Mike Lindell anywhere on the website?

341
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,400
I have to think. There will be before the end of this.

342
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,400
Yeah, there will be. That's an endorsement.

343
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Will Mike Lindell have a house here?

344
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:19,400
Look, I didn't expect the former president of a company that builds million dollar homes to be necessarily a good person.

345
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:28,400
But like, you got to think that company's like, oh God, could she? Does she have to do this? And why does every article say former president of us?

346
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,400
I don't know. They might be.

347
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

348
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,400
I'm sure a lot of the people are on board.

349
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:45,400
I'm sure a lot of the residents, the initial buyers were like, oh yeah, come to Katino, live next to, you know, used car lot dealership owners and ill fitting let's go branded shirts.

350
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,400
You know, I was going to say this early.

351
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,400
They should have gone all the way. It's Katino, but they may as well have just called it.

352
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:02,400
There's a lot of ideas I have for this place that we should get to the end, but they may as well have just called it Kamino, the name of the clone planet in Star Wars Attack of the Clones.

353
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:08,400
It's so close. Got the O at the end. Kamino is that rainy plant. It's obviously the opposite of the desert.

354
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:14,400
But why not use some Star Wars IP at this point to at least like dress it up a bit?

355
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:21,400
Well, and if you go with the Star Wars vibe, then you only have to build like four huts and leave the rest as sand.

356
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
That's a good point.

357
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
Exactly.

358
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,400
If you want to live, it'll be even more authentic than the Star Cruiser.

359
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:33,400
Like you could just live in Ray's little like tent and then you go get quarter portions every day.

360
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:39,400
And at least you're at least we would go like, you know, this looks like it would be a miserable place to live, but at least it's themed.

361
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,400
I live in where they live in a replica of where Anakin's mom got killed.

362
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:50,400
Right. Yes. And then there'll be like, there'll be just sort of a desert patch like on the new on Boba Fett.

363
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Now they have there's a lot of like Tusken Raider content where you just see where the Tusken Raiders live in the middle of nowhere out on Tatooine.

364
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:04,400
So yeah, there'll be a whole at least. Is it nice? Spoiler alert, Scott, it's not.

365
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:09,400
It doesn't look like Cotino. It doesn't look like Crystal Lagoon.

366
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:17,400
Giant screens, those giant screen sets to build the middle of nowhere, to digitally build the middle of nowhere.

367
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:28,400
That's what Cotino is going to be. Wow. It's so spacious. And as long as you don't bump into the wall, that does sound like the sort of thing that Karen Taylor Robinson would be like.

368
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,400
And we've got to investigate this flat earth thing. You know, we've got to look at.

369
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Where is it a hollow earth? I saw Godzilla versus Kong could be a hollow earth.

370
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,400
A lot of creatures. Can I give some advice to somebody?

371
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:54,400
If you're looking to like do a Disney, like if you want to live more Disney, like go to a place where the houses aren't that expensive with like a big basement and like make a weird, crazy themed basement like that.

372
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,400
You know what I mean? Like live, like make it whatever movie you like.

373
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Like I've seen you've seen the videos where like the Star Trek dentists make it like make his office into like the bridge of the enterprise or it looks like a shuttle bay or whatever.

374
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:13,400
Like that's living your fantasy. Yeah. Do that. Just do it in wherever.

375
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Like I don't know why. Like you're getting true. Don't get tricked.

376
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:25,400
It's probably some fine homes across this country that where people have done weird Disney recreations.

377
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:31,400
Yes, there of course are. And we I mean, we've talked about on the show. We want to have a weird room.

378
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,400
We're living in the wrong city to do it, to have a house like that.

379
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:42,400
Yeah, yeah. Well, we're like we could only dream of an amount of rooms that can fit the people who we live with. Right.

380
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:52,400
We don't have space for a crazy room. Right. That when like you die and the police come in and they're like, oh boy, this guy.

381
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,400
There was this room. There was this room.

382
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,400
There's a lot of Etsy receipts in here. A lot of Etsy receipts for furnishings.

383
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:14,400
Yeah. Yeah. A place that you show off to guests and they're so off put by the amount of detail in it that they don't come over again, even though it's impressive visually.

384
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:20,400
They're just like, OK, stay out of that room. This is the went once. We don't have to do it again.

385
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:27,400
This is exactly like Captain Picard's quarters on the NCC 1701. Oh my God.

386
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:33,400
He made his he made a room in his house look like what the what's Captain EO again.

387
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:39,400
And he knows about all the stuff. Right. And he still made his house look partially like Captain.

388
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:44,400
I know he says he cared. He likes Major and Minor Domo more than he likes whoever the star of it.

389
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:54,400
There's a there's a spot in the attic. And as he makes his wife like hang on a rope and come down from the ceiling wearing this outfit and say, you think me beautiful?

390
00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:07,400
You said it's the only way you can get hard. Yes, Your Majesty. But without the key to unlock it, his last words give any indication of the nature of the crime.

391
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:14,400
It's like, well, no, he he just muttered it wasn't originally Angelica Houston. It was another actor.

392
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:19,400
And he died before he could finish and say the name that was somebody famous. I just learned who that was.

393
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,400
Yeah, it's crazy. It's what is it? Is it a Shelley Long?

394
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:31,400
Yeah, yeah, weird. That's crazy. Well, look, we looked right back around to that. We like this stuff. Oh, yeah.

395
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:39,400
I did. It was a famous person. Well, I just yeah, I just it's crazy to me if you were like way into Disney that you would do that.

396
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:47,400
Obviously, what's going to happen is it's going to be at least at first like probably pretty nice and just rich people will buy houses there.

397
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:54,400
Yeah, I mean, this is Disney's fate. One of their favorite demos nowadays. Yeah, the hyper rich, right, which is where everything is headed.

398
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:05,400
Yeah. Pricing out middle class and lower income families. Well, it's like there are these like between all the resorts and the adventures by Disney and all that.

399
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:15,400
So there for sure are some Disney zones out there that don't really feel Disney. Yeah, right. So this is just the next step of that.

400
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:22,400
Right. Yeah, it's just like this is just this is just how they do things when they announce they have to add all this crap. That doesn't mean anything.

401
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:32,400
There's vacation club properties that are just essentially Disney hotels in Vero Beach. I think the Outer Banks to somewhere along there in the Carolinas.

402
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:38,400
Those are not there's no real like cartoony thing. Well, no, there is. I mean, there are characters, there's pools and stuff.

403
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:50,400
But it's just essentially imagine if you were staying at like the yacht club and yacht and beach club and you just took that away from Epcot and put it on the coast and there's no parks or anything.

404
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:58,400
Yeah, you can use your timeshare points within the company to go stay there. Right. And you can book just like any other hotel, too.

405
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:05,400
But I do wonder, like, how popular are those? Like, I don't know.

406
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:13,400
My I when my family was in the 90s, we were like, why would we go to just a hotel and not the theme park?

407
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:20,400
Like we couldn't. Yeah. I think it was for people who just wanted to go to the beach. Right. You know, but wanted a Disney hotel. Sure.

408
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:29,400
Experience a little bit of Disney. Yeah, I mean, I'm just yeah, I'm saying as much as we're making fun of all this, it's just like this is just has this is how they have to press release.

409
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:36,400
And I would I mean, maybe there'll be like an insane Disney super fan. But if you're a crazy Disney super fan, why don't you just go live in Anaheim?

410
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:46,400
Like, why would you live in the middle of the desert hours away from Anaheim? Yeah, there's a because there's no there's probably nice houses around there.

411
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,400
Well, there's the Anaheim Hills if you're richer. Yeah.

412
00:35:50,400 --> 00:36:00,400
There was a video restored video someone uploaded recently of the, you know, a six minute promotional video for the Disney Institute.

413
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:07,400
And it's got all that like 90s stuff you you like the kind of 90s editing that John T. Disney 90s music.

414
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:13,400
But like, it's clear what's going on. Like, they explain what the Disney Institute is.

415
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,400
It is essentially like, yeah, vacation. You're on vacation, but you want to take some classes.

416
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,400
Maybe you want to work on your tennis swing. Maybe you want to see how TV shows are made.

417
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Maybe you want to do some cooking classes with your your spouse.

418
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,400
I can I don't want to do one thing in that list. But yes, they explain it.

419
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:36,400
But like you can explain it in six minutes. It's like, yeah, it's it's a adult education.

420
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,400
You know, it's a lark. You know, it's it makes sense is what I'm saying.

421
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Yeah, no, this is one of these big word soupy things.

422
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,400
And it's yeah, world class service and legendary storytelling.

423
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,400
But then that leads into there's this there's a shot in it.

424
00:36:53,400 --> 00:37:04,400
This video of like a grandmother with her grandkid pouring water on a tomato five straight seconds, not into the soil, but on top of the tomato.

425
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,400
And if that's you washing the tomato, when you take it inside, where are we using the is it a loose tomato?

426
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,400
Yeah, like she picked a tomato out of the ground and she's pouring a bunch of water out of it.

427
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,400
And they cut out of the watering can. She's about to take a big bite of it.

428
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,400
Is that a bite? I don't know. I think I'm making this up, but I'm pretty sure this is just a long.

429
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,400
You I'm just saying, I made a shot. Does it seem like she's longingly looking at the tomato?

430
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:32,400
Like she's like, I want to take a big bite of this thing. No, she and her granddaughter, whoever it is, are laughing.

431
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,400
This is fun to that. This is I mean, kind of what they hear.

432
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:43,400
Let me just play like what happens once they say that it's Katina and that like maybe this would be fifty five and up aimed.

433
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,400
Let's see. We're clinking glasses.

434
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,400
You know, here this is just pen. This is Avatar.

435
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,400
They're showing the drone again, unfocused in what.

436
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,400
But now it'll be like, hey, good yoga today. Wow.

437
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:02,400
Look at this vase. Maybe I'll buy it. Oh, look, you brought strawberries over.

438
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,400
Here's the tomato. Wow.

439
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:11,400
In the bright hue of the sun, let's pour as much water and then clinking glasses.

440
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Let's clink. And then a dog's got a tennis ball in its mouth.

441
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,400
What is it? What if you're so about storytelling and what story is it?

442
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,400
What is it? These are unrelated. This is an abstract film you've made.

443
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,400
This is a you did this to a bunch of like caustic noise rock.

444
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,400
Then it would be, boy, that was one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen.

445
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,400
They've well, they didn't say they bought.

446
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,400
They bought the rights to George Lucas's experimental films he's been making in his garage.

447
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
And that's what the stories are.

448
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,400
They're just formed like shapeless and formless and experimental stories.

449
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,400
Is anyone going to get to see them? No, only Charlie Rose.

450
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,400
No, you could just don't do anything bad. I'll show them to you.

451
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,400
All right. Bleed your chance, Charlie.

452
00:38:53,400 --> 00:39:01,400
Anyway, you also get to meet as a guy, another as a new guy who talks to you and then Michael Hundigan.

453
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,400
Here's this like fitted shirt man.

454
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,400
This guy, he looks like he is.

455
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,400
He was bred in a lab that solely produces Harvard Lampoon presidents.

456
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:16,400
It was slick eyebrow fitted man.

457
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,400
And Michael Hundigan says a lot of nothing.

458
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,400
And then Josh Demaro says more nothing.

459
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,400
And then he's now meet one of the people responsible for this exciting development.

460
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,400
And then it goes back to Michael Hundigan.

461
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,400
I met Michael Hundigan. Nothing new to say.

462
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Everyone in this video is doing an interview where they're looking not into the camera, but at an interviewer, but they are reading off of a teleprompter.

463
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,400
It's not an interview just because you don't look in the camera lens.

464
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,400
The most scripted thing I've ever seen.

465
00:39:45,400 --> 00:40:04,400
There. Yeah, I mean, I get I get that on some level corporations have to pretend because the true answer to like what is this is like Disney sees a big opportunity to make a lot of money by buying up land across the world and just completely like expanding and owning more pieces of the world.

466
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
Like they're not going to say that.

467
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:14,400
But couldn't they have made something up better? Couldn't they have made like some explanation better or like or just don't do any of you know what?

468
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,400
Because, you know, who cares? Like the Americana, but the Americana was never couched in.

469
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,400
We want to transport you to put no, it's just like a funny place to the big.

470
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,400
They'll look as a big tower and trolley goes through it and fountain.

471
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:36,400
Yeah, they never nobody tried to convince me that all the passages in my life are going to happen at the Americana, even though they have is what has happened.

472
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,400
Little clearer to just say outdoor mall next to indoor malls.

473
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,400
The walkway. Yes.

474
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:52,400
Well, I can ask. Look, Disney, just say you want to make because I bet we probably would with this got built walk around to Cotino town center and opening weekend.

475
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,400
Of course.

476
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,400
I mean, we're going to buy. We will be asked to leave.

477
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
Oh, you three.

478
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:08,400
There is one aspect of this and I look I don't want to be the ghoul bringing this up, but they're saying that this is going to be done maybe in like 2040.

479
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,400
You imagine how hot it is going to be.

480
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,400
Oh, yeah.

481
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,400
2040. How what?

482
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:22,400
Deep in a website. I say it could be wrong, but I definitely saw that referred to either way, even if it's not that far off like this place here.

483
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,400
It'll be hotter next year. Oh my God.

484
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,400
2040.

485
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,400
There are some bad contractors in California, but you don't usually start by assuming like we're going to have the worst contractors.

486
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,400
So we wouldn't set expectations.

487
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,400
That's why I saw it somewhere.

488
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,400
A little too far. Maybe that's all phases.

489
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
Maybe it's totally completed.

490
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,400
Yeah, I mean, it is a lot of acres.

491
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,400
Again, that is like bigger than Disneyland by a lot and how long it took all of Disneyland to develop.

492
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,400
Yeah, maybe that's correct.

493
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:58,400
Are you sure it didn't read Disney plans to abandon the casino by 2040?

494
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,400
Yeah, that's probably right.

495
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,400
Disney plans to let it rot.

496
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:18,400
Well, they may also be penciling in some economic declines because like reading about some of the other DMV developments, like we've started construction on this development in 2006 and then the housing bubble immediately burst.

497
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,400
So like they had a, I don't know, a shopping center on a road with nothing else on it.

498
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,400
Like they got the shopping center done and they got like a house done.

499
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:47,400
But it's just like they had to essentially subsidize the supermarket while the housing market recovered so that when people did start buying homes and they got completed the construction and people moved in, there would be the mixed use that they had advertised.

500
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,400
Well, the economy seems fine now.

501
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,400
Yeah, everything's fine.

502
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,400
Everything's going great.

503
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,400
Everything's fine.

504
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,400
We're recording this the end of February and everything in the world looks great.

505
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,400
Everything feels pretty solid.

506
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,400
Everything feels wonderful.

507
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,400
February 25th, baby, 2022.

508
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,400
New Batman movie coming.

509
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
How about that?

510
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
Oh yeah, it is coming out.

511
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
Pretty good.

512
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,400
Oh boy, it seems like Paul Dano really took himself to the brink.

513
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,400
He took himself to the brink.

514
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,400
He almost died.

515
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,400
I only want Batman.

516
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:23,400
I only want Batman villains and actors to play Batman villains who do serious permanent damage to themselves.

517
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,400
Yes, that's it.

518
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,400
To play a guy who once was played by like a guy who smoked cigarettes in Musso and Frank's.

519
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,400
Well, you know what Jajago Borges said when she played Miss Minerva on the old 60s Batman show.

520
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,400
She was in a day spa.

521
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:43,400
She stayed in a day spa for three months and only subsisted on the steam in the steam room.

522
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,400
So because she really wanted to live the character of Miss Minerva who owned the evil day spa.

523
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,400
So it's just a long tradition is what I'm saying of actors punching themselves.

524
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,400
Yes.

525
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,400
Egghead got scurvy.

526
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,400
Was only eating eggs.

527
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,400
Vincent Price famously eating only eggs for weeks.

528
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,400
But eat some orange juice with them.

529
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,400
Have some citrus.

530
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,400
Sounds like Gaston from The Miner, Big and Strong.

531
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,400
That should be good for you.

532
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,400
Liberace, what did he do?

533
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,400
Who was he again?

534
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,400
The Great Chandel, of course.

535
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,400
And he played his evil twin brother, the mobster.

536
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:23,400
And yeah, he lives, you know, he lived on the streets for three years to prepare for that.

537
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,400
You're fucking dead.

538
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,400
He seduced.

539
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,400
Give me your money.

540
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,400
And Chandel seduced Aunt Harriet is also what happened on that episode.

541
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,400
I don't think they had sex.

542
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,400
He had, look, he had a lure.

543
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,400
He absolutely did.

544
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,400
The older ladies.

545
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,400
Yes.

546
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,400
Yes.

547
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,400
It might not have been his persuasion, but my goodness, this man was just as popular

548
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,400
with the Aunt Harriet types, I believe.

549
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:53,400
You know, we missed something about the Walt backstory.

550
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:59,400
Walt's famous love of the smoke tree ranch in the Coachella Valley that.

551
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,400
We got the Polo injury, right?

552
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,400
We did get that.

553
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,400
Yeah, we did.

554
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,400
I believe we did cover.

555
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,400
If we didn't, we'll get to it in the full episode.

556
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,400
It was Polo injury.

557
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,400
But I'm so excited.

558
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

559
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,400
We're all daydreaming about that now.

560
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,400
But OK, but key to our story of inspiration.

561
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,400
Here's the this is the story.

562
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,400
The story is Walt and the story of inspiration is the man himself, Walt Disney.

563
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:26,400
Of all the destinations in the world, Walt chose Palm Springs as his favorite special retreat.

564
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,400
As he referred to it, his laughing place.

565
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,400
No, no, no.

566
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,400
In twenty twenty two.

567
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,400
All right, everyone, look up.

568
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,400
Let's let's associate the phrase laughing place as much as we can now.

569
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,400
Did he today?

570
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,400
That's did he first of all, he didn't say that right?

571
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,400
I don't know.

572
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,400
Probably not.

573
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,400
The second of all, yeah.

574
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:53,400
Also, like laughing place, you know, I look I've never seen the film.

575
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,400
I wouldn't care to see the film.

576
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,400
Sure.

577
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,400
But in the context of the ride, the laughing place ends up being a not a good place to go.

578
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,400
That's why would they imagine going to Walt's?

579
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:12,400
Imagine getting tossed into Walt's laughing place is a very good chance that whoever wrote that has no clue about the song with self controversy.

580
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:19,400
Yeah, maybe doesn't know they just they were charmed by the I think maybe there was a piece in like history somewhere where walls like this is my laughing place.

581
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,400
Although he probably said about every place he stayed.

582
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,400
But still, they're like, oh, that sounds funny.

583
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,400
That sounds fun.

584
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,400
And he where there's a can of chili and a cold glass of black and white scotch.

585
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,400
That's his laughing place.

586
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,400
Look, I got to tour his apartment once, you know, that's right.

587
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,400
His toilet was his laughing place in the apartment.

588
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,400
I saw Walt Disney's toilet, by the way, I don't know if we've talked about this enough.

589
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,400
No, actually, I guess we really didn't.

590
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,400
Yeah, I know.

591
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:53,400
It's all been about the, you know, the magic lamp that Zaddy DiMaro taught us about.

592
00:46:53,400 --> 00:47:00,400
But it's the I think the true beacon in the darkest days of COVID was that Walt's toilet would flush again.

593
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,400
Yeah, I was going to ask, is it hooked up? Was there water in it?

594
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,400
Yeah, can you use it?

595
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,400
I believe it could. You could use it.

596
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,400
We were not allowed to use it.

597
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:13,400
But yeah, I got this. I got to I got to see where the magic happened.

598
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,400
Any particular observations about it? Was it an unusual toilet anywhere?

599
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,400
Yeah, we're looking at an American Standard or a Kohler.

600
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,400
You know, I should have taken a note about it.

601
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:28,400
I don't remember what kind it was. It was a very, very small room.

602
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,400
It was not a big area to do it.

603
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:37,400
In general, by the way, there's some magic to, I guess, to that like it's in a bit above the firehouse.

604
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,400
And this is my my little world that I built.

605
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,400
But it's kind of a it's like a well, so a weird place to stay for a while.

606
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,400
This little oh, it's super like living in this garage for a little while.

607
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,400
The apartment is so weird.

608
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,400
It was obviously cool to go up there. And like it feels ghostly.

609
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,400
It feels like haunted because so much of it feels like it's been preserved.

610
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,400
But then you like logistically think about like like living here for a while.

611
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,400
You're like, this is strange.

612
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,400
It would feel like like I'm trying to think of a good example.

613
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,400
It would feel like living on a ride.

614
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,400
It would feel like living in the bed with the pirate on Pirates of the Caribbean or something.

615
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,400
The skeleton scoot over dear. It feels like that scale.

616
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,400
Well, of course, they have two separate beds in there, too.

617
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,400
And Walt Lillian had two separate beds in the Lillian was never there.

618
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,400
That's a hypothetical.

619
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:33,400
But to be honest, he brought his mistress up there like whoever it was, I don't know.

620
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,400
But she ever got. Yeah.

621
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,400
Right. And corrupt.

622
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,400
Walt had a lady in Anaheim. He had a lady out in the desert.

623
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,400
He had a lady.

624
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:46,400
Walt's journeys took him in pursuit of stories in quotes.

625
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,400
What's love of his insatiable love of stories of stories.

626
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,400
He wasn't satisfied to just be part of one story that he committed to.

627
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,400
Right. In front of his friends and family.

628
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,400
He wanted to share his love of stories with everyone.

629
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:06,400
Walt's love of family was so large, he had a second one in the Coachella Valley.

630
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,400
Do you remember? Do you remember on Fox a few years ago?

631
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:27,400
I feel like this was the kind of in the first downturn of like, oh, everyone's watching, you know, good shows start to show up on cable.

632
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,400
People are kind of checking out from broadcast TV.

633
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,400
There was a drama on Fox.

634
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,400
I think it was canceled after two or three episodes about a guy.

635
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,400
The whole premise was like, this guy's got two families.

636
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,400
That's going to be a pain in the ass.

637
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,400
Really? I don't remember this.

638
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,400
And he was living two lives like secret family, secret family.

639
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,400
Yeah. Wow.

640
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,400
No, I don't remember this.

641
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,400
Who was on the show?

642
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,400
I don't. I got to look this up.

643
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,400
I can remember that someone is like just screaming.

644
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,400
It's like they shot five episodes.

645
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,400
They only aired three.

646
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,400
Somebody's a big fan of the secret.

647
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,400
I want to know, is this like the cool secret family man?

648
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,400
Well, that's secret family man.

649
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,400
That's a good parody.

650
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,400
That's what you'd sing to yourself as you're commuting between the family.

651
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:20,400
Well, okay.

652
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:27,400
Another also to file away future episode waltz can get that one done too.

653
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,400
We say all your thoughts.

654
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,400
We'll have to like recreate.

655
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,400
Here's a really gross thought.

656
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,400
Well, we can, one of us can recreate his diet for a week and then we can

657
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,400
figure out what his ball movement might have been like.

658
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,400
I do.

659
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:47,400
You know where I'm, do you guys have denizens chili by the palette?

660
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,400
Great.

661
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,400
And then just, let's see, it's a week.

662
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,400
So nine bottles of scotch.

663
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,400
Yeah.

664
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,400
We're all end up in the hospital in the room.

665
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,400
He died in after a week of eating and drinking like that.

666
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,400
We weren't supposed to live like he lived in December, 1966.

667
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,400
Yeah.

668
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,400
Yeah.

669
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,400
Don't forget the cigarettes.

670
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,400
You got to smoke.

671
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,400
Oh no, nevermind.

672
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,400
I guess I take it back.

673
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,400
Okay.

674
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,400
Smoke like a carton a week.

675
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,400
Canceled after the second episode.

676
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,400
It's called Lone star.

677
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,400
Aired in 2010.

678
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,400
It was about a man who'd lived a double life married to two different

679
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,400
women in two different Texas towns.

680
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,400
Who was married to two different women in two different Texas towns.

681
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,400
I wish Chris Knopf, Kevin Spacey.

682
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,400
Who's left.

683
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,400
Charlie Rose.

684
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,400
Charlie Rose stars on Lone star.

685
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,400
That's why people don't remember it.

686
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,400
Cause it was so short lived.

687
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,400
Adrian, uh, Plycky, is that how you say her name?

688
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,400
Yeah.

689
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,400
She was.

690
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,400
Okay.

691
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,400
She's on the second field.

692
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,400
Um,

693
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,400
I don't know if you guys remember her name.

694
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,400
I don't know.

695
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,400
I don't know.

696
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,400
I don't know.

697
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,400
I don't know.

698
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,400
Okay.

699
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,400
She's on the second field.

700
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,400
Um,

701
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,400
She was in the wonder.

702
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,400
She was on the David E.

703
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,400
Kelly wonder woman that never went.

704
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,400
The pilot.

705
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,400
Yeah.

706
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,400
Many years ago.

707
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,400
James Wolk.

708
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,400
Maybe.

709
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,400
Oh, I don't know who that is.

710
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,400
Uh, Hey, you got John Voight.

711
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,400
All right.

712
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,400
Great.

713
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,400
You got the Voight man.

714
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,400
Always a good phrase to hear.

715
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,400
You got a John Voight.

716
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,400
I saw him.

717
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,400
So a phrase that Cotino might hear one day.

718
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,400
Cause what?

719
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,400
Cotino homeowners association.

720
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,400
You had Sean Voight.

721
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,400
I saw John Voight.

722
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,400
Uh,

723
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,400
At arts deli a couple of years ago.

724
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,400
He was just having a business meeting of some kind through all of celebrity with that.

725
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,400
Without that coming up.

726
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,400
Talking about that.

727
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,400
Yeah.

728
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,400
Is arts the one on the, by the bowling alley adventure or no?

729
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,400
Almost.

730
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,400
Okay.

731
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,400
Um,

732
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,400
Anyways, uh,

733
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,400
What have we missed about all this?

734
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,400
Oh, here's a weird thing that,

735
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,400
Um,

736
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,400
Okay.

737
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,400
Well, a couple of things I can point out from their website.

738
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,400
Um,

739
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,400
And, and elsewhere in that video,

740
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,400
Um,

741
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,400
My favorite part of the website they put up story living by Disney.com is,

742
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,400
There's a big section of jargon copy.

743
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,400
And before that, there's a big picture and a big splash titled the Disney touch.

744
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:15,400
And the background of that phrase, the Disney touch is a dude jamming out on guitar.

745
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,400
Oh, I saw that.

746
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,400
Yeah.

747
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,400
Yeah.

748
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,400
Very exciting.

749
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,400
Now there's another guy with a guitar in the back.

750
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,400
So Cotino is a place to start your dad band.

751
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,400
Oh yeah.

752
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,400
Cotino and Cialis using the same stock footage.

753
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,400
Cotino doesn't have two bathtubs next to each other.

754
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,400
You know,

755
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,400
You can hold hands with your partner.

756
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,400
You know, that's like kind of a rambly blues jam they're doing right there.

757
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,400
That's a long tongue.

758
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,400
It's tall Sally.

759
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,400
Yeah.

760
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,400
That is a long tall Sally.

761
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,400
Yeah.

762
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:47,400
If they want to structure it and not just, not just jam, of course you'd want to jam.

763
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:52,400
Rambling in incoherent, mostly incorrect story about muddy waters.

764
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,400
And the crossroads.

765
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,400
Get Belushi.

766
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,400
Get Belushi on stage.

767
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,400
You'll probably play the grand opening.

768
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,400
Yeah.

769
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,400
The other thing that I like is the, okay.

770
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,400
So they're like, they're showing the town center.

771
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,400
And again, look, I like these boring outdoor mall places.

772
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,400
I would like that.

773
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,400
I would go walk around here, but it's just so funny to see it presented by tomorrow by

774
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,400
this man who people have, especially when the park reopened and it's like, no here,

775
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,400
this is an exact, this is what an executive looks like.

776
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,400
He cares about the parks.

777
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,400
He's shaking hands and he is beautiful.

778
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,400
And then he's like, and now we're watching him just spew shit about condos.

779
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,400
That's kind of where I fall on this.

780
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,400
But anyway, but look, I would like to go to the place in this concept art with this

781
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,400
like technicolor, these technicolor bubbles in the air and with these boring wine

782
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,400
bars, I would like to be here.

783
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,400
But one thing I like there's, so there's like a pillar in the middle of the words

784
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,400
that, you know, this is very standard concept art, right?

785
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,400
Where they don't know what brands are going to come start restaurants or, you know,

786
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,400
fill the retail spaces in this place.

787
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:04,400
So they just make up some bullshit, you know, arione, you just put some Italian

788
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,400
word, but there's this one where there's a pole in the middle.

789
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:11,400
And in the video, it's just panning across this shot, right?

790
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,400
So you see the first half of it and it's pie P I E or pie place.

791
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:20,400
And then it gets all the way over and you see there's a space after pie.

792
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,400
And then it gets to the rest of the word and it's R O apostrophe S pie rose.

793
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,400
The restaurant is called pie rose.

794
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,400
And I think the intent was when this was a still painting, they probably imagined

795
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,400
there was like a D back here, like it was Pietros or something.

796
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,400
But in the video that shows the space, they commit to that.

797
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,400
The restaurant is pie rose, pie rose.

798
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,400
So I'm excited to go to pie rose.

799
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,400
I bet it's like a hot one style, like tie in red.

800
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,400
Everything's real spicy.

801
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,400
It's a hot one.

802
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,400
That's row.

803
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,400
Oh, I see.

804
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,400
Oh, I get it.

805
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,400
And they could.

806
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:01,400
I was thinking it was like a new Disney character name, like pie rose.

807
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,400
And she's like, her name's Rose and she makes pies.

808
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,400
That sounds nice.

809
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,400
She's like friendly and she welcomes you in and you go like pie rose.

810
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,400
How are you?

811
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,400
And she's like, oh, great.

812
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,400
I'm doing fine.

813
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,400
I'm doing fine.

814
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,400
Sit down.

815
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,400
Whipping up a boysenberry.

816
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,400
Yeah.

817
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,400
Yeah.

818
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,400
Maybe pie rose.

819
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,400
Yeah.

820
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,400
Maybe it is that, that like heat theme and it's the updated version of the fireworks

821
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,400
factory.

822
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,400
I rose.

823
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,400
Yeah.

824
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,400
I rose the real name of the bang master.

825
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,400
Oh yeah.

826
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,400
Well, there's the part, there's an X-Men villain named pyro as well.

827
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,400
Yeah.

828
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,400
It's spelled traditionally like pyro is, but maybe.

829
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,400
Yeah.

830
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,400
I don't know.

831
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,400
Well, now in my heart, sit on it.

832
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,400
Now they can't buy rose.

833
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,400
Yeah.

834
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,400
Stick a cheesecake factory in there.

835
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,400
It's gotta be pyro.

836
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,400
Yeah.

837
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,400
I think that's the pyro.

838
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,400
Well, hopefully.

839
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,400
Yeah.

840
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,400
What are we?

841
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,400
Are there any places we want to want to go in there?

842
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,720
Like what would your dream lineup be for the, for the outdoor mall?

843
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:54,240
I mean, the place I want to go is the place that's already there that I like.

844
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,880
It's called Palm Springs.

845
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,480
Like I think that's what all of this is.

846
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,280
They're trying to generate from nothing.

847
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,680
How about this?

848
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,600
What if they throw Gideon's out there?

849
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,200
Oh, well, you know what I mentioned.

850
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,200
All right.

851
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Oh yeah.

852
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,880
All that that said, chocolate chip cookie in the desert.

853
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,360
I mean, that's not the best.

854
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:21,320
Well, hot chocolate chip cookie, but a hot chocolate chip cookie in the 85 degree Orlando

855
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,320
heat.

856
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,680
Uh, well yeah, that's true.

857
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:29,960
Maybe they, you know, I, I went to Hershey park once and they were giving out samples

858
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:34,880
of the chocolate they had made for the troops during operation desert storm that melts at

859
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,880
higher temperatures.

860
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,600
Maybe they can get hold of that.

861
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:42,600
Reinforce desert heat with standing shock.

862
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,920
Reinforce MRE chocolate.

863
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,680
Welcome to Gideon's where we use chocolate from desert storm.

864
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:54,120
It holds up in the heat much better.

865
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,120
Wizard of Gideon.

866
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,520
I mean, what is Gideon a wizard?

867
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,880
What's the backstory of Gideon's?

868
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,880
Do we know?

869
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,360
Well, it's kind of in a cult bookstore.

870
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,360
Yeah.

871
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,800
But it's like Gideon, like a magician or something.

872
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:03,800
Do we know?

873
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,640
Is there a, yeah, I guess there would be a Gideon, right?

874
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,440
We got to dig into.

875
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,440
We got to dig in.

876
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,800
Hopefully there's, there's talk about bringing Gideon's to Anaheim, but maybe this is a quicker

877
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,640
path to get Gideon's and Joshua tree.

878
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,640
What about chicken guy?

879
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:18,640
Chicken guy.

880
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,640
Yeah.

881
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,640
And Josh.

882
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,600
These are the third party vendors they often work with.

883
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,600
Mariah's cookies in.

884
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,600
Free stuff.

885
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:27,600
Finally a brick and mortar.

886
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,600
Yeah.

887
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,600
It carries.

888
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:33,040
What about a plant that'll be $70 please.

889
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,240
What if we just give Robert Earl a blank slate?

890
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,240
Oh, okay.

891
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,040
They give it all to him.

892
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,040
Yeah.

893
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,040
Yeah.

894
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,040
Then we're, then we're good.

895
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,040
You know, is all Earl restaurants.

896
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,040
Oh, the full lineup.

897
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,800
Breakfast club, bang.

898
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,000
Steve Harvey's family food.

899
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Bang.

900
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Oh yeah.

901
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Get them all.

902
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Get them all in there.

903
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
And then we'll, yeah.

904
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,560
Then each of us will figure out a way to buy a house.

905
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,360
We quit our quit entertainment and get another job.

906
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,360
This podcast.

907
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,360
The podcast.

908
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:01,360
And then.

909
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,040
Well, the Cotino cast, we're going to have to chronicle it.

910
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,040
Oh yeah.

911
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,040
Yeah.

912
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:11,040
We'll reunite when we're north of 55 for the Cotino.

913
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:17,160
Reunite for two things for a podcast and to jam out on long tall Sally.

914
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:27,800
All of our wives doing the thing you've ever seen.

915
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,880
Let's give them tambourine.

916
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:31,880
Let's give the girls tambourine.

917
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:35,720
For a second, I'm like, you meant like secret wife and regular wife.

918
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:36,720
Going back.

919
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:40,440
I wasn't going to introduce them, but we just need more.

920
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,440
We need more meat to those vocals.

921
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,440
So yeah.

922
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,440
All right.

923
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,440
So you guys have a lot in common.

924
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,440
Me.

925
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:57,320
Speaking of jamming out, I don't know if we're wrapping up, but I have a, I wrote a little

926
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,920
song to celebrate.

927
00:59:58,920 --> 00:59:59,920
Oh wow.

928
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:00,920
The founding of Cotino.

929
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,160
All right.

930
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,600
I think this, I think this summons the spirit.

931
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,600
Okay.

932
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,400
Cotino in Rancho.

933
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:15,400
Ooh, a monthly art show, a condo by Pyros.

934
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,400
Come on Josh tomorrow.

935
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:22,400
Laguna Soclino, Disney's latest dreamo.

936
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,400
Cotino.

937
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,400
Yay.

938
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,680
See, I'm already jamming.

939
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:27,680
Wow.

940
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,680
That's great.

941
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:33,520
I've seen the way Aaron scowled at me after I sang that song to her.

942
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,160
She said bad to me.

943
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:38,160
Like she says to the cats.

944
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,360
No, I think it was good.

945
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:43,360
I think.

946
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,360
All right.

947
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,360
Thanks.

948
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,360
That's the validation I needed.

949
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:49,360
Mike Love will be playing there in his mid-90s.

950
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:52,360
110 years old.

951
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:56,360
He's so auto-tuned.

952
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:01,040
If you hear him today, if they release any clip of him.

953
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,480
It's just going to be, he'll just be lips.

954
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:07,720
He's a permanent lip-syncher who can kind of twiddle his fingers.

955
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:12,160
They have to turn all his many rings on his hands into foam so that he can hold them up

956
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,680
without his hands just dropping to the pavement.

957
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,000
Oh man, the hat's going to be huge at that point.

958
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,280
The baseball hat's got to be like a fully circular, it's going to have to cover his

959
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:24,200
whole body because the sun's going to be so strong in the desert at that point.

960
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:29,560
And he's going to want it to cover his face, his withering face.

961
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:33,560
Didn't I on one podcast say that he'll be hooked up to the Rise of Skywalker Emperor

962
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:34,560
machine?

963
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:39,960
That would be like kind of hauled around on like an arm, on a hydraulic arm.

964
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:43,600
Which is a lot like what the Queen Captain EO is on.

965
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,600
That is right.

966
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,880
So I will, yeah.

967
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:52,600
One, that's my secret wife hides in the basement as an attach to the Angelica Houston ring.

968
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:59,400
And the other, I also keep Mike Love on dialysis and swing him down when I want to hear a little

969
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:08,240
hit of, when some little braggart is you being, oh he's malfunctioning, he's smoking, gets

970
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,240
into back up.

971
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,240
Are we done?

972
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,240
I think we're done.

973
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:18,360
All right, well he survived podcast the ride.

974
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,920
Will we all, will Cotino survive?

975
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,120
Will this plan survive?

976
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:26,200
Will there be other story living by Disney locales?

977
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,200
That's what we don't know.

978
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:34,920
We've announced Cotino, but where else are we going to learn that Walt called home and

979
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:40,680
loved like, oh, it turns out that Walt actually really, he was very passionate about the manmade

980
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,680
islands outside of Dubai.

981
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:43,680
What?

982
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,280
I thought those were only built a couple of years ago.

983
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:47,280
No, no, no.

984
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,580
He, I think it inspired Bambi.

985
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:52,660
He went there and thought of Bambi there.

986
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:59,100
Maybe they'll figure out a way to tie in Walt to that second island that they just kind

987
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,100
of dropped.

988
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,100
Oh, Rhodey's Island.

989
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:02,100
And then he left.

990
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,900
Rhodey chose space over his island.

991
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:04,900
Yeah.

992
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,460
It was going so poorly.

993
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:09,220
He's like, I have to leave the earth.

994
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:14,580
It just soured him on the general idea of land and soil.

995
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:15,580
Yeah.

996
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:20,140
He turned bearish on land and soil.

997
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:21,380
Who wouldn't?

998
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:28,620
Well, we're so excited for every Cotino development and we will keep you posted on that.

999
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:31,900
Keep it tuned here to podcast throughout the second gate for three bonus episodes every

1000
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:39,700
month, including as we've learned soon, Walt's polo injury, Walt's turlet, lots to look forward

1001
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:40,700
to.

1002
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:41,700
Thanks for subscribing.

1003
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:42,700
Goodbye.
