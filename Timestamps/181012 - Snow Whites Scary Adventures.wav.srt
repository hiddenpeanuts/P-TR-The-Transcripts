1
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,760
Part of an adventure

2
00:00:11,076 --> 00:00:15,056
Hauntcast is about an attraction so ghoulish,

3
00:00:15,496 --> 00:00:20,276
it almost turned a young Mike Carlson off theme parks entirely.

4
00:00:21,136 --> 00:00:25,476
Rest your weary bones in a scared chair next to a scared deer.

5
00:00:26,076 --> 00:00:31,916
It's Snow White's Scary Adventures on Hauntcast, the fright.

6
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:46,616
["Spring Day's Theme Song"]

7
00:00:46,616 --> 00:00:50,076
Welcome to Hauntcast, the Fright,

8
00:00:50,436 --> 00:00:52,716
the show hosted by two men who were once

9
00:00:52,716 --> 00:00:54,516
very scared of today's ride,

10
00:00:54,796 --> 00:00:57,056
and one big brave boy who ain't scared of nothing.

11
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,496
I'm said big brave boy, Jason Sheridan.

12
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:01,996
Joined as always is Scott Gareder.

13
00:01:02,016 --> 00:01:04,736
And I'm one of the little scaredies.

14
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:06,916
And the little scaredy Mike Carlson.

15
00:01:07,376 --> 00:01:09,516
Jason, you were roasting me.

16
00:01:10,176 --> 00:01:12,536
I'm scared, I'm scared of roasts.

17
00:01:12,716 --> 00:01:16,016
You took a big leap there that is,

18
00:01:16,336 --> 00:01:19,076
I can back up with evidence you were correct,

19
00:01:19,236 --> 00:01:20,176
you made a good guess.

20
00:01:21,836 --> 00:01:24,136
But let's be honest though,

21
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:26,616
the word scary is in the name of the ride,

22
00:01:27,136 --> 00:01:29,276
so how else am I supposed to be able to guess?

23
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,576
For now.

24
00:01:30,576 --> 00:01:31,736
Added later though.

25
00:01:31,756 --> 00:01:32,256
Added later.

26
00:01:32,336 --> 00:01:33,256
As we'll get into.

27
00:01:33,436 --> 00:01:34,176
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:34,176 --> 00:01:35,356
It wasn't always in the title.

29
00:01:35,756 --> 00:01:35,896
Yeah.

30
00:01:36,836 --> 00:01:39,476
But what you were listening to also

31
00:01:39,476 --> 00:01:42,596
is the first episode of Hauntcast, the Fright,

32
00:01:42,696 --> 00:01:45,076
which we will be for all of October.

33
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:48,096
We are out of the last themed thing

34
00:01:48,096 --> 00:01:50,656
and into the next themed thing immediately.

35
00:01:51,596 --> 00:01:54,656
For those of you who have not listened

36
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:58,376
since the City Walk Saga began, welcome back.

37
00:02:00,276 --> 00:02:03,056
Encourage you to go back and check out highlights.

38
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:08,116
There's so, so many twists and turns,

39
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:10,716
a spectacular ending I thought.

40
00:02:10,996 --> 00:02:12,636
The way I figured you can just do

41
00:02:12,636 --> 00:02:15,516
like one City Walk Saga episode a month now

42
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:16,616
for the next 19 months.

43
00:02:16,656 --> 00:02:19,116
So like when you're, maybe there's no podcast

44
00:02:19,116 --> 00:02:21,976
or you got an extra hour to kill, catch up on it, you know?

45
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:23,736
You didn't have to do it daily.

46
00:02:24,196 --> 00:02:26,376
In a lot of cases, an extra two hours.

47
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:28,756
Okay, another two hours, sure.

48
00:02:29,336 --> 00:02:31,476
Also, they're not going anywhere.

49
00:02:32,176 --> 00:02:33,336
They're up, you know?

50
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,296
Take your time.

51
00:02:34,596 --> 00:02:34,616
Yeah.

52
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:39,096
They are up and accruing respect and admiration.

53
00:02:39,636 --> 00:02:41,516
And within a couple of years,

54
00:02:41,636 --> 00:02:44,836
we'll be considered one of the great cult podcasts,

55
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:46,116
mini-series.

56
00:02:47,196 --> 00:02:49,676
Maybe it's not there yet, but.

57
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,056
It's not, look, we're not getting serial acclaim yet.

58
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,276
We're not getting Finding Richard Simmons,

59
00:02:55,816 --> 00:02:57,896
whatever Richard Simmons is, what's it called?

60
00:02:57,896 --> 00:02:59,576
There's something about him looking for.

61
00:02:59,576 --> 00:03:00,816
Oh, Richard Simmons is missing.

62
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,096
I don't think it's called that.

63
00:03:02,236 --> 00:03:04,056
The wrong show, the show that was wrong

64
00:03:04,056 --> 00:03:05,116
about its premise.

65
00:03:05,836 --> 00:03:07,336
Edward Richard Simmons was always fine.

66
00:03:07,476 --> 00:03:08,856
Or the porno dad show.

67
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:09,756
My dad wrote a porno.

68
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,716
A lot of people seem to like My Dad Wrote a Porno.

69
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:12,476
Do you guys know this show?

70
00:03:12,476 --> 00:03:13,116
What is that?

71
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:17,096
It's a show about like a guy whose father passed away

72
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,076
and when they were going through his things

73
00:03:19,076 --> 00:03:22,296
that he found this very long, erotic novel.

74
00:03:22,676 --> 00:03:23,016
Okay.

75
00:03:24,276 --> 00:03:28,476
How dare you be talking about other compelling podcasts

76
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:32,396
when we're trying to hype up what we have just been through?

77
00:03:32,616 --> 00:03:33,316
I mean, that's true.

78
00:03:33,316 --> 00:03:35,096
Yeah, we certainly went through one of our deal.

79
00:03:35,636 --> 00:03:37,756
I don't, we should all, the only thing we should be talking

80
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:40,016
about with any enthusiasm is, yeah, these guys did

81
00:03:40,016 --> 00:03:42,956
this thing where they went to CityWare for 19 days in a row

82
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,036
and there was a little boy ghost keeper.

83
00:03:45,436 --> 00:03:46,776
You gotta check it out.

84
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:49,556
If we, and if any of us have children,

85
00:03:49,656 --> 00:03:51,816
which obviously very unlikely,

86
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:53,696
but if any of us have children,

87
00:03:54,056 --> 00:03:57,196
they're gonna find years later, like in their 40s or 50s,

88
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:59,376
they're gonna stumble upon the fact that their dads

89
00:03:59,376 --> 00:04:02,496
did 19 episodes on CityWalk

90
00:04:02,496 --> 00:04:04,376
and then they'll do a podcast about it.

91
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:05,396
It'll be like, oh my, did you,

92
00:04:05,676 --> 00:04:08,136
my dad did a 19 part series on a shopping mall.

93
00:04:08,156 --> 00:04:12,016
We've also like lessened our chances of having children

94
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:14,936
just because of the amount of salt we have consumed.

95
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,296
To do the CityWalk episodes.

96
00:04:17,296 --> 00:04:19,236
Because we weren't down our actual sperm count?

97
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:21,676
Possibly, I mean, we were walking a lot.

98
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:24,456
No, I just meant our longevity of life.

99
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:26,276
So yeah, we will die sooner.

100
00:04:26,276 --> 00:04:27,536
I thought you meant like,

101
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:30,996
cause they would put saltpeter in like military meals

102
00:04:30,996 --> 00:04:33,076
to make sure the men weren't that horny.

103
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:34,196
That's what I heard.

104
00:04:34,236 --> 00:04:36,936
So I thought maybe we're, our drives are down.

105
00:04:37,096 --> 00:04:37,436
I don't know.

106
00:04:37,576 --> 00:04:38,436
Well, that's a different now and then.

107
00:04:38,436 --> 00:04:39,576
I'm not forgetting you of course.

108
00:04:39,636 --> 00:04:40,196
Of course not.

109
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,896
But Scott and I are way down as far as our T's.

110
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:44,856
Every now and then you hear about someone

111
00:04:44,856 --> 00:04:47,436
who like lived to a hundred something

112
00:04:47,436 --> 00:04:50,416
and they would eat like bacon and hardtack and whiskey.

113
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:51,196
Sure.

114
00:04:50,836 --> 00:04:53,676
How much hardtack have you been eating lately?

115
00:04:53,716 --> 00:04:57,476
I eat a normal amount of hardtack.

116
00:04:57,736 --> 00:04:59,796
Just six times a month.

117
00:04:59,796 --> 00:04:59,816
Doctor recommended it.

118
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:00,616
Just, yeah.

119
00:05:01,716 --> 00:05:03,476
Have you ever had hardtack?

120
00:05:04,276 --> 00:05:05,596
I don't think, I mean.

121
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:06,996
You're thinking about it.

122
00:05:07,316 --> 00:05:08,436
I don't think so.

123
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:12,276
I think, cause I went to a lot of like

124
00:05:12,276 --> 00:05:15,176
colonial themed shit growing up

125
00:05:15,176 --> 00:05:17,296
in like the Pennsylvania area.

126
00:05:17,396 --> 00:05:20,176
There's a lot of colonial themed shit.

127
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:21,456
Or going to New England.

128
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:24,016
And I'm sure we would have,

129
00:05:24,396 --> 00:05:26,896
must have had some foods of the time.

130
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:27,496
But like.

131
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:28,776
Cause a hardtack is a biscuit.

132
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:29,776
It's a biscuit.

133
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:30,436
Yeah, but that was,

134
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:34,276
so that was more of a military like ration sort of thing.

135
00:05:34,476 --> 00:05:35,276
Because I think it's like.

136
00:05:35,276 --> 00:05:36,456
That doesn't mean you wouldn't have had it.

137
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:37,456
Yeah, that's true.

138
00:05:37,456 --> 00:05:38,396
It's an old timey thing.

139
00:05:38,696 --> 00:05:40,816
I don't think I've had hardtack.

140
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:41,296
Okay.

141
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,856
Well call your dad.

142
00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:44,836
Maybe he has some information about it.

143
00:05:45,356 --> 00:05:49,236
I did email him about something on today's episode.

144
00:05:50,176 --> 00:05:51,696
About the topic.

145
00:05:51,816 --> 00:05:53,636
Which I should say we're talking about

146
00:05:53,636 --> 00:05:55,016
Snow White Scary Adventures.

147
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:56,356
Snow White Scary Adventures.

148
00:05:56,636 --> 00:06:01,696
It is a month of the scariest attractions on earth.

149
00:06:02,016 --> 00:06:05,636
And where better to start than with the most.

150
00:06:05,636 --> 00:06:06,396
The first.

151
00:06:06,596 --> 00:06:06,956
Bone chilling.

152
00:06:07,276 --> 00:06:07,896
Yeah.

153
00:06:08,056 --> 00:06:10,976
The first attraction I ever went on at Disney World.

154
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:12,516
Oh, I see.

155
00:06:12,636 --> 00:06:13,016
Wow.

156
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:16,196
I think it's seeming to me like maybe we all have

157
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:20,496
parent stories and contacts related to this episode.

158
00:06:20,516 --> 00:06:20,876
I would think.

159
00:06:21,136 --> 00:06:21,256
Oh.

160
00:06:21,376 --> 00:06:23,616
We had to unlock memories.

161
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:29,636
Yeah, of the hidden terrors that befell us.

162
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:33,976
Yeah, well, you know,

163
00:06:34,636 --> 00:06:37,836
where, yeah, where better to begin in a terrifying month.

164
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:38,876
Is there a more,

165
00:06:39,016 --> 00:06:41,896
is there a scarier ride than Snow White Scary Adventures?

166
00:06:42,356 --> 00:06:43,656
Soon we'll find out.

167
00:06:43,656 --> 00:06:45,996
I can't imagine there would be.

168
00:06:45,996 --> 00:06:48,456
Not a maze where some teenagers running at you

169
00:06:48,456 --> 00:06:52,016
with a chainsaw or there's slasher like characters

170
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:53,296
from movies running at you.

171
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:53,776
No, no, no.

172
00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:57,576
It's a tiny two minute ride on a tiny little car

173
00:06:57,576 --> 00:07:00,896
on a little fast track where a bunch of like

174
00:07:00,896 --> 00:07:03,616
static mannequins like slide out toward you.

175
00:07:03,896 --> 00:07:04,976
That is what we're talking about.

176
00:07:04,976 --> 00:07:06,156
And I'm saying that in jest,

177
00:07:06,596 --> 00:07:09,436
but no ride scared me more.

178
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:10,256
Yeah.

179
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:10,756
As a kid.

180
00:07:10,756 --> 00:07:13,416
And I think it's possible that there is not a ride

181
00:07:14,816 --> 00:07:16,876
that has produced more terror

182
00:07:16,876 --> 00:07:19,236
because it just sheer volume,

183
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:21,796
if you go back to the fifties

184
00:07:21,796 --> 00:07:23,816
and chart all the many decades

185
00:07:23,816 --> 00:07:25,796
of some iteration of this ride occurring,

186
00:07:26,136 --> 00:07:30,216
and it is a ride that kids can go on in terms of,

187
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,636
you know, it's not a twisty tourney ride.

188
00:07:32,636 --> 00:07:33,956
So all ages can go on.

189
00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:35,436
I just, I just feel like more tears

190
00:07:35,436 --> 00:07:37,076
have probably been produced by this ride.

191
00:07:37,076 --> 00:07:39,356
Maybe than any other in the world.

192
00:07:39,656 --> 00:07:39,796
Sure, more than the Haunted Mansion.

193
00:07:39,816 --> 00:07:40,336
Potentially.

194
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:41,036
Yes.

195
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:42,616
I think you know what you're getting into

196
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:43,376
on the Haunted Mansion.

197
00:07:43,556 --> 00:07:45,836
I think this ride pulls a bait and switch on you.

198
00:07:46,016 --> 00:07:48,496
Yeah, the Haunted Mansion is downright delightful

199
00:07:48,496 --> 00:07:50,536
compared to the, especially the original

200
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,796
Walt Disney World Snow White scary adventures.

201
00:07:52,976 --> 00:07:53,236
Like.

202
00:07:53,236 --> 00:07:54,596
Yes, I mean, that's true.

203
00:07:54,796 --> 00:07:56,816
I went on Haunted Mansion with no problem.

204
00:07:56,836 --> 00:07:58,676
I might've like squinted a little bit,

205
00:07:58,716 --> 00:08:02,796
but I was not nearly as scared as I was on this thing.

206
00:08:02,836 --> 00:08:03,816
So can we get into,

207
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:06,676
because you have had such a visceral reaction

208
00:08:06,676 --> 00:08:08,136
to talking about this ride as a kid,

209
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,936
why don't we start with that?

210
00:08:10,636 --> 00:08:11,776
Sure, let's explore it.

211
00:08:11,776 --> 00:08:12,816
Yeah, let's explore that.

212
00:08:12,816 --> 00:08:13,236
In fact, because you're holding a,

213
00:08:13,236 --> 00:08:13,956
because I have a different angle.

214
00:08:13,956 --> 00:08:15,596
You're holding your hand out like you're a therapist

215
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:16,756
and you're like, let's start with you.

216
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:17,976
No, I'm just curious.

217
00:08:18,076 --> 00:08:20,276
I was just surprised when you brought this up

218
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:24,256
because my, the long and short of me is I never,

219
00:08:24,616 --> 00:08:26,036
I liked this ride.

220
00:08:26,236 --> 00:08:28,156
I always, I never gave this ride much mind.

221
00:08:28,156 --> 00:08:29,556
What a brave, brave little boy.

222
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:30,396
What did you call yourself?

223
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:33,356
Oh, a big, brave boy who ain't scared of nothing.

224
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:35,596
Okay, so as long as I remember that.

225
00:08:35,596 --> 00:08:37,456
I was trying to figure out something sluggo

226
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:38,796
from Nancy would call herself.

227
00:08:38,796 --> 00:08:40,836
No, that is a perfect way to describe yourself.

228
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,976
I'm not mad about that at all.

229
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:44,616
As for us, yeah.

230
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:49,036
Yeah, no, so I think I really should

231
00:08:49,036 --> 00:08:49,936
have double checked with my mom.

232
00:08:50,016 --> 00:08:52,436
I could have maybe gone on like Dumbo or something first,

233
00:08:52,476 --> 00:08:56,956
but my memory is when I was three years old,

234
00:08:57,316 --> 00:08:59,336
we were in Florida, three or four,

235
00:08:59,696 --> 00:09:02,376
and the first ride we went on was this ride.

236
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,556
And it's the original Walt Disney World version

237
00:09:04,556 --> 00:09:05,336
of Snow White.

238
00:09:05,356 --> 00:09:06,936
And it was not called Scary Adventures,

239
00:09:07,196 --> 00:09:10,496
but it was the scariest of all of the versions of the ride.

240
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:12,796
Was it just called Snow White's Adventures?

241
00:09:13,196 --> 00:09:14,436
Yes, yeah, yeah.

242
00:09:14,616 --> 00:09:15,156
Okay, sure.

243
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:19,196
And the ride is, if you haven't been on it,

244
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:22,016
it's like all these dark rides in Fantasyland

245
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:23,296
are very claustrophobic.

246
00:09:23,836 --> 00:09:25,996
So like the walls are closing on you

247
00:09:25,996 --> 00:09:28,056
and all the characters are pretty close

248
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:29,016
in proximity to you.

249
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,876
I think that's an element that makes it scarier

250
00:09:31,876 --> 00:09:32,856
than Haunted Mansion.

251
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:33,796
Yes, 100%.

252
00:09:33,796 --> 00:09:36,776
Lot of room to breathe, and it's all very calm.

253
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:39,536
There's no real jump scares,

254
00:09:39,836 --> 00:09:42,696
other than I guess I was freaked out by the things

255
00:09:42,696 --> 00:09:46,056
that do like pop up from behind the tombstones.

256
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:48,776
Yeah, but there's a party going on at that point.

257
00:09:49,216 --> 00:09:49,836
Sure, sure.

258
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:51,916
So it's a little, yeah, as a kid probably I was like,

259
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,976
but there's such a fun song happening

260
00:09:54,976 --> 00:09:57,156
and there's a big party, ghost party happening,

261
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:58,816
that at that point those jump scares,

262
00:09:58,816 --> 00:10:00,376
they feel like are lessened in their intensity.

263
00:10:00,536 --> 00:10:03,336
Yeah, I did not like the things jumping up

264
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,096
in the Haunted Mansion, but that music is so infectious.

265
00:10:06,316 --> 00:10:06,936
Of course. Like as a kid,

266
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:09,416
I was just like, I'm here, I get to hear,

267
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,156
what are my favorite songs?

268
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:16,776
This is before Spotify, you couldn't take it on the go.

269
00:10:17,276 --> 00:10:17,436
Yeah, exactly.

270
00:10:17,736 --> 00:10:19,076
Are you typically driving around

271
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,636
blasting Grim Grinning Ghosts?

272
00:10:21,636 --> 00:10:22,736
Yeah, yeah.

273
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,456
It seems possible, I don't know.

274
00:10:24,476 --> 00:10:25,776
It's entirely possible.

275
00:10:26,296 --> 00:10:28,116
Well for me, I would certainly be blasting

276
00:10:28,116 --> 00:10:30,796
the Bear Naked Ladies cover of Grim Grinning Ghosts

277
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,416
that exists.

278
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:32,136
Did they really?

279
00:10:32,396 --> 00:10:33,356
Interesting.

280
00:10:33,496 --> 00:10:34,516
We can talk about that later though.

281
00:10:34,936 --> 00:10:38,236
The full episode devoted to the note by note breakdown

282
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:39,436
of the Bear Naked Ladies cover.

283
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:40,596
And here's what Ed Robertson was doing

284
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:41,796
on the verse, second verse here

285
00:10:41,796 --> 00:10:42,736
that I thought was very interesting.

286
00:10:44,216 --> 00:10:48,396
Yeah, so we went on the ride and I loved The Seven Dwarfs.

287
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:50,056
I was obsessed with it.

288
00:10:50,056 --> 00:10:52,816
They had re-released it in theaters not long before that.

289
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,056
And I remember like, I remember going to see it.

290
00:10:56,076 --> 00:10:57,076
I remember being so excited.

291
00:10:57,076 --> 00:10:59,236
I remember taking a nap before going to see it

292
00:10:59,236 --> 00:11:00,276
because I was so excited.

293
00:11:00,656 --> 00:11:02,476
There was a poster on my grandmother's door

294
00:11:02,476 --> 00:11:03,756
of like Seven Dwarfs.

295
00:11:04,116 --> 00:11:06,396
I wanted the toys that didn't exist.

296
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:07,896
And my dad came back one day

297
00:11:07,896 --> 00:11:09,356
because I was sick and I was like,

298
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,216
can you get me Seven Dwarfs toys?

299
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,336
And my dad was like, all right, I will.

300
00:11:12,396 --> 00:11:13,876
My mom was like, they don't make those.

301
00:11:14,016 --> 00:11:15,156
You can't promise them that.

302
00:11:15,156 --> 00:11:15,856
They don't make those.

303
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:20,076
So my dad found seven like little ninja toys

304
00:11:20,076 --> 00:11:22,736
and he goes, yeah, these are the Ninja Dwarfs.

305
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:23,856
Here you go.

306
00:11:23,996 --> 00:11:25,156
And I was like, oh cool.

307
00:11:25,156 --> 00:11:26,316
Wow, that's so sweet.

308
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:27,216
And I bought it.

309
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:29,236
Like I didn't, I was like, oh cool.

310
00:11:29,476 --> 00:11:31,796
Like made them fight and I was none the wiser

311
00:11:31,796 --> 00:11:34,216
that those were not really the Seven Dwarfs.

312
00:11:34,876 --> 00:11:35,616
Now I didn't think about it though.

313
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:38,176
I wonder if he found like a perfect seven pack of ninjas

314
00:11:38,176 --> 00:11:40,216
or he like took some out to make it.

315
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:41,636
I really should ask him about that.

316
00:11:41,716 --> 00:11:42,576
No, yeah.

317
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,756
Anyway, so I-

318
00:11:43,756 --> 00:11:44,636
So ninjas sound cool.

319
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:45,376
Yeah.

320
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:47,556
I'd like to see a ride about them.

321
00:11:47,636 --> 00:11:47,996
Sure.

322
00:11:48,216 --> 00:11:51,956
But the audience would be very slim for that, I suppose.

323
00:11:52,256 --> 00:11:54,656
I've heard of three ninjas, but seven ninjas?

324
00:11:55,056 --> 00:11:55,996
Now I've heard of everything.

325
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:56,836
Or too many.

326
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,636
So I was so excited to go on this ride

327
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:03,236
and immediately the ride like plunges you into darkness.

328
00:12:03,716 --> 00:12:06,016
It's already very dark and claustrophobic

329
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,296
and very quickly your friends are not there.

330
00:12:09,336 --> 00:12:10,996
The dwarves are not there immediately.

331
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,916
You start out in this little forest and then you go in

332
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,356
and immediately you're just in,

333
00:12:14,496 --> 00:12:15,956
you're just with the witch and the queen.

334
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:16,236
Yeah.

335
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,176
Like the queen and the witch.

336
00:12:17,176 --> 00:12:17,556
Yeah.

337
00:12:17,716 --> 00:12:18,136
And immediately-

338
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:18,576
Oh, you know what?

339
00:12:18,576 --> 00:12:19,696
I'd like to explain something.

340
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:22,036
And we can go, we'll go back and talk about the-

341
00:12:22,036 --> 00:12:22,336
The actual ride.

342
00:12:22,336 --> 00:12:23,896
The different versions and everything.

343
00:12:23,896 --> 00:12:26,156
But if anyone listening is,

344
00:12:26,636 --> 00:12:29,516
has in their head the Disneyland version,

345
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,156
which begins with,

346
00:12:31,396 --> 00:12:33,676
oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

347
00:12:33,676 --> 00:12:36,216
Like there's a pleasant scene at the beginning

348
00:12:36,216 --> 00:12:38,756
before you are plunged into terror.

349
00:12:38,976 --> 00:12:41,016
But the Disney World version that you went on,

350
00:12:41,216 --> 00:12:43,876
not so much, not even, I don't think any pleasantness.

351
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,816
No, you are immediately greeted with the witch

352
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:49,716
turning around as an old hag and screaming.

353
00:12:50,356 --> 00:12:53,216
Just blood curdling, like screaming.

354
00:12:53,516 --> 00:12:55,056
Yeah, and I was done.

355
00:12:55,256 --> 00:12:56,836
I mean, I was done at that point.

356
00:12:56,936 --> 00:12:58,096
I was so scared.

357
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:00,716
I closed my eyes and looked toward the ground.

358
00:13:01,396 --> 00:13:05,556
And my mom always tells the story that she was like

359
00:13:05,556 --> 00:13:07,716
pointing stuff out to me on the ride to try to show me.

360
00:13:07,896 --> 00:13:10,896
Cause in her mind, we drove down to Florida

361
00:13:10,896 --> 00:13:13,396
from Chicago area, which-

362
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:14,076
I don't know.

363
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:15,036
This is a crazy.

364
00:13:15,136 --> 00:13:17,056
I don't know why my parents insisted on doing this.

365
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:20,256
Like could flying have been that much more money than,

366
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:23,536
like an extra day of work, my dad had to take off.

367
00:13:23,856 --> 00:13:25,576
Like in hindsight, now that I think about it,

368
00:13:25,576 --> 00:13:27,156
like why did we drive a couple times?

369
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:29,396
Was it too young to fly in their eyes potentially?

370
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:33,196
Maybe, that's a funny thought.

371
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:34,316
My sister was-

372
00:13:34,316 --> 00:13:35,376
A lot of people don't fly.

373
00:13:35,496 --> 00:13:36,196
A lot of kids don't fly.

374
00:13:36,196 --> 00:13:37,576
My sister was younger.

375
00:13:37,836 --> 00:13:40,416
No, I didn't fly until I was like 15 or something.

376
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,056
But so like, I think we were thinking it was safe.

377
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,676
That's not how your parents chose to.

378
00:13:44,696 --> 00:13:46,996
Yeah, and I don't know if my mom was like scared of flying

379
00:13:46,996 --> 00:13:48,816
at that point or I don't know.

380
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,816
I honestly, I don't have an answer for this, but we-

381
00:13:50,816 --> 00:13:54,696
I think there's a cutoff in any direction from Orlando

382
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:59,456
of eight to 10 hours where people, if they haven't done it,

383
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:02,556
they have at least considered driving to the park.

384
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:05,916
It's like 22 hours of driving from Schaumburg.

385
00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:07,316
It's not that short.

386
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,196
So it's like a two day trip.

387
00:14:09,676 --> 00:14:11,276
And I remember we like left at night

388
00:14:11,276 --> 00:14:14,256
and I remember being very, oh no, this is the second time

389
00:14:14,256 --> 00:14:14,956
we drove to Florida.

390
00:14:14,996 --> 00:14:16,676
Sorry, I'm mixing up my stories

391
00:14:16,676 --> 00:14:18,556
because I remembered having my Game Boy in the back

392
00:14:18,556 --> 00:14:20,676
and we stopped at Burger King, but that's a different trip.

393
00:14:21,176 --> 00:14:23,076
That sounds like a hell of a time.

394
00:14:23,256 --> 00:14:25,016
That sounds like-

395
00:14:25,016 --> 00:14:26,176
So yeah, so we drove down.

396
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:29,796
So my mom will say like, oh, we like drove all this way

397
00:14:29,796 --> 00:14:31,696
and he's not gonna look at any of the rides.

398
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:32,956
Like that was her first thought.

399
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:33,336
So she's-

400
00:14:33,336 --> 00:14:35,456
And the whole way down you were bragging about,

401
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:39,616
mommy, when you see me on the first ride we go on,

402
00:14:39,676 --> 00:14:41,536
my pants are gonna come out dry.

403
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,396
I'm not gonna blink.

404
00:14:44,596 --> 00:14:45,596
I'm gonna have big boy dry pants.

405
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:47,056
You'll be so proud of me.

406
00:14:47,056 --> 00:14:48,756
My eyes-

407
00:14:48,756 --> 00:14:49,236
Immediately over dirt.

408
00:14:49,276 --> 00:14:50,516
My head's on a swivel.

409
00:14:50,576 --> 00:14:52,836
I will be enjoying all of the animatronics.

410
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:55,756
We will get our money's worth, mother.

411
00:14:56,036 --> 00:14:57,336
The money will be well spent.

412
00:14:57,476 --> 00:14:59,196
Wait till you see how much I look at.

413
00:14:59,956 --> 00:15:02,376
This all seems like stuff Jason may have said as a child.

414
00:15:02,816 --> 00:15:04,516
The money will be well spent, mother.

415
00:15:06,236 --> 00:15:09,716
Your hard earned payday will come to fruition.

416
00:15:09,936 --> 00:15:12,156
I've calculated the amount of joy I'll have

417
00:15:12,156 --> 00:15:13,236
for the ticket price.

418
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,496
So yeah, so she was like trying to get me.

419
00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:17,196
She's like, look at this.

420
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,596
There's a evil tree or there's a this.

421
00:15:20,056 --> 00:15:22,796
And I think within like 30 seconds

422
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,096
she said like, oh, look over here.

423
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,156
There's whatever, a squirrel or something.

424
00:15:27,156 --> 00:15:28,396
And I looked and it was a scene

425
00:15:28,396 --> 00:15:29,956
when the witch comes out on the boat.

426
00:15:30,436 --> 00:15:34,236
So I opened my eyes, the witch pops up

427
00:15:34,236 --> 00:15:35,696
or pops like that thing.

428
00:15:35,816 --> 00:15:38,016
And that's a similar effect to the Disneyland version too

429
00:15:38,016 --> 00:15:40,556
where she just kind of slowly comes out on a boat.

430
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:41,136
Ah!

431
00:15:42,016 --> 00:15:43,676
Yeah, she's on a boat now.

432
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:45,196
She's turning around.

433
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:45,896
Was she on a boat in the movie?

434
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,336
And she shows up on a damn boat.

435
00:15:47,956 --> 00:15:50,536
I can't, there's a lot of this where I'm like,

436
00:15:50,536 --> 00:15:51,956
this is just the ride.

437
00:15:51,956 --> 00:15:53,816
This is like the ride taking shortcuts

438
00:15:53,816 --> 00:15:55,016
to try and tell the movie.

439
00:15:55,436 --> 00:15:56,876
They love the witch on the ride.

440
00:15:57,116 --> 00:15:57,576
They love it.

441
00:15:57,576 --> 00:15:58,876
I was obsessed with the dwarves,

442
00:15:58,936 --> 00:16:00,516
but this is a ride about the witch.

443
00:16:00,696 --> 00:16:02,616
This is a ride about this woman chasing and stalking you.

444
00:16:02,636 --> 00:16:04,396
And especially the Disney World version,

445
00:16:04,436 --> 00:16:06,976
she showed up so many times in a row.

446
00:16:06,976 --> 00:16:08,196
Six or seven times.

447
00:16:08,456 --> 00:16:11,156
She is full on stalking your ass.

448
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:13,876
Yeah, so my mom's turning and I opened

449
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:15,036
and then that was it.

450
00:16:15,056 --> 00:16:17,336
And I was not gonna open my eyes the rest of that ride.

451
00:16:17,956 --> 00:16:19,816
And my mom said, open your eyes, Mike.

452
00:16:20,076 --> 00:16:22,056
Oh no, she said, look at that or whatever.

453
00:16:22,136 --> 00:16:24,896
And I said, I can't, my eyes are shut too tight.

454
00:16:25,996 --> 00:16:29,756
That's the famous line my mom always tells that story.

455
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,836
I can't mommy, my eyes are shut too tight.

456
00:16:34,236 --> 00:16:34,856
So like I was just.

457
00:16:34,856 --> 00:16:36,336
It's your eyes fault, it's not you.

458
00:16:36,356 --> 00:16:37,896
I was blaming it on my eyes.

459
00:16:38,116 --> 00:16:39,476
It was like, I cannot help it.

460
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:42,036
I am so scared my eyes will not open.

461
00:16:42,956 --> 00:16:44,396
And I wasn't crying or anything.

462
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:47,416
I was just like, I don't want to deal with this scariness.

463
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:52,336
And yeah, so I think we went another dark ride

464
00:16:52,336 --> 00:16:53,616
and it was a similar situation.

465
00:16:54,296 --> 00:16:56,696
But luckily, and we'll save that for the Peter Pan episode.

466
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:59,776
Peter Pan, a nice distance away from all the things.

467
00:16:59,796 --> 00:17:00,836
And I loved Peter Pan.

468
00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:03,856
Okay, so it was dicey whether or not

469
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,716
this trip was gonna work out at all.

470
00:17:05,736 --> 00:17:07,376
It's a hell of a note to start on,

471
00:17:07,496 --> 00:17:08,576
but Peter Pan turned you around.

472
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:09,796
How old would you have been?

473
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:11,756
I always forget.

474
00:17:11,836 --> 00:17:14,436
I think it's 80, not 87, that's when my sister was born.

475
00:17:14,456 --> 00:17:15,956
So I must've been like five.

476
00:17:16,196 --> 00:17:17,856
I was probably 89.

477
00:17:18,076 --> 00:17:21,216
All right, it's brave of you to share these details

478
00:17:21,216 --> 00:17:24,156
to go back and remember dates and times.

479
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:26,856
I know it's hard to do so, but I'm glad you're doing it.

480
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,136
Are you about to do the same thing?

481
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:30,456
Well, I might as well tell mine.

482
00:17:31,656 --> 00:17:34,576
The first time I went on this ride

483
00:17:34,576 --> 00:17:39,876
was not the first time that I went to Disneyland in general,

484
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:42,976
which I will explain.

485
00:17:44,576 --> 00:17:48,396
Basically, I told my mom that this was a topic

486
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:50,916
we were gonna do, that we were gonna kick off

487
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,796
this month of Haunt Cast the Fright with this ride.

488
00:17:54,076 --> 00:17:57,216
And she started telling a story of

489
00:17:57,216 --> 00:18:00,296
the first time I was at the ride.

490
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,236
And I said, you know what, here, wait, save it,

491
00:18:03,396 --> 00:18:05,396
call back, leave a message,

492
00:18:06,796 --> 00:18:08,436
and tell the story that way.

493
00:18:09,276 --> 00:18:11,396
So that's what happened.

494
00:18:11,396 --> 00:18:13,996
And I'm just gonna play the audio file.

495
00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:15,416
I figured it would be,

496
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,836
this is the more honest way to do it,

497
00:18:17,836 --> 00:18:20,596
to let my mom tell the tale.

498
00:18:20,656 --> 00:18:23,716
So here now, for the first time,

499
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:27,076
actually, her voice on the podcast,

500
00:18:27,636 --> 00:18:29,056
this is Kathy Gerdner.

501
00:18:29,736 --> 00:18:31,036
Hi, Scott, it's mom.

502
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:33,516
I was just remembering a story

503
00:18:33,516 --> 00:18:35,376
of when we first took you to Disneyland.

504
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:40,116
You were four, and we were wandering through fantasy land,

505
00:18:40,116 --> 00:18:43,196
and I took you over to the Snow White ride,

506
00:18:43,676 --> 00:18:45,536
and you stopped at this real cute sign

507
00:18:45,536 --> 00:18:47,296
on the outside, the elbow characters,

508
00:18:47,596 --> 00:18:50,116
and you looked at it and read out loud,

509
00:18:50,456 --> 00:18:53,096
Snow White Scary Adventures.

510
00:18:53,756 --> 00:18:56,316
Board a mine cart to travel through

511
00:18:56,316 --> 00:18:58,776
the scary adventures of Snow White,

512
00:18:59,396 --> 00:19:01,716
but watch out for the wicked witch.

513
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,576
Supervise children at all times.

514
00:19:06,316 --> 00:19:09,056
Children under age seven must be accompanied

515
00:19:09,056 --> 00:19:12,296
by a person age 14 years or older.

516
00:19:13,176 --> 00:19:14,936
And then you turned around and said,

517
00:19:15,356 --> 00:19:19,176
Mommy, I don't think I'll go on this ride.

518
00:19:19,476 --> 00:19:23,216
And you maneuvered us right out of fantasy land.

519
00:19:23,216 --> 00:19:24,056
Wow.

520
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,416
It's always been one of my favorite stories.

521
00:19:28,356 --> 00:19:29,396
Love you, bye.

522
00:19:31,016 --> 00:19:33,156
And then my mom said she loved me.

523
00:19:34,176 --> 00:19:35,816
And so that made me feel good.

524
00:19:35,816 --> 00:19:37,236
And then you added, Mommy, I'm sorry,

525
00:19:37,236 --> 00:19:40,176
we will not be getting the most for our ticket today.

526
00:19:40,176 --> 00:19:44,836
I apologize for you and father's earnings.

527
00:19:45,636 --> 00:19:49,036
We will earn our money by looking at each planter

528
00:19:49,036 --> 00:19:51,656
and the beautiful landscaping in the park, Mommy.

529
00:19:52,676 --> 00:19:55,096
I think I could have just told that story,

530
00:19:55,316 --> 00:19:59,996
but I knew that tale, and I wanted my mom to do,

531
00:20:00,436 --> 00:20:02,316
my mom could do a better impression of me

532
00:20:02,316 --> 00:20:04,076
at four years old than I could now,

533
00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:06,736
because I had a very high-pitched voice.

534
00:20:06,736 --> 00:20:09,736
I don't know if you know this, but I was,

535
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:13,016
I mean, my parents always said I sounded like Mickey Mouse

536
00:20:13,016 --> 00:20:13,896
as a little kid.

537
00:20:14,616 --> 00:20:16,656
And I probably said the full name.

538
00:20:16,836 --> 00:20:18,476
Yeah, I'll find a clip at some point.

539
00:20:18,736 --> 00:20:20,936
But I think I was constantly just saying,

540
00:20:20,976 --> 00:20:24,736
Mommy, in falsetto, as I did in this instance.

541
00:20:24,796 --> 00:20:27,436
So I made a point of reading the entire sign

542
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:31,116
very carefully out loud, showing that I could comprehend

543
00:20:31,116 --> 00:20:32,816
all of the safety warnings.

544
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:36,636
And then I just made kind of an educated decision.

545
00:20:37,296 --> 00:20:39,616
But what I didn't know is that I just took them out

546
00:20:39,616 --> 00:20:42,536
of Fantasyland entirely, and I did it sly,

547
00:20:42,716 --> 00:20:45,016
like, why don't we go see something else,

548
00:20:45,456 --> 00:20:47,256
as if I was not just a...

549
00:20:47,256 --> 00:20:49,096
Had you not been on any of the other dark rides

550
00:20:49,096 --> 00:20:50,196
in Fantasyland at that point?

551
00:20:50,396 --> 00:20:53,036
I think I, I'm not sure.

552
00:20:53,096 --> 00:20:54,556
I think I must have been on one of them.

553
00:20:54,556 --> 00:20:56,196
And as you said, Peter Pan is fine.

554
00:20:56,336 --> 00:20:57,896
And then you go on the thing,

555
00:20:57,996 --> 00:20:59,896
we're talking about the Disneyland version there,

556
00:20:59,896 --> 00:21:02,816
which is not that scary,

557
00:21:02,836 --> 00:21:04,476
not as much as the one that you went on.

558
00:21:04,476 --> 00:21:05,636
Still kind of scary.

559
00:21:05,956 --> 00:21:09,056
I might have skipped it like a bunch of times in a row.

560
00:21:09,096 --> 00:21:11,156
I think I saw the word scary,

561
00:21:11,376 --> 00:21:13,996
and that was enough to get me to bail entirely.

562
00:21:14,236 --> 00:21:16,836
And I might have ended up going on it and thinking,

563
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,096
what was the problem?

564
00:21:18,216 --> 00:21:19,356
What was the fuss here?

565
00:21:19,756 --> 00:21:22,036
Why did I avoid this for so long?

566
00:21:22,256 --> 00:21:24,276
Mommy is probably what I'd said.

567
00:21:24,456 --> 00:21:28,556
And just to confirm, this was the post-New Fantasyland

568
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,776
83 redo?

569
00:21:30,096 --> 00:21:30,656
Yes, correct.

570
00:21:31,336 --> 00:21:33,756
Where they kind of softened it a little,

571
00:21:33,956 --> 00:21:35,196
but it seemed like they,

572
00:21:35,296 --> 00:21:37,516
that was when they added scary to the title

573
00:21:37,516 --> 00:21:39,216
and put up the warning sign,

574
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:42,256
even though they had dialed back a little on the terror.

575
00:21:42,376 --> 00:21:43,476
They made it less scary.

576
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:44,856
They made the rides less scary.

577
00:21:44,976 --> 00:21:47,176
I mean, the redo in Florida was in the nineties,

578
00:21:47,276 --> 00:21:48,856
but the one in the eighties, yeah, makes it...

579
00:21:48,856 --> 00:21:53,396
But the redo they did was putting the word scary

580
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:54,636
in front of the ride.

581
00:21:54,636 --> 00:21:58,116
And that is more, just that was more terrifying to me

582
00:21:58,816 --> 00:22:00,276
than anything internally in the ride

583
00:22:00,276 --> 00:22:01,336
that they could have done.

584
00:22:02,676 --> 00:22:05,896
So if you want me to avoid something, put the word scary.

585
00:22:06,316 --> 00:22:09,036
If there's a party going on, you don't want me at the party,

586
00:22:09,456 --> 00:22:11,676
say my scary birthday party,

587
00:22:12,016 --> 00:22:14,716
and I'll call my mommy and not go.

588
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,956
Well, and a big thing with these changes

589
00:22:16,956 --> 00:22:20,556
is that they put more of the dwarves in

590
00:22:20,556 --> 00:22:21,956
and they put Snow White in,

591
00:22:21,976 --> 00:22:25,336
because for the longest time, she was not in,

592
00:22:25,436 --> 00:22:26,896
besides a brief period in the seventies,

593
00:22:26,896 --> 00:22:30,316
she was not in there, because you were Snow White.

594
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:32,776
You were supposed to be experiencing it

595
00:22:32,776 --> 00:22:34,916
from her perspective, what she would live,

596
00:22:35,056 --> 00:22:38,616
which is all the fantasy land stuff.

597
00:22:38,636 --> 00:22:40,856
When it first opened, that was the concept.

598
00:22:41,496 --> 00:22:44,596
And people did not get that

599
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:48,416
because theme parks didn't exist.

600
00:22:48,496 --> 00:22:51,716
Like, I feel like now you can get away with a little more,

601
00:22:52,156 --> 00:22:54,496
although now it's kind of like, you know,

602
00:22:54,496 --> 00:22:56,796
you want to see, people want to see Optimus Prime.

603
00:22:56,796 --> 00:22:58,196
They want to see Harry Potter.

604
00:22:59,136 --> 00:23:01,036
Right, there's a balance between that

605
00:23:01,036 --> 00:23:02,316
on all the rides that have to do,

606
00:23:02,336 --> 00:23:04,916
like you want to sort of experience what they experience,

607
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,756
but also like if you're on the Snow White ride,

608
00:23:06,756 --> 00:23:08,576
you kind of want to see Snow White do something.

609
00:23:08,936 --> 00:23:12,076
And how are you a group of nine people,

610
00:23:12,196 --> 00:23:13,816
one young girl?

611
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:15,696
How are you a single?

612
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:16,716
That doesn't really make sense.

613
00:23:16,856 --> 00:23:20,496
Can I ask, do you have any memory of your first time

614
00:23:20,496 --> 00:23:23,056
other than just some cool leather jacket boy

615
00:23:23,056 --> 00:23:25,076
getting on the ride and saying, I'm scared of this?

616
00:23:25,496 --> 00:23:26,376
Lighting cigarettes on it.

617
00:23:26,376 --> 00:23:27,676
When we were talking about this,

618
00:23:27,676 --> 00:23:29,056
I was trying to remember that

619
00:23:29,056 --> 00:23:31,356
because I was a very nervous, scared child.

620
00:23:31,816 --> 00:23:34,296
And now I am a very nervous man.

621
00:23:35,276 --> 00:23:37,796
I was a worry wart as a kid.

622
00:23:37,956 --> 00:23:41,096
Like I gave myself stomach aches just all the time,

623
00:23:41,116 --> 00:23:41,956
just nonstop.

624
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:47,116
And my parents do have a story of me freaking out

625
00:23:47,116 --> 00:23:52,296
in a ride, but it was Pirates of the Caribbean.

626
00:23:52,436 --> 00:23:55,056
Like that was one of the first things they took me on.

627
00:23:55,056 --> 00:23:57,476
And my dad just texted me because I was asking him

628
00:23:57,476 --> 00:24:00,916
about this, how old would I have been on this trip?

629
00:24:01,956 --> 00:24:04,856
Because this is a story my parents like to tell.

630
00:24:05,356 --> 00:24:09,216
And he wrote back, it would have been like February 88.

631
00:24:09,336 --> 00:24:11,796
So just under, I would have been just under

632
00:24:11,796 --> 00:24:14,496
two and a half years.

633
00:24:14,596 --> 00:24:16,196
My brother hadn't been born yet.

634
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:19,016
And they wanted to go when I was still young,

635
00:24:19,156 --> 00:24:22,016
but they knew that if they waited for my brother to be born,

636
00:24:22,076 --> 00:24:26,076
like it would be another X number of years.

637
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:27,756
So they wanted to go down.

638
00:24:28,696 --> 00:24:31,596
So we went down, one of the first, if not the first ride

639
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:33,576
they took me on was Pirates of the Caribbean.

640
00:24:33,696 --> 00:24:35,276
And I screened my head off.

641
00:24:35,476 --> 00:24:36,756
And it wasn't because of the pirates,

642
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,276
because of how dark the ride was.

643
00:24:39,496 --> 00:24:41,636
I did not like the darkness as a kid.

644
00:24:41,756 --> 00:24:45,156
I think that factors into Snow White for me personally,

645
00:24:45,156 --> 00:24:46,336
and I bet for you as well.

646
00:24:46,436 --> 00:24:47,296
It's just darkness.

647
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:51,576
So my quick thinking parents similarly were like,

648
00:24:51,576 --> 00:24:53,056
is he gonna do this the whole trip?

649
00:24:53,096 --> 00:24:53,856
What are we gonna do?

650
00:24:54,136 --> 00:24:56,316
And they were at the gift, you know,

651
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:59,016
you exit into the gift shop and they're like,

652
00:24:59,016 --> 00:25:00,876
oh my God, there's a little key chain flashlight.

653
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:02,716
Let's give him the little key chain flat.

654
00:25:03,036 --> 00:25:05,036
So they bought a little key chain flash and they're like,

655
00:25:05,176 --> 00:25:08,036
okay, so why don't we go on another,

656
00:25:08,136 --> 00:25:09,436
or why don't we go on this again?

657
00:25:09,616 --> 00:25:10,756
But we got this little flashlight.

658
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:14,176
So if you get scared, just point it at the ground

659
00:25:14,176 --> 00:25:15,476
and it won't be dark.

660
00:25:15,976 --> 00:25:17,076
And it just worked.

661
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:20,756
It worked instantly for that and for everything else,

662
00:25:20,756 --> 00:25:21,656
including Snow White.

663
00:25:21,776 --> 00:25:24,676
So I emailed my dad and asked him,

664
00:25:24,676 --> 00:25:27,956
was I scared of Snow White?

665
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:31,136
And he said, I don't remember you being scared on this.

666
00:25:31,216 --> 00:25:33,816
I do remember the flashlight being brought out,

667
00:25:33,856 --> 00:25:34,956
but you liked it.

668
00:25:36,156 --> 00:25:39,276
You should ask him how bright was the flashlight

669
00:25:39,276 --> 00:25:41,996
and did it ruin the ride for the people behind us?

670
00:25:41,996 --> 00:25:43,516
No, because they taught me.

671
00:25:44,256 --> 00:25:46,056
Don't bother other people with it.

672
00:25:46,256 --> 00:25:49,196
Aim it like in your hand or aim it at the ground.

673
00:25:49,676 --> 00:25:50,116
Okay.

674
00:25:49,776 --> 00:25:51,696
Just to see something light at all.

675
00:25:51,696 --> 00:25:53,716
Just to see some light.

676
00:25:53,876 --> 00:25:56,736
And then I think I was just fine with it.

677
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:59,116
And yeah, I mean, I still have,

678
00:25:59,156 --> 00:26:01,896
it's back in my mom's house somewhere.

679
00:26:02,056 --> 00:26:02,756
Oh, he's actually exists.

680
00:26:02,756 --> 00:26:03,616
I still have it, yeah.

681
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,416
I don't think it stopped working years ago.

682
00:26:06,436 --> 00:26:07,876
Well, when we go to Halloween Horror Nights,

683
00:26:07,876 --> 00:26:09,956
you're gonna have to bring that flashlight with you.

684
00:26:12,016 --> 00:26:15,276
Wait, now, hang on, wait, that was a pretty revealing,

685
00:26:15,676 --> 00:26:18,056
you just don't, now you don't do Halloween Horror Nights

686
00:26:18,056 --> 00:26:18,716
is what you're saying.

687
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:19,816
Okay.

688
00:26:20,156 --> 00:26:21,356
Well, I don't either.

689
00:26:21,596 --> 00:26:22,316
Yeah, none of us.

690
00:26:22,436 --> 00:26:24,236
But at a certain point, maybe not this year,

691
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,436
we're gonna have to do it.

692
00:26:25,436 --> 00:26:26,216
Yeah, we should just be,

693
00:26:26,216 --> 00:26:28,996
we should be calling this month Scaredy Cattober.

694
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:31,696
That's essentially what we're doing here.

695
00:26:32,496 --> 00:26:34,576
We will tease, we've got a little bit of

696
00:26:34,576 --> 00:26:36,076
We've got some fights coming up.

697
00:26:36,076 --> 00:26:37,496
We've got some fights coming up.

698
00:26:37,836 --> 00:26:40,336
We are dealing with actually scary things.

699
00:26:40,476 --> 00:26:43,236
It's not all gonna be a child's ride.

700
00:26:43,236 --> 00:26:44,156
Pranks and goofs, yes.

701
00:26:44,276 --> 00:26:46,276
We were scared of when we were three or five.

702
00:26:46,676 --> 00:26:47,876
Yeah, but I'm just saying,

703
00:26:47,876 --> 00:26:49,556
we're opening up, we're giving you

704
00:26:49,556 --> 00:26:50,856
those vulnerable moments.

705
00:26:51,036 --> 00:26:51,616
That's in our lives.

706
00:26:51,616 --> 00:26:53,096
I'm saying, just get your flashlight ready, Jason,

707
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,696
because we're gonna scare the shit out of you.

708
00:26:55,756 --> 00:26:57,476
I had a little MacGuffin flashlight

709
00:26:57,476 --> 00:26:58,956
that solved all the problems.

710
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:01,056
And that's how it was good to go.

711
00:27:01,136 --> 00:27:04,036
Although, I would still have to hype myself.

712
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:06,296
I loved the one at mansion, but I was like,

713
00:27:06,596 --> 00:27:07,936
just gotta get past that hanging.

714
00:27:09,176 --> 00:27:09,416
And not-

715
00:27:09,416 --> 00:27:10,636
Oh, the hanging stressed you out.

716
00:27:11,056 --> 00:27:12,276
Yeah, the hanging man.

717
00:27:12,736 --> 00:27:15,836
I think because it's a constant narration,

718
00:27:15,836 --> 00:27:18,016
it's a constant narration, the stretching room,

719
00:27:18,296 --> 00:27:20,536
and then it's the sudden lightning strike.

720
00:27:20,896 --> 00:27:22,136
Yeah, I don't know, that would never-

721
00:27:22,136 --> 00:27:24,076
I don't have a memory of that bothering me.

722
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:24,596
I don't know why.

723
00:27:24,736 --> 00:27:26,736
I think I just didn't like sudden surprises,

724
00:27:26,876 --> 00:27:29,256
like the lightning strike or the heads popping up.

725
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:31,036
And you're not gonna like the sudden surprise

726
00:27:31,036 --> 00:27:33,836
of a 21-year-old in a leather face mask

727
00:27:33,836 --> 00:27:36,056
jumping out at you when we go to Universal.

728
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:37,576
I mean, we'll see.

729
00:27:37,776 --> 00:27:38,996
You're not gonna like that either.

730
00:27:39,236 --> 00:27:41,816
Okay, let's not gang up on Jason.

731
00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:42,596
I'm so tough now.

732
00:27:43,336 --> 00:27:44,036
I'm such a tough guy.

733
00:27:44,036 --> 00:27:45,256
We are believing you.

734
00:27:45,356 --> 00:27:48,396
To tell us, they are, it sounds like a chore,

735
00:27:48,556 --> 00:27:50,836
but they are at the Hollywood One selling

736
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:57,076
limited alcohol refreshments at Hollywood Horror Nights now.

737
00:27:57,596 --> 00:28:00,036
Orlando, I believe, is the wild, wild west,

738
00:28:00,216 --> 00:28:02,276
and I don't know that they really changed their alcohol laws.

739
00:28:02,276 --> 00:28:04,536
Yeah, it's like Mardi Gras down there during this thing,

740
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,976
which we gotta do that too one of these days.

741
00:28:07,256 --> 00:28:08,016
What, the-

742
00:28:08,016 --> 00:28:09,576
The Orlando Horror Nights.

743
00:28:09,936 --> 00:28:12,916
Well, sure, you gotta compare the more heavily IP-based

744
00:28:13,676 --> 00:28:17,136
Hollywood mazes to the more original attractions,

745
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:20,376
which are called houses in Orlando.

746
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:22,656
And we'll get to that in a future episode.

747
00:28:22,956 --> 00:28:24,116
Next week or two weeks from now?

748
00:28:25,596 --> 00:28:27,316
Snow White, back to Snow White.

749
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:28,196
Back to Snow White.

750
00:28:28,396 --> 00:28:30,116
We're just gonna have to move to Orlando

751
00:28:30,116 --> 00:28:31,576
for like three months.

752
00:28:31,816 --> 00:28:32,056
Forever.

753
00:28:32,116 --> 00:28:34,616
To cover all of the, well, there's an idea, yes.

754
00:28:35,776 --> 00:28:40,456
Let's talk about some of the basic tenets of this ride

755
00:28:40,456 --> 00:28:45,236
as it does not relate to us peeing our pants as children.

756
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:49,936
Do you realize this is the first opening day attraction

757
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,756
we've ever talked about?

758
00:28:52,556 --> 00:28:53,516
Correct me if I'm wrong.

759
00:28:53,876 --> 00:28:55,456
I don't believe we've talked about

760
00:28:55,456 --> 00:28:56,096
a Disneyland opening day.

761
00:28:56,096 --> 00:28:56,856
I think that's right.

762
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,096
That seems right.

763
00:28:58,676 --> 00:29:00,596
We have not talked about any of the primary

764
00:29:00,596 --> 00:29:02,616
Fantasyland rides of which this is one.

765
00:29:02,676 --> 00:29:05,936
It was an opening day attraction in all of the original

766
00:29:05,936 --> 00:29:09,356
Magic Kingdoms in Disneyland, in Disney World, in Tokyo,

767
00:29:09,696 --> 00:29:13,396
and in Paris, and that was the last of the Snow White

768
00:29:13,396 --> 00:29:14,996
adventure rides that have been built.

769
00:29:15,376 --> 00:29:21,196
It is no longer in Florida, which I guess the now

770
00:29:21,196 --> 00:29:24,916
Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, which is a newer ride.

771
00:29:25,016 --> 00:29:26,776
And that's in Shanghai as well, I believe.

772
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:27,856
I think it is, yeah.

773
00:29:27,876 --> 00:29:30,696
And Hong Kong, if you like Snow White, you're out of luck.

774
00:29:31,276 --> 00:29:32,756
I believe, I don't think they have a...

775
00:29:32,756 --> 00:29:36,256
Orlando became, is it called Princess Fairytale Hall?

776
00:29:36,596 --> 00:29:37,276
Something like that.

777
00:29:37,316 --> 00:29:38,056
Something like that.

778
00:29:38,056 --> 00:29:39,496
Princess photo opportunity.

779
00:29:40,396 --> 00:29:42,776
Fascinatingly designed, it's crazy where they have

780
00:29:42,776 --> 00:29:46,156
multiple characters, but then there's switchbacks,

781
00:29:46,496 --> 00:29:49,256
and so you could, they rotate the print,

782
00:29:49,516 --> 00:29:52,936
but the geography of that is very interesting to me.

783
00:29:52,936 --> 00:29:56,096
How they navigate it, so you don't see the other princesses,

784
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,796
you only see the one you're going to meet.

785
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,156
I did not do that.

786
00:29:59,156 --> 00:30:01,676
I took many, as we know, I took many photos in Orlando

787
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:04,956
with many characters, but I did not, as a lone man,

788
00:30:05,396 --> 00:30:06,976
go and take photos with the princesses.

789
00:30:06,976 --> 00:30:09,416
Did you go to the princess zone?

790
00:30:09,836 --> 00:30:11,016
No, I've just read about it.

791
00:30:11,016 --> 00:30:11,516
Oh, okay.

792
00:30:11,516 --> 00:30:13,956
There's a smaller version in Anaheim, right?

793
00:30:13,956 --> 00:30:16,536
You just read about how the doors work

794
00:30:16,536 --> 00:30:18,476
of the princess show.

795
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:21,196
I'd like to see you snooping around there in Orlando,

796
00:30:21,456 --> 00:30:25,096
noticing that you can't see the other princesses in here,

797
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,876
You gotta play it a little more cool at Orlando

798
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:29,316
for inspecting this stuff.

799
00:30:29,476 --> 00:30:30,756
I was down at the park recently,

800
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,996
and no one cares in Anaheim.

801
00:30:33,136 --> 00:30:35,616
Right, but you have to bring a friend or a wife,

802
00:30:35,676 --> 00:30:37,616
a person playing your wife around

803
00:30:37,616 --> 00:30:39,996
to make it not suspicious if you were just going.

804
00:30:40,176 --> 00:30:41,576
You have to hire an actress.

805
00:30:42,136 --> 00:30:43,976
Yeah, you have to hire a local actress to play his wife

806
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:47,196
so we can go snoop around the Princess Fantasy Fair area

807
00:30:47,196 --> 00:30:48,696
so we can see the different ways

808
00:30:48,696 --> 00:30:49,976
that they hide the princesses.

809
00:30:49,976 --> 00:30:51,956
That sounds like a very charming rom-com

810
00:30:51,956 --> 00:30:54,756
that nowadays Netflix would probably make it,

811
00:30:54,756 --> 00:30:55,676
it would just get buried.

812
00:30:56,336 --> 00:30:58,456
That's fine, as long as you get some money.

813
00:30:58,756 --> 00:30:59,116
That's true.

814
00:30:59,176 --> 00:31:00,836
Your SAG minimum or your WGA minimum.

815
00:31:00,956 --> 00:31:01,596
Oh yeah, sure.

816
00:31:01,896 --> 00:31:04,956
He's gonna star in a movie where he hires a woman

817
00:31:04,956 --> 00:31:07,236
to go around Disney World with.

818
00:31:07,496 --> 00:31:09,636
He'll have to have the permission of Disney to do it,

819
00:31:09,636 --> 00:31:11,656
but he's only getting SAG minimum,

820
00:31:12,196 --> 00:31:14,956
even though this is his film based on his story.

821
00:31:15,576 --> 00:31:17,896
It could be like Escape from Tomorrow, I guess.

822
00:31:18,256 --> 00:31:19,976
It could be another gorilla.

823
00:31:20,096 --> 00:31:23,296
We should reclaim the genre of secret leap shot

824
00:31:23,296 --> 00:31:24,876
in theme park films.

825
00:31:24,876 --> 00:31:25,836
This is the perfect place.

826
00:31:25,976 --> 00:31:28,716
Well, I have to say, I mean, it's been a year now,

827
00:31:28,716 --> 00:31:30,756
so I could say I thought the Florida Project

828
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,536
did it very well.

829
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:36,356
Well, it's not only, only a little bit of it is in the parks.

830
00:31:36,356 --> 00:31:40,036
Only a little bit, and I found it so moving

831
00:31:40,036 --> 00:31:41,956
the way they did it.

832
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:43,216
Yeah, that's fantastic.

833
00:31:43,476 --> 00:31:43,856
Great film.

834
00:31:44,816 --> 00:31:48,036
I'd like to talk, since this is an opening day attraction,

835
00:31:48,516 --> 00:31:50,876
I'd like to talk about the first thing ever filmed

836
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:54,096
in a Disney park, which is the opening day special.

837
00:31:54,576 --> 00:31:56,576
Have you guys watched the opening day special

838
00:31:56,576 --> 00:31:57,796
in full, ever?

839
00:31:57,936 --> 00:32:00,016
Like the one with, like,

840
00:32:01,156 --> 00:32:02,556
Reagan, what's the guy?

841
00:32:02,836 --> 00:32:03,196
Art Linkletter.

842
00:32:03,276 --> 00:32:03,896
Yeah, Art Linkletter.

843
00:32:04,076 --> 00:32:04,616
Yeah, I've seen that.

844
00:32:04,876 --> 00:32:08,076
And like, there's a lot of weird pauses in the feed

845
00:32:08,076 --> 00:32:10,336
and like, there's confusion going on.

846
00:32:10,376 --> 00:32:13,356
And weird parts where Bob Cummings can see Art Linkletter

847
00:32:13,356 --> 00:32:15,896
and they know that this is a part in the broadcast

848
00:32:15,896 --> 00:32:17,236
where he's supposed to be talking,

849
00:32:17,416 --> 00:32:18,896
but he doesn't have a microphone,

850
00:32:19,156 --> 00:32:21,796
and they cut to him stomping around and loudly

851
00:32:21,796 --> 00:32:25,356
gesticulating and pointing to him and his ears

852
00:32:25,356 --> 00:32:27,516
and his mouth, and now he has no way of.

853
00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:27,916
Right.

854
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:32,536
And due to fair airtime laws at the time,

855
00:32:32,676 --> 00:32:35,656
they occasionally cut to a young Gore Vidal ranting

856
00:32:35,656 --> 00:32:41,056
about the fall of society and capitalism just unwarranted.

857
00:32:41,896 --> 00:32:45,056
He was sitting in the Mickey Mouse planner in the front.

858
00:32:46,696 --> 00:32:48,696
His head was the Mickey's nose.

859
00:32:49,136 --> 00:32:52,236
He did get to eat the very first Mickey ice cream bar.

860
00:32:53,756 --> 00:32:56,456
I may be upset about a lot, but this is delicious.

861
00:32:56,536 --> 00:32:58,696
That is so, I mean, cause you know,

862
00:32:58,796 --> 00:33:01,276
Noam Chomsky's email is just, it's public.

863
00:33:01,616 --> 00:33:04,416
It's public and you can email him, it'll write you back.

864
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,036
You could email Noam Chomsky and say,

865
00:33:07,116 --> 00:33:09,396
hey, have you had a Mickey Mouse ice cream bar?

866
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:10,276
Do you think he'd respond?

867
00:33:10,276 --> 00:33:10,996
What do you think about the whiskey?

868
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:11,656
Well, who knows?

869
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,116
Do you think he would respond while we're doing it?

870
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,796
Can you email him right now

871
00:33:14,796 --> 00:33:17,236
and they'll see if he responds by the end of our recording

872
00:33:17,236 --> 00:33:19,476
and by the time it airs?

873
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,316
He could, but we'd lose Jason for a while.

874
00:33:22,656 --> 00:33:24,576
I can try, but I only have touch screen devices

875
00:33:24,576 --> 00:33:25,916
and I'm trying to hold a microphone.

876
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:27,156
I could do it by,

877
00:33:27,176 --> 00:33:28,656
We'll email him after this.

878
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:30,336
Let's try it by next week.

879
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:30,956
We'll find out.

880
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:31,676
By next week we'll find out.

881
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:34,956
Yeah, let's give a little Noam a little more time.

882
00:33:35,396 --> 00:33:35,496
Yeah.

883
00:33:36,456 --> 00:33:40,496
But so there's one little bit of the,

884
00:33:40,696 --> 00:33:42,456
since we haven't talked about original Fantasyland,

885
00:33:42,576 --> 00:33:44,216
there's a little thing that I'd like to play.

886
00:33:44,516 --> 00:33:47,616
My favorite part of the opening day special,

887
00:33:47,916 --> 00:33:50,936
which is the lowering of the drawbridge

888
00:33:50,936 --> 00:33:55,956
to let kids into Fantasyland for the first time.

889
00:33:56,836 --> 00:34:01,516
And boy, do I like the voice that is in this video.

890
00:34:01,616 --> 00:34:02,916
Here we go.

891
00:34:04,816 --> 00:34:06,676
Open the Fantasyland.

892
00:34:14,492 --> 00:34:17,632
Open the Fantasyland Castle!

893
00:34:18,792 --> 00:34:21,872
I love that voiceover, I love crazy old men.

894
00:34:21,892 --> 00:34:24,592
The dog was really stirred by your impression.

895
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,152
Did it make Edwin freak out?

896
00:34:26,372 --> 00:34:31,052
I used to, our cat, I used to sometimes sing like Ringo.

897
00:34:31,432 --> 00:34:34,612
I'd sing that song, you don't love me anymore!

898
00:34:36,252 --> 00:34:39,372
And then our cat would flip out.

899
00:34:39,392 --> 00:34:42,132
That was like the exact register that she could not handle.

900
00:34:42,252 --> 00:34:45,552
Edwin's tail is slightly wagging, so I don't know if he hates it.

901
00:34:45,832 --> 00:34:48,312
He might like it, he just came to hear it more clearly.

902
00:34:48,772 --> 00:34:51,632
No, no, no, no, I don't smoke anymore.

903
00:34:52,212 --> 00:34:54,372
I like to write a little bit up on the floor.

904
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:57,332
It's the Ringo No-No song, look that one up.

905
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:58,112
That's my favorite.

906
00:34:58,532 --> 00:35:03,072
Anyway, that makes me, I like that VO, and I want that to play,

907
00:35:03,512 --> 00:35:07,632
I want an equivalent of that to play at every part of the park

908
00:35:07,632 --> 00:35:10,072
before things open.

909
00:35:10,072 --> 00:35:14,732
For example, open the Napa wine patio

910
00:35:14,732 --> 00:35:19,252
for the day drunks of the world!

911
00:35:20,072 --> 00:35:23,292
How much more fun would Disneyland be?

912
00:35:24,212 --> 00:35:26,432
Open the women's restroom!

913
00:35:27,672 --> 00:35:32,172
Let's get Scott Gander a Fess Parker winery Riesling.

914
00:35:32,712 --> 00:35:34,732
He's thirsty, my man!

915
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:39,392
The Riesling lovers of the world!

916
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:44,732
Ralph Brennan's Jazz Kitchen is now serving dinner!

917
00:35:45,032 --> 00:35:48,072
The finest jambalaya in the world!

918
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,932
Splitsville luxury bowling!

919
00:35:52,732 --> 00:35:53,472
Luxury lanes.

920
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:58,492
Open the cat door for the feral cats of the world!

921
00:35:59,172 --> 00:36:02,312
Well, please do that and let me do it.

922
00:36:02,552 --> 00:36:06,972
I want to be that guy, hire me as the official Disneyland bellower.

923
00:36:08,092 --> 00:36:09,792
Everything, the children of the world,

924
00:36:09,812 --> 00:36:12,692
they repeated that when they redid Fantasyland.

925
00:36:12,812 --> 00:36:13,092
Yeah.

926
00:36:13,252 --> 00:36:15,352
They said the same thing, we're opening it up,

927
00:36:15,652 --> 00:36:17,492
the drawbridge for the children of the world.

928
00:36:17,732 --> 00:36:21,572
The second, only the second time that drawbridge was ever lowered.

929
00:36:22,612 --> 00:36:25,812
Yes, because when they redid all of the rides in 1983,

930
00:36:26,232 --> 00:36:29,872
Fantasyland was just closed entirely because the whole thing

931
00:36:29,872 --> 00:36:33,732
kind of got got wrecked and the rides were like not just slightly altered,

932
00:36:33,872 --> 00:36:36,192
but completely changed and lengthened.

933
00:36:37,532 --> 00:36:42,732
By our now best friend, Tony Baxter, he redid all the facades.

934
00:36:42,792 --> 00:36:46,812
So all of the more ornate versions of the rides that you see today,

935
00:36:46,932 --> 00:36:49,292
the fact that it actually looks like a Bavarian town.

936
00:36:49,692 --> 00:36:53,192
And he made all of the rides, including Snow White, 25% longer,

937
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:55,732
because he thought if people don't like the new versions,

938
00:36:55,792 --> 00:36:59,832
at least they will get more bang for their buck, more value.

939
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:05,892
The parents of the world will get more value for their admission fees.

940
00:37:07,752 --> 00:37:11,072
But yeah, but so when they do, because there just was no Fantasyland

941
00:37:11,072 --> 00:37:14,332
for a couple of years, they raised the drawbridge.

942
00:37:14,412 --> 00:37:17,492
And that's described by Imagineers as a very dramatic moment

943
00:37:17,492 --> 00:37:20,392
and a very dramatic moment to re lowering it.

944
00:37:20,552 --> 00:37:22,552
It would seem like it would be very dark.

945
00:37:23,352 --> 00:37:26,272
Yeah, it would seem like it would have been better to like just put up a sheet,

946
00:37:26,872 --> 00:37:29,752
like keep the bridge down, put up a sheet in there that just says,

947
00:37:29,752 --> 00:37:30,892
like, don't come in here.

948
00:37:30,892 --> 00:37:33,432
Like if you want, you can walk in part of the castle, but then there's

949
00:37:33,432 --> 00:37:36,692
maybe not a sheet, maybe a wall, maybe an actual physical wall.

950
00:37:36,892 --> 00:37:40,212
That's like, you know, we'll be back in the next year.

951
00:37:40,272 --> 00:37:40,852
Hmm.

952
00:37:41,112 --> 00:37:43,972
But I think it was a I think it was a bold statement.

953
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:47,572
It was indicating that big things are not even going to be able to recognize it

954
00:37:47,572 --> 00:37:49,772
when it comes back, which is true.

955
00:37:49,772 --> 00:37:50,692
They did a great job with that.

956
00:37:50,732 --> 00:37:53,392
I have one more thing about the opening day special, which is the I watched

957
00:37:53,392 --> 00:37:56,832
they kind of there's a little like opening musical number,

958
00:37:57,092 --> 00:37:58,792
which is very poorly organized.

959
00:37:58,812 --> 00:38:01,972
And boy, the old there's a lot of videos on YouTube that go into this.

960
00:38:02,052 --> 00:38:05,812
What the characters looked like in the early days.

961
00:38:05,812 --> 00:38:07,392
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

962
00:38:07,492 --> 00:38:12,072
Mickey, they they they it was like a last minute idea on Walt's part.

963
00:38:12,232 --> 00:38:15,812
And he reached out to the ice capades, which was the only thing at that point

964
00:38:15,812 --> 00:38:20,452
where there had been walk around Disney characters and he got these ice costumes,

965
00:38:20,452 --> 00:38:24,712
which all had these big, bizarre slices in their face.

966
00:38:24,932 --> 00:38:28,612
Like said, like the Mickey mask would go mesh every

967
00:38:28,612 --> 00:38:32,152
or every once in a while, like in the cheeks and in the forehead,

968
00:38:33,492 --> 00:38:36,672
because the the ice dancers needed maximum visibility.

969
00:38:37,552 --> 00:38:39,472
So the first couple of years of Disneyland,

970
00:38:39,552 --> 00:38:42,512
you're looking at these bizarre ice uniforms for all the characters.

971
00:38:42,512 --> 00:38:44,312
And that's that's true of the dwarfs.

972
00:38:44,552 --> 00:38:46,812
Also, the dwarfs were super terrifying.

973
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:49,592
So in the opening day special, you get to see all of the rides

974
00:38:49,592 --> 00:38:52,032
kind of one by one open and they show clips of the movie.

975
00:38:52,232 --> 00:38:56,212
And you see a ton of kids all flood into the Snow White

976
00:38:56,212 --> 00:38:58,472
ride when the gates lifted.

977
00:38:58,912 --> 00:39:01,692
And Bob Cummings, one of the hosts of the special, is sitting

978
00:39:01,692 --> 00:39:05,232
in one of the cars and like, OK, come on in, kids.

979
00:39:05,432 --> 00:39:06,252
All right. Cool.

980
00:39:06,652 --> 00:39:09,592
Take it easy. Slow it down.

981
00:39:09,732 --> 00:39:11,472
And not all of you not to.

982
00:39:11,472 --> 00:39:12,912
Hey, well, one at a time, maybe.

983
00:39:13,212 --> 00:39:15,352
OK, good. Hey, get it.

984
00:39:15,372 --> 00:39:17,732
Get off my cord. OK, good. Fine.

985
00:39:17,812 --> 00:39:22,352
Very good. He like scolds the children for standing on his mic cord.

986
00:39:22,592 --> 00:39:23,912
And it is like it is chaos.

987
00:39:24,032 --> 00:39:25,832
The entire opening day special is chaos.

988
00:39:25,912 --> 00:39:28,752
But this was one little sliver of a moment I enjoyed.

989
00:39:28,872 --> 00:39:29,912
That's great. Yeah.

990
00:39:29,912 --> 00:39:33,652
I mean, from the way anyone ever describes that opening day, it's like,

991
00:39:33,692 --> 00:39:37,932
what is it? 60,000 people, something insane, like descend upon Anaheim.

992
00:39:38,232 --> 00:39:41,252
And there's parts of the park unfinished and there's like paths

993
00:39:41,252 --> 00:39:42,332
that lead to nothing.

994
00:39:42,652 --> 00:39:43,712
And bootleg tickets.

995
00:39:43,912 --> 00:39:46,112
Someone figured out how to scout tickets.

996
00:39:46,152 --> 00:39:48,672
That's why there were so many more than expected.

997
00:39:48,892 --> 00:39:51,692
Yeah. And then there's like just people like people describe

998
00:39:51,692 --> 00:39:55,912
like cement drying still the first day and women's shoes getting stuck in cement.

999
00:39:56,192 --> 00:39:59,892
And the only shoes they had to give them were the Mocketsons.

1000
00:39:59,992 --> 00:40:01,272
For sale and frontier.

1001
00:40:01,372 --> 00:40:02,492
Like they were. Is that a true thing?

1002
00:40:02,492 --> 00:40:03,792
Are you joking? I know.

1003
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:05,552
I believe that is a thing I've heard.

1004
00:40:05,952 --> 00:40:07,012
Really? They were handing out Mocketsons.

1005
00:40:07,012 --> 00:40:09,492
They were handing out free Mocketsons because women's high heels

1006
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:10,432
got stuck in the cement.

1007
00:40:10,712 --> 00:40:13,212
Yeah, that's that's the urban legend I always heard.

1008
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:16,392
Yeah, because people are getting stuck in the cement and then their shoes

1009
00:40:16,392 --> 00:40:20,072
were dinged up or ruined and they had to give them something.

1010
00:40:20,112 --> 00:40:22,412
Really? We got to look into this.

1011
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:24,732
If you guys at home have any

1012
00:40:24,732 --> 00:40:28,632
information about the free Mocketsons that people got opening day.

1013
00:40:28,972 --> 00:40:30,632
That's the old wise tale I always heard.

1014
00:40:30,772 --> 00:40:32,332
That's crazy. I mean, it also seems just crazy.

1015
00:40:32,372 --> 00:40:33,652
Disney would give something for free.

1016
00:40:34,692 --> 00:40:35,492
Yeah. Yeah, true.

1017
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:36,832
They just marked them down.

1018
00:40:37,772 --> 00:40:40,872
Well, we'll give you a five percent discount for getting your high heels

1019
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:43,012
stuck in the not dry cement.

1020
00:40:43,172 --> 00:40:46,812
Well, they gave out ice capades skates for free.

1021
00:40:47,432 --> 00:40:48,652
So you could.

1022
00:40:48,912 --> 00:40:52,132
All right. We can replace your shoes, but you will have to walk around

1023
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:53,692
concrete on skates.

1024
00:40:53,832 --> 00:40:57,032
But if you can handle the balance, this should get you going.

1025
00:40:57,112 --> 00:40:58,492
It was chaos. Yeah.

1026
00:41:00,132 --> 00:41:00,872
Oh, no, go ahead.

1027
00:41:01,012 --> 00:41:04,492
I was just going to say the ride, I just both versions of the ride.

1028
00:41:04,972 --> 00:41:06,792
This is something I don't know if you guys have the same thing.

1029
00:41:07,052 --> 00:41:11,552
When we were kids, one of the most exciting aspects of getting on the ride

1030
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,172
was seeing which car you were going to get.

1031
00:41:14,352 --> 00:41:15,252
Oh, yeah, sure.

1032
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:18,552
And we would like, well, I let's I will go around.

1033
00:41:18,652 --> 00:41:21,992
Well, all once we'll say what character we want, because they have all seven

1034
00:41:21,992 --> 00:41:23,052
dwarves on these cars.

1035
00:41:23,592 --> 00:41:26,812
So what character did we all want?

1036
00:41:26,812 --> 00:41:29,372
And I'll say one, two, three, Dopey.

1037
00:41:29,632 --> 00:41:29,952
Yeah. Right.

1038
00:41:29,952 --> 00:41:34,552
Is there any kid who didn't want Dopey who really likes happy?

1039
00:41:34,552 --> 00:41:39,152
I was I mean, I was praying Jason said like Doc or Sleepy.

1040
00:41:39,172 --> 00:41:43,492
Doc was Doc or Sleepy would probably have been a better joke, I guess, for you.

1041
00:41:43,532 --> 00:41:47,912
But yeah, I was hoping he's the king or like Bashful or something

1042
00:41:47,912 --> 00:41:49,952
would have been a cute choice for you.

1043
00:41:49,952 --> 00:41:52,332
Bashful is cute. But yeah, Dopey is.

1044
00:41:52,352 --> 00:41:55,212
Yeah, Sneezy is maybe who's like the least popular is it?

1045
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:59,572
Grumpy is popular because he's so specific and because you get a shirt

1046
00:41:59,572 --> 00:42:01,832
with grumpy on it for your asshole dad.

1047
00:42:01,832 --> 00:42:07,192
That's the tone of all those shirts is like, hey, isn't your dad a grump?

1048
00:42:07,952 --> 00:42:11,092
Well, get this shirt to shame him or this coffee mug to say

1049
00:42:11,092 --> 00:42:12,552
he's so unpleasant in the morning.

1050
00:42:12,552 --> 00:42:14,712
Oh, no, it's it's to embrace it.

1051
00:42:14,712 --> 00:42:17,332
It's the character we love about you, Dad.

1052
00:42:17,552 --> 00:42:19,472
Don't ever change.

1053
00:42:20,092 --> 00:42:21,592
But yeah, we're yeah, we're all dopey.

1054
00:42:22,012 --> 00:42:24,492
And he he definitely lands

1055
00:42:24,492 --> 00:42:28,272
heavier than the other dwarves, I suppose.

1056
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:29,752
He's the he's the fun way.

1057
00:42:29,952 --> 00:42:32,392
Is this the only one is different doesn't have a beard.

1058
00:42:34,112 --> 00:42:38,272
I had a question about the dwarves in general, which is,

1059
00:42:38,852 --> 00:42:42,492
do they know each other because they are all dwarves?

1060
00:42:42,672 --> 00:42:45,612
Or did they all separately meet?

1061
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:50,672
Did they like go applying for mine jobs and then meet each other

1062
00:42:50,772 --> 00:42:53,012
and go, we have so much in common.

1063
00:42:53,172 --> 00:42:54,132
We're all small.

1064
00:42:54,552 --> 00:42:56,392
You have a beard as well together.

1065
00:42:57,072 --> 00:42:58,652
Why don't we all move in?

1066
00:42:59,032 --> 00:43:00,912
It won't cost us much.

1067
00:43:01,572 --> 00:43:04,212
The space being small after all.

1068
00:43:05,552 --> 00:43:10,652
Like, do they know they're bringing this, you know, they're not canonically brothers.

1069
00:43:10,812 --> 00:43:12,632
There's nothing that says they're brothers.

1070
00:43:12,772 --> 00:43:13,952
No, I don't think so.

1071
00:43:14,032 --> 00:43:16,012
They're in all a litter together.

1072
00:43:16,032 --> 00:43:17,072
Yeah. Some of them.

1073
00:43:17,152 --> 00:43:18,592
Where do dwarves come from?

1074
00:43:18,592 --> 00:43:20,092
Because they could come from budding.

1075
00:43:20,092 --> 00:43:22,172
They could reproduce from like budding.

1076
00:43:22,172 --> 00:43:23,832
What? What does that mean?

1077
00:43:23,972 --> 00:43:27,212
Like another species like, I mean, I guess they're human.

1078
00:43:27,232 --> 00:43:28,232
Budding like buds.

1079
00:43:28,592 --> 00:43:30,152
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?

1080
00:43:30,172 --> 00:43:31,132
Disney dwarves are human.

1081
00:43:31,312 --> 00:43:33,332
I guess so, but we never meet their parents.

1082
00:43:33,932 --> 00:43:34,832
But a lot of movies.

1083
00:43:34,852 --> 00:43:36,812
You meet their parents to know they're human.

1084
00:43:37,272 --> 00:43:38,872
You don't meet Snow White's parents either.

1085
00:43:38,892 --> 00:43:40,452
There's a lot of magic shit going on.

1086
00:43:40,592 --> 00:43:42,712
Snow White can summon animals with singing.

1087
00:43:43,092 --> 00:43:45,032
Like that's some real Aquaman level shit.

1088
00:43:45,032 --> 00:43:45,572
That's because she has the greatest voice.

1089
00:43:46,132 --> 00:43:47,372
I guess so. That's just science.

1090
00:43:48,252 --> 00:43:49,052
There's a lot of magic.

1091
00:43:49,932 --> 00:43:52,392
There is a witch with spells.

1092
00:43:52,392 --> 00:43:53,592
There's a witch with powers.

1093
00:43:54,792 --> 00:44:00,632
But is your thinking that like the hobbits aren't human?

1094
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:03,512
Or are they like a variety of human?

1095
00:44:03,792 --> 00:44:05,332
Or are they a different species altogether?

1096
00:44:06,372 --> 00:44:07,392
I guess humanoid.

1097
00:44:07,632 --> 00:44:08,472
They're humanoid.

1098
00:44:09,172 --> 00:44:12,212
I feel like the dwarves, the specific type of mining that they do,

1099
00:44:12,312 --> 00:44:18,092
this is just a guess, is that it helps if you're of a smaller stature in these mines.

1100
00:44:18,212 --> 00:44:24,332
So whoever is in charge of these mines decided to hire specifically little people.

1101
00:44:24,472 --> 00:44:27,812
And they got all the dwarves together and those are maybe they're like,

1102
00:44:27,912 --> 00:44:29,472
they all wear similar clothes,

1103
00:44:29,832 --> 00:44:33,332
which are very similar to the clothes of like David the gnome.

1104
00:44:33,652 --> 00:44:34,672
Like kind of a hat.

1105
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,812
And that's my question is,

1106
00:44:37,032 --> 00:44:44,692
did they all have that fashion sense when they met or was like bashful in a suit?

1107
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,732
I think that was just a dress.

1108
00:44:46,832 --> 00:44:50,032
Form like a unified, a group mind style.

1109
00:44:50,272 --> 00:44:53,932
Well, like Dopey is wearing like pajamas that are too big for him.

1110
00:44:54,012 --> 00:44:56,312
And then like the habit is a similar.

1111
00:44:56,452 --> 00:44:59,372
I think it's just the clothing of the time for like poor people.

1112
00:44:59,552 --> 00:45:02,632
I think, but I think they own the mine.

1113
00:45:02,972 --> 00:45:04,312
You think the seven dwarves own the mine?

1114
00:45:04,332 --> 00:45:06,752
Like this is the ideal.

1115
00:45:06,752 --> 00:45:09,912
This is some like socialist paradise in your brain.

1116
00:45:09,972 --> 00:45:11,632
I don't think that the seven dwarves own the mine.

1117
00:45:11,652 --> 00:45:12,772
Who are they giving those jewels?

1118
00:45:12,812 --> 00:45:14,892
I think they're selling those jewels direct.

1119
00:45:15,072 --> 00:45:16,072
Here's why you're wrong.

1120
00:45:16,072 --> 00:45:20,272
Here's what I think laborers own all of the, they deserve all of the fruits of their labor.

1121
00:45:20,392 --> 00:45:22,192
But offhand, I think, I think Jason is correct.

1122
00:45:22,292 --> 00:45:26,252
I think he's a hundred percent wrong because why are they living in that small ass house?

1123
00:45:26,292 --> 00:45:30,152
But you just said that because they're little, it feels lavish.

1124
00:45:30,152 --> 00:45:37,912
No, no, no, I'm saying they would be, look, they mine like big juicy jewels every day.

1125
00:45:38,052 --> 00:45:40,672
They have carts, mine carts full of jewels.

1126
00:45:40,772 --> 00:45:45,932
Like if these are legit jewels, these guys are some of the richest guys we know.

1127
00:45:46,332 --> 00:45:47,852
They would have a castle.

1128
00:45:47,992 --> 00:45:50,232
They would have had so much money that they would own a castle.

1129
00:45:50,412 --> 00:45:56,332
They have to be giving these diamonds and jewels to some other mysterious like person

1130
00:45:56,332 --> 00:46:01,012
and they're making all the money because unless the dwarves are very tight with their money,

1131
00:46:01,032 --> 00:46:07,112
which I guess is possible, the amount of jewels that they're bringing in on it in a day,

1132
00:46:07,172 --> 00:46:09,652
like it's not like they're hunting and they get a couple pieces a day.

1133
00:46:09,652 --> 00:46:11,292
It could be like Jay Leno.

1134
00:46:11,532 --> 00:46:13,372
They don't touch their tonight show money.

1135
00:46:13,552 --> 00:46:14,972
It's all retirement.

1136
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,312
It's all in a fund somewhere.

1137
00:46:16,852 --> 00:46:16,912
Yeah.

1138
00:46:16,912 --> 00:46:21,892
I just think they're living a little bit higher on the hog than what they're doing in the movie

1139
00:46:21,892 --> 00:46:23,552
if they own everything.

1140
00:46:23,912 --> 00:46:28,372
I think what if they're what if it's like then they collect them and then they give it to a guy

1141
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:33,672
to sell the way that like a farmer would like he picks all the crops, but then like here,

1142
00:46:33,852 --> 00:46:37,692
take it to market and maybe the guy taking it to market is screwing them

1143
00:46:37,692 --> 00:46:40,332
because what I don't think is that they are slaves.

1144
00:46:40,332 --> 00:46:44,872
I don't think that they're being forced to be in that mine because they enjoy it.

1145
00:46:44,872 --> 00:46:47,372
They say digging is what they like to do.

1146
00:46:48,352 --> 00:46:51,732
So I don't think they have a boss, but I think there's some.

1147
00:46:52,052 --> 00:46:56,832
I think the seller is screwing them and he comes back with a little a couple of coins

1148
00:46:56,832 --> 00:47:00,092
and they're like, oh boy, we've forage for us this week.

1149
00:47:00,312 --> 00:47:01,792
So they're just fucking idiots.

1150
00:47:02,212 --> 00:47:02,512
Yeah.

1151
00:47:02,672 --> 00:47:05,872
They're being taken advantage of by some slimy guy.

1152
00:47:06,092 --> 00:47:06,992
But they seem happy.

1153
00:47:07,212 --> 00:47:08,432
They sing what I learned.

1154
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:11,452
I never realized this is called the silly song.

1155
00:47:12,092 --> 00:47:16,532
That's that Germany kind of song where like snow there were like, oh,

1156
00:47:16,532 --> 00:47:21,332
like Snow White's just kind of clapping along.

1157
00:47:21,332 --> 00:47:21,732
Yeah.

1158
00:47:21,732 --> 00:47:26,672
And there's a weird moment where like Dopey has a an accordion.

1159
00:47:26,812 --> 00:47:27,492
No, a symbol.

1160
00:47:27,552 --> 00:47:31,732
He has a symbol and he hits it and then he hits Snow White's knee

1161
00:47:31,732 --> 00:47:35,672
and then he puts it on his head.

1162
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:36,372
Oh, no.

1163
00:47:36,532 --> 00:47:39,832
Like a hat, like a what kind of hat?

1164
00:47:39,832 --> 00:47:42,852
I actually don't know what kind of hat, what that is called.

1165
00:47:42,992 --> 00:47:44,892
Do you call that a rice paddy hat?

1166
00:47:45,052 --> 00:47:48,292
Yeah, but I don't know if that's an Americanized like term for it.

1167
00:47:48,292 --> 00:47:51,152
That's a scene in every Disney movie up until 1965.

1168
00:47:51,512 --> 00:47:51,792
For sure.

1169
00:47:52,032 --> 00:47:52,172
Yeah.

1170
00:47:52,212 --> 00:47:54,992
There's a pre-racist cat in the aristocats.

1171
00:47:55,112 --> 00:48:00,352
The crows take a break from singing and then they put those hats on in Dumbo.

1172
00:48:00,912 --> 00:48:03,092
They do a worse stereotype.

1173
00:48:03,092 --> 00:48:03,812
Yeah, they do.

1174
00:48:03,852 --> 00:48:05,192
They double stereotype.

1175
00:48:06,212 --> 00:48:09,392
Yeah, but I never knew that moment was called the silly song.

1176
00:48:09,932 --> 00:48:10,852
Yeah, I don't know.

1177
00:48:10,912 --> 00:48:11,212
I didn't know.

1178
00:48:11,212 --> 00:48:12,172
I don't know that.

1179
00:48:12,332 --> 00:48:13,312
I didn't know that.

1180
00:48:13,612 --> 00:48:14,912
So they're having a good time.

1181
00:48:14,952 --> 00:48:16,492
They're obviously very pleased.

1182
00:48:16,692 --> 00:48:18,152
I think they're just rubes.

1183
00:48:18,252 --> 00:48:19,352
I think they're getting taken advantage of.

1184
00:48:19,372 --> 00:48:20,192
That's sad then.

1185
00:48:20,212 --> 00:48:23,452
That adds a whole like a tinge of sadness to the whole thing.

1186
00:48:24,032 --> 00:48:30,152
Also, where is this amazing mine full of like just completely perfectly shined up diamonds?

1187
00:48:30,152 --> 00:48:33,812
By the way, this is a thing that I have to commend and we're not going to talk about it too much,

1188
00:48:33,812 --> 00:48:37,412
but the the mine train ride is that the mine train ride

1189
00:48:37,792 --> 00:48:43,672
takes all the scary stuff away and it focuses on what my sister and I's favorite part of the movie

1190
00:48:43,672 --> 00:48:47,052
was the mine with the colorful diamonds.

1191
00:48:47,232 --> 00:48:47,452
Yeah.

1192
00:48:47,532 --> 00:48:54,292
With the while you work picking up like fully perfectly like shined up diamonds somehow.

1193
00:48:55,292 --> 00:49:03,212
Don't like it's not a hog looking for truffles situation where you need you have to like go

1194
00:49:03,212 --> 00:49:04,312
like where are they?

1195
00:49:04,312 --> 00:49:10,032
There are so many if they like they could go all day and there would still be bright

1196
00:49:10,032 --> 00:49:17,612
bright diamonds and rubies and just amethysts everywhere.

1197
00:49:18,192 --> 00:49:22,072
They're all just open and out and ready to pluck like ripe apples.

1198
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,232
These guys should be the richest men on earth.

1199
00:49:24,312 --> 00:49:24,912
Yeah.

1200
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,132
But something's going wrong.

1201
00:49:26,392 --> 00:49:30,172
Maybe the seven way split screws them somehow.

1202
00:49:30,472 --> 00:49:30,912
I don't know.

1203
00:49:30,992 --> 00:49:31,452
That's true.

1204
00:49:31,492 --> 00:49:33,292
They may just have a bad money guy.

1205
00:49:33,732 --> 00:49:34,332
Yeah.

1206
00:49:34,332 --> 00:49:35,792
Who's their financial advisor?

1207
00:49:36,952 --> 00:49:41,772
The great great great great grandfather of Lou Perlman.

1208
00:49:42,072 --> 00:49:42,852
Oh boy.

1209
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:44,552
He makes a lot of saves actually.

1210
00:49:45,072 --> 00:49:45,612
Yeah yeah yeah.

1211
00:49:45,632 --> 00:49:47,752
Lou Perlman had auditions for dwarves.

1212
00:49:48,212 --> 00:49:49,432
The Huntsman could also.

1213
00:49:49,752 --> 00:49:52,572
Yes looking for little guys to fit into mine.

1214
00:49:52,832 --> 00:49:55,192
I'll cut you in on so much of the profits.

1215
00:49:55,432 --> 00:49:59,692
The Huntsman could also be screwing that because he's the queen's like fixer.

1216
00:49:59,692 --> 00:50:03,892
He's like an Eddie Mannix type of like back in the day.

1217
00:50:04,092 --> 00:50:04,592
Right.

1218
00:50:04,612 --> 00:50:08,932
Because the queen sent the Huntsman to like hey go murder go murder this person.

1219
00:50:08,932 --> 00:50:09,932
This is another story.

1220
00:50:09,972 --> 00:50:12,652
So this is how a little insight into how I was raised.

1221
00:50:12,912 --> 00:50:18,472
I loved when my family would or my parents would read me the book the Snow White Book.

1222
00:50:18,592 --> 00:50:19,032
Oh sure.

1223
00:50:19,512 --> 00:50:24,832
And my mom used to censor that part of the story when she would read it to me.

1224
00:50:25,612 --> 00:50:29,572
So the thing that the evil queen says is like to the Huntsman like go

1225
00:50:30,212 --> 00:50:33,712
cut out Snow White's heart and bring it to me in this box.

1226
00:50:33,712 --> 00:50:34,612
Yes.

1227
00:50:34,672 --> 00:50:41,612
And then he says okay but my mom would always say go get Snow White and bring her back here.

1228
00:50:42,352 --> 00:50:44,792
So a kidnapping is better than a slaughtering?

1229
00:50:44,812 --> 00:50:45,372
I guess it is.

1230
00:50:45,392 --> 00:50:51,912
She didn't like the graphicness of cutting out Snow White's heart so she would change that around.

1231
00:50:51,972 --> 00:50:52,912
So she would change the story.

1232
00:50:53,112 --> 00:50:56,632
Apparently though she called my dad and she didn't tell my dad the plan and all of a sudden

1233
00:50:56,632 --> 00:51:01,572
overheard like go cut out Snow White's heart and she's like like she ran in and like

1234
00:51:01,572 --> 00:51:02,392
did a whole thing.

1235
00:51:03,252 --> 00:51:04,652
Yeah so that's a little bit of insight.

1236
00:51:04,652 --> 00:51:07,152
And you closed your eyes so tight you couldn't hear the story anymore.

1237
00:51:07,992 --> 00:51:09,752
The sound of my blindness.

1238
00:51:09,752 --> 00:51:10,692
Father of mine.

1239
00:51:11,332 --> 00:51:22,172
You know speaking of censorship weird facts that I learned about this film is that

1240
00:51:23,152 --> 00:51:29,932
this is so so what I all right I was trying to disseminate why did they make this ride so scary?

1241
00:51:30,452 --> 00:51:34,492
Why is it not a ride where you're going through the mine and the workshop and then there's a

1242
00:51:34,492 --> 00:51:35,492
little bit of witch peril?

1243
00:51:35,712 --> 00:51:39,472
Why did they double down on it is so just terrifying front to back?

1244
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:46,432
And I guess if you were if you saw Snow White when it came out probably one of the biggest

1245
00:51:46,432 --> 00:51:52,072
pieces of it you're hanging on to is Snow White running through the woods sort of a psychedelic

1246
00:51:52,752 --> 00:51:57,752
sequence because I didn't remember how it all played out that the trees are kind of her fantasy

1247
00:51:57,752 --> 00:52:04,452
it's not like there are magic alive trees trying to get her she's she's having a nightmare the

1248
00:52:04,452 --> 00:52:10,812
the crocodiles kind of form out of logs and stuff so this is like a this is a crazy trippy

1249
00:52:10,812 --> 00:52:17,652
sequence for the 30s that a lot of people discouraged Walt from doing at all but he

1250
00:52:17,652 --> 00:52:20,932
thought he doubled down and did it in all of those movies.

1251
00:52:20,932 --> 00:52:22,312
I was gonna say on all the rides.

1252
00:52:22,352 --> 00:52:23,872
All the first ones are terrifying.

1253
00:52:23,972 --> 00:52:28,232
So many of the original movies and rides still have I mean Heffalumps and Woozles is a

1254
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:30,692
hallucination there's so many hallucination scenes.

1255
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:31,532
Ah true yeah.

1256
00:52:31,872 --> 00:52:32,672
Movies and rides.

1257
00:52:32,932 --> 00:52:34,032
Mm-hmm and Fantasia.

1258
00:52:34,092 --> 00:52:34,812
Fantasia.

1259
00:52:35,212 --> 00:52:44,272
Super trippy movie and then yeah yeah so but he thought it's an important feature of the

1260
00:52:44,272 --> 00:52:50,292
fairy tales that I want to make these films of that they are genuinely scary that they actually

1261
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:57,012
are kind of like grotesque and weird and freak kids out so he pushed that but they had to like

1262
00:52:57,012 --> 00:53:06,812
really argue with film boards across the world to get this film shown the English board of censors

1263
00:53:06,812 --> 00:53:12,132
like after they they relented and they played Snow White without editing it but the British

1264
00:53:12,132 --> 00:53:18,632
public was very upset about it people people were like like honestly terrified and their their kids

1265
00:53:18,632 --> 00:53:26,552
freaked out and uh here's what I didn't know in England this this board banned all horror films

1266
00:53:26,552 --> 00:53:33,572
entirely in 1934 so to play a film with this essentially horror sequence was a really big

1267
00:53:33,572 --> 00:53:42,952
deal and then in Italy during the Mussolini regime all terror films were banned and the first one

1268
00:53:42,992 --> 00:53:49,552
after the ban was lifted was Snow White and people who had not been accustomed to seeing

1269
00:53:49,552 --> 00:53:55,152
scary movies of any kind for decades and who didn't know what the medium could do this is the

1270
00:53:55,152 --> 00:54:00,772
first animated feature film entirely it freaked the fuck out of everybody in Italy.

1271
00:54:01,312 --> 00:54:03,872
Worse than years of living under a fascist regime.

1272
00:54:04,912 --> 00:54:11,292
This scary cartoon was the worst part of living in Italy but it's whatever the article that I

1273
00:54:11,292 --> 00:54:16,632
read I think that's what might have all been from the site passport to dreams which were a really

1274
00:54:16,632 --> 00:54:23,052
cool article about Snow White's scary adventures but it's it's considered true that the specific

1275
00:54:23,052 --> 00:54:29,652
bizarro type of Italian horror that was popular in the 40s 50s 60s was largely influenced by Snow

1276
00:54:29,652 --> 00:54:34,512
White and by this weird frame of mind that Italians were in where they didn't know horror at all and

1277
00:54:34,512 --> 00:54:41,272
then it like shot back up in their awareness due to Snow White. This kind of makes sense because I

1278
00:54:41,272 --> 00:54:48,792
are and British are like very specific and strange. I don't know how to say it. Yeah like more

1279
00:54:48,792 --> 00:54:52,712
upsetting in some regard I wouldn't pretend to be an expert in the genre but I know what they're

1280
00:54:52,712 --> 00:54:59,952
saying that Italian horror is a particular freaky vibe. For sure. So I gotta say watching the

1281
00:54:59,952 --> 00:55:11,252
ride-throughs before the refurbishment that happened at both Anaheim and Orlando I was

1282
00:55:11,412 --> 00:55:18,412
this is what like boardwalk haunted houses look like. Like this I think on purpose or

1283
00:55:18,412 --> 00:55:24,792
inadvertently like influenced like roadside haunted house just because like there's so my just like

1284
00:55:24,792 --> 00:55:31,232
beach town haunted houses in amusement parks I just associate with yes so much screaming

1285
00:55:31,232 --> 00:55:37,612
skeletons saying help me and like fucked up trees because like all of this shit is not that

1286
00:55:37,692 --> 00:55:43,472
expensive to make. And there's not a good like not a good video of like what it looked like in

1287
00:55:43,472 --> 00:55:48,732
the first five or ten years of it being open in Disneyland. Seemed to be yeah we looked around I

1288
00:55:48,732 --> 00:55:53,792
didn't find anything. But the way people describe it is that you know the Disney World version is

1289
00:55:53,792 --> 00:55:58,172
the Disney World version is even painted differently and what you're saying about like haunted houses

1290
00:55:58,172 --> 00:56:04,932
the color scheme in the in the video at least I watched of the the one in from Florida the original

1291
00:56:05,092 --> 00:56:11,212
one that one really reminds me of some janky like haunted fun weird fun houses I went on as a kid

1292
00:56:11,212 --> 00:56:16,572
because like the witch even has this bizarre like green hue to her that she doesn't really have

1293
00:56:16,572 --> 00:56:22,532
in the movie like she seems more jacked up and weird than she does even in the movie and like

1294
00:56:22,532 --> 00:56:28,352
all the trees and all the different characters like really have this like like they're very

1295
00:56:28,352 --> 00:56:32,612
disturbing but also they have this color scheme that was almost reminiscent of like black light

1296
00:56:32,612 --> 00:56:36,672
haunted house even though that's not really what it is but it feels like that to me from watching

1297
00:56:36,672 --> 00:56:42,212
the video and I did like watching the video of the Florida one I was like in it especially after my

1298
00:56:42,212 --> 00:56:47,112
dad said like no you turned on your flashlight once or twice but like you did like this I'm like

1299
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:52,352
watching and I'm like I do like this aesthetic like I was like this reminds me like there's a

1300
00:56:52,352 --> 00:56:58,552
few comic book artists that are like really scratchy or really like Wilson Kavich like I

1301
00:56:58,552 --> 00:57:03,932
like oh this that's weird this is like hitting the same part of my brain that those artists like

1302
00:57:03,932 --> 00:57:11,252
that's true you know I think you feel the concept art in the style of this ride like it doesn't feel

1303
00:57:11,252 --> 00:57:19,072
like a frame of a Disney movie it seems like you're inside a weird scary painting because the the

1304
00:57:19,072 --> 00:57:26,552
movie itself is is particularly I think striking and beautiful and I think probably they they went

1305
00:57:26,552 --> 00:57:33,752
so hard on it because they had so much to prove with it um yeah the backgrounds and just even just

1306
00:57:33,752 --> 00:57:40,872
watching the motion of the dwarves I'm like god this is so like fluid and intense well yeah dude

1307
00:57:40,872 --> 00:57:46,072
that's that kind of thing when you think about how little that this this genre is unprecedented

1308
00:57:46,072 --> 00:57:52,812
yeah oh yeah there's not been this kind of film and so they don't just they don't like cut themselves

1309
00:57:52,812 --> 00:57:59,832
slack and try something easy they it is seven care seven bulbous characters marching around

1310
00:57:59,832 --> 00:58:08,532
cresting a hill changing perspective every single second it is so crazy the uh just the you know the

1311
00:58:08,532 --> 00:58:14,652
level of detail and very human looking I mean Snow White and the prince very human looking totally

1312
00:58:14,652 --> 00:58:20,472
different from the queen and the dwarves like so many different things going on and that sequence

1313
00:58:20,472 --> 00:58:25,952
of her that kind of like psychedelic sequence is is different from the rest of the film it's like

1314
00:58:25,952 --> 00:58:32,172
its own a bizarre little sequence that the nests incited perfectly I mean I have to say a lot of

1315
00:58:32,172 --> 00:58:37,012
these classic Disney movies when they there was a run like five or six years ago where they were

1316
00:58:37,012 --> 00:58:42,672
putting them all on Netflix and I went back and watched a lot because I feel like every house

1317
00:58:42,672 --> 00:58:49,452
growing up bought some of the like coming out of the Disney vault tapes but I remember having like

1318
00:58:50,952 --> 00:58:56,212
Pinocchio and I mean all the 90s ones certainly but like I don't think we had a ton of the classic

1319
00:58:56,212 --> 00:59:02,192
ones but I knew I caught them like here and there at like friends houses or the Disney channel or

1320
00:59:02,192 --> 00:59:09,052
like after school stuff right and I was just amazed at how much I had just forgotten about

1321
00:59:09,052 --> 00:59:16,712
like oh this movie is only 70 minutes long we're like oh this what is this sequence like that sort

1322
00:59:16,852 --> 00:59:20,952
of thing yeah as a kid I watched it's weird though because I'm talking about how scared it was of the

1323
00:59:20,952 --> 00:59:25,512
ride but as a kid I don't recall being that scared of the movie I think I just thought it was cool

1324
00:59:25,512 --> 00:59:30,592
I was scared at the end with the with the rain for sure that last sequence is was very scary to me

1325
00:59:30,592 --> 00:59:34,812
but like for whatever reason I just thought the movie was cool and I thought the ride was the

1326
00:59:34,812 --> 00:59:40,592
scariest thing ever sure I'm gonna do a similar voice to what I've been doing but my favorite

1327
00:59:40,592 --> 00:59:46,252
part of the film still cherished to me today is when she's singing into the wishing well and the

1328
00:59:46,252 --> 00:59:52,592
well is singing everything back to her and then the last word is today and but her reflection

1329
00:59:52,592 --> 01:00:00,032
doesn't sing it back it's suddenly the prince is there and he sings today that bizarre that people

1330
01:00:00,032 --> 01:00:06,732
this was the accepted style of male singing yeah that era the the dwarves kind of sing like that

1331
01:00:06,732 --> 01:00:12,232
too even though then they talk and they're kind of like they're weird old they're weird elfie guys

1332
01:00:12,232 --> 01:00:20,472
but they all sing this is very warbly voice that everyone had yeah I love it I want to go back to

1333
01:00:20,472 --> 01:00:27,712
it if this was if you turn on new it's the instrumentation of you know Skrillex DJ Khaled

1334
01:00:27,712 --> 01:00:35,272
sort of music but everyone agrees that now men sing with a heavy baritone again the uh uh I

1335
01:00:35,272 --> 01:00:40,252
thought you were going to say something about another thing that you love that starts with today

1336
01:00:40,432 --> 01:00:48,112
which oh yeah that's yes yes yes the the um the Geppetto song uh from this Christmas special which

1337
01:00:48,112 --> 01:00:54,552
we talked about in an episode where every Shriver is crafting a puppet of himself and but today

1338
01:00:54,552 --> 01:01:00,932
that's a similar different different uh male baritone today but I guess I always like that

1339
01:01:00,932 --> 01:01:08,472
I just love crazy old man yells so much and uh there's a lot of those to talk about in the area

1340
01:01:08,472 --> 01:01:15,432
Snow White uh yeah uh the I was reading so yeah so the the Disneyland version apparently was

1341
01:01:15,432 --> 01:01:20,992
originally very scary then the Disney World version way scarier and they cite a lot of these articles

1342
01:01:20,992 --> 01:01:27,072
sites Claude Coates Claude Coates Tony's mentor Tony Baxter's mentor um and his first collaborator

1343
01:01:27,072 --> 01:01:31,252
I think he worked Tony had something to do with this like it's one of his first projects to work

1344
01:01:31,252 --> 01:01:36,532
with Claude is the yeah it sounds like it I don't know why I I'm a little fuzzy in the details but

1345
01:01:36,532 --> 01:01:42,672
some interview where he was saying I'm you know I'm 22 years old and I'm like I personally am

1346
01:01:42,672 --> 01:01:48,352
supervising all the you know big props that will be in the Snow White attraction uh-huh and the guy

1347
01:01:48,352 --> 01:01:55,232
who did the the movies yeah right crazy Claude Coates painted those backgrounds and then he's

1348
01:01:55,232 --> 01:02:06,512
painting he's painting them himself in Florida right on that right like that's that's what's

1349
01:02:06,512 --> 01:02:10,892
drawing those backgrounds and then 40 years later hand drawing them in a physical place in Florida

1350
01:02:10,892 --> 01:02:17,872
and Claude famously I think has a has a another uh an argument or whatever a debate with another

1351
01:02:17,872 --> 01:02:22,112
guy that's like this as well who works on all the movies and then it just designs a bunch of stuff

1352
01:02:22,112 --> 01:02:28,172
for the theme park Mark Davis which they famously I think fought about Haunted Mansion or I don't

1353
01:02:28,172 --> 01:02:36,492
know if there was really fighting but they Mark Davis wanted uh the fun ghost party and Claude

1354
01:02:36,972 --> 01:02:41,952
and Claude lost basically he got a little creepy at the start but then it ends up in a Mark Davis

1355
01:02:41,952 --> 01:02:49,312
fun yeah character ghost party but is that why if this is Claude Coates going full till that's what

1356
01:02:49,312 --> 01:02:53,012
they're that's what people say is that Claude finally got to do something that was as scary as

1357
01:02:53,012 --> 01:02:59,792
he wanted uh on this on this version of the ride specifically huh so like he finally got to scare

1358
01:02:59,792 --> 01:03:06,232
the shit out of kids like he always wanted to wow I just want to scare kids and they won't let me

1359
01:03:06,732 --> 01:03:11,692
Mark Davis permanently scar children I don't know that he hated whimsy but I mean

1360
01:03:11,692 --> 01:03:18,792
Mark Davis's whimsy won out over his uh nightmare he just wanted an area without any whimsy and he

1361
01:03:18,792 --> 01:03:26,412
got it and you're totally right that you it is like we'll post a video of what this was like pre

1362
01:03:26,412 --> 01:03:36,212
the remake in 1994 what was originally in Disney World and I don't know if it's a it's if it's a

1363
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:43,272
fact that the audio is probably not that great so things are overlapping and echoing but it is just

1364
01:03:43,272 --> 01:03:51,612
a terrifying wall of sound from front to back that's just constant witch cackling screaming

1365
01:03:51,612 --> 01:04:00,032
moaning wind whistling it is it is awful it's it's insanely good sound design but well I could I can

1366
01:04:00,032 --> 01:04:04,372
absolutely see why this would have freaked you out as a look at it and is there no music something I

1367
01:04:04,372 --> 01:04:09,732
mentioned the original version original version doesn't see no music which is crazy that's the

1368
01:04:09,732 --> 01:04:14,932
case with a lot of these things though too like there's yeah but I can't really remember the

1369
01:04:14,932 --> 01:04:22,212
music for Mr Toad I remember all the songs from Snow White yeah you mean yeah in the movie yeah

1370
01:04:22,212 --> 01:04:29,932
yeah yeah yeah for sure there is a Mark Davis book there's a for sure there's a Mark Davis book out

1371
01:04:30,012 --> 01:04:34,372
somewhere Mark Davis Walt Disney's Renaissance man I forget when it came out it's supposed to be

1372
01:04:34,372 --> 01:04:41,972
very good but whimsical so I don't know trash it if you're holding out for terror Claude would want

1373
01:04:41,972 --> 01:04:48,912
you to burn it yeah um yeah but I don't know I I think I like I found it you know yeah it's a joke

1374
01:04:48,912 --> 01:04:52,412
that we're gonna start the scary month with Snow White's Scary Adventures but watching that

1375
01:04:52,412 --> 01:04:56,772
watching the ride through that thing and yeah and what are the what are the specific components that

1376
01:04:56,772 --> 01:05:02,012
get scarier than what was at Disneyland at the time I guess it's it's more witch appearances

1377
01:05:02,012 --> 01:05:08,272
yes there's there's I think there's a 10 second sequence in which she jumps out at you twice or

1378
01:05:08,272 --> 01:05:18,672
maybe even less yeah and it's kind of more um it's a little more caustic jump out violent than

1379
01:05:18,672 --> 01:05:24,012
in the Disney ride especially the Disneyland ride especially now you round a corner you see

1380
01:05:24,012 --> 01:05:29,692
her back she turns around or something but this has you she is not in sight at all and she kind

1381
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:35,372
of slams out of you uh in a weird rickety boat and stuff like that yeah there were seven Wicked

1382
01:05:35,372 --> 01:05:41,992
Witch figures on the original Florida ride that's crazy which is a lot for like a new ride zero

1383
01:05:41,992 --> 01:05:48,192
Snow White zero Snow White ride with seven figures of the witch of the villain of a horror she may

1384
01:05:48,192 --> 01:05:53,032
as well have just been in the car with you like she's just that's it's her ride it should have

1385
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:59,512
called the witch's adventure like Snow White's villains the witch's quest the witch's quest

1386
01:05:59,512 --> 01:06:06,512
to see what I feel in my head every day and it's so bombarding you with so many witches that

1387
01:06:06,512 --> 01:06:12,952
there's net like now you know there there's a rhythm to a lot of the haunts now where it's like

1388
01:06:12,952 --> 01:06:18,492
scare relax a little forget about the scare scare again relax a little you know they kind of pace

1389
01:06:18,492 --> 01:06:25,252
it a little yeah this is a barrage from the very beginning and then here's a component I didn't

1390
01:06:25,252 --> 01:06:32,452
know about that after a lot of chaos then you arrive back in a cottage I guess the dwarf's

1391
01:06:32,452 --> 01:06:41,852
cottage and well maybe this will be a respite but in fact all of their all of the animals and all of

1392
01:06:41,852 --> 01:06:49,692
their doodads and toys and pots and their you know their their organ with the faces and everything

1393
01:06:49,692 --> 01:06:58,852
all of the all of these faces are open and aghast and staring at you that is a stoned nightmare

1394
01:06:58,852 --> 01:07:06,092
yeah like imagine if you hallucinated that everything around you was staring open-mouthed

1395
01:07:06,192 --> 01:07:10,552
in horror of whatever is happening to you that is that is genuinely freaky

1396
01:07:10,552 --> 01:07:16,412
the animals in the window just look like a good harpy so and then you're just out of the cottage

1397
01:07:16,412 --> 01:07:23,212
and back into the into the swamp again yeah it's so quick there's no fun to be had it's it's crazy

1398
01:07:23,212 --> 01:07:28,712
it's crazy it's so crazy that they allowed this ride to happen like this that there wouldn't be

1399
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:35,212
any fun yeah and very little I rereading the summary of the plot of this movie I'm like oh

1400
01:07:35,212 --> 01:07:40,412
the prince is very useless in this like they dance and then he kisses her to wake her up

1401
01:07:40,412 --> 01:07:46,632
and that's his two appearances and I the huntsman has a very brief appearance of course

1402
01:07:46,632 --> 01:07:51,232
he chickens out yeah he chickens out he doesn't stab snow white and take her heart

1403
01:07:51,232 --> 01:07:56,752
the guy can't do can't get his job done let's be honest but in the ride he does you watch it happen

1404
01:07:56,752 --> 01:08:03,332
he rips her chest open he stops you he says where are you going you're not going anywhere yet

1405
01:08:03,332 --> 01:08:08,692
Claude Coates wanted an actor always on the ride to reach toward your heart in the last scene

1406
01:08:08,692 --> 01:08:15,252
your heart please that was a crazy thing I read about and and this to me seems wild that people

1407
01:08:15,252 --> 01:08:20,172
did this like it reminded me of the thing about how like the great train robbery or whatever that

1408
01:08:20,172 --> 01:08:24,512
was where the train would be coming at the screen people saw a movie where a train was on the screen

1409
01:08:24,512 --> 01:08:29,112
they thought a train was going to shoot into the theater that there's anecdotes of people reaching

1410
01:08:29,112 --> 01:08:34,512
out to grab the poison apple at Disneyland so they made it behind a mirror so there's a like

1411
01:08:34,512 --> 01:08:39,692
a holographic basically apple yeah it's like a projection wait I don't think that's like the

1412
01:08:39,692 --> 01:08:44,452
the great train rob I think that's people wanted to steal the apple I guess so but like how often

1413
01:08:44,452 --> 01:08:50,192
did that happen maybe a lot I think a lot of you're saying it's bullshit I'm saying it's yeah I

1414
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:57,292
disagree I think I think a prop is handed to you essentially you maybe reach out and take it and

1415
01:08:57,292 --> 01:09:02,112
wow I stole the apple yeah I don't think that's people not understanding what's happening to them

1416
01:09:02,112 --> 01:09:07,232
in the medium what he's saying no he's saying that he thinks the story is overblown I'm not saying

1417
01:09:07,232 --> 01:09:12,752
it's actually like he doesn't think that it's fake I'm saying the anecdotes about what you're saying

1418
01:09:12,752 --> 01:09:15,952
it's fake but he's not saying that people are confused Jason thinks that it's a real apple

1419
01:09:15,952 --> 01:09:22,692
that she was like a cafeteria lady handing him food and that they would take the apple and say

1420
01:09:22,692 --> 01:09:26,872
thank you and then try to take a bite and then their teeth would all break off

1421
01:09:26,872 --> 01:09:33,932
Jason is the head did you ever reach for the apple as a child no because I didn't think again I

1422
01:09:33,932 --> 01:09:39,672
don't remember paying this ride too much mind if she offered you an ice cream would you have

1423
01:09:39,672 --> 01:09:49,712
reached for it well I don't it may have tricked me now I will say dear oh I love butter I know you do

1424
01:09:50,292 --> 01:09:55,432
uh it could have also been in the early days maybe they were doing that because their brains are

1425
01:09:55,432 --> 01:10:00,872
just trained from riding carousels where you reach out to grab the brass ring so you get to ride the

1426
01:10:00,872 --> 01:10:05,612
carousel again people in early days wanted to just wanted to reach their reaching arms gotten

1427
01:10:05,612 --> 01:10:10,692
tingling uh yeah yeah I don't know what you're talking about oh the term grab the brass ring

1428
01:10:10,692 --> 01:10:17,192
I know that term that comes from in the old days of carousels there used to be a brass really

1429
01:10:17,352 --> 01:10:21,712
hanging out and you would try to grab it and if you won it you got to ride the carousel so only

1430
01:10:21,712 --> 01:10:25,692
one person would be able to win it I'm sure different uh carousels had different rules

1431
01:10:25,692 --> 01:10:31,832
and bylaws interesting but that's that was the prize you just got to do it again I think so

1432
01:10:31,832 --> 01:10:38,132
remember carousels were like amazing to people back yeah these were people startled by trains

1433
01:10:38,132 --> 01:10:42,692
constrained by the British and Italian governments from what they could do

1434
01:10:42,932 --> 01:10:50,392
everyone was so repressed it's just enjoyment of things would come out in weird ways like a

1435
01:10:50,392 --> 01:10:54,172
brass ring or a psychedelic sequence in the middle of a snow white we're telling

1436
01:10:54,172 --> 01:11:01,172
that's why all English people and Italians still want to have sex with brass rings

1437
01:11:01,172 --> 01:11:07,972
their brains are all scrambled um we're talking a lot about the different versions of this right

1438
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:12,472
and it's very confusing because they're pretty close even though it's so there's a video

1439
01:11:13,172 --> 01:11:17,412
myself absolutely there's a video though I'm going to tell and we'll link to it and now it's

1440
01:11:17,412 --> 01:11:21,372
this is also confusing because there's so many different things theme park related yeah I know

1441
01:11:21,372 --> 01:11:26,692
this is called the yester world yes and it's a great 15 minute video sort of detailing the

1442
01:11:26,692 --> 01:11:31,452
changes to these rides and like which version was which and very highly recommended I got a

1443
01:11:31,452 --> 01:11:37,552
lot of information from it um but there needs to be some variations in the names for these different

1444
01:11:37,552 --> 01:11:42,792
parts because there's a yester world there's a yester land there's defunct land and there's

1445
01:11:42,792 --> 01:11:49,812
and as if if you weren't confused enough in the yester world video defunct land kevin perjurer

1446
01:11:49,812 --> 01:11:55,732
makes suddenly appears in the video hey it's me from defunct land here just interrupting yester

1447
01:11:55,732 --> 01:12:04,432
world what's going on we need some variation in the names uh or are we wrong should our

1448
01:12:04,432 --> 01:12:11,512
thing be called yester disney day like is our podcast title too creative

1449
01:12:11,512 --> 01:12:18,012
to fund yester kingdom we're gonna change it to from pocket we're well from oh yeah let's buy

1450
01:12:18,012 --> 01:12:33,552
that right now yester kingdom podcast yeah uh jason the yester kingdom podcast featuring jason

1451
01:12:34,272 --> 01:12:42,732
yeah that's good now we have a proper theme park titling system um so but anyway that is a very

1452
01:12:42,732 --> 01:12:47,312
good video though very good yeah it spells out a lot of stuff that i didn't know and how all the

1453
01:12:47,312 --> 01:12:52,712
different it's a weird they all all these attractions opened yeah all right so one in

1454
01:12:52,712 --> 01:12:59,752
the 50s one in the 70s uh the one in the 80s in japan one of the 90s in france but they were but

1455
01:12:59,752 --> 01:13:05,552
disney one the disneyland one was redone in 83 the disney world one was redone in 94 and each

1456
01:13:05,552 --> 01:13:12,212
time they kind of changed to become more central and similar to each other to the point where i

1457
01:13:12,212 --> 01:13:17,872
think probably by paris they had perfected the ideal what this ride should be and the big thing

1458
01:13:17,872 --> 01:13:23,472
that they did in paris that none of the other ones had was an ending they actually made the space

1459
01:13:24,472 --> 01:13:30,612
for instead of okay if you go on the one here in anaheim and disneyland it's a bunch of horror

1460
01:13:30,612 --> 01:13:37,332
the witch gets struck by lightning and through shadows is her demise is implied and then you

1461
01:13:37,332 --> 01:13:41,092
round a corner and just see kind of a flat sign that says they lived happily ever after

1462
01:13:41,092 --> 01:13:47,072
it's very abrupt i kind of like it i almost don't want them to change it but by the time they open

1463
01:13:47,072 --> 01:13:53,452
the paris one they actually created a little room where the dwarves are waving goodbye to snow white

1464
01:13:53,452 --> 01:13:58,912
and the prince and dopey's sitting on top of a bridge and wiggling his ears and so they actually

1465
01:13:58,912 --> 01:14:04,752
got to the by the by finally by the 90s they knew we need to do a concerted ending room well the

1466
01:14:04,752 --> 01:14:09,232
one you're describing where it was just which is the the thing on the wall the writing on the wall

1467
01:14:09,232 --> 01:14:14,372
is even better than the original disney world version which doesn't have anything like that

1468
01:14:14,372 --> 01:14:23,152
the witch is about to drop a giant diamond or a giant jewel on you and then you just leave you're

1469
01:14:23,152 --> 01:14:28,232
like thanks for riding well there's no thanks it's just you're outside like she kills you even though

1470
01:14:28,232 --> 01:14:33,612
though it's obviously very bizarre that you end up in hell at the end of that ride it does you're in

1471
01:14:33,612 --> 01:14:42,172
that room for long enough that it feels like a odd twisted ending and you've been like all right i see

1472
01:14:42,172 --> 01:14:48,972
the end of the story but to just you're getting a diamond pushed at you and then you're outside

1473
01:14:49,992 --> 01:14:56,592
there's no transition out all the light just hits you it's so strange and i guess well i guess mr

1474
01:14:56,592 --> 01:15:02,492
toad implies that you were yeah you're dead because you're in hell but the it's even like worse in snow

1475
01:15:02,492 --> 01:15:07,172
white because you were dead and there's no indication of what happens to you yeah it's bizarre

1476
01:15:07,172 --> 01:15:12,412
the newer version correct me if i'm wrong but there's the the implication that a lot of the

1477
01:15:12,412 --> 01:15:18,472
horrifying the terrifying stuff could be a dream is that right did anyone come across that yeah

1478
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:23,352
i mean like they're like the stuff in the forest and stuff what do you mean because you see now

1479
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:30,192
that snow white is in some of these attractions uh she's walking up the stairs to go to bed

1480
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:37,172
and that's an implication that we are seeing her dreams and that's all right i see yeah interesting

1481
01:15:37,172 --> 01:15:42,532
but that's so slight you have to read an article for that to even occur to you the other thing that

1482
01:15:42,532 --> 01:15:51,052
like to take umbridge with is a giant diamond yeah that's wild in the anaheim one it's a big

1483
01:15:51,052 --> 01:15:57,752
boulder which is the movie makes sense absolutely but a giant diamond and once again if the dwarves

1484
01:15:57,752 --> 01:16:05,072
are working in a mine that has diamonds that are bigger than they are then why are they still

1485
01:16:05,072 --> 01:16:10,812
working they should have found that cashed out you would think never worked again a day in their

1486
01:16:10,812 --> 01:16:17,152
lives this is this also suggests that like they're inside the mine somehow like like this is a

1487
01:16:17,152 --> 01:16:21,172
different surreal ending to the ride that's different from the movie the witch is in the

1488
01:16:21,172 --> 01:16:25,672
mine right she get in the in the mine right we don't know so it's actually kind of interesting

1489
01:16:25,672 --> 01:16:31,152
it's an alternate ending to the movie uh an alternate ending to the story but it's it's

1490
01:16:31,152 --> 01:16:36,812
bizarre and yes we've never seen something that big it's it's yeah it's a rare disney fairy tale

1491
01:16:36,812 --> 01:16:42,812
that ends with the protagonist being crushed by a giant diamond you're in a scene that is not in

1492
01:16:42,812 --> 01:16:48,472
the film and then you don't live happily ever after i mean it's but you're you're dead it's like

1493
01:16:48,472 --> 01:16:53,392
kind of an inglorious bastards rewriting of history where his hillar dies in inglorious

1494
01:16:53,392 --> 01:16:57,412
bastards of course he did not die like that in real life in this version we know all the evil

1495
01:16:57,412 --> 01:17:02,812
queen meets her end in the ride from the 70s in disney world she lives she kills you with a giant

1496
01:17:02,852 --> 01:17:09,832
diamond she lives she goes on i think yeah that's it that's the alternate history of snow white

1497
01:17:09,832 --> 01:17:16,872
she probably tracks down that huntsman has him rip out the hearts of every dwarf one by one

1498
01:17:16,872 --> 01:17:24,052
makes them all watch as each other are slaughtered that's that's i know i'm making that up but that

1499
01:17:24,052 --> 01:17:28,752
is in the spirit of what this disney world attraction is in the spirit of the original

1500
01:17:29,652 --> 01:17:30,472
for sure

1501
01:17:30,472 --> 01:17:36,892
oh yeah well you always ripping people up and killing people every original fairy tale is about

1502
01:17:36,892 --> 01:17:43,052
rape and the eating of hearts everything in disney movie is based on they had to censor the most

1503
01:17:43,052 --> 01:17:48,552
horrifying things anyone's ever written or read man if you could go back and see like clod coats

1504
01:17:48,552 --> 01:17:58,732
his original like what is his blue sky version of this thing it has to be what 10 times weirder and

1505
01:17:58,732 --> 01:18:05,372
gets to put their wildest like idea so like he had a whole other narrative like seen like specific

1506
01:18:05,372 --> 01:18:12,252
scenes where each dwarf is tortured like you go in a room he didn't want dumbo to be built he was

1507
01:18:12,252 --> 01:18:18,492
one he was wanting to annex all of that territory to have the room to do individual deaths for each

1508
01:18:18,492 --> 01:18:28,712
yeah it's uh he's depriving sleepy of sleep it's like the clockwork orange his eyes are

1509
01:18:29,052 --> 01:18:35,872
a survivor's guilt that he just lives with for the rest of his days i could never mine again

1510
01:18:35,872 --> 01:18:41,312
dopey has to like take a test or something and he can't do it because he doesn't understand things

1511
01:18:41,312 --> 01:18:47,832
well that's just your nightmare oh he tests i can't take tests too much pressure i had to take the

1512
01:18:47,832 --> 01:18:55,352
act twice i did okay though the second yeah not the first time talk about horror yeah oh sure um

1513
01:18:55,852 --> 01:19:00,312
so there's there's certainly a much more nightmarish version it would be that i'm sure

1514
01:19:00,312 --> 01:19:05,672
clod coats will get his blueprints and get to the bottom of this and we'll see all the various ways

1515
01:19:05,672 --> 01:19:12,932
this sicko wanted to torture the dwarfs you guys i wonder if tim burton used any of the sick and

1516
01:19:12,932 --> 01:19:19,512
twisted stuff for that live action dumbo that's coming out oh yeah that would make sense because

1517
01:19:19,512 --> 01:19:23,892
this is all snow white stuff but maybe you know you got to look for inspiration you know where

1518
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:28,092
you find it if you can get in those disney archives you're going through a lot of stuff

1519
01:19:28,092 --> 01:19:32,832
i think yeah i think tim burton's dumbo is going to be an incredibly challenging film

1520
01:19:32,832 --> 01:19:38,872
we're going to be as freaked out as the italians in 1938 we couldn't process horror

1521
01:19:38,872 --> 01:19:44,732
that count on it um i learned something this is a quick side note i didn't realize this maybe you

1522
01:19:44,732 --> 01:19:48,552
guys know this and i'm just stupid for not realizing it that when they were doing disney

1523
01:19:48,552 --> 01:19:53,272
where they were going to build disney world they were going to basically clone like the ride systems

1524
01:19:53,272 --> 01:19:58,932
for snow white mr toad and peter pan but they were not going to be those movies whoa they were

1525
01:19:58,932 --> 01:20:04,792
going to be sleeping beauty sword in the stone and mary poppins wow they were going to be the

1526
01:20:04,792 --> 01:20:09,392
same ride system was that going to be tony baxter's mary poppins ride that got him the gig

1527
01:20:09,392 --> 01:20:13,672
i don't believe so because i think it was just going to be a peter pan ride system and maybe i

1528
01:20:13,672 --> 01:20:18,532
don't know of the same track and the stuff but then roy o disney said no they got to be the same

1529
01:20:18,532 --> 01:20:23,832
we're not changing what the carrot what the movies are so i mean that would have cost a lot more money

1530
01:20:23,832 --> 01:20:28,332
to make brand new rides that they were brand new i'm saying like peter pans would have been mary

1531
01:20:28,332 --> 01:20:33,452
poppins i know no not brand new ride systems but it would have been more money yeah for sure more

1532
01:20:33,452 --> 01:20:38,912
money but it wouldn't have been like yeah as much of developing but none of them really are clones

1533
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:48,512
like those fantasy land dark rides are not exactly the same from park to park maybe by the time you

1534
01:20:48,512 --> 01:20:53,172
have the carbon copied but as it was like all of these snow white ones are slightly different

1535
01:20:53,172 --> 01:21:00,012
from each other right you have no choice but to go see all of them on this earth if you want to be

1536
01:21:00,012 --> 01:21:04,792
a completist that's what you have to do yeah i mean that would have led to a fascinating like

1537
01:21:04,792 --> 01:21:10,352
two very different fantasy lands between orlando and anaheim if they had totally different awesome

1538
01:21:10,352 --> 01:21:14,492
yeah that would have been crazy if they set that precedent that they would change it every time

1539
01:21:14,732 --> 01:21:19,632
it's sort of smart though because i don't know if this is why he did it but like the famous story is

1540
01:21:19,632 --> 01:21:22,752
that there was not going to be a pirates in florida they're like well you have a pirates

1541
01:21:22,752 --> 01:21:28,152
in california and then too many people complained and then they scrapped like a cool new ride for

1542
01:21:28,152 --> 01:21:33,432
pirates and they just threw pirates into florida so it's almost like anticipate i mean i don't know

1543
01:21:33,432 --> 01:21:38,692
if that's why roy said it's probably a cost thing he was the money man so that's probably why they

1544
01:21:38,692 --> 01:21:43,972
didn't do something different but so they kind of i feel like the dark rides are like the primary

1545
01:21:44,252 --> 01:21:49,652
movies maybe that was the feeling too we gotta do snow white sleep and beauty that is a primary

1546
01:21:49,652 --> 01:21:55,312
that's not represented in any significant way yeah i guess the castle walk through and me can make

1547
01:21:55,312 --> 01:22:00,052
an argument but no ride and this was going to be that was going to be the scary one that was yes

1548
01:22:00,052 --> 01:22:04,472
going to be the snow white one too so then there was like versions of it that they had drawn up

1549
01:22:04,472 --> 01:22:09,472
and then they decided to go back to do this yeah so that was going to be scary and you'd obviously

1550
01:22:09,692 --> 01:22:15,112
maleficent would appear you know a hundred times on it or something would have been screaming about

1551
01:22:15,112 --> 01:22:20,492
maleficent instead of the witch imagine that i thought it was interesting thinking about like

1552
01:22:20,492 --> 01:22:26,932
when when the disneyland one first opened opening day of disneyland the movie was 18 years old at

1553
01:22:26,932 --> 01:22:32,352
that point right yeah yeah 18 yeah but still but i was because you know when they opened the little

1554
01:22:32,352 --> 01:22:38,612
mermaid ride in california adventure and what would that have been like 2000 and 11 first 10

1555
01:22:38,612 --> 01:22:49,512
11 yeah 11 11 i think um check uh uh the movie was over 20 years old at that point and then

1556
01:22:49,512 --> 01:22:54,892
similarly here but like at the time i was like oh yeah i guess you can i mean that one but little

1557
01:22:54,892 --> 01:23:01,172
mermaid is so beloved i'm wondering if like that did that make more sense for disney to like yeah

1558
01:23:01,172 --> 01:23:06,532
of course we used the little mermaid ride here did that make more sense i guess they had less

1559
01:23:06,552 --> 01:23:12,492
movies when they opened disneyland so i mean it's just big gaps it's interesting to think about

1560
01:23:12,492 --> 01:23:18,292
like oh yeah that movie has been gone for years whereas like guardians of galaxy opened the summer

1561
01:23:18,292 --> 01:23:25,252
guardians of the galaxy 2 was in theaters i mean i assume it's just that they were like in a similar

1562
01:23:25,252 --> 01:23:31,112
way to being like well 20 years later we know this one was a like classic that people still like today

1563
01:23:31,112 --> 01:23:35,232
i'm assuming what that's the same thing with little mermaid where it was like oh yeah this

1564
01:23:35,232 --> 01:23:41,752
seems to be still resonating very hard do we think i think maybe mr toad potentially was a

1565
01:23:41,752 --> 01:23:48,912
more odd choice it was a more recent choice film that probably correct me if i'm wrong i feel like

1566
01:23:48,912 --> 01:23:53,532
people know mr toad because of the ride yeah i agree more than because i don't even know

1567
01:23:53,532 --> 01:24:00,052
it's from the it's it's from like an anthology called adventures of icapod and mr toad

1568
01:24:00,052 --> 01:24:04,872
yeah because it's paired with the legend of sleepy hollow which that concept or someone

1569
01:24:04,872 --> 01:24:12,552
posted that concept art online recently that was going around and i think it's mary blair did concept

1570
01:24:12,552 --> 01:24:20,212
art whatever it is it's beautiful but terrifying sure and that always scared me as a kid i was i

1571
01:24:20,212 --> 01:24:24,892
was scared of that i was scared of the headless horseman sure oh i didn't like the headless

1572
01:24:25,092 --> 01:24:33,032
he gets him at the end yeah sure he doesn't get away there's just a new new school teacher at the

1573
01:24:33,032 --> 01:24:38,252
end am i imagining that the disney version yeah i'm trying to remember now i don't think there's a

1574
01:24:38,252 --> 01:24:44,752
while ending it's more heart rips the he rips out icabod's heart in the tim burton sleepy hollow

1575
01:24:44,752 --> 01:24:52,652
detective icabod crate goes back to new york with his new bride and uh wars he just kind of adopted

1576
01:24:52,652 --> 01:24:58,872
is it johnny depp and halena bottom carter uh johnny depp and christina ricci oh yeah christina

1577
01:24:58,872 --> 01:25:04,052
ricci interesting but what will happen in the will ferrell sleepy hollow when they get around

1578
01:25:04,052 --> 01:25:11,672
to making the comedy versions of john c reilly is the headless horseman yeah i guess that actually

1579
01:25:11,672 --> 01:25:17,252
sounds fun yeah into that what we know will happen is we'll all be laughing we'll all be laughing our

1580
01:25:19,572 --> 01:25:24,512
multiplex um are we at the are we at the plus it up point um i don't remember how this works

1581
01:25:24,512 --> 01:25:29,352
anymore we've been doing so many on this forever city walks how do the how do these episodes go

1582
01:25:29,352 --> 01:25:35,372
what is my name for this stone is the big jewels yeah no stones no stone there's no there's no

1583
01:25:35,372 --> 01:25:40,292
narrative there's no overarching narrative for this thank you just talk about it right and we

1584
01:25:40,292 --> 01:25:45,012
say what we like about it and we just have to determine when we move on nobody is coughing

1585
01:25:45,612 --> 01:25:50,832
tell us yeah how do we oh how do we go back i think what we used to do is we would talk about

1586
01:25:50,832 --> 01:25:55,432
should the ride stay as is should it be plussed up or should it be burnt to the ground for

1587
01:25:55,432 --> 01:26:03,232
insurance money do you have any thoughts i do sure um so yeah i mean plus it up like we usually say

1588
01:26:03,232 --> 01:26:09,772
there's like the problem of course is space with this stuff but amazing they found some in 83

1589
01:26:09,772 --> 01:26:14,012
right they found some in 83 and they made it bigger i can't imagine it being shorter a lot

1590
01:26:14,012 --> 01:26:21,112
these rides yeah especially um and like i do think it's the intimacy of the ride is something

1591
01:26:21,112 --> 01:26:26,632
cool i think the frozen ride in epcot benefits from the fact that they had to force it into this

1592
01:26:26,632 --> 01:26:31,892
smaller space because you kind of get closer to the robots and it's cooler and like there's a

1593
01:26:31,892 --> 01:26:36,372
definitely a feel like as opposed to little mermaid where i feel like it's too big there's too much

1594
01:26:36,372 --> 01:26:40,432
room in little mermaid for some reason for me some of those i mean i thought there was a little room

1595
01:26:40,432 --> 01:26:45,592
obviously but like i don't know it's something about the sea is too but that's but it's the

1596
01:26:45,592 --> 01:26:49,792
grandeur of that sequence then maybe there's a different problem i'm not identifying ending

1597
01:26:49,792 --> 01:26:54,392
though that just skips the last like 20 minutes of the movie yeah i know i'm just saying that

1598
01:26:54,392 --> 01:27:00,252
there's something about um the fantasyland rides that put everything closer to you that makes it

1599
01:27:00,252 --> 01:27:07,392
more interesting it makes it feel special or better to me um but the thing i don't love about

1600
01:27:07,552 --> 01:27:13,252
fantasyland rides and this is just because these tracks are so old is that like the the cars all

1601
01:27:13,252 --> 01:27:18,552
just run at a very similar pace the whole time and it just feels like you're getting it done with it

1602
01:27:18,552 --> 01:27:24,312
doesn't feel like the car itself has any character to it it doesn't feel like like it would be nice

1603
01:27:24,312 --> 01:27:29,852
if you stopped and started in places it would be nice if there were moments like i'm trying to

1604
01:27:29,852 --> 01:27:35,032
think um like you know indiana jones or something just the car vehicle changing up its speed and

1605
01:27:35,032 --> 01:27:40,692
changing where it's pointing or something i feel like would go a long way in making the rides feel

1606
01:27:40,692 --> 01:27:44,112
a little bit more memorable other than just kind of going like all right zip through this thing

1607
01:27:44,112 --> 01:27:48,412
all right you saw all of it all right you're gone like sure like it's not necessarily the amount of

1608
01:27:48,412 --> 01:27:53,852
time you spend i feel like it's the way you're sent through everything that sometimes feels like

1609
01:27:53,852 --> 01:27:58,752
you're not getting a full experience on it i don't know if this is impossible because these are very

1610
01:27:58,752 --> 01:28:03,472
like short tracks and they want to get people in and out because of the ride capacity but like if

1611
01:28:03,572 --> 01:28:10,012
if your car like zipped into the the house the snow white house and it spent 20 seconds sitting

1612
01:28:10,012 --> 01:28:14,592
there watching the little show when they're playing or something maybe 20 seconds is too long

1613
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:18,772
dude at the capacity i know it's i'm talking about things that would ruin the park and there's no

1614
01:28:18,772 --> 01:28:24,592
room there i'm just saying i'm trying to identify why sometimes i feel like these don't give you

1615
01:28:24,592 --> 01:28:32,712
the feeling of a ride and i don't think it's the length of time i think it's the very i think it

1616
01:28:33,512 --> 01:28:39,552
standard like speed i i don't disagree with you but i also think that is what these are i know

1617
01:28:39,552 --> 01:28:49,652
they are just like single speed you know really like minimal not not super flowery attractions

1618
01:28:49,652 --> 01:28:56,032
and it's it is what it is they have an old-timey charm to them and i think it might betray what they

1619
01:28:56,032 --> 01:29:01,552
are to get crazy yes right betray what they are though but i know what you're saying it is what

1620
01:29:01,552 --> 01:29:07,192
it is too dramatic of a word but i like what they are and i guess all i'm saying is like thinking of

1621
01:29:07,192 --> 01:29:14,232
the other rides that are similar to this why don't i want to go on these more often like i

1622
01:29:14,232 --> 01:29:19,492
wonder an adult but that's beside why do we want to go on any of this crap um well like that's

1623
01:29:19,492 --> 01:29:25,612
beside the point i'm just saying that there's there's probably things you could do and may

1624
01:29:25,612 --> 01:29:29,592
and again it may be impossible but i'm blue skying here you know that's what we're doing

1625
01:29:29,592 --> 01:29:35,252
i'm just saying maybe that's no bad ideas in blue skying like like a like if the witch slows your

1626
01:29:35,252 --> 01:29:39,212
car down or something and like you have to deal with like literally deal with her as opposed to

1627
01:29:39,212 --> 01:29:44,052
driving by her like i love the moment in the transformers ride when optimus prime at the end

1628
01:29:44,052 --> 01:29:49,732
of the ride he leans down and he tells you you did a good job i love that i think that's great

1629
01:29:49,732 --> 01:29:54,972
you want the huntsman to lean down and tell you you did a good job uh-huh and i yes i want i want

1630
01:29:54,972 --> 01:30:00,132
an intimate moment with each seven dwarf i want each of them to shake my hand in a way that's

1631
01:30:00,132 --> 01:30:05,352
like your need for mommy approval you like want the characters to tell you you're good uh yeah

1632
01:30:05,352 --> 01:30:10,752
maybe i mean i think that it would be nice if some of the characters told me i was good at least a

1633
01:30:10,752 --> 01:30:15,892
few of them it sounds like you had a very strong bond with these characters when you were young

1634
01:30:15,892 --> 01:30:24,412
i did for sure yes the seven dwarfs uh for sure i was obsessed with the seven dwarfs i may have

1635
01:30:25,132 --> 01:30:29,612
i had all those toys i wanted to hang out with aladdin and and the carpet you wanted to be

1636
01:30:29,612 --> 01:30:35,652
friends with the carpet yeah the carpet was a real scam the carpet and the monkey why can't

1637
01:30:35,652 --> 01:30:44,132
i remember the monkey's name a poo yeah i wouldn't be friends with you want to list the characters

1638
01:30:44,132 --> 01:30:50,572
that i like to be friends with let's let's hit it lumiere cogsworth flounder sebastian uh the dog

1639
01:30:50,572 --> 01:30:56,352
from oliver and come to dodger from oliver and cogsworth well i love the dogs and alluring yeah

1640
01:30:56,352 --> 01:30:59,912
cogsworth and i feel like would get along just fine

1641
01:30:59,912 --> 01:31:07,112
yeah i could see you'd end up you'd under his influence you'd end up growing a mustache that

1642
01:31:07,112 --> 01:31:12,432
looks like two little handles of a clock yes even once i've turned back into a human

1643
01:31:12,432 --> 01:31:19,092
yeah a little thin part and then you see you turn it into you have to shape it into an arrow each

1644
01:31:19,612 --> 01:31:26,192
morning look good on you so i think all to somewhat what my plus up is look for moments of intimacy

1645
01:31:26,192 --> 01:31:32,632
on these rides that's what i'm looking for and i'm not not intimacy in a sexual way intimacy in a

1646
01:31:32,632 --> 01:31:38,532
in a way where you come off feeling like you had a more of a connection with the characters or the

1647
01:31:38,532 --> 01:31:44,452
situation as opposed to just zipping by all of them good job mike from me doc you have to give

1648
01:31:44,452 --> 01:31:50,512
card at the start of the ride obviously that should be in every ride it's your passport to

1649
01:31:50,512 --> 01:31:56,332
get to bavaria or wherever snow white is set but the thing is so fast he has to rip through four

1650
01:31:56,332 --> 01:32:04,292
names like great good thank you thank you i'm proud of you mike do you want to meet my friend shrek

1651
01:32:04,292 --> 01:32:12,612
and it's red donkey i know dodger he's not here but i have his number he knows everyone yeah we

1652
01:32:13,452 --> 01:32:18,192
talk sometimes that's what the magic texting makes it easier they were promising with the magic band

1653
01:32:18,192 --> 01:32:22,412
that's the type of thing that would happen in florida but they really didn't make good on that

1654
01:32:22,412 --> 01:32:29,032
the closest was that was that poster in the rock and roller coaster queue that was like future r&b

1655
01:32:29,032 --> 01:32:35,732
singing sensation michael and it was just a written on the thing but it wasn't like they were they

1656
01:32:35,732 --> 01:32:38,812
were talking about magic bands being like a character would be able to come up to you and be

1657
01:32:38,812 --> 01:32:46,932
hey there michael i heard you stay to port orleans in room 305 i'm proud of you

1658
01:32:46,932 --> 01:32:50,512
how was your meal at south segula float works

1659
01:32:50,512 --> 01:33:01,052
sorry your flight had a delay in talahassee

1660
01:33:01,052 --> 01:33:04,792
i'm noticing your smartphone is running out of space

1661
01:33:05,472 --> 01:33:10,172
your app your disney app another dog is now distracting me in front of this bit

1662
01:33:10,172 --> 01:33:17,072
anyway i was 12 yet michael want me to delete unwanted files for you

1663
01:33:17,072 --> 01:33:24,912
good decision i'm proud of you as long as they say they're proud of me that's all i care about uh

1664
01:33:24,912 --> 01:33:30,732
hey all right so tell mike you're proud of him i look i do come on i do his your house i do his

1665
01:33:30,732 --> 01:33:38,552
voice when he when no one's around what does he say well he said hey he kind of sounds like this

1666
01:33:38,552 --> 01:33:43,892
oh i want to go outside that's my dog voice that sounds like a sick mickey mouse yeah he's a little

1667
01:33:43,892 --> 01:33:47,992
like anxious and he's rumbling right now and he doesn't like it right now he's worried i'm gonna

1668
01:33:47,992 --> 01:33:57,972
do that voice again yeah don't love me anymore the children of the world today that's all i do one

1669
01:33:57,972 --> 01:34:03,392
voice is every every deep male bell what's funny is that the 1983 version when they yelled it

1670
01:34:03,392 --> 01:34:09,232
the guy seemed like he was 20 years old he was kind of hanging off the side of a castle with

1671
01:34:09,232 --> 01:34:17,732
the sword and barely got it out he's coughing um all right plus it up what do you guys think

1672
01:34:17,732 --> 01:34:25,372
i have a i have a genuine answer which is i think it's time to uh oh i think it's time to bring

1673
01:34:25,372 --> 01:34:31,412
seven dwarfs mine train to disneyland really how interesting would it be to i don't think people

1674
01:34:31,412 --> 01:34:36,452
i think people like this i think people like snow white scary adventures i think no one has allegiance

1675
01:34:36,452 --> 01:34:40,612
to it enough to where if it was replaced by something i don't think people would be upset

1676
01:34:40,612 --> 01:34:47,392
and i like what they did in florida i like that this this the florida ride seemingly embattled

1677
01:34:47,392 --> 01:34:53,332
too scary for its first several decades they redid it in 1994 and people thought that that kind of

1678
01:34:53,332 --> 01:34:59,612
the balls off of it it wasn't scary enough so they ended up getting rid of it entirely in 2012

1679
01:34:59,612 --> 01:35:04,452
thinking that well now we will represent snow white via seven dwarfs mine train i haven't been

1680
01:35:04,452 --> 01:35:10,692
on seven dwarfs mine train it seems like an awesome ride and i the area of disneyland i'm

1681
01:35:10,692 --> 01:35:16,972
the most interested in in terms of expansion at this point is i mean toonetown but everything

1682
01:35:16,972 --> 01:35:22,232
up there the fantasyland theater the former videopolis i feel like that's all prime spot for

1683
01:35:22,232 --> 01:35:27,552
and you've heard rumors that frozen happens there i think it'd be cool if it seems like a really

1684
01:35:27,552 --> 01:35:35,212
smooth transition to go from either frontier land or or star wars galaxy's edge however works

1685
01:35:35,212 --> 01:35:42,372
to go from that to the to the rocks of the snow white coaster and that that kind of transitions

1686
01:35:42,372 --> 01:35:47,392
you maybe this frozen up there too and that transitions you into whatever's left of toontown

1687
01:35:47,392 --> 01:35:53,992
i think they could get rid of gadgets go coaster and do uh bring this ride there and then maybe

1688
01:35:53,992 --> 01:36:01,052
that opens up the possibility of doing a new uh 50s style dark ride perhaps for a more recent

1689
01:36:01,052 --> 01:36:06,892
property i think i think it actually would be interesting to see like let's do a little frozen

1690
01:36:06,892 --> 01:36:15,172
ride or let's do rapunzel or let's do uh or one of these sword and stone or sleeping beauty or

1691
01:36:15,372 --> 01:36:20,552
i think the i feel like walt might have wanted more change over of these rides i agree with that

1692
01:36:20,552 --> 01:36:25,732
kind of rinky dink enough that you could update them and change them out um that'd be my i just

1693
01:36:25,732 --> 01:36:29,912
think i think that would all be interesting doesn't have to happen but i that seems like a cool

1694
01:36:29,912 --> 01:36:36,492
disneyland move of the future well how about this you take out the storybook boats you take out casey

1695
01:36:36,492 --> 01:36:42,412
jr no and you put the whole coaster back there i don't know if it's big enough you're a huntsman

1696
01:36:42,552 --> 01:36:47,192
and we'll eventually do the coaster um and you guys neither of you guys have been on it right

1697
01:36:47,192 --> 01:36:53,412
the snow white i wrote it oh you wrote it okay i don't want to review that but i i do find the

1698
01:36:53,412 --> 01:36:58,132
ending of that lacking i feel like we need a good ending for it but that's another show sure um but

1699
01:36:58,132 --> 01:37:03,192
okay fine you put that back there with get rid of casey jr burn it to the ground for insurance money

1700
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:13,912
how dare you and uh the storybook boats uh and then how about this we combine toad and

1701
01:37:13,912 --> 01:37:20,112
snow white into one ride somehow i knew it doesn't have to be those properties one big toad but those

1702
01:37:20,112 --> 01:37:27,072
are fine one big toad those are separate sides of the castle oh wait i'm confused then no wait

1703
01:37:27,072 --> 01:37:30,812
no no no no i want to have you say and take out pinocchio's during journey oh so you want to keep

1704
01:37:30,812 --> 01:37:36,572
pinocchio's yeah yes my favorite now the allegiance has come out yeah actually i was curious about this

1705
01:37:36,572 --> 01:37:43,232
in general favorites favorite of the fantasy lander it's gotta i mean it has to be peter pan okay toad

1706
01:37:43,232 --> 01:37:49,892
i'm pinocchio now i i this will do a full toad obviously but toad as much as i love it i love

1707
01:37:49,892 --> 01:37:56,492
the concept you can't deny that it's a lot of flats there's a lot of flats there's no robots on it

1708
01:37:56,912 --> 01:38:04,092
but he's a real scamp i love those devils hopping around i don't know i feel like we need some robots

1709
01:38:04,092 --> 01:38:08,712
i think the flats have a lot of personality and i think the train hitting you gag is very clever

1710
01:38:08,712 --> 01:38:13,392
the devil's fun i agree i'm just saying that peter pan has to beat it i think unfortunately for me

1711
01:38:13,392 --> 01:38:20,772
i don't think it does because for me because that is not it is it is not worth the wait it is all

1712
01:38:20,772 --> 01:38:27,392
that is out of control the line has nothing going on i think i somehow take some of the line

1713
01:38:27,392 --> 01:38:31,632
if they could kick out a store or something get a little more space do something a little more

1714
01:38:31,632 --> 01:38:37,232
interesting with that line uh but i i think what i like i think i like snow white and pinocchio

1715
01:38:37,232 --> 01:38:43,292
because you can just essentially walk right on them always and are they that is peter pan that

1716
01:38:43,292 --> 01:38:48,312
much better than the other kind of ride system i kind of believe peter pan is that much better

1717
01:38:48,432 --> 01:38:54,372
yeah i think it's a whole letter grade above those rides once since the upgrade yes i think

1718
01:38:54,372 --> 01:38:58,492
i've written it once because the line is just always so bad unless you go first thing in the

1719
01:38:58,492 --> 01:39:04,872
morning yeah no i i hear you i we don't go on it a lot either it's just it's the reason is it's the

1720
01:39:04,872 --> 01:39:10,232
best one it's yeah that's unfortunately the reason is that it's the best one and everyone knows it

1721
01:39:10,232 --> 01:39:16,892
toad's weirder this is why this is i think a lot of people would vote toad over peter pan

1722
01:39:16,892 --> 01:39:21,852
especially since we lost especially since we lost it let's look at the app right now let's see what

1723
01:39:21,852 --> 01:39:28,392
the line is we don't need to look at that we're looking at the app right now i'm gonna change my

1724
01:39:28,392 --> 01:39:35,152
points you have no put your phone down it's loading i have a ton of let's let's put the poll up on

1725
01:39:35,152 --> 01:39:46,872
twitter uh although now people might have allegiances they're just wanting to spite one of us but i

1726
01:39:46,872 --> 01:39:51,152
would love to say toad i would love to say it it would make me happy it doesn't sound like you would

1727
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:56,752
i absolutely would toad is a more obscure choice i'd love to be like cool and hip and pick the cool

1728
01:39:56,752 --> 01:40:03,532
underground ride next to the mainstream ride toad is liking like liking brian eno or something

1729
01:40:03,532 --> 01:40:07,892
saying brian eno is your favorite artist or something it's not saying it's exactly like that

1730
01:40:07,892 --> 01:40:16,852
and mr toad produced a lot of great stuff too he wasn't just a performer well look right now peter

1731
01:40:16,852 --> 01:40:22,492
put the phone down i know the no i could have guessed that michael we said no phones during podcast time but it was in the it was a disneyland app

1732
01:40:22,492 --> 01:40:31,172
we are not proud of you right now but i said put the phone away all right uh so i'll give mine yeah uh i'll give

1733
01:40:31,172 --> 01:40:36,332
my silly the skykeeper serious answer i'll give a silly nonsense answer okay um so one thing we

1734
01:40:36,332 --> 01:40:43,912
didn't talk about is how when they changed uh this ride in disneyland the the ride vehicles used to

1735
01:40:43,912 --> 01:40:50,992
be shaped like mine carts and now they are shaped like beds and each bed has yeah the dwarf's name on

1736
01:40:50,992 --> 01:40:58,552
it i think you know i think about watching the first lie down dark ride i think we go further i think we

1737
01:40:58,552 --> 01:41:04,272
think about watching these uh movies with our families on family movie night all cozied up

1738
01:41:04,272 --> 01:41:09,892
on the couch with lots of blankets i think you really get pampered i think they really should

1739
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:17,332
pamper you like you're getting into a bed i i want some are they beds they were beds no that's the

1740
01:41:17,332 --> 01:41:21,812
ride vehicle that's a question is is what are these i saw an article asking that question are they really

1741
01:41:21,812 --> 01:41:29,032
beds i don't know they're sort of bed-ish they kind of look like where you look that's true okay but am i

1742
01:41:29,032 --> 01:41:35,692
in reality i'll say my my real answer is i like the little i know the i know the budget got scaled

1743
01:41:35,692 --> 01:41:40,952
but like the last time for the 60th anniversary it kind of gave a fresh coat of paint upgraded

1744
01:41:40,952 --> 01:41:47,632
some effects on all these rides i think that is the way you keep them going uh i think just every

1745
01:41:47,632 --> 01:41:54,992
few years you you get some you know you certainly keep a lot of the animatronics or a lot of the

1746
01:41:54,992 --> 01:42:02,532
figures but you you plus it up a little with rear projection or new sound cues or new

1747
01:42:03,112 --> 01:42:09,372
whatever uh i mean because i don't know i think people just like the fantasy land rides kind of

1748
01:42:09,372 --> 01:42:15,232
as they are there's a reason people are waiting 20 minutes even just 20 minutes 50 minutes

1749
01:42:15,232 --> 01:42:21,512
to see these things sure how about also at the end of the ride we meet the mysterious man who

1750
01:42:21,512 --> 01:42:25,752
takes the jewels into town and sells them for the seven i mean i would love to learn more about the

1751
01:42:25,752 --> 01:42:31,652
economic uh is that have they oh no well that's i was going to say did they relinquish out to

1752
01:42:31,652 --> 01:42:38,572
action but they haven't done a live action no they haven't have they so when the rock plays

1753
01:42:38,572 --> 01:42:45,332
the huntsman well there was a snow white was a huntsman that was another studio yeah but the

1754
01:42:45,332 --> 01:42:51,372
huntsman can't be this star and we get the live action of disney's snow white well let's just

1755
01:42:51,372 --> 01:42:56,112
you know if the although i don't know let's get a more interesting i don't know like steve buscemi

1756
01:42:56,112 --> 01:43:05,732
or somebody is the man who uh who just cheats the dwarfs out of all of their way hailey steinfeld

1757
01:43:05,732 --> 01:43:12,592
is the snow white yeah she's snow white and how about uh grumpy no no doc is played by the rock

1758
01:43:12,592 --> 01:43:19,332
that would be very funny that's like infinity war where uh what's his face is the real big

1759
01:43:19,332 --> 01:43:25,672
the guy from uh game of thrones oh oh peter dinklage is the giant yeah oh

1760
01:43:25,692 --> 01:43:32,972
that's good stuff you know all right yeah neat opposites and dealing with uh uh finances and

1761
01:43:32,972 --> 01:43:38,572
finding out why the dwarfs are getting screwed yeah uh well part of the film is just looking at

1762
01:43:38,572 --> 01:43:42,732
spreadsheets they'll just put spreadsheets up on the screen we can scan it and go oh yeah oh no

1763
01:43:42,732 --> 01:43:47,092
that's that's that's bad or they'll put the screens on the ride like they did on spaceship earth

1764
01:43:47,092 --> 01:43:51,312
and you'll be able to look at the spreadsheets while the ride's happening oh that would be great

1765
01:43:51,312 --> 01:43:55,972
i mean because the more we talk about this the more i realize the dwarfs are probably wealthy

1766
01:43:55,972 --> 01:44:01,592
enough that they could get the huntsman to turn on the queen and overthrow her yeah and they could

1767
01:44:01,592 --> 01:44:08,492
rule yeah wouldn't that be a good sequel yeah the dwarfs ruling the king dwarfs ruling the king

1768
01:44:08,492 --> 01:44:13,232
and see how power corrupts and money corrupts them yeah yeah soon enough they're all cooking up

1769
01:44:13,232 --> 01:44:21,252
poison apples too and trying to knock off their enemies anyone in power would be working with

1770
01:44:21,252 --> 01:44:29,212
the dwarfs to turn from their kingdom to kick some ass take that i dedicate this

1771
01:44:29,212 --> 01:44:37,092
beheading to the children of the world this ass whooping to the children of the world

1772
01:44:37,092 --> 01:44:45,212
um all right these are all great ideas yeah folks you survived haunt cast the fright the first

1773
01:44:45,212 --> 01:44:50,252
edition of haunt cast the fright and we'll be talking about other scary rides throughout

1774
01:44:50,272 --> 01:44:56,592
the month could they possibly get scarier than this i don't know of a scenario where a ride would

1775
01:44:56,592 --> 01:45:02,332

it's on youtube and it's a it's a thing called tiny fuppets 4dx uh this is a i've been a fan

1785
01:46:01,712 --> 01:46:07,032
and a proponent of this series for a long time it's a portuguese animated show it's just been

1786
01:46:07,032 --> 01:46:12,952
in 2d for a long time uh called tiny fuppets and it's remarkable animation i mean i'm trying to
