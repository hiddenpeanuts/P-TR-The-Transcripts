00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Good evening podcast listeners. Terrorist Solomon Lane and his group of apostles have stolen plutonium for a nuclear attack.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In response, your three hosts have decided to watch this from fancy leather chairs that jostle them around.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to listen to the boys talk about the chairs.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If you're caught listening to this by significant other or someone you respect, the host will disavow any knowledge of your actions.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This podcast will self-destruct in odds are verging on two hours. Good luck.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is Podcast The Ride, 4DX edition.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, hosted by three guys who will tear you a new asshole if you call it the Main Street Electrical Parade song

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
instead of Baroque Hoedown. The song has a name, show some respect and learn it.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's an edict from me, Scott Gardner, and hopefully you guys agree, Mike Carlson.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I do agree and I think I'm upset. Let me take a look here. Is that in my Apple Music, I don't know if it says Baroque. I think it might list it incorrectly.

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Tsk, tsk. Well, I mean, if it's on a Disney album, then it is what it is, I guess. I just know that the original song that it's based on, the meat of it, and I won't do any more, we have to pay for it.

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Baroque Hoedown is the main thing by Electronic Music Pioneers, Perry and Kingsley.

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah, look at this. Disney's Electrical Parade is what it's listed as here and it's bullshit, you're right. It should say Baroque Hoedown.

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Great, I'm mad at the album too. Disney also in the wrong. Jason Sheridan is here.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yeah, so how long is that track though that you pulled up?

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Nine minutes, 57 seconds.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So that's the full loop though. That's the full...

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes, yes, that's the whole thing you can hear.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Which does not, of which Baroque Hoedown is a piece, but also obviously it goes into, you know, Alice in Wonderland music and Cinderella music and what have you.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So I guess that is an accurate title and all is forgiven with this album.

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Man, that was a close... I was really upset there for two minutes, but now we're okay, now everything's fine.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hey, we're on Disney's side. Hey, in multiple ways, guys, the union issue worked out.

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes, congratulations to Disney employees getting $15 an hour by next year.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:56,000
They get an immediate raise and then they get $15 an hour, which is going to be beating, I guess, the minimum wage in California, which is going to be $15 by 2020.

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So they're ahead of the curve. And all it took was some of the employees threatening to build a shantytown outside of Disneyland. That's all it took.

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And the most popular politician in the country coming to Disneyland, coming to Anaheim, shaming them and then dragging them on Twitter for months.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Arassing Bob Iger specifically. Hey, these things make a difference.

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't think anybody wants to be mean and angry right now, but I think it's what you have to do to...

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes, get attention.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
...change, which I guess, which is also true of installing you as the mayor.

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Maybe we got to get Bernie on our side and he needs to endorse you.

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh, Bernie Ocasio. I want everyone on board.

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
A Bernie Ocasio dual event to endorse Jason as the mayor.

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And let the record show. This is Mayor Disneyland. A friend of mine, future potential guest, Avery Monson, texted me today.

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He's like, hey, you know, in the current Golden Horseshoe show, there is a mayor frontier land.

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I have no beef with him, but I will be rat fucking him.

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But just for fun, just Nixon style rat fucking, but just for kicks.

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Just to assert your dominance and that frontier land certainly is within your jurisdiction.

40
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Will he let you use the Golden Horseshoe for a campaign event with the Bernie event?

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Like where would the Bernie event take place?

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Oh, that's a good question.

43
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
In Disneyland, like what's the best venue for it?

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You get him on your side. I mean, the biggest is Lincoln.

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But maybe you have to appeal to Lincoln himself in order to get permission.

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, I don't know. I mean, there's a venue, obviously, like the where they do the Mickey and the Magical Map show.

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's a pretty big venue, but maybe not the intimacy you're looking for.

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You know what? Maybe it's a handshake that maybe it's at the country bear, you know, maybe it's at the restaurant.

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You're asking, you're saying the hungry bear.

50
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. The hungry bear.

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah, yeah. Country bear. All they can picture is them on the restroom sides.

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The politician in Ohio or I'm sorry, Iowa, kind of like, you know, on the stump shaking hands in the diner is what you're thinking.

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh, OK. Well, that's fair.

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But you want the event to take place. Could it be in the dining room on Haunted Mansion?

55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Oh, how about this? OK, go ahead.

56
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The phantasmic stage. The phantasmic stage and everyone surrounds the rivers of America.

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And then you take the little raft over at the end when everyone's clapping and then you start shaking hands.

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So you get off the dock. OK. But then like, does the Maleficent Dragon come out and it says like bad policy or bad government?

59
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And then you and Mickey like slay the dragon?

60
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
No, obviously we want the Maleficent Dragon under. It's a big tent. We want the Maleficent Dragon on our side.

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You don't slayer, you convert her. Oh, that's good.

62
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You use rules and rationale to get her in the tent.

63
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
With policies that appeal to people and their daily lives.

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's a much less exciting phantasmic show, but I get why you're got your point.

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah. And if hopefully we can get if somebody who looks kind of like you can pop up in a different place

66
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and then you appear like closer to the river bank, like like a little magic switch out like Mickey does.

67
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And you pop up at the very end and say some policies, huh?

68
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, some platform, eh?

69
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
No one said you can't have a little fun in politics, you know, little razzle dazzle razzle dazzle.

70
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Well, I'm looking forward to the fan.

71
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Well, no, you'd replace Mick Fantas. Jay Jay has Jay Sherwood.

72
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let's just go the other way. Jay's Tasmic.

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Jay's Tasmic. Jay's Tasmic. Yeah, it represents Mickey and you.

74
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Hey, well, you know, today we're talking about we're going to we're going to have just a little fun,

75
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
casual episode here and talk about what we consider the the thrill ride of the summer.

76
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Mission Impossible 4DX, Mission Impossible Fallout 4DX.

77
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't know where the colons and dashes go exactly. No idea.

78
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And this is not don't worry about spoilers in this episode because this is really, you know,

79
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I think in my mind, we're less talking about the film and more talking about what the chairs do.

80
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
There is one moment that is a spoiler that I would like to talk about, but I will indicate ahead of time.

81
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm just saying I don't think it's a episode chock full of spoilers. Yes.

82
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I say I say tune in even if you haven't seen the film and we will certainly convince you to go enjoy this 4DX experience.

83
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
If it's in your town, which it is, if you live in Korea or Japan and possibly not unless you're in or one place in Slovenia.

84
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Is that right? I think it's Slovenia. There's a 4DX in Slovenia.

85
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Hey, it's very weird spot. Melania's parents go, go chill.

86
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Go take your mind off everything going on with your daughter.

87
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Melania's dad who looks just like Trump. Yes. Google it. That's not a joke.

88
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Google Melania's father. And it's a big man with a red tie with a stern face.

89
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And it's shocking. It's a very funny thing that cuts through the clutter and explains it.

90
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm going to warn right now, though. I'm probably going to fuck it up.

91
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
They just start dropping spoilers. Oh, that's fine.

92
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah. Feel free to razzle. I'm sorry. It's Slovakia. Slovakia. Oh, no.

93
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I don't know what's close to where, but they can check it out.

94
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But before we get into all that, I thought this might be a nice place to tell you guys about something that I came across.

95
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:51,000
A couple episodes ago in the 20,000 Leagues episode with Stony Sharp, something spilled out of the backlog of my brain,

96
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
which is that when I was about 10 years old, I did an assignment for school,

97
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
in which I made up an imaginary theme park based on then topical events.

98
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And the theme park was OJ land. And the reason this came up, well, I forget which.

99
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Maybe that came up first. And then we specifically talked about one of the attractions in the show,

100
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
which was Captain Edo, a Judge Lance Edo themed redo of Michael Jackson's Captain Edo,

101
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
which, by the way, since we talked about that, incredibly, we were all together when this was discovered.

102
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We were sent fan art of Captain Edo on Instagram, which was fantastic. I don't have his info in front of me, but fantastic.

103
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Oh, and also me as a centaur. Oh, that's right. Interactive from my experience volunteering at a show. Whoa.

104
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
OK, well, yeah, let's give him a shout out if you don't mind looking it up. It's amazing.

105
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
CJ Word, Christopher James Warrington. Thank you very much. Check out his Instagram.

106
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
There's a lot of really fun art on there. Yeah, indeed. Great work. Thank you so much for that.

107
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Seeing this, you know, this new well rendered art made me think I need to go back into the archives and find the real deal.

108
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
All right. So what I have to present to you now is the original.

109
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I mean, photocopies of it, but I have this school assignment and I will hand it out to you guys now.

110
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Now, I haven't like vetted this. So this is a photo copy. I'm allowed to mark up.

111
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yeah, although I spilled a little water on all the but you can grade it like a like a teacher.

112
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I have a ballpoint pen here that is a promotional pen from the movie After Earth.

113
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Beautiful. I stole it from a restaurant when I found it and I said, I don't steal pens. I'm a good boy.

114
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But after Earth, I must have it. Yeah. You appreciate it more. Appreciate it more than other people.

115
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So I all right. I I strive on the show to not put find myself in a vulnerable position, but I feel like I needed to throw this out and not look at it too carefully, not vetted right before you guys took a look.

116
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And I'm not saying we need to read the whole thing. I don't want to. We shouldn't spend a ton of time on it.

117
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm just I would just like if you guys rifled through and just like noted any right details that jump out the front page is kind of the drive into OJ land, seemingly Florida inspired this trees.

118
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's clearly kind of a swampy vibe and and OJ is up at the top of the sign in a prison uniform like the Hamburglar right would wear, though he certainly almost did not wear that uniform.

119
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I have a question. I don't think I mentioned this on the show. Was this inspired by all the like Jay Leno OJ jokes at the time?

120
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Because you were a big Leno fan as a child. My friends. Oh, is it in here? I'm you since you I was kind of hoping you wouldn't find it.

121
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Well, I have some just set up. Hold on, hold on, hold on. What is he was about to say something?

122
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Well, there's no set order to go through this. OK, you describe it. I wanted more context, but go ahead. No, no, no. Let's let's get into it. You'll hear it.

123
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You'll hear it. All right. All right. Fine. How what grade was this and how old would that I want to say fifth grade, though it could be four.

124
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm pretty sure it was fifth grade. OK. And this is the thing that my parents thought was so clever and the teacher.

125
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This is Moldovan and it was it was talked about for a long time. And when I started expressing desire to get into comedy writing as a field, they were all like, well, you'll be a natural.

126
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Right. You did OJ land. And by the way, on the front, a extremely creative and that's a two underlines, two underlines, not the two lines did not form a plus to make an A plus.

127
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But I do consider the underlines a great compliment. It's funny because this does really speak to the climate of the 90s because this is obviously very creative and you would go on to be a very creative adult.

128
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But if you really think about this, it's ghastly. Oh, fuck. Yeah. Crazy. Yeah. But like that.

129
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But that's why I asked the Jay Leno thing, because like it was sort of commonplace for him just to be like, and then OJ Simpson, he chopping up people like he would just say stuff like that.

130
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And that was a joke, even though it was a horrible thing that had happened. I think it reflects a really in the dark time and that I, you know, I blame Leno for making me feel like this wasn't like this.

131
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:44,000
This was fair game to make fun of. I mean, you know, what I will say is the circus surrounding the event. Oh, I get why.

132
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It was a fair game. But I think I'm not even sure I was totally clued in until that great documentary made in America as to how ghastly the actual murder was.

133
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And I think it's something a lot of people overlooked. And with that, and now that I've said that, let's read. Yeah, no, we have to read it.

134
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:18,000
We're all did about it right out right out the gate. The first sentence come to OJ land, the most politically correct place on earth. Now, let's unpack that. I don't. I've been trying to myself and I thought about leaving that page out.

135
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:32,000
We've been giving it to you guys, but I thought I have to just throw it all out there. What feels like a turn, an event of its era and a term that came into the public conscious just kind of mushed together.

136
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's really unclear. And what I think it is, is something that my dad was railing against. I think it might refer to the fact that racial politics took over the trial. And I think maybe my dad possibly was ranting about political correctness as it pertained to the to the event.

137
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And then I combined it with the Disneyland phrase, the happiest place on earth. You know, there's other things in this document where I do feel like I grasped more of the complexities of the trial. Yeah.

138
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:12,000
How, but that is certainly not one of them. And I'd like to apologize for it. But with that said, I think it gets less less embarrassed. Well, no, that's not true.

139
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Well, I just saw juice in the ears, a combination of a juice and imagine and engineers. Oh my goodness. And this is all written in like, I think, fourth and fifth grade was in there really like you have to write in cursive.

140
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Which is, I think, for most people, although not everyone in my family, I as soon as I didn't have to write in cursive anymore. I'm like, great. Failed. Yeah. My signature now is a squiggle.

141
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yeah, I am. Although I'm sure if I did cursive right now, it would look exactly like the curse of doing cursive right now to see if I remember to do it.

142
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:03,000
There was like a weird kind of do the SATs. There's like a statement you have to transcribe as like a legal thing and you have to do it in cursive. Geez. And it's hook forever.

143
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Was there like a cursive lobby at a certain point or a person in the government or an education that was really trying to push the cursive is like a really like sophisticated way to communicate.

144
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:25,000
My dad went to Catholic school, like K through 12, and I know the nuns and priests were very much like curse. I feel like people who went to Catholic schools where I grew up stuck with cursive.

145
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah. And my parents seem to find it like a moral imperative to keep cursive alive. But I'm not sure why. Is it something to do with like politeness or with the decorum? It's all decorum stuff.

146
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Same reason they want you to know the right fork for the right knife for butter or, we're not talking about knives, back to OJ. Printing was just the commoners way to write.

147
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Lazy is what it is. They claim that they have common rights and protections.

148
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Feel free to just call it anything. There's also a narrative going on here too. Wait until you just, it's pretty, this is the worst thing I've had to reveal on the show. I didn't have to. I volunteered it and you'll see what it is.

149
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Also the creative team got Jay Leno, host of The Tonight Show. This way we could play his songs and use the dancing eetos.

150
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The dancing eetos. Oh, so they get a corporate, you didn't make your own new version. This is a corporate partnership with the Jay Leno Tonight Show.

151
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Scott, I love how you figured out licensing agreements. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was funny. Hey, I went to Disneyland. I knew that things said copyright Lucasfilm and I knew we had to work with the Leno film.

152
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Let me back up and just volunteer and say, okay, the whole idea was born from a young boy from a San Fernando Valley. 10 year old Scott Gardner is this boy. He said that OJ land will never be completed as long as.

153
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Well, boy, you felt that way sometimes. I swear that trial just kept going. As long as OJ is still in civil court. That's something to note is that I think this was done in the lead up to the civil trial and the criminal trial was already over.

154
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The die was cast. So if you connect those pieces, and I will in this next part, that tells you my involvement, me a 10 year old boy, then we partner with Jay Leno.

155
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Jay and Scott created the attractions and shows. They also created the layout of the park. I like if a listener could make some fan art of you as a 10 year old boy and Jay Leno working together over like drafting papers or in like what models working models that would be.

156
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I am in a little denim suit. The way that Dustin Hoffman as hook made the kid be in a miniature hook costume Leno dressed me as him. I'm under his control.

157
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So this is this is like a fan fiction right of me a boy working working alongside Jay Leno made all the stranger by the fact that I, I went and worked for ostensibly the enemy of the, of the, of the, of the Leno show what became the Conan, you know, what was briefly the, the tonight show I guess 10 year old me would have been disappointed.

158
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But what I wanted to dream. Yeah, I was the land. So it says OJ's adventure land adventures land I guess there's an S at the end of that. Maybe that's a typo. Yeah, we're now you're into the attract the list of attractions.

159
00:19:38,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Oh, sorry. Yeah. So, so, Enchanted living room is one of the rides. I mean this does for a 10 year old this is obviously a high level of being able to do parody and combining two things. It's a very you can tell that is why people were reacting to it so much Mike and something that I think about a lot is that I am specifically in my writing career a little lacking in the area of topical comedy, and I think I peeked at 10 years old I think if I could get some of this mojo back.

160
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Maybe I could maybe they'd take my packet at cordon. I don't even know that you need to get the mojo back I think you're just bringing that I think we're selling limited run chat books of this right that's what they, it's not quite a book it's not quite a magazine right that's what they call.

161
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm not sure nice pamphlet sort of thing I think we're some form this can live in army man we're going to sell like a few hundred of these and this will be the next generation comedy, the self distributed magazine that predated the Simpsons and other shows yeah I think this will be just as influential.

162
00:20:45,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So pirates of the dream team as Jason said that one may be a little less like clever title wise, but it had to get moved down it wasn't in the right. I foolishly listed it as part of OJ's adventures land, and not, is there a New Orleans Square.

163
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh it gets classified oh it's in dream team land. It's in. Oh, I see I see I see. Yeah, I think today I would do like dream team square USA I'd get it a little more right, because it shouldn't always be land obviously they they change it up.

164
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Oh, but yeah maybe I'll just list the lands OJ's adventures land, land of mystery. Hmm, not sure that I'd X that that's, that's off the list firm it firm and land from land is what I wanted to talk about next.

165
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yeah, so Mark Furman. What does it say your monthly show.

166
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Show here, like, you know, Elvira knots they look he's a celebrity. We know we're not getting Mark Furman right. There's nothing about the racism here though.

167
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I think that's a part of it. That's the thing that I maybe wouldn't have grasped back then and thank God because I think 10 year old me is racial politics might have to be deleted from the podcast, not I wasn't a blue I wasn't a racist kid.

168
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Even though the mark for most not really a nuance he was just super racist. But see I didn't all that I know what the time see my collector, my parents were not of you know what I caught was, I saw the dancing egos, and I knew that Johnny Cochran went on these rants that people found

169
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:40,000
funny and put on costumes, I didn't. My parents I think shielded me from the fact that there was a tape where he said the N word it's gonna time. Oh yeah I mean this is the like God this all of this is the Leno fide. Yes, cartoon version of this.

170
00:22:40,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Which is sort of a good way to say like whitewashing or like covering up the more difficult end of the thing I consider myself, having been brainwashed by Leno, as you as as will be evident in this art of me in the little denim suit.

171
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It is interesting because like people are always like well you know we need to laugh we didn't make jokes about all this stuff but to a kid, it really makes it into like this like not vicious thing at all.

172
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Yeah, maybe no more jokes about anything.

173
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:33,000
That is kind of horrifying in our current reality where everything is speeding up, everything is just getting odder and odder all like what do kids joke about Trump what do God help me what do kids joke about me to Jesus Christ.

174
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:47,000
That one's just impossible there's no fun characters everybody's just bad. I think though the the the OJ trial in the way it was presented it was just so much more of an innocent time despite it being about this horrible thing.

175
00:23:47,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And what I like about Trump is that no one stays in the administration long enough really to be this like colorful character I mean I guess Sean Spicer and Sarah Sanders or Perry never but the way that these attorneys right just kind of have like these imagine that the lawyers had this kind of grip on pop culture that they didn't really ask for.

176
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Yeah.

177
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And for me for months for you for years even.

178
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:25,000
That's crazy. And I loved I soaked up every part of it and cleaning great with great parodies like Darden rail is as Marsha in legal land and Darden rail Darden rail.

179
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I gave Darden the monorail is am I missing I probably am missing it. Where is Cato in all of this.

180
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Is Cato in the back anywhere I'm not sure Cato.

181
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:48,000
That's crazy. Yeah it was the most kid friendly cartoon character in my mind at the time I knew Cato joke oh Cato is that silly silly guy in the back.

182
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Shaggy from Scooby Doo zoinks OG.

183
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Well, easy fix the Cato cell and it's all the all the vehicles are all different it's all him sleeping at different minutes of the night it's him sleeping to 34 it's like 45 the Cato you could have the hotel rooms like the Cato suite and it's just like this tiny room in the back of the hotel.

184
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yeah.

185
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I approve you if it was like a Star Wars immersive style hotel like they're going to build like you would have a teenager playing Cato and he'd like kind of come over and try to hang out with you during the day.

186
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Uh huh. And your window with a window be blacked out and you would have a view of OJ's Brentwood. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

187
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It would be digital screens instead of windows. I like all this I like these ideas, I would say, I do have to run everything by Jay. Sure final. Yeah, yeah.

188
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
But in the but in theory, I looking at yeah he may have an issue.

189
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Looking at the OJ Simpson story featuring a moment with Mr Simpson. Now, I'm hoping it's not the moment I'm thinking of.

190
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:13,000
But I do admire fourth grade Scott's commitment of using the full official like just referenced in an episode very recently the convoluted nature of the title. Yeah. And now. Yeah. Yeah, I knew it. I knew it then.

191
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Al Cowling reference here California Cowling. I mean, this is great. Like I will say like if you and I met and I was what 11 and you were 10 or whatever you had much more you had more names than I did.

192
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I knew Cato I think I probably knew Johnny Cocker and knew OJ knew the gist of it. I don't think I knew as deep as I don't think Al Cowling's was in my brain at that point.

193
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Let alone to make the leap that him driving the Jeep is like you driving the Jeep in the Indiana Jones. Right.

194
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Him avoiding obstacles and the other people with signs on the freeway are like the dart blowers.

195
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:06,000
OJ's Haunted Mansion and the tagline here is when the court took a field trip to OJ's house, it was decorated so nicely. Could it be haunted?

196
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:22,000
This is a reference to when they revamped the decor. Oh, right. To make him a more appealing and to sort of nod to his heritage and stuff. They did a little they like dressed up the house.

197
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I don't think I was very cognizant of this all at the time, but I watched religiously the people versus OJ Simpson on FX like a year and a half, two years ago.

198
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So this is all Al Cowling's took me a second. Yeah. So, OK, so there's a drawing which I assume is Johnny Cochran and it says the Lion King Parade. Yes.

199
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:55,000
There's also a Lion King parking garage. Did I see that right? Possibly. This is another combination of topical thing of the time. The hit movie The Lion King.

200
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Well, it's spell lion, though. Oh, yes. Sorry. It's L.Y.I.N. King. Apostrophe King. He's Johnny Carrey's telling lies. He's the lion. You were anti-Johnny. I like that still.

201
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Was that that seems like that could have easily you could have worked in the Leno writers room with that.

202
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:25,000
This is coming on here. You know, it's kind of like, you know, it's like, yeah, that's not the joke, obviously. But you like that would be a joke that I could see being on.

203
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Yeah, there's a way. There's a way to frame that as a way to do it to make it a lot of joke.

204
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I yeah, look, this has a packet. I think I have a packet ready to go. It's probably for the Jalen O'car show.

205
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It's your point. Yeah, maybe that's still a job. Do you think you'd have OJ on the car show?

206
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I think. Whoa, that's an idea. Hey, smile, Bronco.

207
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Jett juice. You like this? Bring back memories.

208
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I mean, wouldn't that that would be a ratings event and all ratings events that Leno and OJ in a car together in a Bronco together.

209
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
We're going to try to judge each other's grave in Paris.

210
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Did he did he pass away? I think Judge Edo passed away.

211
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
He didn't. I think he did.

212
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
If that's not true, then Jason, you're the lion king.

213
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Oh, no, he is still alive. Jason. All right.

214
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Who passed away? You're thinking of Judge Edo's brother.

215
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,000
What? And as I said that, I went, what are you talking about, Michael?

216
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But why would you know that he is dead? I feel like there was some I mean, I'll look it up later, but there's some you're talking about his brother, Captain Edo.

217
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Captain Edo has passed away.

218
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Yes, somebody has some somebody told me some story about Captain Captain about Judge Edo's brother.

219
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And maybe they think that's who you're thinking of. Judge Wopner died.

220
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I just judge has died in the last 20 years or so. Larry passed away.

221
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Yes, Judge Wopner is let's see.

222
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Judge Reinhold is doing great. Judge Wopner dead in 2017 at age 97.

223
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
You were thinking of a different celebrity judge. Did they do an autopsy?

224
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:28,000
There could have been foul play. He was 97. He was posing as I know.

225
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I just think Judge Wopner probably put a lot of people away, you know, I see.

226
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
That was a show where you prosecute criminal like murdering criminals on it.

227
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I think he had some small claims court enemies, you know. Well, that's true.

228
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Evil stay mad. So somebody who he forced to pay five hundred fifty dollars tracked him down. Yeah, had him murdered.

229
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Well, let me also let me say the thing that started all this, Captain Edo, of the things in here, I'm I genuinely like the Lion King.

230
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm spelled that way and I like Captain Edo and he is the the oh and the in Edo.

231
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Oh, yeah. It's his rotund body, which was he large? Maybe I just think he was because he was in a Captain Edo.

232
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,000
That's replace judge Edo in my brain. I was Captain Edo. No, I don't think so. I think he was a moderately sized man.

233
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I'm trying to think what Captain Edo would have done. What is his journey of transformation?

234
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Maybe he took all of the hate and discord within Los Angeles around that time, the potential riot about to bubble over and turn the city into a peaceful dance party

235
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:53,000
and made everybody dressed in white and made everyone's vehicles white and magic and glimmering and full of rainbows.

236
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Yeah, he would have just met like put his hand in the air and an angry man would turn into like a wild, buffon haired, crazy backup dancer.

237
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
That would have been to burst out of the wall with that's Alan Dershowitz Alan Dershowitz.

238
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Oh, hang on. Dershowitz. There was not a lot of Dershowitz in here, right? No, I kind of missed him. Yeah.

239
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And the other guys who's a Barry Sheck. Oh, yeah. Sheck not represented. That's another one. Sheck tours. Sheck Mountain. There we go. Sheck Mountain. Sheck Mountain is good.

240
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Will be. Yeah. Dershowitz is the oh, sorry. Sheck Mountain is the you are going through the wild strands of a DNA sample because that's like the track of a roller coaster.

241
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:49,000
You're going through a big helix. Oh, yeah. Sorry. I just had I had to jump on it. You were saying about Dershowitz.

242
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Oh, Dershowitz is sort of like, you know, if there's a Soren type ride where he's welcoming you aboard the Epstein.

243
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
But you're like, oh, there's no way for that. And every even the cast members are like, don't don't go. No, no, don't don't go on that.

244
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:17,000
It's full of famous people that haven't faced repercussions for it. There's all these animatronics of very famous people. Yeah, you don't want to just don't. In the fan art, Leno is whispering into my ear and telling me about this plane.

245
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Don't go near that plane. I know there's a lot of famous people.

246
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And I guess, Scott, also check in your favor. There is a Vanity Fair article from two years ago. Mark Furman slams the people versus OJ Simpson for political correctness.

247
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Wow. So old Furman and 10 year old Scott. Same page.

248
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Wonderful. I think that this I will say that this again for a 10 year old, very impressive. I will say it's not as it already. Excuse me. It is much better than the of course, second gate.

249
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:05,000
OJ's Vegas robbery adventure. It's much better than that. That one was much less exciting. It was cheap. They didn't have enough money. They didn't have, you know, the vision or the money.

250
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Nobody wanted photos with the nine would be thugs. Yes. Tried to help them bring in. They had to put a lot more money into the Vegas robbery adventure years later.

251
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Plus all those attractions that like quickly opened and then quickly closed. You know, the if I did it experience the celebrity boxing, the prank show, Juiced.

252
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Like, you know, they converted juiced to 3D. You could watch it in 3D at the second gate. Oh, OK. It's the whole maybe this is the second gate is like all it's the entire last chapter.

253
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It's everything post trial and any store where you go in and try to get merch and OJ animatronic bursts out and says, hey, that's my stuff.

254
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Oh, man. Man, we're doing we're continuing the thing you started at 10 years old on a podcast. We're 20. Yeah. Twenty three years later. Yeah.

255
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Who knew this was just the first chapter and who would have known that I would add two friends eventually.

256
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
That would have been the biggest shock. Twenty plus years to find it.

257
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Hey, you know, to bring this out and have you guys not just tear it apart and to to find some fun in it, it's I appreciated.

258
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Genuinely, I'm going to give it an A. Whoa. I wrote an A on it. Jason, would you like to grade Scott's on your own?

259
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Of course, I use my after his fingers crossed. I'm nervous. That is also a detail that seems like something I would have like a promotional after Earth pen stolen from a restaurant.

260
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I think I was I with you when I got it. Scott, your your wife, when we were at Pirates Dinner Adventure, she realized we were like either leaving or something.

261
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
She still had the pen for what is it called? What is the sexy cabaret show called?

262
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Oh, what? T-Tro Martin. Yeah.

263
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And she like very quietly leaned over to me and was like, you want this? And I was like, OK. And it was you. You're right. Yes, I do want that.

264
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I'm sure it was an emphatic. Yes. What's your thought there?

265
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Was it just like was she just like it seems like Jason would appreciate a free pen? I think so.

266
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Also, it starts working immediately. It felt very dirty. I'm going to write a first off a plus. Oh, my God.

267
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And I'm going to put it so very grateful, funny and underline that because sometimes I, you know, depending on the teacher, you probably knew the better.

268
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I found extremely creative, either very sincere or very condescending.

269
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Yeah. Hey, you know what? This was a very good teacher, Mrs.

270
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Great. That's very nice. And, you know, you might actually say that the encouragement that I felt from this project made me think that maybe I could move forward in a creative fashion.

271
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,000
So, you know, honestly, this this was a an important piece.

272
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I think the next step you guys having seen it is for me to then to send it to the Conan office and to have them revoke my former employment there and have all of my sketches deleted permanently from the server.

273
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Yeah, they were talking about getting a full archive of all the Conan shows up online and your but your stuff is might just be wiped.

274
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. If this if this comes out, they'll realize what a grave mistake they made.

275
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So, folks, rip Wes Anderson Star Wars now.

276
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Oh, hey, thanks for naming one. Look at that. That's a that was a mashup of two properties.

277
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Oh, yeah. Much like OJ land. Yeah, I did a couple of theme park sketches, too.

278
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
There was a fan correction. People would send in, you know, ways to the mistakes that Conan had made.

279
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And he had he had said seven flags instead of six, which was a very odd mistake. But it gave me license to run around the back lot where that the Gilmore Girls set was the famous Gilmore Girls gazebo.

280
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And I got to turn it into a miniature Conan amusement park. It was like a Conan endorsed.

281
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I was still using the logic there where it's seven flags, but Conan was the property they licensed all our bugs.

282
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:33,000
But if you look at all my theme park related comedy, all of the logic I made, I wasted a lot of time adding that up time that could have been used to make the thing funnier.

283
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
The licensing had to be clean so people would get it.

284
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Yeah, well, and that's my promise for all future theme park related comedy, of which there is much more to come.

285
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Although not today because we're not talking about a theme park. Not today.

286
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,000
But it's a theme park of the mind and body and spirit. Yeah.

287
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And it employs tricks. There's similar tricks or identical tricks, in fact.

288
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Yeah. It honestly we were going to record something else tonight, which we will likely do that thing we had planned at the future.

289
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,000
But we all walked out of this going like this is can we tomorrow? Yeah, let's do this tomorrow.

290
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,000
We all knew us all watching the movie together.

291
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
For the second time.

292
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:29,000
In a row. Yes. In a row of people from other podcasts who were all segregated by their podcast.

293
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
We had to sit with our podcast. You got to show team unity.

294
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And we, you know, that's how the magic happens. You see a movie and you know what? This could be an episode.

295
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I think this is an episode. This is an episode. I think this is thin enough to spin an episode out of.

296
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,000
We're talking just to clarify about Mission Impossible, Fallout, 40X, the 40X experience.

297
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Now, we saw this film opening night. You bought a bunch of tickets and for the IMAX experience.

298
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
At City Walk. At City Walk, a place where we're going to be spending a lot of time in very soon.

299
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Very soon you're going to be hearing a lot about that. Start learning.

300
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Bone up on City Walk now if you want to know what the hell we're talking about.

301
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:23,000
So on a Thursday night we had already seen this film in an elevated setting.

302
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And I think really enjoyed it in that.

303
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
But then people were going to see it, how many? Four days later?

304
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Yeah, Monday. So yeah, that's four days.

305
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,000
At IMAX. Now, if you're not in Los Angeles, in downtown LA, there is a place called LA Live,

306
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
which is one of the fakier malls ever to spring up.

307
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Yeah, LA Live is right by the Staples Center. It's like, I don't know what the boundaries of LA Live are,

308
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:57,000
but it's mostly like this couple block swath of land that has, you know, like a yard house.

309
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
It has a Carl's Urban. It has like a Smash Burger. It's like...

310
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Formerly an ESPN zone. One of the only other ESPN zones around.

311
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
There's a bowling alley. There's a Ritz Carlton right next to it.

312
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Yeah, a couple hotels around in the area. It's like...

313
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Near the Staples Center, near the Microsoft Theater and Club Nokia.

314
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Right.

315
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Maybe it's not called that anymore. I've seen a lot of fun concerts there.

316
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
This is the first time I've really spent any time down there.

317
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I was there at LA Live. Really?

318
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Yeah. I really haven't gotten down there.

319
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Boy, missing out.

320
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Yeah, well, I go down for wrestling events to Staples Center and then you go to yard house afterward

321
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
and you hope you see Randy Orton eating a steak.

322
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Did you see that?

323
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Yeah, of course. And then a friend of ours, Tim Chang, yelled at him out the window

324
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
when we were driving away. And Tim didn't have like a very good thing.

325
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
He just was like, Randy Orton! It wasn't like a funny quip or anything.

326
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Well, relevant to Disney interests, a couple weeks ago, my wife and I got a little too drunk

327
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
at a Pebo Bryson concert. Did he do one of the...

328
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I don't know if he did one of the Disney songs. I want to say that he didn't.

329
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So, sorry to tell you, Beauty and the Beast is out of the set.

330
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Get that fixed, people.

331
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Should I look at the set list?

332
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I guess if you can.

333
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Refresh my memory.

334
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Excellent. If ever you're in my arms again.

335
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Yeah, yeah.

336
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
If ever you're in my arms again.

337
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
What are the Disney songs that he did?

338
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Oh, I'm sorry. Pebo Bryson was the adult contemporary R&B type artist

339
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
who was the male part of the duets of Beauty and the Beast and Whole New World.

340
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Oh, wow.

341
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Yes. Beauty and the Beast, Celine Dion, and Aladdin.

342
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Whole New World was Regina Bell.

343
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Huh.

344
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Yeah. Which are things that I didn't like as a kid.

345
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I remember thinking, play the one from the movie. Don't play this lame grown-up version.

346
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Oh, the singles version. Yeah.

347
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Yes. Then those always, they topped the adult contemporary charts and in the Oscars,

348
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,000
they all performed together like Angela Lansbury performed with Celine and Pebo.

349
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And it's a very moving moment.

350
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I feel like in elementary school, like they, as soon as those movies hit,

351
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
the music teachers bought the sheet music immediately and then like taught us to sing it.

352
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And I feel like they were teaching the arrangements of the adult contemporary versions,

353
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
not the movie one. And I would just be like, why don't we sound like the movie?

354
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I want to do the voice of Cogsworth.

355
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I want to do the movie. Yeah.

356
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
It's just full of kind of like chimes and like.

357
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I cannot find, for whatever reason, Pebo Bryson does not have like recent set lists on setlist.fm.

358
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Okay. Nobody's, that's on me to do.

359
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Yeah. You have to update it. But I have a December 7th setlist.

360
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And it's 22. He ends with Joy to the World. This was maybe a holiday. Oh, no, this is holiday.

361
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
These are all holiday songs. Nevermind.

362
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Not a good sample.

363
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,000
This is, if you wanted to hear anything about Mission Impossible, you've now heard about OJ for 35 minutes.

364
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
You've heard about Randy Orton and Pebo Bryson.

365
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Our three favorite people.

366
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Our three other dream guests, Randy, Pebo and OJ.

367
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Yep. So yeah, look, there's a magical place down in LA Live.

368
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
So much entertainment. It's not as fun as City Walk or Downtown Disney, but it's similar.

369
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Just that's what you know. It's similar to that. A lot of lights, a lot of stimulation.

370
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Family friendly-ish.

371
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And a very nice movie theater, which I'm not sure when, but in the last couple years,

372
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,000
they have started this innovation of, oh, well, the place being.

373
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Well, it is an innovation center.

374
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Regal LA Live Barco Innovation Center is the name of the theater.

375
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:01,000
The theater is called Barco Innovation Center, which, again, it's so elementally.

376
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I hope nobody really wants to hear anything juicy about Mission Impossible.

377
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:13,000
If you do see the movie, which is jaw dropping stunts rather than three guys blathering on.

378
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Yeah. But Barco Innovation Center does sound like, oh, is that one of the names in the big short?

379
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Was that one of the shell companies? Like margin call or something?

380
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
It's very possible that it is. Greenovation.

381
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:36,000
It's like, well, I went to the Barco website to try to get more information,

382
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:45,000
and it will not negate your opinion, Jason, because the way it is about Barco.

383
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Imagine a way to see, sense, and share the intangible.

384
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
It's what happens when big data becomes knowledge, when images become insight,

385
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
and when experiences come to life. That's what Barco is all about.

386
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Barco.

387
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
It is? What do you mean?

388
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
So if you're somewhere and you see images become insight, that was Barco.

389
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:12,000
That sounds a lot like the Cambridge Analytica website.

390
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I mean, these sound like companies that would be like fronts that the IMF force would be combating.

391
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:25,000
When we were in the movie, Barco was using these special chairs to scan all of our phones,

392
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
get all of our contacts, places we've been, interests.

393
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Oh, we scared our faces for the mask.

394
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Mr. Hunt, you will never defeat Barco. Barco is on your trail.

395
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
That sounds like Gollum, but that is sort of what that guy's voice is like.

396
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Yeah.

397
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
It's pretty the villain.

398
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Lane.

399
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Lane, right? Not Lurk.

400
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
They've gotten really good at finding sleazy villains.

401
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
You will find, as we discuss this film, that I remember no characters, names in the film,

402
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
and once again, I think that's OK because we're mainly talking about the chairs.

403
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
It is, but just for the fun of it, let's see how many you can name.

404
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
What's the main character's name? Who does Tom Cruise play?

405
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Ethan Hunt.

406
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Yes. Who does Ving Rhames play?

407
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
The old Jamie.

408
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
No, it's not for you, Jason. I know you know.

409
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Oh, yeah.

410
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Simon.

411
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
No, but you should correct me.

412
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Simon Pegg.

413
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Oh, you said it a little bit. Benji.

414
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Yes, he plays Benji.

415
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Rebecca Ferguson.

416
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Oh, it's Ilsa.

417
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
That's right. Ilsa Faust.

418
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Yeah, there you go. You had the last name, too.

419
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I got no last names.

420
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
How about the...

421
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I know the name of the theater. It's the Barco Innovation Center, but Ilsa Faust.

422
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
How about Cavill, Henry Cavill's character?

423
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Didn't catch it.

424
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I'm trying to remember it.

425
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Do we even know his name?

426
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
He's a plumber.

427
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
He's a plumber.

428
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
He's the CIA's Lee Plumber.

429
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
The bad guy's name is... what's his first name?

430
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I was going to say Jackal Lane, but that's not right.

431
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
It's Lane, though, right?

432
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
His name isn't Lane.

433
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I don't know.

434
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
He talks like a this, though.

435
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Yeah.

436
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
All right. Well, I know the name of the band that did the theme song in part two.

437
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
That's Limp Bizkit, motherfucker.

438
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Sure.

439
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I started watching part two the other night, and it is an amazing time capsule of the year 2000.

440
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Like Scott's OJ thing. OJ.

441
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Yes, very similar.

442
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:25,000
So, yeah. So the movie... I had never done 40X. None of us, right?

443
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I had gone to see Valerian and the Keeper of the 19 Clouds.

444
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
That's the correct...

445
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
City of the Thousand Planets.

446
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:47,000
All right. Okay. And I was having fun. I was enjoying it, but I was particularly tired that day.

447
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
That's something to do in the morning. And I was like, think I got it. Think I got my fill.

448
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
And I left 40 minutes in. It was not meant to be a big protest.

449
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I since have finished the film of Valerian and the 19 Astro Dungeons.

450
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:13,000
So I had experienced it, and that was enough to know some of not only what the chairs do, but what the room does.

451
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,000
And I was impressed. And I've been thinking about 40X ever since. And I'm glad that I did a full experience.

452
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Yeah. I was going to say, I was a little... I don't know if they do this...

453
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:31,000
So before the movie starts, they do a little demonstration of the room, which scares the shit out of me.

454
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Because I actually didn't know how invasive 4DX was. I knew it would jump you around, but I was like...

455
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I didn't either. So you get like a full themed entertainment experience. You get a pre-show.

456
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Yes.

457
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
You get a pre-show.

458
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
It's a minute long.

459
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
It's a minute long, but it fires off all of the different triggers and stuff.

460
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Which is almost a cool thing about that, that it's all 20 of the stuff.

461
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Yeah. The strobe lights, the spray.

462
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
The gas.

463
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
The spray, the gas.

464
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
So that was the most shocking thing to me. So the seats jostle you around a lot.

465
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
You get hit in the back by different rollers or different little fists. I don't know what they are.

466
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Yeah.

467
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:20,000
There's air guns. But in the front of the theater and in the front of each seat, they can spray fog at you or gas.

468
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It reminded me of a Batman villain trapping Batman in the 60s show where gas comes out and everyone just passes out.

469
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,000
So like there would be the start of a Batman 66 and it's like, we're in a normal movie theater in Gotham.

470
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,000
And then everyone passes out and it's like, it's the Riddler and he's capturing all these movie patrons.

471
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
This is what, in this case, it would be the Barkler.

472
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
The evil head of Barko.

473
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
John Barko by day, the Barkler by night.

474
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Will Batman defeat the Barkler? Find out.

475
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Will the gas spray keep our heroes knocked out for 24 hours so they can't record an episode?

476
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I found the gas spray woke me right up because it was startling for one thing.

477
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:16,000
But the other thing, and I don't know if I've talked about this before, I have a very sensitive sense of smell.

478
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Like if something does not agree with me, I cannot stop thinking about it.

479
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:27,000
The spray, the water spray, I think there was one or two moments where it did have fragrance in it,

480
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,000
but the rest of the time it just smelled like old water color like a dead basement.

481
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
When all the effects started in that little pre-show, I think, and this is maybe not a quote,

482
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:43,000
but it is certainly the sentiment that you were giving off, is all of a sudden the chairs start going crazy

483
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
and the gas starts coming out and you just go, oh my God.

484
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
You were just like freaked out a little bit.

485
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
They don't warn you.

486
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,000
There's also strobes in the theater, strobes shooting at the ceiling.

487
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Kind of as lightning usually is what it's representing,

488
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:09,000
which then during Mission Impossible, during the crazy halo jump where it's a stormy sky, you do get lightning going.

489
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
That is fun. I like that.

490
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,000
How do we tackle this in an orderly fashion?

491
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,000
The 40X chair. We hadn't talked about the D-Box company.

492
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Okay.

493
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:30,000
This is the company, it's a Canadian company, and they installed these D-Boxes at movie theaters around the world.

494
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
But this is a different, D-Box is different than 40X.

495
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I believe D-Box is like the chair technology.

496
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Is that right? But it's not 40X.

497
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I think 40X is, yes, so it's a different branding.

498
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,000
But D-Box is like the chair motion and you can get D-Box stuff at home.

499
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,000
So Batman would be in his back cave and he'd be like, D-Box is this, is this 40X, Robin?

500
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
They're the same thing. It's all part of...

501
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I'm Googling is 40X D-Box because I'm not totally sure.

502
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I think it's the D-Box motion feedback track.

503
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Okay.

504
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Is what I'm saying.

505
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I have a list of feature films that have been synced.

506
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,000
But I'm looking at websites that say D-Box versus 40X.

507
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Whoa.

508
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Is this different?

509
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I think they're different.

510
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Jason, after my tiki room fuck up, this podcast cannot sustain another error like this.

511
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
We cannot screw up.

512
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And also because 40X, maybe there is some similar technology going,

513
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:49,000
but 40X, which is certainly what we saw, is a Korean company, I believe.

514
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Wait, I'm on the Wikipedia doing all my research.

515
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
There's a different... Oh my God.

516
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
South Korea. Yeah.

517
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I am a fool.

518
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
There's similar ideas.

519
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Oh my God.

520
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
But I believe they are competitors.

521
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Wow.

522
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Can you find out when D-Box began?

523
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Well, so I know this.

524
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I think the company dates back to like the 1992, I think I saw.

525
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:19,000
The first movie that was coded and synced for D-Box was Fast and Furious in 2009.

526
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Okay.

527
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
And then they have...

528
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:28,000
This list only goes up to like 2016, but there was like a ton of movies that have been coded for D-Box.

529
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
That's the thing.

530
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I think this is a Blu-ray HDDVD situation.

531
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I think they snuffed them out or something.

532
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Wow.

533
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Or if not entirely, then...

534
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
This is like a Tissues Kleenex sort of thing.

535
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I was associating... I was calling the whole thing D-Box.

536
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I was like calling it Kleenex.

537
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I would like it if you issued your apology now.

538
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I'm very sorry.

539
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Okay, but I apologize to D-Box.

540
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I'm glad we've gotten ahead of this sooner.

541
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I apologize to D-Box if they are not out of business.

542
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And I'm falsely claiming that.

543
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Like we claimed that Edo's brother was... that Edo was dead.

544
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
A lot of mistakes.

545
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
One more.

546
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Is there some punishment for Jason?

547
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Also, yeah.

548
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
All coming from Jason tonight.

549
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:21,000
We'll make him go back to the theater and like really press his face up into the gas spray.

550
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
There has to be a D-Box setting that would be torture.

551
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Like you could interrogate a terrorist.

552
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Absolutely.

553
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:34,000
And you could hang them in and there's the punches, set punches to highest punch level.

554
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And it really pummels you in there.

555
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
You could waterboard someone with a drip from the ceiling.

556
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Yeah.

557
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
That's possible.

558
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
And have the lightning going in kind of a strobe fashion so you start to seizure.

559
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
And the gas of course is like...

560
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Serin gas or something.

561
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Maybe less toxic because you don't want to kill them.

562
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
You want to get information from them.

563
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Okay, this is very funny.

564
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:05,000
So 4DX also launched with the first movie in 2009 in South Korea.

565
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Journey to the Center of the Earth.

566
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Okay.

567
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Kicking it off with a bang.

568
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
So something about that film inspired...

569
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,000
It's not enough to sit still and go on a journey to the center of the earth.

570
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
You got to be shaking around and jostled and sprayed at.

571
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
We got to really pull you into the center.

572
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
And they kept going with looking at some of the other earlier films.

573
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:39,000
You got Maze Runner, Ice Age, Continental Drift, The Cruise.

574
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:45,000
The 4DX technology premiered in Hungary with The Cruise.

575
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Oh, The Cruise.

576
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I thought you were saying The Cruise.

577
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
What's The Cruise?

578
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
What are you talking about?

579
00:56:53,000 --> 00:57:01,000
What do you think is that documentary about Speed LeVitch, the New York City tour guide?

580
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
The Cruise is what I call all the Mission Impossible films.

581
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I like the idea of that cruise documentary.

582
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Like you're on a bus in New York City and the seats are jostling around like experiencing those New York potholes and stuff.

583
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
That wouldn't be the worst.

584
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
That would be fun.

585
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:22,000
It's a race through New York with Speed LeVitch.

586
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
A lot of kids movie.

587
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I was surprised.

588
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:39,000
My mistake in research about D-Box also kind of carries over to 4DX, which also has 4DX, Rise of the Guardians, Despicable Me 2, Ice Age, Continental Drift.

589
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I would think this would be very jarring for a child.

590
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Yeah.

591
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Well, I think here's how I believe they play it.

592
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Did you guys come across information about the levels that you can set for your 4DX experience?

593
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I knew that there were levels, but are we allowed to set them?

594
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
No, no, no.

595
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:09,000
By the way, the chairs are programmed by somebody probably in a very audio animatronic fashion.

596
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Somehow, which I think is pretty neat and odd and magical that this chair programming is distributed along with the movie all over the world to all these different countries.

597
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Yeah.

598
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:29,000
So, no, you don't get to set it, but apparently it's on a scale of one to nine.

599
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:41,000
And my guess is that an Ice Age or such has just a little bit of motion, enough to make it fun, something akin to your tough to be a bug, your Disney kind of stuff.

600
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:50,000
But what we experienced, and no wonder you were all so jostled and stressed out, that was level nine.

601
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Do you think or you know?

602
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I know.

603
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
You do.

604
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Level nine.

605
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
This is a very spinal tap kind of situation.

606
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
This arbitrary measuring.

607
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Level nine.

608
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
But it's all the way up.

609
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
And one thing, I like the social media for DX because there's something about it.

610
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I mean, the company is not headquartered in America, and it's just something, there's like odd little words that are wrong or it's just kind of off here and there that make you think that it's translated.

611
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,000
But I saw a strange tweet that was just kind of like, remember level nine?

612
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Do you recall it?

613
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Did you miss it?

614
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
You have not seen it in some time.

615
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:32,000
That is because it has not been seen since Fast and Furious, and now it is back.

616
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Oh.

617
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:39,000
And their copy off the website is interesting and odd as well.

618
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Oh, I'm so okay.

619
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I'm not sure what level one through nine starts to classify it as 40x extreme, but nine certainly is 40x extreme.

620
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
The most amped up level of intensity in 40x motion design.

621
00:59:52,000 --> 01:00:01,000
40x eliminates the boundary between the audience and the film with motion chairs that move in perfect synchronicity with the movie being shown.

622
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Eliminates.

623
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Do you agree with this or not?

624
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Look, that might be a bit hyperbolic as far as eliminating the, like that's essentially saying you'll forget you're in the theater.

625
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:21,000
You'll be racing in the streets with Ethan Hunt, which is, look, I did not, I had a coke with me in a cup holder.

626
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Yeah, I was looking at my phone.

627
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,000
And it was still like jostling the coke, but like I could still handle the coke for most of the movie.

628
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Maybe if I had finished it by the point, by the end of the movie when you really get like fucked around with, like, so maybe that would have been crazy.

629
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:41,000
But no, I don't think this is a bit hyperbolic, but all theme park materials and advertising it.

630
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
You have to juice it up.

631
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
No, but no seat belts and stuff.

632
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
So you're saying we were at level nine last night.

633
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
We were all the way at level nine.

634
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I mean, we were certainly, again, there really wasn't much of like warning level nine is starting or like there are certainly no seat belts.

635
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Oh, I do the crank up.

636
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
The picture is true.

637
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
No, no, no. That's what I want.

638
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I want to dial taking you to nine.

639
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Yeah, they should have a pre video where like there's like some teenagers who are like, man, this isn't that this isn't that scary or this isn't that intense.

640
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:21,000
And then it's like, oh, yeah, and then there's like, you know, a commercial actor, not me, but a different one like yourself.

641
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
All right, I'm in it.

642
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
And it's it pays very well.

643
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:31,000
And he's like got a dialing like turns the giant dial up and then like the teenagers like their hair like shoots up like they were electrocuted.

644
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
And then like it jostles them for a while.

645
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
But then maybe like the commercial would like merge them into you.

646
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:44,000
So like they're driving along the road with Ethan and they're like, it's like whatever that marketing slogan was.

647
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:55,000
That would be a good like warning to really like you would feel what two is like and then you would feel what nine is like you would you could see and you could be prepared for like so Jason wouldn't have had a heart attack like he did last night.

648
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I would like to see Ferdinand 20th Century Fox animated movie about a bull.

649
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I would like to see that at nine.

650
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Is that a 40 X option?

651
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
It was one of the 20.

652
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I know.

653
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I wonder if there's so every Mission Impossible screening is nine.

654
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
They don't have like a kid's matinee.

655
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
That's two or three.

656
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I don't think so.

657
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I think you're I think they deny their one their one sync pass and there's no age limit.

658
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:28,000
So you could put hypothetically you could bring a two year old in there.

659
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Yeah.

660
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Sit them down in a chair.

661
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I mean I think probably somebody at the ticket counter would say but maybe not maybe you bought your tickets online.

662
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I think maybe you got an age.

663
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Oh okay you have to be at least three and a half feet tall and four years of age interesting to experience 40 X and that's any level but you can pull a four year old down for an afternoon screening of Dunkirk.

664
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
As soon on their fourth birthday.

665
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,000
You can go straight to it. Mother mother I want to see Dunkirk.

666
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I want to see those brave boys mother.

667
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
If you were a little boy now that is verbatim what you would have been saying to your mom.

668
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Probably.

669
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Done the school project.

670
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Dunkirk land.

671
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
They fought impossible odds mother.

672
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:25,000
You know I think that there are these age limits and everything you know recently you've seen our president Donald Trump talk again about how with all the violence and everything going on probably it's because of the movies and if we how we need a movie.

673
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Rating system and I couldn't agree more I think you know morality is just out the window in this country and I think it's because I think people are getting ideas from the odd vibrations happening in their seats and these 40 X movies and we do you know I think it's distinctly possible that you could be.

674
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I mean certainly that he feeling the bullets on the back of your neck could make you thirst for you know trying out some gunfire yourself.

675
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I think like maybe some of those rumbles could you know do a little rumble on your junk and you know kind of arouse you a little bit.

676
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
So we need 40 X rating levels.

677
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Yeah go ahead.

678
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Unrealistic Hollywood expectations I mean you're going to see the final maze runner you think you're getting a death cure.

679
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:22,000
You think you're going to come out of this movie like I got a death cure I don't need to worry about the mortal morality.

680
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:28,000
You know I'm going to be immortal I'm going to live forever I have the death cure I got it from the maze.

681
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Because it's broken down the line between reality and when you eliminate the gap between the screen and your reality you get all kinds of crazy ideas.

682
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I was like the chair does vibrate like crazy like that's another thing it does like it shakes like it's big shakes and big movements but there is like a vibration like either like a sharper image chair or like a dirty hotels vibrating bed.

683
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Like that sort of the feeling because all of a sudden and it would come it would sneak up on me too because also like I feel my teeth vibrating or something.

684
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Oh okay.

685
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:20,000
There were some weird vibrations I think though the most unnerving thing was the occasional punch like where there were certain punches where you would get all of the back but then there was one level where it would just hit the shoulder blades and it was only like every 20 minutes and I found that very startling.

686
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
That was awful.

687
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I had to sit up.

688
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I enjoyed this experience. I noticed you doing what I did as a child during Honey I Shrunk the Kids or like you were up at the front of the seat because you did not want to be touched by these invisible robot hands.

689
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:43,000
No and I would have done the same thing I die get up when all the insects leave and tough to be a bug.

690
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I don't want that experience.

691
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:54,000
This I wouldn't quantify it. I'll defend myself and say I wouldn't quantify it as being afraid. I just it's like you're getting punched in the shoulder.

692
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,000
That's not a good feeling. I'd hang out with Nick Mundy if I wanted that.

693
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I mean I sympathize with because I do have that feeling but then I think what happened was when the first when the chair first punched me in the back I was thinking hmm you know what does lean into it really let's do this.

694
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:29,000
So like when that happened to me I was like I'm in it. I'm going to get over my eye because I did I flashback to Honey I Shrunk the Audience and even the Bugs Life and then any other 3D movies that would like kind of fuck with your legs or your back or touch you.

695
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,000
And I was just like I'm in for it. I'm in for I was trying to position. So this is another thing we haven't talked about.

696
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:58,000
It shoots air blasts. There's two holes by your head and it shoots air blasts constantly especially in a movie with guns. So I was trying to like position my head in the perfect way like I wanted to try to get the optimum experience because I noticed I was leaning sort of in my seat and I got hit right in the back of the head with a blast of air because I was leaning sort of toward the right.

697
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:09,000
And then I was kind of leaning up and I wasn't getting punched as much so I was like no I'm going to sit and put my head right back in between the two holes and I'm going to let my back be brutalized during this whole movie.

698
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:20,000
My head was if I was sitting up straight along the back my head was getting like bounced around like yeah the all these descriptions make it sound like we did not like this.

699
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Yeah. First time those air blasts happened I found those very invasive. I was like oh that's like what would happen if you were being publicly executed like it was a like these giant.

700
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I was like I was really not prepared for that. That was one thing I did not like the most.

701
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:46,000
After like the first 10 15 minutes I was like there's another two hours and 40 minutes of this movie like.

702
01:07:46,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Yeah I would I also like I would think like OK because we knew we've suddenly seen the movie before which honestly it might have been more fun or crazy if we hadn't seen the movie because then I'd be like oh there's going to be a lot of guns in this scene and then it was like.

703
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
So I would know at least that I was about to be shot in the head with a bunch of air.

704
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:26,000
We could prep for all the major sequences and get ready for what we knew was was coming which which you can't do and I think it's what makes that opening demonstration so fun is that you don't you really don't know what's coming and it's so much immediately more intense than what you think it's going to be.

705
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:34,000
The chairs really rise up and also what a visual when you I'm glad we're further back than the one that I did before.

706
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:42,000
So getting to see a whole room of chairs getting jostled around is very crazy and a neat visual for sure.

707
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Yeah I think we were all looking at each other just like giggling because we're like yeah we were seeing a lot because I really I truly didn't think I thought like the bugs life movie doesn't do the chairs aren't that crazy like.

708
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:03,000
And honey I shrunk the audience the chairs don't move like that so I was expecting a standard sort of theme park experience but this was a yes much more aggressive.

709
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:13,000
There's a lot. There's a lot of stuff and it's not just action as you guys know there are parts where you're you like tilts along with a camera pan.

710
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Yes you're drifting to the left you can have this little drift.

711
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:34,000
There's a thing and I was one like I wanted to know I'd love to get the guy who or a girl who programs this because it's not a set like it's not a set sometimes the thing moves with the vehicle sometimes it moves with the person running sometimes it moves with the camera.

712
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Sometimes it moves sort of to the music or the score but it's not uniform. Yes the whole way around there is a constantly shifting narrative voice of the chair and you are not the same POV for even two seconds in a row and is an anal theme park consistency person like myself I was like well that's not now we're just imitating the camera but we're not there's no action on the screen.

713
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:13,000
I found that however consistent with attractions like the new Kung Fu Panda or Shrek 4D 2 it's like you're feeling the bump as the donkeys run along a bridge.

714
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Yeah or or now you're in this now you're feeling what Shrek is feeling that I think that I think all of these kinds of things jump or it's more Shrek 4D than it is star tours where you have a consistent vision and where you are.

715
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Yes I think one of you were very quick to remark like these chairs are like the amped up version of the Kung Fu Panda chairs. Uh huh. Uh huh. Because that had some like there was a lot of floating on water stuff there. Yeah.

716
01:10:45,000 --> 01:11:00,000
And you had that in this too there's a few boat sequences or there's one boat sequence there's a long helicopter thing where you're kind of like following the helicopter and I thought that was very cool the like drifting.

717
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Yeah without spoiling I mean if you've already seen the film there is a there is a ton of I mean we could say that this the helicopter scene is like one of the best things you've seen in a movie theater in the recent past. It's wild.

718
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And the nine was amped up all the way to like nine plus. Yes. I at that point like there's a ton like I remember when I was young and I went to my first like concert which is cool it was Green Day and I was so stressed out because I was raised to be fearful of everything.

719
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:45,000
So when I went I was going alone with my friends to the Aragon in Chicago to see Green Day in a mosh pit and I was stressed out about actually now to think about it that might have been my second concert.

720
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
How old are you?

721
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Foo Fighters. I don't know too old 15 some 14 I mean I had seen like the Monkeys or something but going alone to what was like a modern band.

722
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
You sure you would actually quantify it as a mosh pit?

723
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Green Day I would.

724
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Really?

725
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:09,000
So Foo Fighters there was a little moshing going on. This is Foo Fighters. This is after color and the shape this has learned to fly era. But Dave Grohl is still a young man he climbed the balcony of the of the Riviera.

726
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:22,000
But so Green Day. So I knew the crowd was like kind of like you know it's sometimes mosh. Green Day even back then during the warning tour there were still a lot of punks. It was before American Idiot and they had refreshed the audience with a bunch of young kids.

727
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:34,000
So there were a lot of punks still wanting to mosh pit and we were up front and I was just so stressed out about the thought of it happening that I remember feeling like beat up for days even though I hadn't moshed or whatever.

728
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:42,000
So I've tried over the years to like not be stressed out in situations where I feel like I've lost control.

729
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:58,000
So what I'm getting to is that once this started like beating me up I feel like now as a 34 year old man I get comfortable in it and then I start to go well can't this thing go any faster or harder? I start going the other way with it.

730
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I see.

731
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Where now finally I'm like I don't know I don't really know exactly what I'm saying.

732
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
You wanted level 19.

733
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:12,000
That's what I'm saying. I wanted level 19 so I think it's all just like making up for me being a scared youth. So once I get jostled around.

734
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:19,000
This is still the pattern though is that you begin experiences with fear and once you're in it you just want more.

735
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Yes.

736
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Which is what like a sitcom scene would tell you about getting on a roller coaster.

737
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
That's true.

738
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Or whatever.

739
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
So yeah.

740
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
What a nice lesson.

741
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,000
It was a nice lesson that sitcoms teach but yeah it was fun. I liked nine. I liked that nine level. It was insane.

742
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Oh you know what I'm thinking. This is the this is the moral of the film parenthood is what you have learned.

743
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
That life is like a roller coaster and you just enjoy it.

744
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:50,000
You have a lesson I need to learn too. Not about life. OK. The actual roller coaster part is what I need to learn.

745
01:13:50,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I got to say the way you guys think like looking at the list of 4DX movies what do you think is the funniest example like movies that have been 4DX.

746
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Oh I get it. I got to find it. I got to know one is Grimsby.

747
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:17,000
The other. Oh God. Where did it go.

748
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Now you see me too.

749
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Now you see me.

750
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:26,000
There too. I would love to see. I love that. Now you see me movies. I would love to see them in this.

751
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Frank and Weenie less so kind of a weird one. Yeah there's also some weird like like you were saying Valyrian.

752
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:45,000
There's also some weird bombs. Independence Day resurgence. Awful. I would have liked if that 4DX chair propelled me through the ceiling out of the theater.

753
01:14:45,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Yeah there's a lot of movies that were like genre action movies with like a lot of subtitles or colons in them like the Mortal Instruments colon city of bones or Percy Jackson colon sea of monsters.

754
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

755
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Amazer under the death cure. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. It's perfect for and 4DX itself adds a colon to a colon movie.

756
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:19,000
They should have they done old movies that they've like re put like that use the technology for like yes that would be a good they have.

757
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I think I saw episode one maybe Star Wars Jurassic Park 3D. Pod race.

758
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Yeah. Yeah. That's the way to turn the tide back. Yeah.

759
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Towards the prequels that would get everybody convinced the peanuts movie cranked to nine or the Angry Birds movie.

760
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Oh man if the chair can make you feel like you're being pulled back and launched like one of the birds.

761
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Incredible legend of Tarzan is a pretty funny one.

762
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Yeah. These films that aren't and they aren't remembered by anyone and you get to learn from this list about Chinese films that you've missed like the White Haired Witch of Lunar Kingdom.

763
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Wait that's the subtitle of Valerian isn't it.

764
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Hmm. Valerian and the White Haired Witch of the Lunar Kingdom.

765
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
And the four realms.

766
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
And the four realms.

767
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Yeah. Yeah. I mean so I was thinking like I was thinking because the camera moves like is there is there a movie that's not an action movie that just has amazing cinematography that all it is is just we're experiencing the camera moves like Koyana Scrooge.

768
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Sure touch of evil. Yes.

769
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Or the player Children of Men is a nice long tracking shot that's very like not action never use the chairs for the action just use it to experience with like Chiva the DP of Children of Men or Gravity how he places the camera and moves it along with the shot.

770
01:16:51,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Yeah. Another Orson Welles project one of my very the third man you could be in the Ferris wheel with Joseph Cotton and Orson Welles.

771
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:13,000
I think this is a good. Well 40 X for film buffs is clearly a very I need to innovate. That's that would be lucrative. Yeah. Doing all of Barry Lyndon.

772
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Yes.

773
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:34,000
I gotta say though I think one of the weaker parts of it is the glass of the 3D glasses. I thought there was some decent like depth in this one of the 3D. But and there's a lot of very brightly lit sequences in fallout.

774
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:46,000
But there's a lot of stuff in catacombs or tunnels or garages and it does look a lot darker. Here's what they should do because because the best 3D as far as movie wise is is the city walk IMAX.

775
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Okay. If you're seeing a 3D movie which is still not like the optimum way there's no they haven't perfected yet but some some of the movies we've seen are pretty good like Guardians of the Galaxy 2 I thought for whatever reason looked great in 3D.

776
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Yeah a lot of bright colors a lot of fluorescent colors. Maybe that helps. So I think that screen is very bright and it's very big. Yeah. Dr. Strange looked good too. Yes. A lot of that a lot of that Marvel has a lot of CGI goop in all these movies and that plays well in 3D on a giant screen.

777
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:28,000
But it's very well lit and it would be nice if you could get that screen but with 4D technology if they could combine IMAX and 4DX. Yeah. That might be the optimum movie going experience. There must be places where that is the case.

778
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:49,000
This was kind of a smaller theater maybe but I bet where I bet it would where this is taken wing a little more like in Thailand or Vietnam or South Korea or whatever. I'm sure there's like oh I even saw on the website there are sizes of the of the theaters.

779
01:18:49,000 --> 01:19:09,000
So you could do premium level 9 extreme. They have it all the way up to the top. That's what I want. How long. I've never turned it off and we're at one thirty three and how long were we doing tickets 15 minutes. Yeah. So we're an hour 15. Okay.

780
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:27,000
I'll jump back in here. So I'm going to make a bold statement about this. Oh okay. I have to say I think this is if not one of the if not the best one of the best like screen attractions I have ever experienced.

781
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Now that is tempered by the fact that is I saw a full movie but honestly if you went to Universal there was an original like movie with like the cast of whatever like let's say they did a mission impossible like an original five minute thing with the seats cranked to eight or nine and you're whipping around and all of this stuff.

782
01:19:51,000 --> 01:20:06,000
This was so much more satisfying than like the fast and furious ride or whatever fury. Yeah. That part of the studio tour or the King Kong studio tour part that is the solo you know its own attraction in Orlando.

783
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Like I honestly kind of I don't want to see everything like this but this is like a next level to me. Yeah I think maybe I feel like I've heard that the Fast and Furious also released in level nine was was really well done.

784
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I didn't see that this mission impossible was fantastic. We saw with people who were complaining a little about ready player one. I didn't love Valerian this way but I think a great movie that's perfectly equipped for this with a lot of car chases or motorcycle chases or

785
01:20:38,000 --> 01:21:07,000
whatever it is. I think the right combo. I was surprised how much I loved it and how much it's teetering on that fun theme park line where it's a little stupid. You're maybe looking for the word stupid. Do I not like it. No I think this is stupid in the way I like. I think this is the worst. I totally agree. I feel like we've been like slamming or complaining because those moments are more fun to talk about than really. I mean that that helicopter sequence was like they die.

786
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:28,000
I'm not kidding. That was like better than any like new theme park thing I've done in a little while. Yeah. By the time we got to the helicopter because like there were certain points when I went this is OK. I like this but for sure I think we crossed paths and going to the bathroom and I was like this is so I didn't know what I say stupid. I said something along those lines. Yeah.

787
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Or whole layer. I said this is hilarious. That's the word more than stupid. Yeah. We were laughing so funny. Yeah. Like getting sprayed in the head and like shot with air and like I kept saying theater loud. Oh my God. You keep you laughing so much. Yeah. Everyone was to like everyone was there was a couple next to Mike and I.

788
01:21:48,000 --> 01:22:03,000
That's the other thing you're paired off in seats and on the website they refer to it as the love seats like tiny couches the couple next to us. I feel like we're also like having a blast. Yeah. We're also startled when like stuff. Yeah. And they had not seen the movie.

789
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:32,000
They had not seen the movie. Every joke hit with them and they loved it. Yeah. Yeah. Do you think seeing Mission Impossible fall out the first time would work. I think for sure it would work but I feel like I would have won like now let's go see it so I can look at it a little more. Yeah. And not get beaten up while it was happening. I was glad because I mean I think this easily my favorite movie this summer. Yeah. Oh yeah. I think that is in a while. It's like hitting me in a dark night.

790
01:22:32,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Yeah fashion probably because they have a similar vibe with that some scenes are IMAX and it's all very real and he's on the top of a very tall places and and I don't I haven't the I didn't like love the last Mission Impossible as much. I like this. I don't know. It feels this this franchise feels like the Dark Knight series and that like you know some are really pretty good and then others are like masterpieces.

791
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Yeah I mean I I was just this is how annoying I am. Yesterday I was just probably yelling but I was saying to Lindsay I go do you remember seven years ago I kept talking about how good Mission Impossible is and how everyone's saying how good Mission Impossible.

792
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:28,000
She's like yeah it's true you did. I remember you were confused when I was like Mission Impossible 4 is coming on. She was like why do you. OK that's fine we'll go see that but why. And she's like yeah you're right. Everyone now is saying all the Mission Impossibles are great.

793
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:41,000
So I do think that hit like snobs and elitists a little more lately which I might even include myself in. You're saying I'm more of a common man who enjoyed working class Midwest.

794
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Well you you I think you like you like passionately love a lot of pop entertainment and comic that's true worlds. You're like a head of things that other that everybody else starts to love. Thank you. I think so. Wrestling too. I think like that's true too.

795
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:14,000
The wrestling you've been going to is like having like I feel like is building in cool cred and you've been out of the game. I'll say this. I was a fan of Jason too ten years ago and now everyone is. You beat me too.

796
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Yes an early adopter of me. And now I am like a mummy's curse that you cannot shink. You set me up for the joke. Yeah. What was I. Oh I think like looking back on the Mission Impossible I thought like number four.

797
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I feel like they were that one had the added bonus of oh Brad Bird is directing this and that has a lot of crazy stunt pieces in it. I think but there was also like the vibe of the movie. They're like well they're setting up Renner to take it over.

798
01:24:47,000 --> 01:25:00,000
They're setting up Renner and then they're like we're going to make another one with Tom Cruise and that one I was like well how are they going to top the last one then rogue nation was also very satisfying and then this this is just like next level.

799
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:15,000
I think again I don't want to spoil anything but there this picks up a lot of characters and then some threads from the other movies and it nails it so much better than Spectre did because Spectre tried to do that too and did not stick the landing.

800
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:21,000
That's fair. I mean it's the best spy franchise to certainly been more consistent than James Bond.

801
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:39,000
And and more than born and I like both of those franchises too. I'll say this I also felt like just building up like the characters and the motivations and this. I thought this was a better payoff that Avengers Infinity War and maybe it's because they weren't selling it like that.

802
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:52,000
That's a different I can't know I wanted it. We can't just review movies on this podcast right now because I we could have an argument about Avengers Infinity War but Jason your biggest problem with Avengers Infinity War is that it made you too sad.

803
01:25:52,000 --> 01:26:01,000
It's upsetting. You were too sad by it and you don't like to feel sad. I'm just a viewer of a film who can that can that's a valid opinion if that's how it made you feel.

804
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:16,000
But I'm just saying you know what didn't we if you don't think that being sad should be part of that experience. If I wanted to be sad I'd watch that god awful looking Aquaman we saw a trailer for. Hell yeah.

805
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:37,000
My man that's from Justice League though. I just a couple of quick things I had written down. There's a couple on occasion something would happen that was different like like we're talking about effects and a con occasion like and this is a spoiler but something would happen where just let's just say a character got a jolt a sudden jolt.

806
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:59,000
And all of a sudden I get like a like on one side of my back I get just like a like a prolonged like punch essentially and like it lingers there for a while like whoa and there's a section where somebody somebody gets hit by something and like it feels like the corpse the body not corpse rolls over my back essentially.

807
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Like there's a couple like interesting very under that was a nervous and I like that but then for the rest of the movie I was also going like what other tricks do you have for DX. So then like there's a scene where somebody is getting choked and I was like kind of like no I hope nothing like pops out around my neck during this because it was like surprised me on occasion with something.

808
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:36,000
So then I was thinking like maybe it's got one more like leg shackles or something like oh they did the snakes they did the snakes like honey I shrunk the audience they did like they got your legs at one point you may have stepped out there were I was at your legs.

809
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:41,000
For what that was the thing I was most scared at it with honey I shrunk the audience.

810
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:58,000
I did it I forget what oh wow it was I left during the talking a lot. Yeah you guys supposed to say oh my gosh I missed I literally missed the one thing that maybe would have like brought back a horrible memory of me being at Epcot Center when I was six and go yeah I don't like the mice around my feet.

811
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Thank God there's no PlayStation one looking lion popping out of the screen. Yeah right.

812
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:16,000
What is this. There's no snakes in the film. Oh it's that scene where the professor releases all the mice into the theater in the Mission Impossible when Benji releases all the mice.

813
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Ethan Hunt is at the Spy of the Year awards. Save old Ethan.

814
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Oh man. The flubber got loose.

815
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I will you're you're also there is there specifically that somebody gets stabbed and then you know that's what I was saying earlier I was trying to make me say out loud why we get stabbed.

816
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Yeah I was thinking so yeah I was trying to figure out like what what else is going to come up that nothing really did but I was like there's got to be something they're hidden like another surprise they have well he of course Tom Cruise does a stunt he jumped from building to building and he broke his ankle

817
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:04,000
doing it and I was a little worried that a sledgehammer would pop out of the chair inspector gadget style smash my ankle into pieces.

818
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:15,000
When he did that jump in when we saw the first time I feel like people went huh and this time I think everyone went huh but also because you you feel it.

819
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Yeah you got jostled so hard. Yeah I feel like as much of a daredevil as Tom because I got I was in a chair that tilted when he did the jump.

820
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:43,000
I was in a chair that shifted forward and wind was blowing at me when he did the jump from the plane. I feel covered in terms of skydiving parkour say okay here let this is the hypothetical though and I was thinking about this and this is only tangentially related but it is we're talking about.

821
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Like say you were now cast in Mission Impossible 7 and you're on the IMF team and you have to do like would you ever be able to do any of the things this 56 year old man is doing.

822
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:09,000
I would get thrown through a plate glass window. Would you seriously want that? I'm being saying like. If I could have the proper training and safety people and all that stuff.

823
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:29,000
And let's remember the training for most stunt men is you just do it. There's not a lot. You go through the glass. I think because adrenaline kicks in when you're performing anyways and just knowing I'm going to get to go through I'm going to be able to tell people I went through a window.

824
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:38,000
I think that's a double shot of adrenaline. I just want I'm just wanting to clarify with you specifically because when that thing started I was worried about your health during that in the chair.

825
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:47,000
I think I there was a lot of shock but there was delight. It's just hard to convey delight and oh my God.

826
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I think I can do the running. I think I could do like a very small building to building jump.

827
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Really if I have the wire on, which he did, which he did. Mike does this thing where I don't know very low cement walls.

828
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:13,000
I do. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go like I think I could make this jump and I do. I see says please don't. I do that in Indiana Jones when we're leaving the exit. There's like a set of six stairs.

829
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I go you think I can go get up all these stairs in one jump and she's like do not do that and then I will and then I'll be like I can still jump pretty good.

830
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:41,000
This is the most like kid and mom discussion. Yeah. Oh yeah. I mean I'd be willing to try a number of things but I think I'd be terrible at it and most of my workout stuff is low impact and yoga ish because of like I get very red in the face.

831
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:52,000
It's kind of a red. It's not as bad as it used to be when I was a kid but like running laps in middle school or whatever I'd get just flush red which is very uncomfortable and I know that's what would happen to me.

832
01:31:52,000 --> 01:32:01,000
There is a I have a vague feeling of for some reason mentioned this on the podcast before but there is a video a Funny or Die video called the Prairie Children.

833
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:19,000
One of the best funny die videos done by Ryan Perez our past guest and I also another past guest Dave Ferguson. He and I are like tussling in it like we're like little house on the prairie kind of like rough and tumble brothers and we're in like a dry patch and we're like we're like

834
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:39,000
tussling and this shot went on for a pair of approximately 25 seconds and I was beat red sweaty out of breath by the end of it and if you look up this video and you see what caused what what made me be like dead deaths door.

835
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Yeah, it makes me think I couldn't do the bathroom stunt scene. I couldn't burst through a mirror. I was when you were saying that I was like if you had to do the helicopter with like Tom so like it's you so imagine the helicopter scene but it's like Tom on one of the legs and you on the other.

836
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Your face would be like so bright red like they'd have to digitally take the red out of it and post. Yeah, it'd be like yes absolutely. It'd be pretty clean and they could just select one color right right form as a green screen, just be bright, the brightest pink possible on a man's face

837
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:33,000
that had been nice precedent when Justice League had to CGI Henry Cavill's mustache. Was it for this mustache so maybe why do we have to have a mustache for this people bring up because he's a because he's a prick in the movie.

838
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:46,000
And I think he looks kind of like a prick like they may actively make him look like a dick. My theory is that Tom wanted to make sure he looked different than him, and now that they look so similar but like they're both handsome guys.

839
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:56,000
So I feel like Tom was like he's got to have a mustache because I will differentiate. I think okay so Mission Impossible seven, we usually pitch rides but let's pitch an idea.

840
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Maybe Ethan Hunt has three sons that he just found out about. And he has to take the three sons that he separated from the IMF. He has to take his three sons on vacation but the vacation turns into a whole mission, and maybe he takes them on vacation to, you know,

841
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:24,000
a theme park of some kind. Maybe we have to rescue the IMF team, sort of like a new x men old x men. Okay, that's fine. That would be good.

842
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Because they went to see a movie at the Barco Innovation Center, and they were gassed. And the Barkler released his gas that you thought was just a gas simulation but it's real gas.

843
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:46,000
I mean the apostles are still out there and God knows what sort of twisted plans they have.

844
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:59,000
And we have to do the halo jump into to get into Epcot Center undetected. And then Jason has to do the halo jump but it's the halo top ice cream that he got.

845
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:10,000
I've never had that. Is it good? It's okay. I mean some people have a problem with like kind of diet stuff because it tastes a little off but I always think as long as it tastes 80% like the other thing, it's pretty good and obviously low calorie.

846
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:26,000
We get captured by Lane Jr. and he's gonna execute us all but then he hears that fun conversation about ice cream and he's like these guys are alright. And we all share ice cream together.

847
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:34,000
That's a good finish. I was gonna say like he also. We eat ice cream for 70 to pad out the rest of the run time. 70 straight minutes.

848
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I was gonna say he tortures each of us with our worst fear and of course he puts you on a log flume ride with a big drop.

849
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Or a 50 foot drop. Like a mid tier.

850
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:54,000
He puts me in a mosh pit with teens. With rowdy teens.

851
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:05,000
And he would also, for me he would take a giant animatronic that doesn't belong and have been closed to space. What's the biggest animatronic?

852
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Maybe that's why, in Jurassic Park you're in include. How big was the old Kong?

853
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Well but I saw old Kong every day and I had no problem. I loved seeing him. Yeah.

854
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:25,000
I did my soul well every time I smelled that banana breath. Really a precursor to 40X technology. The King Kong banana breath. Much respect.

855
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Jason what don't you want to encounter when you've been recruited on the IMF team?

856
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,000
An empty cupboard.

857
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,000
No! Punches everyone open.

858
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Jason I've emptied your cupboard of treats.

859
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:55,000
God fuck. That joke threw me off because I was trying to think of a joke about emotional openness with no irony attached or something.

860
01:36:55,000 --> 01:37:05,000
And now you've knocked you. You'll watch me eat the treats that could have been yours. Oh but there's lots you can share. I'm little. I don't need that much.

861
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Your mission should you choose to watch. No he wouldn't. That was just him being a jerk.

862
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Oh yes that's fun. That's a fun thing. Actually they were right on the line using that gag. I feel like a couple characters said.

863
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Oh a lot of characters say your mission should you choose to accept it.

864
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:31,000
The movie also they started shooting with 33 pages of a script and I feel like you could tell with some of the dialogue that it wasn't.

865
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I didn't say it didn't work. I'm just saying some of them some of the lines felt like well this is this is a good first draft for this line.

866
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:45,000
This conveys the emotion or the plot necessity. But I found Alec Baldwin and Tom Cruise on the runway very moving.

867
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,000
I was shocked. Moving? Yeah.

868
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:58,000
I'm trying to think of a here I don't know if you said your worst fear. I said a mosh pit when I was 60. But yeah that's not I've gotten over that. I love that now.

869
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Help me out with the end of this but I think we haven't talked about the masks being deployed as possible against you.

870
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:17,000
What if you when you got dropped into Epcot Center and you met your best gal Minnie and pure per usual she's hugging you grabbing at you pawing at you.

871
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:26,000
And then she takes off the mask and is something else as another big character. Oh like the bad one.

872
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:37,000
The alien from Alien Encounter. Sure. Minnie's actually the alien. I don't know what's a similar size. If it's Ursula or I like Ursula I wouldn't mind a hug from her.

873
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:42,000
You wouldn't mind being pawed at by having all tentacles. I would kick her out of bed.

874
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:51,000
What if the Eric Idle journey into your imagination took off the mask and it had been Dreamfinder this whole time. Well that's a good thing.

875
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:57,000
No we're all just like what have you been doing for 20 years. Why were you lying. Why. What.

876
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:06,000
He walks away. He does like the walk away from camera and the mission impossible theme comes on and you're like what what is happening.

877
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Why do you just describe the confusing thing. Maybe not a terrifying thing. Guys what we're doing right now is mashing up a franchise with theme park lore which once again if you told me

878
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:37,000
that's what I'd be doing with a couple other weirdos. If you told 10 year old me that feverishly working on OJ land that the fan fiction would never continue or never cease rather and that people would be listening to it for some reason.

879
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Although in this case maybe they bailed. They might have bailed 10 minutes ago when we said what if we were on the IMF team. Yeah that was a self indulgent idea from me. What if it was us as the stars.

880
01:39:47,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Although we do that a lot. We try to inject ourselves into most things on this podcast. So it's a pretty I mean what podcast is not about the host. Sure. Podcast. Maybe there are some and maybe they're better.

881
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:21,000
But this one is lazier and that's the way it is. That's true. I'm gonna bet there's some religious podcasts that are primarily about numero uno Mr. J.C. Someone takes a backseat. I feel like you're doing a Christianity podcast. You're like well sure.

882
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:35,000
I'm always gonna be number two on the Patreon to Jesus Christ. But what if Jesus Christ took a mask off and he was Lane the whole time. That is just like Lane.

883
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:54,000
What cursed to be you not blessed. Why does he sound like a troll or a pirate. He sounds like Emperor Palpatine or Senator like he sounds like Darth Sidious. He's him too. Then he takes off the lame mask and he's another villain and golem. He sounds like a little bit. He's all and then he's golem. He was wearing three masks.

884
01:40:54,000 --> 01:41:10,000
And the top one was Jesus Christ. He was lying. If we were doing plus it up our scale with the 40 X. What do we think as far as what do we keep it exactly as is would we plus it up or would we burn the whole 40 X down for insurance money.

885
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Certainly not that I was thinking plus it up. I think we're probably we might all have ideas for it. I was thinking like put some restraints and give me a seat belt and like let's drop the floor out like let's. Yeah. Yeah. Like like as I was saying I wanted more earlier like like really like much like Ethan Hunt does to the Philip Seymour Hoffman character Mission Impossible 3 and dangles him out of like the back of a plane.

886
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Like I want to be down. I want to be on like dangling from the movie theater seats. I guess it's not practical as far as drinks or popcorn are concerned because it would just dump it all over. But they have to give you a warning. Maybe you're not allowed to have it in there.

887
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:57,000
But you get a little like just suddenly there's a quick little intermission like popcorn time. Yes.

888
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:07,000
And then you're back to it. Yeah. Or there's like a little warning logo that's like secure popcorn now and you have to put it in like a little case. Yeah. And it like there's like a little robot.

889
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:18,000
And then put the popcorn seat belt on it. Like if you could really like if they could rotate you 360 in those chairs I would love it. I would love more just more jostling.

890
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:39,000
More jostling. Rotating is good. Oh Jason's yelling. I don't need the 3D. Yeah I don't need the glasses. I have thick plastic glasses. I find them very awkward to wear over my glasses and then also my eyes kind of hurt at the end or a little achy.

891
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:56,000
I agree with that. You know we were saying how fun the opening the demonstration of the 4DX technology is. That is a blast. And also before the movie you get to see one of the best things you can see in a movie theater.

892
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:15,000
The Regal Coca-Cola Refreshing Filmmakers contest. So I want the 4DX to extend to that. I want the Refreshing Filmmakers to also program a perfect chair experience for me to watch their their film that is Coke centric.

893
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:28,000
The little the little story where like you know the guy like spills Coke in the projection booth but then it makes the people on the screen be cheers in a Coke together. Yeah that would be great.

894
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:40,000
I want to I want to experience every tilt and the spill of Coke in my face. And the water should be Coke at that point. Yeah. So it makes it longer the whole time and I should get to taste it all.

895
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Oh I think we forgot one thing that happened to us when we were there and this this is before the movie we were walking down the hallway and we walked through what appeared to be some sort of media event or interviews or something for death of a nation.

896
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:13,000
And he's the newest Dinesh D'Souza joint. And if you're not familiar with him he's a right wing documentarian to stretch. He's a real con man. He's a real huckster who makes these dog shit documentaries.

897
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:28,000
He was pardoned by the president. He served some time for illegal campaign contributions because he was so fucking dumb he couldn't figure out how to give an excessive amount of money. And so we had to do time for that.

898
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:47,000
And he was like pardoned like a president wasted out an hour in the day to pardon this fucking moron and this movie is called Death of a Nation and it's about how like what if the left the real Nazis and it's just yes it's called Death of a Nation.

899
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:58,000
But then the poster has a giant picture of Trump and under it says Death of a Nation. So he's too dumb shit to even like put that in.

900
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:08,000
My favorite is that the premiere of the movie appeared to be at a 9 p.m. showing in like theater 3 at the Regal Cinema in LA Live on a Monday night.

901
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:21,000
In the middle of a city full of people who would fucking despise this man if you said like hey you know who this is. We were all we all walked by and we were like we all made noise and interviews.

902
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Yeah there were interviews happening like there's a PR person that was like a PR person there. She's like looking and I was like she knows we know like I would think.

903
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Well once we got like about six feet away I went did you just walk through a fucking Dinesh D'Souza movie premiere. I'll tell you this I would have seen it if it was in 4DX.

904
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Yeah. Hell yeah. Absolutely. You know that's probably the out but really fast I just have to say. Oh yeah. We forgot about in that pre thing how the you're in the motorcycle chase and then the audience it cuts to the audience watching the 4DX motorcycle chase and they're all so into it

905
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:14,000
that they all pretend to be holding handlebars. That's the funniest thing I've seen in a movie theater in years. And that everyone 20 people all agreed to hold up fake handlebars something that's never happened in all of time.

906
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:31,000
And that was I will say that that like that played well as a joke to everybody in the theater not just snarky podcaster Roe that we were in. Yeah that was a huge laugh of everyone laughing at these idiots on the screen pretending to be on the motorcycle room like that.

907
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Everyone was laughing at that. Everyone laughed. That wasn't just cynical dicks doing. And I want the you know what that's my other plus up I want full I want a full refreshing Coke filmmakers thing and I want a full I want the people in the theater

908
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:56,000
I want the people who made that to make an entire movie but it's a movie where half of it is cutting to the audience who are all like if the scenes in a truck they're all pulling a truck horn.

909
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Or if it's like a train if it's a romantic scene they're all grabbing they're all grabbing air and smooching with it. Or like if they're like loading coal into a cold coal train whatever you would call that train and then shoveling in. Oh what a hard life.

910
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:35,000
I'll see in here. Yeah that'd be great. I want to see more of this 40 X space work you guys did improv you could appreciate. Oh yeah. Could you feel the the physics of the motorcycles they were holding on to. Yeah I mean that's you really got to commit to it and that's how you get an audience on board.

911
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:51,000
I thought the space work was a little broad but still it was effective and that's your plus up. Yes folks you survived podcast the ride 40 X edition. Thanks so much for listening. Hey the next time you hear us.

912
01:47:51,000 --> 01:48:10,000
No that's not true. Very soon you'll be hearing our very exciting live episode with Tony Baxter done live from an abandoned sports 30 in Sherman Oaks. Check that out it's coming up and all kinds of great. There's a lot going on in podcast the ride world I feel and to check it all out.

913
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:24,000
You can hit us up on Twitter or Instagram or email us at podcast the ride at Gmail. We've started to talk about doing mailbag segments or as I call it podcast the ride post office.

914
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:36,000
So you know if you want to send a little letter to the podcast right post office email podcast right at Gmail dot com we'll start incorporating your we're eliminating the boundary between the podcast and you.

915
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,000
So we're going to go to level nine 40 X of email.

916
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Again that's podcast the ride at Gmail dot com we've gotten a couple Twitter DMS recently that made me laugh saying what's the email for the show and I'm like are we mushmousing it on the end of the show so podcast the ride at Gmail dot com.

917
01:48:54,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Should maybe our old friend Lane give them the email address.

918
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:06,000
The ride at Gmail dot com. It's good to see you again Ethan.

920
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
There's some Lori in there.

921
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
He's back.

922
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:15,000

923
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Well on that great Lane impression we should take off.

924
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
