1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
Forever, dog.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,200
Warning, the following podcast includes hundreds of animatronics

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,840
and almost as many charisma-free General Motors CEOs.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,880
It's an exploration of ingenuity, ninja turtle gratuity, and cat-facing nudity.

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,600
Gear up for a slow-moving spin on Epcot Classic World of Motion on Podcast The Ride.

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:57,960
[♪ Synth beat with m究dimiia and

7
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,340
M someday Kindboddy-s clap.

8
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,980
To be free as opposed to podcast ride the second gate where we believe it's fun to pay five or eight dollars.

9
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,300
I'm Scott Gardner joined in the room by Jason Sheridan.

10
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,380
I look just like GM's quality automobiles.

11
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,900
Not everything can be free.

12
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:23,140
You know that's well I would not expect GM to issue cars for zero dollars.

13
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,220
Yes no.

14
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:31,180
Or it would be funny if like podcasting they put out some of the cars for free and then other ones you need to leave.

15
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,700
If you want the really good ones.

16
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:32,980
Yeah.

17
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,020
It's a little extra.

18
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,780
And joining us from somewhere else on God's green earth it's Mike Carlson.

19
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,580
Hi I am.

20
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,540
Hey I'm here.

21
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:47,780
I'm broadcasting live from the Ninja Turtles underground headquarters from Ninja Turtles 2 secret of the ooze.

22
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:53,940
This is the abandoned train station where I've made my home and where I'm choosing to raise my child.

23
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,300
So the ultimate lit wow that's where she's oh my god.

24
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,820
Well yeah instant jealousy not just for from all of us I would think.

25
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:14,220
Yeah we're recording some video on this so if you want to see me live from the underground train station just go to YouTube forever dog right.

26
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,380
Forever does YouTube I believe.

27
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,140
That's correct.

28
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:16,980
Yeah yeah.

29
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,900
Well that rules.

30
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,380
What are some of the amenities of the underground train station.

31
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,060
Do they have.

32
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,820
I mean they they have to like think of a weird way to get pizza right.

33
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,140
They can't exactly like enter that into the app or I guess on the phone.

34
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,380
I think you know I think they did it like in the first one where they just kind of wait by a sewer grate.

35
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:43,860
And then they just a disembodied voice yells at the pizza person to slip it through and then they pay with cash.

36
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,340
They're all they don't like a cashless society.

37
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:54,980
I assume the Ninja Turtles they're not they're not in favor of the great reset that will get rid of cash and turn all of our money digital you know they're old school guys.

38
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:04,900
Well that's what I only recently realized the dimension it's weird about restaurants having to scan the menu that it like essentially boxes out people who don't have phones.

39
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,260
And that's sort of what's happening.

40
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:14,420
If it's if it's a cash free society that severely impacts mutant turtles who live in underground layers.

41
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,300
For sure.

42
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:15,580
Yeah.

43
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,340
Yeah.

44
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,980
And they're they're probably good tippers right because they're about virtue and justice.

45
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,340
So why do you miss out on a different way.

46
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,540
And this is not the topic of the episode but I have a lot of thoughts on which turtle is the best tip.

47
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,100
I'm more than happy to abandon and shift as much as we want to get to the world.

48
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,580
Donatello is the best tipper.

49
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,260
Ah OK.

50
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,380
What's the what's the thought there.

51
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:37,860
What's the logic.

52
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:43,340
Donatello I think he's just the most sort of thoughtful and the most empathetic of all the turtles.

53
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,820
So I think he understands that like being a service worker like it's hard like it's hard waiting on people it's hard delivering pizzas.

54
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,380
So I feel like he's the one who's probably most in tune with that.

55
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:57,380
I would say number two is Leonardo who's pretty empathetic as well but also I think can get a little wrapped up in himself.

56
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,620
I was going to say would he be a little bit like cut the shit at some point there's a job to do.

57
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,340
You can't be nickel and diming.

58
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,100
He might like have a limit where he's like look just deliver the food.

59
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,060
Yeah.

60
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:15,980
And then I think like it maybe it's even like Raphael next even though I think Raphael is one of those guys who's like the food was late.

61
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,300
They're getting half the tip.

62
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:23,380
They're getting half the normal tip I would give them and you're like just give the full tip man like the bounce the bounce of rage.

63
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,660
It depends on when but if you get catch him on a good day maybe he tips.

64
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,420
Yes a lot.

65
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,940
And then Michelangelo look I love him he's a party dude but I don't think he's the kind of guy who's just like oh I didn't have anything.

66
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,900
Sorry bro.

67
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,180
Yeah.

68
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,740
He's like a child.

69
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,900
Like yeah he's like a child.

70
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,260
Yeah.

71
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:46,380
The only time I ever like a group of friends and I ever just did not complete the check was we were all like 15 at a dentist.

72
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,340
Complaining about George W.

73
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:54,860
Bush and we all just pathetically like I have some more nickels I found some more nickels and we just did.

74
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,380
So that's you know yeah.

75
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,780
Michelangelo is eternally 15 I think.

76
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:00,420
Yeah.

77
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,900
That's a great break.

78
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,820
I would find there's no debate over here right about that.

79
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,500
That all adds up to me.

80
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,700
Did you say Leonardo.

81
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,220
Yet.

82
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,460
Did I use to.

83
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:10,820
Yes.

84
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,420
OK.

85
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:11,700
Yes.

86
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,180
Number two.

87
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:12,380
Yeah.

88
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,300
So Jason paid attention to three quarters of the list.

89
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:16,900
I.

90
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,220
Yeah.

91
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,740
I just missed one.

92
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:27,460
I was worried I was I was ranking that I was following your ranking and I remember he's just got General Motors facts in his head and he's running.

93
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,220
It's got a lot over and over again to make sure he doesn't forget them.

94
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:31,740
I.

95
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,020
Yeah.

96
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:40,180
My general unease with how many times they talk about low key talk about freedom just has me a little off kilter.

97
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,260
Fair speaking of George W.

98
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:42,820
Bush.

99
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,420
Yeah.

100
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,820
Freedom talking about freedom and talk about Paul McCartney you know talking about freedom his famous song.

101
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,420
Yeah.

102
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,100
And they were talking about your freedom to buy a Chevrolet Malibu.

103
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,500
Yes.

104
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,660
A car I owned at one point.

105
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,220
That's right.

106
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:05,500
How lost is the reference to freedom at this by 20 year old song Paul McCartney's post 9 11 extremely sorry.

107
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:05,820
Yeah.

108
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:06,900
My fault.

109
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,660
No I'm just curious.

110
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,220
Maybe people have a strong memory or fondness for freedom.

111
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,380
I think the rising is the one we all remember.

112
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,020
That's a Bruce Springsteen.

113
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,180
That's Bruce's song.

114
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:18,620
Yeah.

115
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:24,020
But I was not written and look I'm in the weeds already but Bruce did not write that song for 9 11.

116
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,540
It just happened to come out after 9 11 and feel like it was a very prescient prescient.

117
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:36,340
That's word song something that was a reaction to freedom was written after 9 11.

118
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,100
I just want to make that very clear.

119
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:39,500
Yeah.

120
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,580
I think it's hard to go on from my co-hosts about this.

121
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,980
I was I went to wherever Jason went during the turtles list.

122
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:53,940
I think I went back to thinking of the turtles tipping pizza people when I was talking about the rising and maybe think I should go back to that.

123
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,980
Denny's which is still open and just and just like complete the bill.

124
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,740
I know it won't be the same people.

125
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,900
I don't believe.

126
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,740
I mean how much could the tip have been on like a plate of fries and a sherry coat.

127
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,140
Oh yeah it was all it was already.

128
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,740
Yeah I'm sure we're all.

129
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,260
OK.

130
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,780
So how much hammy do we all get between the five of us is it an even five split on this moon.

131
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,580
How many moons do we all get.

132
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,180
Yeah we split it five ways.

133
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:18,700
OK.

134
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,620
Today we are all in theory.

135
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:28,140
Hopefully we'll be talking about world of motion an opening day Epcot attraction.

136
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,820
We are right around Epcot opening day the 40th anniversary.

137
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,820
I'm wearing a commemorative shirt Epcot forever.

138
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,580
That's what's that's how I feel in my heart.

139
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:47,140
And wow almost 40 years since the future began any general feelings about or sentiments you want to have.

140
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,380
Sentiments you want to send to this venerable park.

141
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,220
And it's a good question.

142
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,220
I mean I'm happy again I'm happy there's new stuff we've gone over this many times.

143
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,180
I'm happy there's new stuff and fun stuff to look forward to.

144
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,140
But I do get wistful for the boring stuff they got rid of.

145
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:06,740
Yeah.

146
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,380
Yeah.

147
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,900
And which this definitely fits.

148
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,740
Oh this is I'm delighted by it but I think it's.

149
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,020
Yeah.

150
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,340
I think you'd be I think you'd be faking it if you said there wasn't at least some of this that is boring.

151
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,700
I see Jason's face is really fired up.

152
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:35,500
I was coming in ready to defend this just on the sheer fried into my memory first traffic accident scene and then I watched it.

153
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,300
And I was like there's a lot of fun stuff in this one.

154
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,020
There's more fun stuff than I remember.

155
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:47,620
First off there's yes nearly 200 animatronics so yeah high marks for that.

156
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,100
Yeah.

157
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,700
And then I like the ride I was to I do too.

158
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,220
This is not a mission space situation.

159
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,900
Yeah no no no no let me get that out of the way.

160
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,060
Oh I like the writer I like boring.

161
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,220
Yeah.

162
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:09,940
But I think there is more fun in this ride because I because you had this was one of the only rides Ward Kimball worked on one of Walt's nine old men.

163
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,780
And then you had Mark Davis working on it you would Claude Coates working on it.

164
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,700
Buddy Baker and exit Tensio did the song and all the names right at the top.

165
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,580
I'm blowing all the names.

166
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,380
Shoot talk about purely a CEO Robert Stimple.

167
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,500
Well look I'll say Stimple for you.

168
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,980
I didn't have Stimple.

169
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:39,900
This is more to make the point that I think those guys generally had more fun creative work more fun in animation than say Ray Bradbury and Buckman's.

170
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,500
Or Fuller.

171
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,460
Sure.

172
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:50,220
Well you've got like a goofier lineup of people Mark Davis is responsible for a lot of the like silliness and attractions Jungle Cruise.

173
00:09:50,260 --> 00:10:01,900
I feel like he's like great Disney like silly playful animatronic tableaus or Mark Davis and then yeah Ward Kimball was like this is the only ride Ward Kimball.

174
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:06,140
See only ride not otherwise didn't otherwise make the shift.

175
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:17,780
Well Ward Kimball they did name he is there is a locomotive named after him at Disneyland named after him in 2005.

176
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:25,620
This locomotive was repurposed was originally used to transport sugar cane or sugar cane plantation and then it was at Cedar Point.

177
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,380
And then eventually the Disney train was not a Disney original.

178
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,860
They like not as original.

179
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,260
Really.

180
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,260
It's also the only Disney locomotive not named after a railroad executive.

181
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,340
All of the other ones are named after old timey railroad executives.

182
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:43,620
Wow.

183
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,020
You're here.

184
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,780
You're heroes.

185
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,460
My hero.

186
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,260
Yeah.

187
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,020
Surely great guys.

188
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,420
Right.

189
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,820
Railroad variants.

190
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,780
Yeah that's right.

191
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,180
Yeah.

192
00:10:52,420 --> 00:11:05,780
And and of course I tried to find a picture of Ward Kimball and first thing on a like Disney fan blog is Ward Kimball with a real big smile doodling one of those crows we don't talk about anymore.

193
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:06,980
Oh no.

194
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,540
OK.

195
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,180
All right.

196
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,180
So she hadn't been photographed.

197
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,620
Yeah he's he though like a lot of fun silly character.

198
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,140
He's he was Jiminy Cricket.

199
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,060
He was Dumbo.

200
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:26,540
He was Tweedledee and Tweedledum and he's like he's a crazy Coke bottle glasses loony guy like he looks fun.

201
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:26,980
Yeah.

202
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,820
To look at.

203
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,500
So the ride is going to be fun.

204
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,460
It's more fun from a fun looking guy.

205
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,940
We discussed that about Imagineers if the Imagineers are fun looking their rides are often better.

206
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,300
Is that something we've put together like.

207
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,860
What is that true because is Tony Baxter fun looking.

208
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,660
He's just like a man.

209
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,340
I think he is.

210
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,700
Yeah he's got that big bushy mustache.

211
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,620
That's pretty fun.

212
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,140
I think he is like kind of iconic features.

213
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:51,540
Yeah.

214
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,340
Mm hmm.

215
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,980
You know I like him too.

216
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,100
I'm just like he's like a guy.

217
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,700
He has a mustache and he is.

218
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:02,340
I wouldn't put him in the same ballpark as a guy with big crazy like a guy who looks like a scientist from a movie.

219
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:09,620
Well maybe we look it's too much to do now but we maybe we rank the fun look of all the Imagineers at some point.

220
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,140
You know who looks the most fun of all the famous imagineers.

221
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,540
Joe road he looks fun.

222
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,220
That's true.

223
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,700
That's undeniable.

224
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,740
But then you've got your Bob Gurz.

225
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,940
Who looks fun now.

226
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,820
He looks fun.

227
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,340
Yes.

228
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:26,860
But at the time I think he was we always talk about like just the white shirt the leg buttoned up.

229
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,620
You know a lot of those guys were very formal.

230
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:36,460
I think I think it's you can make the argument the other way that you know if you don't look fun and maybe you're you inversely come up with fun.

231
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:36,860
Young.

232
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,780
Roly Crump was like a hunk.

233
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,780
Kind of a hunk.

234
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,140
Yeah.

235
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,540
In that world fair one.

236
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,820
But he looks fun in his older age he likes looks fun in his older.

237
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,020
This is all these are parameters we're going to figure out for whatever this takes shape this.

238
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:56,100
What age is it that you have to look fun by fun features.

239
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,420
Final four.

240
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,300
If I could quote what you said about Tony.

241
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:05,060
Well you said iconic features but we're going to rank like what their noses and shins.

242
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,340
Where are we heading with this.

243
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,380
I don't know.

244
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,100
That's I'm saying we have to work the parameters of this out.

245
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:19,980
What we'll each have our own of our ideas about what about costuming because word Kimball was also in the Jax Dixieland jazz band the firehouse five plus two.

246
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,660
And I believe they're wearing fine outfits.

247
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,820
That's going to help them if there's pictures of them wearing fun outfits.

248
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,860
Yeah for sure.

249
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,140
Yeah.

250
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,060
Costumes.

251
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,260
Yeah.

252
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:30,860
Glasses.

253
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:38,740
Look there's no argument about word Kimball looking no argument and the sense of fun that he brought to the history of transportation.

254
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,220
Which you know this could have gone a more clinical way.

255
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:48,620
I think that is where the story of it potentially is that they they partnered with GM.

256
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,740
We want to tell the story of transportation.

257
00:13:51,100 --> 00:14:00,300
There was an earlier version I think that Claude Coats was involved with that was a little more dry as some of Epcot Center ended up being.

258
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,100
And they said have more fun with it Disney it up.

259
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:10,420
And they came up with something that definitely feels like all right it's the pirates vibe.

260
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:26,980
Yeah there's so many characters and big chaotic scenes and things that feel literally taken from pirates like the like a guy coming up from like from a well or a manhole cover with big goofy eyes and looking around like what what just happened.

261
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,260
Garsh.

262
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,220
Doesn't that feel that happens in this right.

263
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,620
I feel like that happens in a lot of Disney right.

264
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:39,500
They always they might always use the same mold of like the befuddled man with big eyes and a like little quivering lip.

265
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,580
You know what I'm talking about.

266
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,060
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

267
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:49,700
I mean that you would in the Haunted Mansion it's probably the same mechanism that like has ghosts pop up behind a headstone or something.

268
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:50,700
Yeah.

269
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,500
Pop ups and pop outs and they pop up pop up some pop outs.

270
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:04,500
Yeah I mean they're riding to two ways right now that the huge success of Haunted Mansion and pirates and they're also not too far out from the World's Fair.

271
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:13,460
I was talking to my dad about this ride he's like you know I always liked about the original Epcot stuff those pavilions felt like the World's Fair pavilions that he saw as a kid.

272
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:13,940
Right.

273
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:25,100
And he's like he always liked those and also a very dad observation about Epcot he's like and also they were very relaxing and it was cold in there.

274
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:32,420
So that was a nice and they were long and long and long and that was a nice comparison to the Florida swamp.

275
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,100
You are your dad's son.

276
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,060
And I am.

277
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:35,820
Yes.

278
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:42,420
With that history with the 64 World's Fair that's definitely a big part of this.

279
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:57,300
So Disney had like Disney already had a car industry girlfriend honey I don't know what you want to say but they were already paired up with like they already hooked up with Ford right.

280
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,540
Yeah they weren't they weren't messing around with Ford and Ford and Disney were going steady.

281
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,580
That's the way you put it.

282
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:02,900
Yes.

283
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,740
Yeah it's the early 60s they were going steady.

284
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:21,740
They Ford sponsored the attraction the Magic Skyway at the 1964 World's Fair showed how successful Disney could be merging with transportation and telling transportation and futurism kind of stories.

285
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:29,620
But I didn't realize this that you know those Disney attractions at the World's Fair small world and Carousel of Progress those feel like a big deal now.

286
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:39,060
But at the time if you ranked guest satisfaction and popularity at the 64 World's Fair the Disney attractions were 2 3 4 and 5.

287
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:48,020
They were none of them were number one and number one that the guests liked the most was a General Motors ride called Futurama.

288
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:53,300
They had an attraction called Futurama in the 30s which whatever year the 30s World's Fair World's Fair was.

289
00:16:53,420 --> 00:17:04,580
And then Futurama 2 was at the 64 World's Fair so they beat Disney somehow they managed Disney managed to not have the most liked attraction at the 64 World's Fair.

290
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,260
So that's probably where Disney's eyes started to stray.

291
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,140
What's going on.

292
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:10,980
Are they available.

293
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,420
Will they be available someday.

294
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,380
We take GM over to Holiday Hill.

295
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,620
You know what I'm talking about.

296
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:17,940
Ford is out of town.

297
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,740
What happens.

298
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:27,980
Well I watched the Martins vid Martins vids does these great video essays about Disney attractions especially long gone ones.

299
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:34,820
And one of the very first slides and a screen grabbed it because I thought it was very funny.

300
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:44,300
He said having seen what Disney did for Ford at the 64 World's Fair General Motors did not want a rival stealing the limelight at Epcot.

301
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:49,620
So they were the first to sign on for Epcot first pavilion that went vertical at Epcot.

302
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,180
OK.

303
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:50,820
So they were.

304
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,540
Yeah they were on board.

305
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,460
They got right to.

306
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,700
They well and they gave Disney.

307
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:01,420
They said come out take a tour of our test track the facility where we road test the vehicles.

308
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,260
Maybe that could be an idea for a ride.

309
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,380
They said no never that will never happen.

310
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,540
We will figure out something better.

311
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,220
So test track did not occur then.

312
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,380
But yeah they got.

313
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,260
I think this is beautiful.

314
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,380
This is like kind of two people in unhappy marriages.

315
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,220
I think the other.

316
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:24,460
Well maybe if there's ever a divorce or a death maybe that's what happened with Disney and yeah they finally hooked up.

317
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,780
Disney and the backup plan.

318
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,260
This is yeah.

319
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,100
Is that a movie.

320
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,540
Is there a movie called the backup.

321
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,900
There definitely is but there is.

322
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,420
OK.

323
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:42,500
As soon as I said it I was like surely someone has made something probably one of the like if we're not married by the time we're such and such an age or if we don't have kids.

324
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,860
I mean I'll look it up.

325
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:44,460
Yeah.

326
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,300
A plan.

327
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,460
The bad plan that Jennifer Lopez.

328
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,660
It is Jennifer Lopez.

329
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,540
It's Jennifer Lopez and Patrick Dempsey.

330
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:53,580
It is.

331
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,180
Hold on.

332
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,420
But is it about divorcees or people who want to get out of their unhappy marriage.

333
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:07,020
I think and she froze her eggs and she just met a guy and the eggs are about to expire.

334
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,220
I feel like I don't know the eggs expire.

335
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,980
Or it was some sort of in this world in this in the backup plan a verse.

336
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,340
Yeah.

337
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,020
Freeze your eggs.

338
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:17,780
It lasts a long time.

339
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:25,300
A woman conceives twins through artificial insemination then meets the man of her dreams on the very same day it is Alex O'Loughlin.

340
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,260
He is in the movie.

341
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,220
Is an actor or what.

342
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,500
That's the star of the movie.

343
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,100
Who's Alex.

344
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,540
I think so.

345
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,260
Is the star of a movie.

346
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,740
I've never heard this name in my life.

347
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,380
Maybe maybe that seems to be the top two.

348
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,740
I will tell you this that makes me very excited.

349
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,140
Also in this movie.

350
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,180
Happy Days is Tom Bosley.

351
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,300
All right.

352
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,380
Well just go skip through just the Bosley.

353
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,580
It isn't Bosley.

354
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,820
She doesn't get with Bosley.

355
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:59,620
If there is a movie from 2010 where Jennifer Loveless and like an 85 year old Tom Bosley hookup we would have known about it already.

356
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,020
I think would have been covered.

357
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,420
It would have been a saga.

358
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,740
Alex O'Loughlin.

359
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,940
Alex O'Loughlin had starred on Hawaii Five O for 10 years.

360
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,860
It's an alternate dimension celebrity.

361
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,300
It's a CBS or USA person.

362
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,180
I've never heard of them.

363
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,420
A handsome guy.

364
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,100
Yeah.

365
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,180
And then he had other TV show Moonlight and Three Rivers for previous shows he was on.

366
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:22,660
OK.

367
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,500
All right.

368
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:25,900
World of Motion.

369
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,660
We'll try to get more stats out of a backup plan as we go.

370
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,500
But stats about World of Motion.

371
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,300
Here's one of those.

372
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:32,620
OK.

373
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,740
I figure we're going to get into that area that always comes up of where we are.

374
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:43,020
We have like the if any of us went on that and I would have been on this when I was like seven or nine.

375
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:49,180
We all have that fog of like OK which one is this.

376
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,460
Is this the one where the is this the one with Mona Lisa.

377
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,020
Yes.

378
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,540
Is it the one with the cavemen.

379
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,860
Well a lot of them have cavemen.

380
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,940
Is it the one with the orange smell as engineer Jordan said.

381
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:09,340
Like you get you get a lot of these dark rides mixed up and in trying to parse which is which and what makes World of Motion special.

382
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:16,020
I just want to talk about like is there are there definitive ways that World of Motion was the best.

383
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:21,260
Is there an area where we think we got back up we're looking at a backup plan now.

384
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,700
There's Alex O'Loughlin.

385
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,740
I've never seen this man in my life.

386
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,580
He's the star of a movie.

387
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:31,940
And a show TV show he's like a guy he's so rich he's so famous to certain people.

388
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,180
Yeah.

389
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,420
I've heard of him in your life.

390
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,180
And I haven't.

391
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:34,780
Yeah.

392
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,540
No offense.

393
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,940
I think he might be a great actor.

394
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,740
He might be awesome.

395
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,780
Well people might be shaking to meet us too.

396
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,300
And he assuredly has never heard of Scott Mike and Jake.

397
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,020
O'Loughlin hive rise up.

398
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,220
Get our asses.

399
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,820
No don't.

400
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,220
What does that mean.

401
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:53,540
OK.

402
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:58,060
Areas where World of Motion might be the best one does.

403
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:04,820
And let me just throw some stats out because it at least is like the winner in some capacities.

404
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,060
I think probably the winner of longest Omni mover one thousand seven hundred fifty feet.

405
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,660
That is very very long.

406
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,820
This is a long ride.

407
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,220
Fifteen minutes we said.

408
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,300
That's incredible.

409
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,500
So I don't know if that was an estimate.

410
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,980
I don't think that's that's about right.

411
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,860
It definitely feels like there's a lot of scenes.

412
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:31,580
And you can tell when they spent through their budget when you get to Centercore the city at the end.

413
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,860
I think it might have been cool though.

414
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,060
It's just hard to tell on the video.

415
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,460
Yeah I think it does look cool.

416
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,300
I think it was cool.

417
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,100
Yeah I think the video is so crappy on it.

418
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:47,300
It all culminates in like you're driving by a big futuristic city which is like minimal and dark.

419
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:47,740
True.

420
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,340
But no animatronics by that point.

421
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,580
But I think maybe video isn't isn't doing it justice.

422
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,340
So it's it's very long.

423
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,100
That's good.

424
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,740
High ride capacity.

425
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,860
I don't know capacities to save my life but I know this thing.

426
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,260
Three thousand two hundred forty guests an hour.

427
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,260
Highest in the park at that time.

428
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,660
Wow.

429
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,220
Wow.

430
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,420
For comparison Space Mountain 2000 on a mansion 2400.

431
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,140
This might be one of the highest ride capacities ever.

432
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:25,900
This could swallow so many people every hour and yet still had a very long line when it opened even though the capacity was was crazy.

433
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:31,020
So putting up good stats but does it have the emotional pull.

434
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:36,740
Mike is there any area where you think you've gone over this and gone well I think this does this the best or that the best.

435
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,980
I think the ending is probably I mean maybe other than like figment.

436
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:47,580
I do feel like maybe this has the best ending of all of the original.

437
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,820
I say it lovingly boring Epcot dark rides.

438
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,100
It does that that city.

439
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,740
I do have I for sure went on this as a kid.

440
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,340
There's there's some video of us going on it.

441
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,180
I don't think we have video of the ride but there's a video of us on the ride vehicle as we start when we were little.

442
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,580
And I do when I watch the videos I do remember the end.

443
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,580
And I think that it's a great it's seemingly a great finale.

444
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:23,020
I want to give some credit to the start like going in the Omni mover going up like in a spiral almost outside.

445
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:23,500
Yeah.

446
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:30,060
Would you get almost like a picture frame view of spaceship Earth and later on the horizons building.

447
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:30,420
Yeah.

448
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:37,220
That's just very cool and unique and was probably a pain in the ass to deal with during Florida thunderstorms and hurricanes.

449
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,260
Was it covered though a roof.

450
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,620
It has a roof but it's open.

451
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,940
It's open to the outside.

452
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:57,860
Yeah it's yeah it's interesting because if you even stack up horizons and world of motion and then you put it up against spaceship Earth which is the last one standing basically at this point for us to cover.

453
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,020
Or or that exists period.

454
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:00,700
Right.

455
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,180
It exists.

456
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:01,340
Yeah.

457
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:01,860
Right.

458
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:09,100
You probably can make an argument that a lot of elements of horizons world motion are better than spaceship Earth.

459
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,900
It's just that spaceship Earth is in the ball.

460
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,260
It's in the iconic ball.

461
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,820
And you end the elevation really.

462
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,340
And that's such a cool element to know you're in the ball.

463
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:25,780
And then at the end even though like I always as a kid was really impressed obviously at the end of spaceship Earth when you're like that's the ball we're inside the ball.

464
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,980
So like that element always was was really impressive.

465
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:35,820
But when you watch the video you go maybe the robot parts of these rides were better than spaceship Earth.

466
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,340
Yeah I think that's right.

467
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:41,140
I think the novelty of being in the ball you're exactly right.

468
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:47,980
And this one the novelty I think comes from more like comedic scenes you know.

469
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:55,740
Yeah but there's still it's still Epcot and it's still as we've talked before it's a big long experimental concept.

470
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:01,500
Album where all the rides blend together and it's not like we're doing pop songs like pirates.

471
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:06,860
We're doing more free form songs where it's not like tight.

472
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,340
The rides aren't tight.

473
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,860
They feel a little messy to me and there's great stuff in all the rides.

474
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:22,620
But they all have like big empty rooms I feel like like there were like yeah that came up with Carly and the the maelstrom of the frozen ride like it's empty for a little bit.

475
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:27,660
I feel like every one of these rides was just dark for at least 45 seconds.

476
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:32,500
Am I hard to know with these old videos exactly how they played.

477
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:39,740
But I do like it is interesting because when you think about Pirates on Haunted Mansion it's like all killer stuff.

478
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,020
But those have genre tropes to fall back on.

479
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,460
You have pirate stories fall back on.

480
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,940
Ghosts to fall back on.

481
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:50,860
These are you know you said concept albums nebulous concepts.

482
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:59,260
The communication transportation horizons like the future transportation probably the cleanest.

483
00:26:59,340 --> 00:26:59,740
Yeah.

484
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:05,220
The cleanest of the concept which gives you like a quicker into like where what are we going to show.

485
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:05,500
All right.

486
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:14,140
Well it will be like early fumbling attempts at how we get around as you and stuff through like things getting kooky in the 20s and higher tech.

487
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:26,860
And some of the history stuff the history gags in this almost reminded me more of like J Ward cartoons than Disney cartoons in terms of like Peabody and Sherman.

488
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:33,700
Like I feel like reinventing like yeah like here's a fun rewrite of history instead of like accurate.

489
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,180
Re-write.

490
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,780
Spaceship Earth is a little like humorless.

491
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,420
That's not the point of Spaceship Earth.

492
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:43,300
But this takes some liberties of making jokes about Da Vinci or Columbus or whatever.

493
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:53,580
Or like like applying like vaudeville or borschtbell kind of jokes to like historic like use chariot lot feels like it would be in like a bullwinkle cartoon.

494
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,340
Oh totally.

495
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:54,820
Yeah.

496
00:27:55,060 --> 00:28:07,260
Richard said well that's an area where it maybe tops the others is the the fun and the comedy because I'm still maybe my heart wants to say horizons is my favorite.

497
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:12,060
But horizons is not about you're not laughing in horizon certainly.

498
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:12,660
No.

499
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,220
I know.

500
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:21,860
I think this wins for animatronics and scenes and then horizons might win in terms of sets.

501
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:22,660
Yes.

502
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,580
I feel like there is.

503
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,260
Yeah.

504
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,900
Yeah that's true.

505
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:33,140
Incredible environments and like inventive and the you know like the multiple futures you could chart and yeah.

506
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:48,020
And then again Martin pointed out in his video the combination of like kind of dry factual narration with like gags scenes like whimsical scenes that is an interesting like.

507
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,580
Interplay.

508
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,300
Interplay.

509
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:49,460
Yeah.

510
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:49,780
Yeah.

511
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:57,140
And you get a lot of mixed media stuff too with like animatronics and projected animation or projected like stock footage.

512
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,540
Oh everything on screens is really fun.

513
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,620
It is like it's like an early supplementary screen right.

514
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:10,020
It's not it's not a screen right but there's lots of screens that like help transport you or support what the animatronics are doing.

515
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:20,540
Yeah it's so so it all comes it all feels like the five and we've talked about this on horizons and there's some literal character parallels whatever the word is.

516
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:32,060
But like it's all carousel progress it feels like this is all born these are longer sort of versions kind of born out of the carousel of progress and that sort of style of like talking about progress technology and whatever.

517
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:41,780
But it is interesting to think about carousel progress is such a and I hate it so annoying that I keep saying this but it's like carousel progress to me is like got a great song.

518
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:54,020
The ride feels so tight as far as like no dead space in it and then you go on this thing and it's like it's more freewheeling the song isn't nearly as good.

519
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,300
Yeah I'm not going to know a lot.

520
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,620
It's not the best Epcot song.

521
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,060
I want not not at all.

522
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:15,900
And it like to be free is the song I referenced it in the opening joke and I feel like I always like assumed when preparing the episode I was like oh then I'll look it up and I'm sure I will be washed with nostalgia for the great song fun to be free and then I didn't you know it didn't really take for me.

523
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,700
Not a great song.

524
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:34,260
And also I wonder if I hate to be like what would Walt have done you know but I wonder with like Small World or anything I wonder if it was Walt who was like and then we need like kind of a refrain on some of these experiences that kind of fills in the transition spaces on the ride.

525
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:34,860
Yeah.

526
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:41,260
Because that's such a small world I know it's people think it's annoying and it is a little bit sometimes but it's such a hook for sure.

527
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:52,220
It's such interest it's so interesting that that these rides don't feel like they have that rhythm that some of those older rides do they feel like looser in structure.

528
00:30:52,380 --> 00:31:02,940
It does have the small world trick of like that song in lots of different styles maybe that's true or different styles and to some extent it is an ear worm.

529
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:09,420
Like it did get stuck in my head last night but I wasn't excited about that like I think you're upset.

530
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:19,980
I was fine I didn't feel one way or another about it in not in the way that the original like listen to the land song that when we talked about that ride it's like where is this.

531
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:25,300
Let's get this song back in here like this 20 percent improvement just put the fucking song.

532
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:26,460
Yeah.

533
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:31,100
Universe of Energy which we're not so high on I think.

534
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,980
But song both songs.

535
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:33,700
Yeah.

536
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:34,820
Yeah.

537
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,700
Now that we've kind of been through a lot of them or imagination could be.

538
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,780
Imagine is up there I think I do the universe of energy is so great.

539
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,500
That man.

540
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,540
That's all.

541
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,900
Feel the flow.

542
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,620
Yeah that's got some real.

543
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,700
Yeah that gets me a little a little pumped.

544
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:56,660
You want to hear one here one that's not good that's not in the ride but that is related to the ride.

545
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:06,260
Yes and I'm sure well I said I feel like you were you already talking about these weird promotional videos which we need to talk about one of them.

546
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:20,100
There is a video that they put out seems like internal for GM mainly it's called reality of dreams and Jordan if you could pull up the clip reality of dreams.

547
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,220
Metal man is.

548
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,300
Traveling like that.

549
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,620
Joe.

550
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,740
Ocean but an ocean.

551
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,660
Is.

552
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:43,700
The.

553
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,020
LRG.

554
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,500
Of.

555
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,380
Was I wrong was I wrong to hate on that.

556
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,380
Not feelin it.

557
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,180
Yeah.

558
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:02,820
I think that I think the verse on that is actually pretty fun and chill but the

559
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,220
chorus is a little bit.

560
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,340
This is kind of too airy.

561
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,940
Reality of.

562
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,620
I think that verse is good though.

563
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,140
I was actually the verses I was like okay maybe I'm into.

564
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:13,620
The.

565
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,060
Course.

566
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,420
I am.

567
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:23,900
Here's my thing to admit when I was I did have that song in my head even though I

568
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:28,180
don't like it really but I was I think what was in my head was that style of

569
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,780
singing I couldn't stop doing it reality of.

570
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:39,940
I was getting ready this morning and my wife walked in on me in the bedroom and I

571
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:45,660
was singing that next to the very reality of trees but I was about to take a

572
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:51,140
shower so I had a shirt but no pants on and I was about a foot away from the cat

573
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,780
and she walks in on this tableau.

574
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,740
What are you are you serenading the cat naked.

575
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,780
Winnie the pooing.

576
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:01,580
Yeah.

577
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,780
Donald Duck in your ass.

578
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:08,460
Hey bunny I got a show for bunny can I teach you about the reality.

579
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,220
I did now look I just was I just wasn't thinking and I was not aware of the fact

580
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,780
that I wasn't wearing pants and I definitely was not putting on a show for my

581
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:22,380
cat that involved whipping my junk around for her amusement.

582
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,060
You said where you said she was a little under the weather too so imagine walking

583
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,620
into that and just being like what the fuck is this I'm already blowing my nose

584
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,060
nonstop this sucks.

585
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,500
Last thing I need.

586
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,620
I have a weird cat show you're doing.

587
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:41,660
Is that can I ask is that off the top of your head is that one of the weirdest

588
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,700
things she's walked in on.

589
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:45,460
I don't know.

590
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,700
I mean it's always you know because hey when you're living with a comedian there's

591
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:54,620
a wings of flying you never know what the I can't think of anything weirder.

592
00:34:54,660 --> 00:35:00,300
Now that I add it up especially that like if she didn't grill me but if she had

593
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,300
like what was the song.

594
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,180
That was a song from World of Motion well not from World of Motion from an internal

595
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,580
GM video called Reality of Dreams promoting World of Motion.

596
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:13,420
The level of it's pretty unexplainable that's for sure.

597
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,700
Yeah I'm trying to think I don't know if I have anything that beats that winning

598
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,180
the pooh style but I mean the amount of times Lindsay walks in and I'm like

599
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:25,300
listening and singing along to like Brent Spiner's jazz album or something.

600
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,180
You think more than once.

601
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,700
Brett Spiner's jazz album.

602
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,060
I've done it.

603
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:34,780
Yeah or I should say old standards it's not maybe someone's jazzy but it's not

604
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,100
you know.

605
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,420
We got to know the genre of the.

606
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,340
It's like more like I get a kick out of you.

607
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:41,940
Big band.

608
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,900
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

609
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,220
It's a MacFarlane stuff.

610
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:44,380
Yeah.

611
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,060
Old yellow eyes.

612
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:45,820
Seth MacFarlane.

613
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,620
My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

614
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,140
Yeah.

615
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,780
So that's Reality of Dreams.

616
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,820
Do we want to talk a little about some about these videos because and we'll say

617
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,020
more stuff that we like about the ride but I because I have I have some little

618
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:03,980
moments from what I'm talking about is there was that video there's Reality of

619
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:09,420
Dreams and then there is this other one called Make Your Own Magic.

620
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,860
Yeah that's the one I watched.

621
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:15,580
I had a tape of this and I was like why did I have a tape of this because it also

622
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:20,180
feels like internal General Motors promotion of Disney.

623
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:25,620
It felt like it's you know telling employees hey we have a ride now you should

624
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,220
maybe go there and here's what else is it.

625
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,220
Disney World.

626
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:31,780
But I realized that there was a time where if you left this ride they gave you a

627
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:37,100
little slip and it said free offer from GM if you give us your address and you

628
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,180
think oh a car.

629
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,340
No no no a tape and the tape.

630
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,460
So I think that's why we had I think my parents must have filled out this form

631
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:48,020
and then gotten a tape promoting the place that we just came back from.

632
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:54,540
Yeah I I got to say I misjudged this one just on the like you know preview image.

633
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,540
I thought it was going to be it's mostly a Disney World promotional video.

634
00:36:59,660 --> 00:36:59,900
Yeah.

635
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,700
With little snippets of world emotion mostly at the end but then intercut

636
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,940
throughout they kind of tease it a little.

637
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:09,940
Yeah but they take you through it's like all the footage we know like there's one

638
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:14,220
shot of people walking past Spaceship Earth and right as the monorail goes by

639
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:19,100
that is in everything every piece of Disney World footage or special or sitcom

640
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,460
or there's like flying over Mickey on top of Spaceship Earth they use all the

641
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,900
footage that we know which I've watched dozens and dozens of times.

642
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,420
So I was I'm always happy to see it.

643
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,380
But when you're talking about why you misjudged the video is it because of the

644
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,980
boring man and there's a very boring man in the thumbnail and I was like all

645
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,140
right let's go.

646
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,700
I believe Jordan has the boring man cued up.

647
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,780
Here he is now.

648
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,820
Something for everybody here.

649
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,180
Something for everybody.

650
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,980
Today we come to expect even demand variety and almost everything that affects

651
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,020
the quality of our lives.

652
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:57,260
The history of transportation here at the world of motion shows how people

653
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:02,260
throughout the ages have searched for and found better ways to get from here to

654
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:02,820
there.

655
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:07,780
That speech goes so much longer than just showed that I mercifully cut it off.

656
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:13,220
You know what I forgot about the his name on screen because I was just like man I

657
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,340
like that sport coat.

658
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,300
Yes it is a really striking like baby blue.

659
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,140
It's kind of a Johnny Carson suit a little bit.

660
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,140
Yeah it is.

661
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:22,540
Yeah.

662
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,220
Yeah it's it's it's very sorry it feels very it doesn't feel like it feels good.

663
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:33,260
It feels 70s like he is Robert Stemple the CEO of General Motors may have gotten

664
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:38,580
stuck in a very he might have got there is one type of suit I like and that's

665
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,140
what I wear.

666
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,140
Don't buy me anymore.

667
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,340
Keep cleaning the one.

668
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,980
Scott how does that compare to the was it Carl Wilson's jacket.

669
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,020
Was it a blue jacket.

670
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,420
You've you've always wanted to know.

671
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,420
No that's a well that's a green jacket a green green jacket that he wore in a

672
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:55,140
concert that they filmed in the early 80s and there's no question that's the no

673
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:55,580
that that's the winner.

674
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:59,380
I admire Robert Stemple's jacket but I don't think I would wear it myself.

675
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,500
Carl Wilson's jacket I would wear every day.

676
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,780
I still waiting for you to find it and wear it all the time.

677
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,580
I should I have not made any particular effort.

678
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:11,220
That'll be the next thing Aaron walks in on Carl Wilson jacket.

679
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,460
How much are you paying at this auction.

680
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,740
Then you're she finds you just wearing it with nothing else.

681
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,260
It's just the jacket.

682
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,740
It's singing Carl Wilson's songs.

683
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,180
Trader.

684
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:28,820
I also think I have an old like a real vintage tie from my dad and I think it's

685
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:32,980
pretty close to that tie like from the 70s or 80s.

686
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:39,340
So like man I might have to get like a simple cause but the black pants the black

687
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,500
pants with the sport coat is very striking.

688
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,420
It's a choice.

689
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:48,660
If you went to if you had a live show or at like a D23 type thing dressed like that

690
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,780
I mean you would have to have visual reference but if you dressed like this and wore

691
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,620
glasses like that slicked your hair back.

692
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,660
I mean you could bald cap it.

693
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,220
I don't want to I don't want to make you spend more money.

694
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,460
Look time's already doing that to me.

695
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,100
I don't I don't think I'll have to work too hard on that one.

696
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:09,420
Well then you would just print out a lower third for yourself that says Robert Stemple

697
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:13,860
Robert Stemple the crowd going insane like people just screaming.

698
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,700
It's like the Beatles are here again.

699
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,180
Maybe now maybe now that we've dropped it.

700
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:18,940
Yeah.

701
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,420
Wow.

702
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,340
This is we're here for the show where Jason's Stemple Stemple.

703
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,660
We're recording this while D23 is just starting and I wonder if there are there any

704
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,620
Stemple cosplayers on the floor right now.

705
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,380
I don't think so.

706
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,020
I think this would be a totally unique Disney world related cosplay.

707
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,300
Disney bounding is Robert Stemple.

708
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,980
Like a hot 22 year old jacked guy cosplaying.

709
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,020
What's up fam.

710
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:52,740
We're checking out the new Halloween cake here at Disneyland and I'm just like Robert Stemple.

711
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:59,620
Cut off sleeves from the jacket like the blue jacket cut off sleeves and he's like jacked.

712
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,860
His arms are huge.

713
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,140
Or a beautiful girl.

714
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:06,420
I'm watching her vlog like why am I so in love with this Robert Stemple.

715
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,100
Yeah.

716
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:13,260
All right everyone let's meet up at the Disney bundle stage and you'll know how to find me.

717
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,540
I'll be dressed like Robert Stemple.

718
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:22,780
Is there was there ever a discussion to make a Park star vinyl figure of Robert Stemple.

719
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,460
I just that maybe somebody threw it out there.

720
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,740
It didn't happen but maybe somebody threw the idea out.

721
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:33,620
People a lot of people filled out the free offer that a lot of people sitting on that tape and we're

722
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:38,580
cutting that business off if we don't make a little toy of Robert Stemple.

723
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:39,540
That's right.

724
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,540
The chairman and the CEO don't forget.

725
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,620
So that's right.

726
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:51,180
And he knows you want freedom the freedom to choose which which very angular car.

727
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,740
Which bizarre undriveable car you want.

728
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:03,580
Robert Stemple incidentally 15 years before he filmed this this dry intro his son was kidnapped.

729
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:11,860
His third year old was just picked up in a car thrown into the trunk where he remained for two days straight.

730
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:19,820
And the kidnappers demanded one hundred twenty five thousand dollars which he paid but they did the old.

731
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:26,620
They they the police knew the numbers and so they tracked the money and got them.

732
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:33,380
They actually they actually only tracked one of the guys and the one ratted out the other immediately like they didn't even know there was a second guy.

733
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:43,540
So these kidnappers this is a very poorly put together plan but the 13 year old his this guy's son Stemple son carved his own name into the into the trunk.

734
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,380
Like he found a blunt object and put his name in there.

735
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,580
So like if they find the car they'll know that's why.

736
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:49,580
Wow.

737
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,220
Yeah isn't that's a resourceful that is really smart.

738
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,420
There is a tip if you get kidnapped an audience.

739
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,940
Boy do I hope that none of you get kidnapped but you do.

740
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,340
Stemple it.

741
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,900
All the stumbles are.

742
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:02,860
But right.

743
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:03,260
Right.

744
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,780
Your name don't write Stem.

745
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:05,620
Don't write.

746
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:09,220
Robert Stemple's 13 year old son.

747
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,700
Oh shit I wrote the wrong.

748
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,620
Oh no.

749
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,020
I wrote Stemple.

750
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,740
I do have a bit of an axe to grind with General Motors.

751
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,260
Yes sure.

752
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:30,300
Because you remember that ignition switch recall this massive recall from like I guess what would it be.

753
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,260
Like seven or eight years ago now.

754
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:37,500
And it's that your car could just turn off sometimes.

755
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:49,020
And in the middle of a drive in the middle of a drive or if it was jostled a little and I had a Saturn Ion which was a GM car and fell under that recall.

756
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,100
And I had to deal.

757
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,580
I had issues.

758
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:59,060
I started having issues where my car I would turn it on and it wouldn't start and then the key wouldn't come out.

759
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:11,460
And the bigger issue this only happened to me thank God one time I went over it like a speed bump like an uneven like part of the road when I was like first moved out here was doing like a P.A.

760
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:22,340
job doing a run in Long Beach and my car like like really came down hard like over this bump and it slowly just turned off.

761
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:28,380
And like thankfully I was in like a residential neighborhood but I just pulled over and I was like what the what's going on.

762
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:32,580
And I like let it sit for five minutes and turned it back on and it was normal.

763
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:39,140
And then like five or six years later I started having this issue where I thought like oh is my battery dead.

764
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,020
What's wrong my car won't start.

765
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:47,300
And eventually the dealership said like oh this is part of the recall.

766
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,580
We don't have the parts yet but hold on.

767
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:54,700
They took a screwdriver and popped a panel off on my steering column.

768
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:59,220
And they're like if your key stuck in the ignition hit this button and you can release it.

769
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:05,820
And I'm like what the fuck is this like this was a secret button years long problem with my old car.

770
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:11,220
And eventually I got the free like recall work done and it fixed it all.

771
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:16,980
But it was like there were thousands and thousands of cars in America that had issues with that.

772
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:20,820
There went over a bump whenever a bomb and more.

773
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,300
Sorry I'm going to need a minute.

774
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,260
Give me a second.

775
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:23,980
Yeah.

776
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,980
I'll be just give me an hour buddy.

777
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:26,700
I'll be fine.

778
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:35,140
Or just weird like hey I was 20 minutes late from work because my car wouldn't start and then it released the key and then it started fine.

779
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,380
I think it was on cold mornings it would do this.

780
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:43,820
This is scarcely an improvement from the days of making zebras carry all your belongings.

781
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:47,500
No I'd rather have a hot foot in the cave.

782
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,060
It was simpler when I had a hot foot.

783
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:51,020
You'll be fine.

784
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,220
Yikes.

785
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:52,940
Yikes.

786
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:54,860
Wow.

787
00:45:55,140 --> 00:46:00,820
So you're telling me that GM is not that the products are not always quality.

788
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,740
I just like what our beloved theme park told us.

789
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:04,580
Just saying.

790
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:10,780
I know it's American made but I haven't had any issues otherwise with my Honda you know with Honda Civic.

791
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:19,140
So I have I also have a General Motors beef which is related to a CEO.

792
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,460
It was like so who else.

793
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:25,900
Well first of all the history is very spotted of the CEOs.

794
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,580
I mean Robert Stempel seems solid.

795
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:28,340
We love Stempel.

796
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,340
We're going to cosplay Stempel.

797
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,020
We agree on that.

798
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,700
But the guy before that the CEO when this ride opened was Roger Smith.

799
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,220
That's Roger and me.

800
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,380
That's like the guy in the movies about.

801
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:41,460
Yeah that's who started Michael Moore's career and killed Flint Michigan.

802
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,180
And yeah.

803
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:51,140
And so you would get you they would hand out pamphlets telling you about the fine GM products that don't die immediately after going over one bump.

804
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:59,540
And there's like a smiling photo of Roger Smith as the like probably you could have the movie was out and you might get handed this pamphlet.

805
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,540
So weird there.

806
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:03,660
But then the first.

807
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,060
OK.

808
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:14,460
So I went and found a this was an internal GM magazine employee newsletter or something called News and Views.

809
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:18,900
And this is from 1982 when Epcot opened when World of Motion opened.

810
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,140
And this was just an article right.

811
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:30,300
And it said the very first line of the article was Walt Disney would have liked Alfred Sloan.

812
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,060
Like that's an interesting assertion.

813
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,460
Who is Alfred Sloan.

814
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,340
I guess anyone reading this if you work for General Motors you know who that is.

815
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:38,900
So let me do a quick Google.

816
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:45,140
Oh Alfred Sloan the first CEO of General Motors the beginning of this lineage that leads to Roger and Stimple.

817
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:45,980
OK.

818
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:47,820
So he built the company into what it is today.

819
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,340
Oh his Wikipedia has the headline criticism.

820
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,020
What could there be to criticize him for.

821
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,140
Oh Nazi collaboration.

822
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:59,020
Ah so the first CEO.

823
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:14,780
The story here is that GM also owned a German auto manufacturer called Opel and Hitler is starting to gear up in the 30s and some shareholders are saying hey maybe we should not be running Opel anymore.

824
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,940
What do you think Alfred Sloan.

825
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,820
And he said we have no right to shut down the plant.

826
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:26,420
In other words to put the proposition rather bluntly such matters should not be considered the business of the management of General Motors.

827
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:38,260
Then a year later the invasion of Poland began the Blitzkrieg and all of the trucks used in the Blitzkrieg were built by General Motors.

828
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,220
Oh my God.

829
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:42,740
One year after he said don't worry about it shut up.

830
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:46,780
So just to remind you where we got how we got to that guy.

831
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:50,580
The phrase was Walt Disney would have liked Alfred Sloan.

832
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:57,900
And within five seconds I got to Alfred Sloan built all of the artillery for the invasion.

833
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:02,180
What was the Nazi scientist guy that was affiliated with Tomorrowland.

834
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,980
Oh in the in the opening day special.

835
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:16,140
Well we're we're in a brown brawn all the like Operation Paperclip all the scientists they got out of Europe and then ushered to America to work on weapons or start NASA.

836
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:21,660
Yeah a lot of them show up in Disney's like documentaries and Tomorrowland stuff.

837
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:21,980
Yeah.

838
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,300
It's just a stone's throw away.

839
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:26,220
Always a stone.

840
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:26,580
Yeah.

841
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:27,940
See collaborators.

842
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,900
You think General Motors.

843
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,300
I truly thought they were going to be in the clear.

844
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:42,940
I thought you were going to make the leap to Mercedes Benz or BMW because they have like those are German automakers that have like not great.

845
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,260
There's a section of the tour missing.

846
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:46,300
Oh right right.

847
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:46,780
Yes.

848
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:54,300
No somehow the American company found their way and they built bombers and landmines and torpedo detonators.

849
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:59,340
And apparently this guy did not resign from the board throughout the whole of World War 2.

850
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:07,460
And again Walt Disney would have liked Alfred Sloan his best buds Mickey Mouse and Pluto and Alfred Sloan.

851
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:22,740
And then a more innocuous CEO Harlow Curtis he didn't do any work with the Nazis but after he retired he was on a hunting trip in Canada with his retired vice president of GM and he accidentally shot and killed him.

852
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:29,780
What is the hunting trip but we're hunting ducks and then he killed his own former vice president.

853
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:34,460
Vice presidents shouldn't go on hunting trips is really what you're saying.

854
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,540
On either side they're going to do any vice.

855
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:43,140
Yeah they're going to shoot somebody in the face or they're going to get shot in the face if you are or have ever been a vice president.

856
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,620
They're not go hunting.

857
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:48,700
You'd rather be a moose on it out in the field than a vice president.

858
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:51,620
That's it's just it's why they're not president.

859
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,340
It's why they're vice president.

860
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:57,820
Poor aim notoriously poor aim.

861
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:01,340
For sure or for aim from ducking away from a bullet.

862
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:01,580
Yeah.

863
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:02,940
Aim poor aim on both sides.

864
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:05,380
Or get invited on a hunting trip.

865
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:08,500
I always ask are any vice presidents coming along.

866
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,340
Raise your hand vice presidents raise your hand.

867
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:14,820
Or they have great aim and they have an axe to grind.

868
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,780
You know also possible very possible.

869
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:20,060
Yeah use these hunting trips as cover.

870
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:23,140
We're on to you vice presidents of the world.

871
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:23,580
We know.

872
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,260
Is there a vice president of Disney right now.

873
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,540
I don't know if we know the who's who.

874
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:28,500
Well we'll keep an eye on them.

875
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:36,220
Anyway so these are some of the great people who are bringing us this attraction.

876
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,660
But it's just you know this is how it goes.

877
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:39,940
We've run into this many times.

878
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:46,540
You have to there has to be horror shows of human beings to finance our animatronics.

879
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:50,980
If we start talking about some of the stuff in the ride this has been alluded to already.

880
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:54,020
The high volume of animatronics.

881
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:54,780
Crazy.

882
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:59,460
This is this could be a record that world of motion has.

883
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:08,020
Now it depends on the source because I've seen a lot of things that say one hundred and eighty eight animatronics but I've seen some that low ball it at one hundred and thirty.

884
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:12,500
That might have to do with figures like one hundred thirty of them are human.

885
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:17,180
Yeah proportion and then the rest are like objects or I don't know if chickens count.

886
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:21,580
So it depends but let's give them the benefit of the day and say one hundred and eighty eight which is crazy.

887
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,700
I don't know a lot of these numbers.

888
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:29,060
Pirates one hundred nineteen hundred nine on imagine one hundred and fourteen America sings.

889
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,180
We know that one had a ton.

890
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:35,460
Hundred sixty three in Sinbad or beloved Sinbad in Tokyo.

891
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:40,380
So this might be the record of an audio and try that's a lot almost two hundred.

892
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:50,180
Yeah that's I that feels like maybe it's just because it hasn't been around so long but I was like I was shocked when I was like yeah this thing has the most robots.

893
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:55,020
It's really crazy and then little little for the 40th anniversary of up cut.

894
00:52:55,060 --> 00:53:03,820
Let's give this this park some credit for what it did to the robot population of the earth on just the day that it opened.

895
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:09,620
So that's a let's say one hundred and eighty eight just for world emotion.

896
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,980
Then and then you start thinking about the other rides.

897
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,220
There's a ton and all of them.

898
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,100
We do it fast.

899
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:20,540
American Adventure 35 Listen to the land 35 Universe of Energy 34 Spaceship Earth 63.

900
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:21,860
I'm not sure about all these.

901
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,940
These are you know their estimates so we'll fuzz it.

902
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:30,500
Kitchen Cabaret has a lot 28 while horizons not opening yet or not open yet on opening day.

903
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:37,620
So let's just October 1st 1982 a conservative estimate would be three hundred and eighty one.

904
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:42,180
And it might be more it might be north of 400 on a single day.

905
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:47,220
I don't think we have Epcot center for all the ways that we love Epcot for the crazy architecture and the ambition of it.

906
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,460
Sheer robot count.

907
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,660
That is nuts.

908
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:53,820
A single theme park 400 robots.

909
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:54,420
God.

910
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:55,020
Yeah.

911
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,620
Is anything ever come close.

912
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:58,260
Nothing will come close to that again.

913
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:58,900
Yeah.

914
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:00,340
No scenario.

915
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:03,380
All parks are we're going to get cool rides here and there.

916
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:11,100
But we you know one of the only things where I might agree with you Mike and your otherwise grotesque breakdown of transformers versus.

917
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,580
Rise of the resistance.

918
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:20,540
We do give you know like we're impressed that there is you know 30 animatronics on something.

919
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:27,460
But when the bar 40 years ago was almost 200 and 400 in a single park.

920
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,140
What have we done.

921
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,900
What what's happened to our.

922
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,620
This is what they took from us.

923
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:32,580
Yeah.

924
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,900
We have to go back.

925
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:37,220
I I would have given even make audio animatronics great again.

926
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:37,580
Yeah.

927
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,820
Maga.

928
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:59,980
I want to give a more specific note for or accolade to world emotion a lot animatronics in the post show area in the what they call the trans center which is what Ron DeSantis supporters called Disney World as a whole right now.

929
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:01,780
It's their favorite.

930
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:07,620
It's one of their favorite activities after only frothing at the mouth and posting on next door.

931
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,620
This is our favorite things to do.

932
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:15,500
But yeah there there was there was a lot of stuff in the post show area looks pretty fun.

933
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:16,580
Yeah on this.

934
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:16,940
Oh yeah.

935
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:20,380
There was a robot and a bird doing a double act.

936
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:26,860
You know I think that count that I get I think if if it's one hundred eighty eight I don't think that even counts it doesn't count burden.

937
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:31,180
I think that takes it up to one night and then original animation at the water engine theater.

938
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:33,540
That's a weird show.

939
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:34,420
That is weird.

940
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:39,740
Part of me wants to do a second gate just on the post show Eric just on the trend center.

941
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:42,180
But I don't know if it's needy enough.

942
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:49,780
It's can I just read the I found a I was I guess looking at 80s magazines.

943
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:58,660
Listen to this was this one I think it was called like industrial design magazine was really mad at this post show which is called really water engine.

944
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,260
They hated it.

945
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:00,420
They hated the whole park.

946
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:07,060
They actually they said GM takes the prize for vulgar excess with its ride through the history of transportation.

947
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:22,820
And one of the things about it is a truly nasty multi screen exhortation by a macho cowboy portrays anybody working on alternatives to the good old combustion engine as a creep a crack pot or a wimp.

948
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:25,940
Oh yeah I'm not endorsing the message of water engine.

949
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:30,300
I was just impressed by original animation for like the walk by post.

950
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,300
Oh the end of the animation is all really fun.

951
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:33,060
But yeah they're not.

952
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,260
I mean I think this guy.

953
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:39,260
Why are we using say nasty and nasty very nasty post show.

954
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:52,740
Let me tell you that it is that is technically the premise though is that a cowboy good old American cowboy says well nothing's ever going to beat the engine and then seven weirdos show up to provide all possible alternatives to the engine.

955
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:56,540
And then in the end he just kind of sits there calmly and is like yeah not engine though.

956
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:57,900
And they're all like yeah you're right.

957
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:00,740
He is he does give them credit.

958
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:05,820
He's like if anyone can pull it off I'll happily endorse it but I don't think so.

959
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,220
And it turns out that glum cowboy was right.

960
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:13,980
Besides the plug in the begrudging plugins we have nowadays.

961
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:22,020
Yeah yeah especially the show is called water engine and the one who says what if there was an engine powered by water is a.

962
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:28,380
Igor lab freak like he's I know it was our engine.

963
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,100
He's like Peter Laurie voice.

964
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:36,900
Yeah yeah yeah he's like like he's one step away from being put in an institution.

965
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:41,740
So that's how crazy a water engine even though it's the name of the show.

966
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:46,900
What else would a weird kids you want to stick around for water engine we got water engines starting in four minutes.

967
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,060
I'm tired but water engine.

968
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:53,660
I don't care about dinner reservations let me just watch water engine one more time.

969
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,740
I can eat at home I can't watch water and.

970
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:04,500
In the Guardian the new guardians right queue and I really love the post show what water engine.

971
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:08,740
That's my favorite show video to watch.

972
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:13,780
Oh God and the all and concepts 2000.

973
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:19,740
Where he showed you what cars might look like and how they might respond to different.

974
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:24,260
Wind speeds love God awesome.

975
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:25,580
Oh so sweet.

976
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:33,580
Someone was mad at us when we posted that and it's like oh sorry this world famous actor doesn't know as much as you 30 year old guys.

977
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,860
And it's like we are we are we're cold of that person.

978
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:37,220
Yeah.

979
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:38,380
Yeah they got square.

980
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:45,300
We're not I don't think that was the criticism I think the criticism was hey man maybe read over the script on the card of the.

981
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:50,260
Maybe give it a pass a couple of times and ask some questions if you're not sure.

982
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:57,980
I think that depending on the level of style not cutting them a break but you know having worked at Funny or Die I know the.

983
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,380
The the pressures of the.

984
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:10,860
The celebrity is here for precisely nine and a half minutes go go go and it shouldn't be that way the rides people should be excited to be on the rise we're going to see that forever.

985
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:17,300
But I have a feeling that second takes are always tough if it's an A-list star I think I think that like.

986
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:24,980
I think Pratt was probably like looking at the door that's where his eye line is he's like the door is open and his car door is open.

987
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:28,380
And as soon as cut is called he is barreling into it.

988
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:36,700
Yeah he's in the middle of changing shoe he's got one shoe on one street shoe on one costume shoe on and then they're like oh we're not going to see your feet doesn't matter.

989
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:43,100
Look I guess I'm just a little naive I'm just more like all right everyone we're putting on a show like.

990
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,180
I don't like it's definitely not good.

991
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:58,700
I the only thing I could say about it is sympathy for and you know what I know from a different podcast that another a Lister will Smith that he was like they had no time with him on men in black.

992
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:08,940
Yeah and I don't approve of his slapping but he did give it his all with his one take performances in the men in black alien attack ride far pre slapping.

993
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,940
Those are that's the will we want back.

994
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:20,100
J. J. L. is lines Jason's acting like on that Hulu commercial that's airing right now they didn't say all right we're going to try it again and Jason goes no I'm good.

995
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:26,660
I did my one I'll be back in the trailer I'll be at the I'll be going to get a breakfast burrito.

996
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:30,500
Give me some cards put up the cards I'll do another one if you give me cards real big.

997
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:38,140
A lot of running you know it's running and gunning in a heat wave to shooting outside on a hill and take Sheridan.

998
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:47,980
Well it wasn't it wasn't when the heat wave was the worst though you're right it was hot but it wasn't sorry it was only ninety five it wasn't a hundred and five.

999
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,180
It is a difference now.

1000
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:59,860
I guess I would you the day where you were very stressed out because of the swimming we haven't seen the swimming yet.

1001
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:07,380
No there's a bunch of other stuff that was shot I think just for social media just for like Twitter and Twitter and Instagram ads.

1002
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:13,500
It was so funny that we were texting you about stuff and then you were flustered and like I'm guys I'm sorry it's just it's been a lot of swimming and.

1003
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:19,740
I'm talking about hours in a pool hours in a pool like it was and is it like.

1004
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:28,900
It's like a lot how crazy is the swimming like I just you know even in an inner tube just shredding water and then paddling back to one.

1005
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:41,180
Lake paddling back to set word like on the side of a pool and like you know you think that be fine but it's like oh the way they need it the background to be we're in the deep end.

1006
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:47,660
So like I'm like holding myself up and your dog paddling little kind of yeah a lot of dog paddling.

1007
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:50,820
Are you a lazy let me ask you this are you a lazy river guy.

1008
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:53,140
I am a lazy river guy usually okay.

1009
01:01:53,380 --> 01:02:00,100
Yeah I love I'm a big lazy river guy Scott ever been in a way I ever what are your feelings on it yeah I love lazy rivers.

1010
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:12,220
Oh I love a lazy river yeah but that's a lot of the pushing for you and so so you're saying that when you were in the inner tube it wasn't you weren't but first sitting with their legs out because that's the most no no no human could be in.

1011
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:25,260
I know I was step into it you were like this and pull it arms over and then other people were sitting in it but even then they're like all right with kind of got a paddle back to the camera mark.

1012
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:36,260
Do you think what is your guess when the commercial comes out do you think that it will be clear the amount of effort that was put into the swimming or are we going to watch it and it looks like there's no way there's no way it's clear.

1013
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:49,140
No because most commercials whatever you whatever you give and whatever everyone was laughing and it's the best one it's just the fastest one is probably what goes in because you're you're judging by seconds.

1014
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:52,180
So this is not going to seem like you were in a Greg Lugina's biopic.

1015
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:52,860
No.

1016
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:53,700
No.

1017
01:02:55,700 --> 01:03:07,100
Hey it's not it wasn't clear in the Wendy's commercial that I had to do stunt driving that they sprung on me about an hour before it happened you know so I'm sure it's not going to be very clear of all the swimming Jason.

1018
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:15,100
Yeah also again I'll say this was one of the most fun shoots I've ever been like this was like a delightful and everyone was very good and stuff.

1019
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:16,260
You hear that Hulu.

1020
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:16,820
I.

1021
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:17,740
So he said it.

1022
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:18,580
I hear him again.

1023
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:19,420
We're delighted.

1024
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:24,900
Make him the face like my feet were bleeding my.

1025
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:28,300
Almost ripped my swim trunks off.

1026
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:32,260
It's almost naked like that swimming and singing to the cat.

1027
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:39,260
The brand new not my swim trunks wouldn't have been my choice necessarily swim trunks.

1028
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:43,380
They couldn't afford a good string ripped right off on the show.

1029
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:44,540
I couldn't say that.

1030
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:46,180
OK OK.

1031
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:49,340
So let's let's say some ride stuff.

1032
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,220
We said hi and I'm trying to count.

1033
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:53,820
Who do we like.

1034
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:56,660
Who are our guys who are fake guys in this ride.

1035
01:03:56,900 --> 01:04:01,180
Well I will say for your theory of like stuff blending together.

1036
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:10,260
Yeah I didn't remember exactly that it was in this ride but the sea serpent looking into the guy's telescope the goofy look and see sir I had no idea which one that was.

1037
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:11,740
But glued in my mind.

1038
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:17,900
Clued in my mind like I mean I knew the traffic accident was in this scene because there's cars everywhere and a horse and stuff.

1039
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:21,500
So that one is great.

1040
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:26,060
That's neat. It's like possibly Columbus or a generic explorer.

1041
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:36,140
I don't know but looking like the idea was that like he has this telescope right up to that almost like the black pupil is filling the entire telescope.

1042
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:39,180
So he doesn't even know there is a full giant dragon.

1043
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:39,700
Oh that's.

1044
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:40,460
Yeah.

1045
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:43,140
Is that possibly the full gag.

1046
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:46,020
I mean it's like it's fun no matter how you slice it.

1047
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:48,420
That's cool.

1048
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:51,660
I like what you get cavemen.

1049
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:53,860
You know what I was going to say this in.

1050
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:59,300
I think this justifies our how we feel where they all blend together a little bit for us.

1051
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:02,460
This is from an imagineer.

1052
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,060
This is from.

1053
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:06,780
Oh why can't I find it.

1054
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:07,300
Geez.

1055
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:11,340
The guy was Tim Delaney.

1056
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:11,860
That's right.

1057
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:16,900
Tim Delaney who was the star of this documentary about Space Mountain in Paris.

1058
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:20,940
He was a bit like kind of pioneered the launch in a way.

1059
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:22,540
The ultimate launch queen.

1060
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:24,060
Tim Delaney.

1061
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:27,580
He he worked for Imagineering and worked on a lot of these rides.

1062
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:30,940
And this is from the defunct land podcast.

1063
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:31,820
Kevin interviewed him.

1064
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:36,060
And this is an imagineer saying this that he just kind of flippantly says.

1065
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:40,620
Well you know a lot of that early Epcot stuff it's like basically all caveman to space shuttles.

1066
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:48,580
So even he is like OK it's another one where it's like see things were very simple but now they are very high tech.

1067
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:53,540
And he said his specialty was the future stuff.

1068
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:54,860
That's what he was really into.

1069
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,540
So I maybe have to credit this guy with a lot of the very good.

1070
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:00,940
And I think he had a lot to do with that ending the future city center core.

1071
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:02,340
He designed that I believe.

1072
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:07,380
So he was like the Epcot future design guy in which case he has my heart.

1073
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:10,420
But he said I didn't mess around with the cavemen.

1074
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:11,620
They had good cavemen guys.

1075
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:12,860
They were they were covered on cave.

1076
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:20,300
I love that. That's like when Disney says we had good fake rock guys like cavemen was like there were people who specialized in that.

1077
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:22,540
And are there cavemen in every one of these.

1078
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:23,980
Probably not horizons but.

1079
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:26,820
Yeah I guess not.

1080
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:28,180
Oh yeah.

1081
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:29,540
But it's definitely space ship Earth.

1082
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:30,340
You go back right.

1083
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:30,980
Pretty far.

1084
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:31,620
Energy.

1085
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:32,420
Universe of energy.

1086
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:33,620
Is that just dinosaurs.

1087
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:34,340
Well there's dinosaurs.

1088
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:34,780
Yeah.

1089
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:35,140
Yeah.

1090
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:39,460
Because they they would be accurate cavemen were not around when dinosaurs were around.

1091
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:50,060
This is kind of a universal reference point of like the earth in the past pre pre man or pre modern man you know pre modern civilization.

1092
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:51,900
Yeah.

1093
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:52,180
Yeah.

1094
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:53,620
And those are I like the caveman.

1095
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:56,340
The guy blowing on his foot because it got all.

1096
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:56,940
Sure.

1097
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:57,940
Hot and.

1098
01:06:58,420 --> 01:06:58,820
Scarred.

1099
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:01,780
I want to shout out the pig in the hot air balloon.

1100
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:03,340
Yeah.

1101
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:04,220
Absolutely.

1102
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:05,580
I mean that should be a go.

1103
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:09,180
I mean I guess it's just because it's not around but that should be like a big thunder mountain goat.

1104
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:11,620
I feel like pig in the hot air balloon.

1105
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,580
Pig has got a real kind of creepy grin on its face.

1106
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:26,020
You got a couple of pigs correct because then you got the one of the more memorable tableaus is the the guy in the white Mark Twain suit landing in the mud.

1107
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,940
And there's pigs around him.

1108
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:31,540
Another pirate's gag is a very similar pirate's gag.

1109
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:31,780
Yeah.

1110
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:38,460
This guy seems like he's in there not by choice whereas the pirate in the slop seems like he loves being there with the pig.

1111
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:39,220
He wants to be there.

1112
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:39,500
Yeah.

1113
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:47,420
I mean there's still there's still kind of inventing the modern Disney dark ride animatronic loaded up dark ride you know.

1114
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:50,580
But yeah it's yeah.

1115
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:52,220
Another.

1116
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,980
I mean the robots are good.

1117
01:07:55,020 --> 01:08:01,060
I don't want to make it seem like I don't like this because there's so many good robots like the newsie boys and stuff that come later.

1118
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:01,460
Yeah.

1119
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,220
Oh the ice picking boy.

1120
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:05,780
They're picking apart the big block of ice.

1121
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:07,060
I like the.

1122
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:14,540
There is the just married car and then the car full of reality college students.

1123
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:17,020
That's what college students did for fun in the past.

1124
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:20,460
They just put too many people in a phone booth or too many people in a car.

1125
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:26,940
But there's banners above the one there's projections going on at the same time.

1126
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:31,580
There's banners above the newlyweds that say Vanity Fair Vanity Fair referring to the phrase.

1127
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:38,900
I looked this up on Miriam Webster dot com a senior place characterized by frivolity and ostentation.

1128
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:42,580
So this was a phrase before the magazine Vanity Fair.

1129
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:43,860
That's why it's called that.

1130
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:50,780
But the weirder banner I want to talk about above the college kids there is a banner that says college humor.

1131
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:52,780
Oh yeah.

1132
01:08:52,820 --> 01:09:01,340
I think that I think college humor was maybe a magazine before the one that we know.

1133
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:01,820
Before.

1134
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:02,660
Yeah.

1135
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:04,740
I saw that in some article.

1136
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:07,100
I think that jumped out of me as weird.

1137
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:08,860
Yeah I think that name may have existed.

1138
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:14,940
Humorous frivolity like of the piece with Vanity Fair it feels like like look at these outrageous.

1139
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:19,180
They've all got letterman jackets on and they're sitting on the top of a flagpole.

1140
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,060
Can you believe the youth.

1141
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:25,020
But it did not overlap with the website.

1142
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:25,660
It was not.

1143
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:26,700
There were no further.

1144
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:28,900
They didn't reference a streeter.

1145
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:31,060
There's no no no.

1146
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:36,420
Zack Oyama baby Zack Oyama came along after this ride.

1147
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:37,180
Yeah yeah.

1148
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:46,580
But here's what I would like to talk about which is the you get into the flight is taken off.

1149
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:57,660
There's a lot of which also is confusing because you have that Delta dream flight that gets into it's the crazy history of playing that is like 1920 stuff and weird barnstorm and planes.

1150
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:03,700
So there's probably memories we all have that we think are in this but are actually in Delta dream flight.

1151
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:13,940
So it's still goes to Magic Kingdom 2 but this does have a woman who's really impressed to be next to a real barnstorm and pilot and I just have this on my computer.

1152
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:14,740
I don't have it.

1153
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,340
Let me get it on camera.

1154
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:26,580
But this is like does this guy who has the aviation cap and a mustache and this guy always kind of scared me and if he's in like Epcot promotional videos he scares me.

1155
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:29,460
I think his his his face is so sharp.

1156
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:32,380
It's a big sharp chin and a big sharp nose.

1157
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:33,540
He's too big.

1158
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:38,100
The other animatronics in this ride are really realistic and then he's he's scary.

1159
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:38,980
He's like the fiddler.

1160
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:42,220
She looks like a 70s woman.

1161
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:44,260
She looks like they're like they don't know.

1162
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:44,940
Yes.

1163
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:47,460
Like they don't know where Sible Shepherd.

1164
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:48,100
Yeah yeah.

1165
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:55,820
And then he looks like when Snidely whiplash wears a disguise with Snidely whiplash is trying to fool everyone.

1166
01:10:56,060 --> 01:11:01,700
So he makes himself look not like creepy and everyone's like oh who's this count.

1167
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:04,340
Who's this captain of the industry.

1168
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:10,980
Or this would look if Jay Leno was like wearing prosthetics for a sketch for a hidden camera.

1169
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:11,500
Gotcha.

1170
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:12,060
Yeah.

1171
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,020
Look like this pilot.

1172
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:14,260
And was that a nod.

1173
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:17,660
I mean it was not a nod to the future of Jay's big dog.

1174
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:22,140
Like obviously Jay wasn't well known as a car guy back then.

1175
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:23,740
So it was just a happy coincidence.

1176
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:28,380
I don't think this is a nod to at the time David Letterman.

1177
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:31,980
Regular guest on David Letterman's late night show.

1178
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:36,900
I don't I don't believe he is and they probably wouldn't put a mustache on him but maybe I don't know.

1179
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:38,180
Might have been the inspiration though.

1180
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:38,940
So sorry.

1181
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:42,420
Miriam Webster dot com covered in Pinocchio.

1182
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:46,500
I'm just realizing they're playing in the background.

1183
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:51,220
This dictionary website covered in ads for live action Pinocchio.

1184
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:53,540
So I guess that's what I've been looking up.

1185
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:00,060
Well happy happy Disney Plus day everyone.

1186
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:00,660
Yes.

1187
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:01,500
Happy Disney Plus day.

1188
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:01,900
Yes.

1189
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:07,580
I like so I like that there's a scene of the train a train robbery.

1190
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:14,100
So we're learning about motion and we're also learning now because of the invention of different modes of transportation.

1191
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:21,420
We learn also that you can be robbed in transit to someplace on one of your favorite modes of transportation.

1192
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:28,780
So I honestly think they should have stuck with this and shown robberies happening on every different type of transit.

1193
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:32,140
Who knows maybe someday robberies on a hovercraft.

1194
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:36,380
Yeah like a future robot comes down with a laser gun.

1195
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,020
People's hands in the air.

1196
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:42,940
I just a very funny thing to put in the middle of like the positive.

1197
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:47,860
I mean it's I guess it's a gag because there's like a guy in a fun like little suit.

1198
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:51,620
And I guess you could say that I don't know.

1199
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:55,020
I'm just gonna say that maybe they're rich people so he's robbing from the rich but I don't know.

1200
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:59,260
They're not really indicating I guess they're not indicating class or status.

1201
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:01,340
I really see the size of the money bags.

1202
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:12,100
No but yeah I know it's like presented as comical but then the guy there's a guy who has a gun like an inch away from his face and he is shaking.

1203
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:20,060
That's his animation is he is trembling like way that would actually the more you stare at it you have a choice to make flip a coin.

1204
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:26,540
It would be like on Carousel of Progress if he's like well you know my identity was stolen again.

1205
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:37,500
Folks what happens is someone takes your Social Security number and then they start they take all the things and they can use your credit cards and then you have to get it back and it's a long process.

1206
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:40,860
Boy do I not like my identity being stolen.

1207
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:42,300
Oh my that's right.

1208
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:43,820
That's progress I guess.

1209
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,260
Cost of progress.

1210
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:49,420
You know I didn't like it happening but I did appreciate the progress.

1211
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:56,140
So noisy around here with the next door neighbor out Philanine Burton Schreli has gone off to jail.

1212
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,300
He's moving out.

1213
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:04,060
He's got a special album though that's still in the house only one of a kind.

1214
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:05,540
The scene rotates.

1215
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:11,860
Well this is progress Martin Schreli out of jail starting something called a Web 3 company.

1216
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:14,660
I'm still trying to just log on to AOL.

1217
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:15,940
That's progress for you.

1218
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:19,340
Each scene just is about Martin Schreli.

1219
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:22,300
What does the future hold for Martin Schreli.

1220
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:33,180
Oh due to the agreement with the contract because the United States government now owns the Wu Tang Clan album they are free to release it as there was only supposed to be one owner.

1221
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:41,140
Uncle Orville invested too much in a theory and the crash happened mere weeks ago.

1222
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:44,740
So needless to say Uncle Orville has no money left.

1223
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:47,900
He did it all on a smartphone.

1224
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:50,740
No privacy at all around.

1225
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:53,460
This isn't our house.

1226
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:57,020
This is a set that we snuck into and then security guards show up.

1227
01:14:57,540 --> 01:14:58,100
Oh crap.

1228
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:58,860
Got to go.

1229
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:00,060
Hey kids.

1230
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:05,980
Lost the house trying to buy GameStop stock and then Robin Hood app wouldn't let me take my winnings out.

1231
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:10,460
Movie pass seemed like a good opportunity at the time.

1232
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,460
They also laughed.

1233
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:14,860
It's a great big beautiful tomorrow.

1234
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:18,660
My new job at Quibi will last forever.

1235
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:22,140
They're flipping videos two ways now.

1236
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:23,060
Who'd of thunk it.

1237
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:28,340
So yeah so it is interesting to see to see that portrayed in that way on this.

1238
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:28,780
Yeah.

1239
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:33,380
Oh and well I got something about the train robbery.

1240
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:43,300
So well this is something to say you know this is a lot of animatronics and this ride disappears in 1996 very beginning of 96.

1241
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:48,420
And you don't just throw one hundred and eighty eight animatronics in the garbage.

1242
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,100
That doesn't seem right.

1243
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:53,260
They were trying to find some other purposes for all of them.

1244
01:15:53,300 --> 01:16:02,460
And I remember strongly I think it was later in that year or could have been 97 that the first of the umpteenth pirates redo's happened.

1245
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:08,220
And where the headline of it was the women are chasing the men now.

1246
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:10,540
How will society ever continue.

1247
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:16,020
But I went on it when it reopened and my main thought was are those the animatronics from the world of motion.

1248
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:22,540
I don't know if they're still there all of them but like they added extra animals especially there's pigs.

1249
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:30,220
I believe your beloved pigs I think showed up in pirates somewhere and maybe some chickens.

1250
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:34,380
I think some of the chickens went to the ride Goofy's barnstormer.

1251
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:35,500
Oh OK.

1252
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:37,700
They had chickens popping up in the barn.

1253
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:41,660
There's some characters who they added.

1254
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:51,540
I don't know what they're doing in pirate but like in world of motion they're pulling on ropes to control horses and donkeys that are getting out of control.

1255
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:57,420
And I think similar stuff's happening in pirates and they just put like pirate rags on them.

1256
01:16:57,660 --> 01:17:01,460
So at least some of these characters ended up in pirates.

1257
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:07,620
But there's one that and I've only found one source saying this so I don't know if I believe it.

1258
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:27,860
This is just the website Walt dated world dot com and they said that one of the animatronics when this ride closed moved a few feet over at Epcot center and was repurposed to become the Ellen DeGeneres animatronic in the bizarre redo ride Ellen's energy adventure.

1259
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:28,700
Wow.

1260
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:30,540
I could not.

1261
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:33,060
I really tried to find other sources on this and I couldn't.

1262
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:36,780
But then I was like I want to figure out if there's any truth to this.

1263
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:38,660
So I started looking at animatronic.

1264
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,780
There's a lot to go through with one hundred and eighty eight.

1265
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:49,020
I'm like looking for posture basically as I said there's there's robots that are pulling a pulling a rope.

1266
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:58,660
And if you remember Ellen that's a big if if you remember the Ellen robot she has a big branch and she's trying to either feed or fend off a big dinosaur.

1267
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:01,740
So I'm like was it one of the rope holding ones.

1268
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:05,380
No I think there's there scrunched too much and they ended up in pirates anyway.

1269
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:13,100
But there's why I have one candidate and I want to see if you guys think this could be Ellen Jordan can you pull up the photo Ellen.

1270
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:20,260
This is the only possible one to me and just hear me out for the listeners.

1271
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:22,540
So Ellen is holding a big branch.

1272
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:37,020
This train robber is also holding items not one big item but a hat to put money in with one hand and like taken a chain robbing a piece of jewelry with the other.

1273
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:43,060
And then the legs are bent at a similar angle not very that's not like a 45 degree.

1274
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:46,020
That's just like a little three degree bend.

1275
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:51,340
And maybe I'm just thrown because the hair is a little similar like it's kind of dirty blonde.

1276
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:58,940
And then and it's like like khaki shirts but you know they could they redressed the animatronic I'm sure.

1277
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:01,180
Am I crazy.

1278
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:07,940
Is this the only this is the only one I think that possibly could be Ellen in hiding.

1279
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:12,180
Well I think a couple of things I have questions on.

1280
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:18,460
Yeah one is how customizable are our movements.

1281
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:25,780
Because the our movement in the train robber is like doing two different things.

1282
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:26,940
It's got the gun it's got that.

1283
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:32,420
Ellen is holding the branch very low much more different position.

1284
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:38,860
Absolutely. But think about this the hands are constructed to be holding something and maybe you just move them down.

1285
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:41,900
You just sweep move them down and then reprogram.

1286
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:43,460
I bet that's possible.

1287
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:44,540
I think that's OK.

1288
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:50,340
But Jen but they didn't have to remold hands and look at the angle on the left hand.

1289
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:52,700
I think there's like a little bit of an elbow bend.

1290
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:53,820
Yeah that's true.

1291
01:19:53,860 --> 01:20:08,620
I'm thinking about what I remember from Superstar limo where Drew Carey was a robot that was holding a bunch of maps to the stars homes and they got converted to a monster zinc robot that's also holding a bunch of pictures that say have you seen this child.

1292
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:14,060
So I'm using that logic like OK they probably if it was holding something it also still has to be holding something.

1293
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:15,740
But I think you could move those arms down.

1294
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:22,300
OK. My other question then is with the bank robber what's under the bandana.

1295
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:24,140
Did they finish the face.

1296
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:27,820
Oh yes. Do you finish a character's face.

1297
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:31,060
If what if the hair looks pretty similar.

1298
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,860
What if they did the math and said I think that could pass for Ellen.

1299
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:42,100
All we have to do is put kind of female features on the lower half of the face which right now is just pure robot.

1300
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:43,220
It's just pure.

1301
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:45,940
There's just no skin under that mask.

1302
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:48,020
You make a very good case.

1303
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:50,420
I think it seems very possible.

1304
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:52,780
It doesn't seem that crazy.

1305
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:54,460
But again I only saw this on one.

1306
01:20:54,580 --> 01:20:59,500
I think it's either either this train robber is hiding out as Ellen to get away from.

1307
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:04,540
They're on the lam posing as Ellen or this fact is not true.

1308
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:06,580
And this was a custom Ellen degenerate robot.

1309
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:10,340
However this robot has always been very bizarre correct.

1310
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,220
Very bad.

1311
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:13,500
It would have to be reused.

1312
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:17,780
I was explaining all of this to Aaron and saying OK so I have a theory.

1313
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:18,500
Now what do you think.

1314
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:22,020
And I pulled up a picture and I said OK so here's Ellen.

1315
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:24,380
And she said OK now show me Ellen.

1316
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:25,900
And I was like no no that's Ellen.

1317
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:28,700
Wait the one we're looking at right now is supposed to be Ellen degenerate.

1318
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:29,500
Yes yes.

1319
01:21:29,740 --> 01:21:31,380
This is the after I'm showing you.

1320
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:34,580
And then she said please also put pants on please.

1321
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:37,980
Why must you conduct all of your business.

1322
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:40,980
And put the cat down for God's sake.

1323
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:42,180
God please.

1324
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:45,780
The boy the boy learns from watching his parents.

1325
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:51,340
He needs to know the anatomy you'll have one teaching him a lesson at all times.

1326
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:56,820
Ellen looks like Lady Elaine Fairchild from from Mr.

1327
01:21:56,820 --> 01:21:57,500
Rogers.

1328
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:58,220
Oh yeah.

1329
01:21:58,260 --> 01:21:59,860
That big version of that Mr.

1330
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:00,740
Rogers puppet.

1331
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:01,620
Oh yeah.

1332
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:02,740
And thank you Jordan.

1333
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:05,620
Yeah yeah that's it's very like that also stern.

1334
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:06,700
That was very scary.

1335
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:07,740
In a stern look.

1336
01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:11,540
That that does sound like a dun dun dun.

1337
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:14,020
Yeah that's a like it's terrifying.

1338
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:15,460
There's almost like very scary.

1339
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:15,620
Yeah.

1340
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:19,580
I mean there's kind of like a like there's like a 70s horror movie.

1341
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:23,500
This it's taken the brow is so like is it.

1342
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:26,460
Am I just thinking of like Yul Brynner in Westworld.

1343
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:28,540
Probably.

1344
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:34,940
I just have eyes or the dinner scene from Texas Chainsaw but like a distant relative

1345
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:38,460
of leather like a grown child of the corn.

1346
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:39,060
Yeah.

1347
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:42,980
Stuff stuff where they were like you know we have a hundred dollars to cost you the

1348
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:43,540
seat.

1349
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:45,980
So just put some putty on their face.

1350
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:50,540
Anyway if anyone knows this this might be another like this this could be like a

1351
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:51,340
gem in land.

1352
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:56,700
I don't know if they listen and if you do sorry I've done impressions of your

1353
01:22:56,700 --> 01:23:01,660
voices once in a while and if if you aren't listening somebody get the words.

1354
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:03,940
I would I'm really curious if there's any truth to this.

1355
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:06,460
Well look Len took on the J.

1356
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:10,260
Big case so I think there's a decent chance he's listening.

1357
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:12,460
I'm pro bono detective work out of one.

1358
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:12,780
Yeah.

1359
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:15,380
So Ellen also the train robber.

1360
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:19,180
I feel somebody out there knows this fact and we got to find him.

1361
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:20,540
We'll figure it out.

1362
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:22,420
Will we won't figure it out.

1363
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:23,500
Someone else will figure out.

1364
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:26,260
As you said the first time it's easy.

1365
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:26,420
Yeah.

1366
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:30,260
Like we can we can solve any mystery with someone else solving the mystery.

1367
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:31,260
Exactly.

1368
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:38,580
Did you guys catch that when when this ride closed in 96 it caused a chain reaction

1369
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:41,020
it caused horizons to open back up.

1370
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:42,420
Oh oh.

1371
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:44,980
Like a few weeks down to a people leader right.

1372
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,260
Yeah they were down too many attractions.

1373
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:53,620
So like I think it was something like the 23rd or 24th of December like right around

1374
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:56,020
Christmas they reopen horizons.

1375
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:59,740
So for a while they had both open for the Christmas rush.

1376
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:00,060
OK.

1377
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:07,140
And then in the new year they close world of motion for test track which was of course

1378
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:09,380
then a pain in the ass because it kept not working.

1379
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:14,820
And there was just no ride for this this section of the part that side of future world

1380
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:17,140
that it's so rough for a while still does.

1381
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:17,740
Yeah.

1382
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:21,740
Well the only reason I wouldn't say that is because they have guardians now.

1383
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:23,660
But oh that end of it.

1384
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:25,820
But the other half of it.

1385
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:26,540
Yeah.

1386
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:32,660
Boring Ellen ride with this with this framing like this Ellen who's going to stab you with

1387
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:34,500
this tree branch and then rob you.

1388
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:36,060
It's still got the robber instincts.

1389
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:44,580
And then these two really like problematic rides in their construction in the rides

1390
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:47,220
functionality not due to racism or anything.

1391
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:47,660
I don't think.

1392
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:47,860
Yeah.

1393
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:48,180
Right.

1394
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:50,620
Mission space or test track.

1395
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:51,980
I don't believe I think they're those two.

1396
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:52,820
I don't think so.

1397
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:53,220
Yeah.

1398
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:55,460
Unlike a lot of rights they're in the clear.

1399
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:56,940
Yeah.

1400
01:24:56,980 --> 01:24:58,620
Bad area though for Epcot.

1401
01:24:58,860 --> 01:24:59,140
Yeah.

1402
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:03,900
While it did this ride purely close because we have an idea for a thrill ride and that's

1403
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:04,180
the.

1404
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:12,220
Well I think what it was was I mean GM you know they had the first sponsorship contract.

1405
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:13,580
They renewed it.

1406
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:18,540
There's an economic downturn around the time that that is being renewed.

1407
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:18,980
OK.

1408
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:25,060
Early 90s maybe 92 about and then they kept doing one year contracts like we'll keep

1409
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:25,580
sponsoring.

1410
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:26,300
OK.

1411
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:27,780
It's still going but we'll keep sponsoring.

1412
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:32,740
Which was like good for Epcot because everything did the 10 year and then bailed but they at

1413
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:34,780
least kept doing little renewal.

1414
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:37,620
GM still the sponsor never went away.

1415
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:43,220
They've just Chevrolet is the more specific line is sponsoring it but still GM.

1416
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:51,420
And so I think after some year long contracts are like we want to keep doing it.

1417
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:53,540
Could we get something new in there.

1418
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:57,620
And Disney was like well we are missing a thrill ride and then that's when they make the

1419
01:25:57,620 --> 01:26:00,740
connection like what we did you did show us your test track.

1420
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:01,700
Gotcha.

1421
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:03,260
Is there something there.

1422
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:04,340
Yeah you know yes.

1423
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:10,460
And then which isn't a bad thought but certainly the first few years even the first decade

1424
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:17,140
of Epcot I was looking up what were Disney's thrill rides were first Space Mountain and

1425
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:18,300
Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.

1426
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:24,860
The earliest one of those was 1975 was the first I believe that would have been Space

1427
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:26,100
Mountain at Disneyland.

1428
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:28,820
They got into thrills very very slowly.

1429
01:26:28,940 --> 01:26:30,620
Yeah they got in very slowly.

1430
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:35,980
So like it kind of makes sense that it took Epcot a while to get a thrill ride because I

1431
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:40,220
don't think they were thinking about like oh yeah parks need to have dark rides and

1432
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:45,500
thrill rides and show like they were still you know figuring out what this is.

1433
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:52,140
We just need slow moving trips from caveman days to an optimistic future that the

1434
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:54,900
corporation sponsoring the ride cannot make happen.

1435
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:56,580
Yeah.

1436
01:26:57,820 --> 01:27:02,740
There is a funny one of the cars at the end looks like the Tesla Cybertruck.

1437
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:04,140
Yes it does.

1438
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:06,380
Yeah like very very similar.

1439
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:06,740
Very similar.

1440
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:09,140
I don't know the Tesla Cybertruck offhand.

1441
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:11,060
Oh it's a really angular.

1442
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:16,180
Everyone says it looks like polygon like early PlayStation 1 car.

1443
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:17,420
You realize.

1444
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:18,500
It's so pointy.

1445
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:19,500
So the pointiest car.

1446
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:22,620
That's the one where Elon Musk said he was he was on stage and he said that the windows

1447
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:25,900
could never break and then he hit it with like a big hammer and then the window broke.

1448
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:26,580
Yeah.

1449
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:28,820
It's like a QVC blooper.

1450
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:29,860
Yes.

1451
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:30,220
Yes.

1452
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:30,500
That's madness.

1453
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:32,420
A high profile QVC blooper.

1454
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:36,620
I think some people speculating because they're like oh there's no rear view mirrors on

1455
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:37,100
the sides.

1456
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:41,020
It's like aha there's cameras and everyone's like what the fuck are you talking about.

1457
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:42,660
Cameras break all the time.

1458
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:43,340
Yeah what if.

1459
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:48,340
I think I don't think we figured out something better than mirror yet.

1460
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:49,140
Is it long.

1461
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:54,620
As long as it has a secret button in case the key won't come out then I think it'll be

1462
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:54,900
already.

1463
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:55,500
No no.

1464
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,060
But Saturn Ion.

1465
01:27:57,380 --> 01:28:02,260
It's guaranteed to get caught on fire that fire departments cannot put out.

1466
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:06,420
That is the special kind of Tesla type fire.

1467
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:06,980
Yeah.

1468
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:08,540
It's not normal fire.

1469
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:11,380
It's futuristic fire that it's harder to put out.

1470
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:11,740
No.

1471
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:13,060
New types of fire.

1472
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:15,260
We're excited about that.

1473
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:17,340
That's my attempt at a new one.

1474
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:18,060
It's pretty good.

1475
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:18,620
It's pretty good.

1476
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:18,980
Doesn't he.

1477
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:21,180
He does kind of ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1478
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:22,980
He like laughs weird right.

1479
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:23,740
Yeah.

1480
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:24,180
Yeah.

1481
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:24,820
That's yeah.

1482
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:25,460
No it's hard.

1483
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:26,660
I've tried to do him before and it's not.

1484
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:28,340
I can't do it.

1485
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:29,940
That's that seems close to me.

1486
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:30,780
That's that's pretty good.

1487
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:32,060
They're clipped and.

1488
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:33,940
That's close.

1489
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:34,420
I'm going to get.

1490
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:39,220
There's another weird car that they showed off called the lean machine.

1491
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:44,980
That's in the show and it's called the lean machine not just because it is very thin.

1492
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:47,300
It is a one person car.

1493
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:51,380
Aaron described it as looking like a motorcycle with a house.

1494
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:52,220
Yeah.

1495
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:53,460
Like it is.

1496
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:54,900
It is because you're reclined.

1497
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:56,420
It's like a recumbent bike.

1498
01:28:56,620 --> 01:28:58,660
But then it's got like a little pod on top.

1499
01:28:58,940 --> 01:29:01,820
But also it's a lean machine because you lean.

1500
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:06,740
It's like it's the same idea as the segue where you're using your own balance.

1501
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:11,300
So you like you know turn your legs in the way you would on a motorcycle.

1502
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:12,980
But you're also steering.

1503
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:22,580
And this thing just looks like it's a tin can like if anything like a large dog landed on top of the car you would get crushed to death.

1504
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:23,340
Yeah.

1505
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:29,420
I will say a lot of proof of concept stuff a lot of you know blue sky thinking sort of stuff in the post show area.

1506
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:29,820
Yes.

1507
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:33,700
Much more fun and optimistic than a lot of test track.

1508
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:34,380
Yeah.

1509
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:38,700
I current test track post shows just like hey everyone here's the new Chevy Malibu.

1510
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:39,300
Oh yeah.

1511
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:41,340
Here's the current model Chevy.

1512
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:42,900
There's a saturn eye on it.

1513
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:43,820
There's a saturn eye on it.

1514
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:45,940
We should post photos of your saturn eye on it.

1515
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:47,900
It was a very reliable car.

1516
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,100
You know I still think you drive that.

1517
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:52,140
I'll see it on the road sometimes and I go oh Jason.

1518
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:53,780
Oh no no I don't have it anymore.

1519
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:54,420
Because I am so.

1520
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:55,100
You get your hopes up.

1521
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:55,900
Jason.

1522
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:59,500
That's like a dog waiting for an intermaster to come home.

1523
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:00,940
It was very specific.

1524
01:30:00,940 --> 01:30:01,620
That's like your Batmobile.

1525
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:02,620
Color green.

1526
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:04,380
I loved that color green.

1527
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:07,180
It was very easy to find parked on the street.

1528
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:08,220
Oh yeah.

1529
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:08,700
Yeah.

1530
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:09,460
We'll find some photos.

1531
01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:17,220
I was going to say I think if you quizzed me in 90 whenever whenever test track test track open I would have definitely said oh good world.

1532
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:20,140
This is much this is so cool test track is awesome.

1533
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:24,980
But in hindsight not not as good as this right.

1534
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:25,500
I think.

1535
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:26,140
Huh.

1536
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:26,860
Yeah.

1537
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:29,740
I mean I would I would definitely love if this was here today.

1538
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:34,100
I was thinking how insane it would be if like again we're recording this on D23 weekend.

1539
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:47,580
We don't know what they're announcing but if they announced imagine this hadn't happened and they announced what we're going to do is build a 15 minute ride about the history of transportation and there will be one hundred and eighty eight robots in it.

1540
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:50,300
Go what in the world now.

1541
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:51,420
That's what's happening.

1542
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:54,060
And what for what IP for what Marvel.

1543
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:55,580
No no no no nothing.

1544
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:57,940
Leonardo da Vinci is in it.

1545
01:30:57,980 --> 01:30:59,180
Does that count as IP.

1546
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:02,380
There is a man on a flying carpet.

1547
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:05,020
Apropos of nothing.

1548
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:05,860
Aladdin esque.

1549
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:06,460
Yeah.

1550
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:08,780
So yeah I don't give a shit.

1551
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:11,220
I don't need to I don't need to fall into your IP trap.

1552
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:17,860
I'll give them a lot of credit in the post show and the building out front a lot of good colored lighting.

1553
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:19,060
Yeah.

1554
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:19,860
Yeah.

1555
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:22,020
Oh and this building is a shape of a wheel.

1556
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:22,700
Uh huh.

1557
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:23,660
Yes.

1558
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:25,020
So that's fun.

1559
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:27,300
That was on purpose that they have stuck with.

1560
01:31:27,340 --> 01:31:33,540
There was the outdoor track which you do get in test track was there was a plan for something like that here.

1561
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:35,300
Where it goes outside.

1562
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:38,860
Well I think they were talking about building a second ride.

1563
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:47,700
The early blue sky stuff is interesting where it was like a much bigger atrium or like yeah yeah Martin's is really good.

1564
01:31:47,780 --> 01:31:48,060
Yeah.

1565
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:52,500
And he also was overall that I watched a ride through.

1566
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:57,460
Kind of a grainy ride through on YouTube and I was like I wish I found a better quality one.

1567
01:31:57,700 --> 01:32:06,380
Most of the Martin's vids is a recreation of riding this ride cutting together people's home videos and it is incredible.

1568
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:11,820
Like if we gave him all the footage he could probably reconstruct the JFK as he could answer.

1569
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:21,700
He is so good at constructing like every angle of a scene from like people's grainy super eight and VHS.

1570
01:32:21,740 --> 01:32:30,220
I found the I found home movies from the CIA with very clear plans and it's very clearly murder plans.

1571
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:33,460
George H.W. Bush standing right there clear as day.

1572
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:36,300
He was in Dallas that day.

1573
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:40,180
Yeah what's the other thing about world of motion.

1574
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:42,140
I mean just for my taste.

1575
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:42,380
Yeah.

1576
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:45,620
The first car accident the first traffic accident scene.

1577
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:50,620
Lot of good old timey nonsense ice truck a bus label Jitney.

1578
01:32:51,660 --> 01:32:59,860
Still a lot of Jitney is the old timey name for buses or trolleys sometimes taxi cabs just back in the day.

1579
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:07,660
And a lot of the small like Jersey shore towns that have been like vacation towns for 100 plus years still refer to like the Atlantic City.

1580
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:11,660
Jitney has been running for like since 1917 consistently.

1581
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:19,180
Is your old timeyness a product of growing up around there where it's more of it like the remnants of it are around more than California.

1582
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:31,820
Well yeah but then yeah there's there's a lot more remnants around and then also like the early Disney stuff all of the middle aged people referencing the past in these rides.

1583
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:34,660
Then just embed in my brain.

1584
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:39,100
You learn a lot about the 19 the early 19 years from all these up from this.

1585
01:33:39,140 --> 01:33:46,660
You know the bugs bunny doing Humphrey Bogart impressions or the Marx brothers just in the stands of a Mickey cartoon or something.

1586
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:50,260
And you hanging out and growing up with the other little rascals of course.

1587
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:51,740
Yes that's true.

1588
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:52,380
Yeah.

1589
01:33:54,900 --> 01:34:00,020
When you hear the phrase 1964 World's Fair you have a little cowlick that pops up.

1590
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:00,780
That's right.

1591
01:34:02,860 --> 01:34:05,780
I drank my polio medicine and now I get to go to the World's Fair.

1592
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:06,220
Three.

1593
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:13,100
Another thing about World of Motion haven't mentioned yet a very good icon.

1594
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,420
I think a top tier Epcot icon.

1595
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:25,020
Yeah yeah it's hard to rank them they're all good but that one has a dot in the very center as if and it's like making centrifugal force happen around.

1596
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:27,980
You know what they're doing the idea of motion.

1597
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:28,420
Yeah.

1598
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:32,020
This forward momentum within the little circle.

1599
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:33,260
That's another rank.

1600
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:34,380
I love them so much.

1601
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:37,500
That's another rank trying to rank the original Epcot icons.

1602
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:38,220
We could do that.

1603
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:38,940
You know that.

1604
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:39,740
Yeah.

1605
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:40,260
OK.

1606
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:41,620
Happy anniversary.

1607
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:43,100
Yeah yes.

1608
01:34:43,220 --> 01:35:02,780
And here in one more before we wrap it up maybe I think this is an iconic scene and one that I like which is the the invention of the wheel and this idea that there's people are pitching other wheels and the other wheels are hexagons and triangles before you get to the to the good old roundy.

1609
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:13,220
I love the idea that that's how that's what happened like they made it as far as we're going to have a cart we're going to have like a little room but a room you could move.

1610
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:16,060
And now what we need is a stick and a shape.

1611
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:18,140
So what should the shape be.

1612
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:26,660
And then people go off and say OK I think I the stakes are high they're going to execute me if they don't like this.

1613
01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:29,460
Yeah hex a hexagon.

1614
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:32,060
Now star maybe a star.

1615
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:33,620
Five points.

1616
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:34,380
All right.

1617
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:35,980
So I made my wooden star.

1618
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:38,740
Let me see if it moves my tiny room forward.

1619
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:39,180
It doesn't.

1620
01:35:39,660 --> 01:35:40,980
Maybe they'll just like the design of it.

1621
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:42,260
Maybe I can sell it anyway.

1622
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:42,780
All right.

1623
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:44,900
I'm late for my meeting with the king.

1624
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:47,140
Better get over.

1625
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:51,860
He's going to be going to poke both of my eyes out with his pointy hat.

1626
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:55,220
If he doesn't like my my moving shape.

1627
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:56,220
Yeah.

1628
01:35:57,740 --> 01:36:02,060
But then he went like really abstract with the shape and like designed a new shape.

1629
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:03,780
Oh yeah really bad.

1630
01:36:03,820 --> 01:36:04,060
Yeah.

1631
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:04,700
Yeah.

1632
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:07,300
Just like weird jagged there's still no name for it.

1633
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:12,780
I like that the three guys with the other shapes are like losers.

1634
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:18,300
They have like poor posture and they're nervous and like I don't know I'd like that on paper.

1635
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:21,180
And then the wheel guy is like hot.

1636
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:23,060
He's taller than them.

1637
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:25,180
He's confident he's swarthy.

1638
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:30,780
He's got just like a beard just like I find General Motors employees and executives.

1639
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:32,100
You look your best.

1640
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:33,180
Think your best.

1641
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:35,420
The cars you make perform their best.

1642
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:37,020
That's how it works.

1643
01:36:37,420 --> 01:36:38,740
There is a good idea.

1644
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:41,460
People with the best ideas are always hotter.

1645
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:44,700
That is just like being represented here.

1646
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:46,140
Just like Elon Musk.

1647
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:47,700
That's right.

1648
01:36:48,820 --> 01:36:49,500
That is correct.

1649
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:51,620
Say what you will about it.

1650
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:53,140
My man's a fucking stud.

1651
01:36:54,860 --> 01:36:55,900
We saw those pics.

1652
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:58,420
We all got those alfalfa cowlicks popping.

1653
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:00,100
Blowing.

1654
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:01,980
All right.

1655
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:03,420
I think we made it.

1656
01:37:03,460 --> 01:37:05,380
Or throw in any thoughts on this as we go out.

1657
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:07,220
But you survived podcast the ride.

1658
01:37:07,580 --> 01:37:08,620
World of motion.

1659
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:11,340
Happy 40th birthday Epcot Center.

1660
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:11,900
Thank you.

1661
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:13,220
And we say this with love.

1662
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:15,100
Thank you for all your boringness.

1663
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:17,700
Because people say keep Epcot weird or whatever.

1664
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:19,220
But I say keep it boring.

1665
01:37:19,460 --> 01:37:22,500
I get nervous with these roller coasters with.

1666
01:37:22,860 --> 01:37:23,460
I you know what.

1667
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:25,340
I like the poor line read.

1668
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:28,100
That feels like I agree.

1669
01:37:28,140 --> 01:37:30,500
I said it before that that's better that it's bad.

1670
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:31,260
But it's funny.

1671
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:31,620
Yeah.

1672
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:32,220
Yeah.

1673
01:37:32,620 --> 01:37:37,100
Well if we if we want Epcot to be at least a little boring in a fun way.

1674
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:41,780
And what better way than seeing an A-list actor get bored while saying his own

1675
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:42,020
line.

1676
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:42,420
Yes.

1677
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:46,980
Will that age into the next generation of thank the Finns.

1678
01:37:47,420 --> 01:37:48,940
Will that be caught like people.

1679
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:50,140
Whatever his quote is.

1680
01:37:50,220 --> 01:37:50,500
Yeah.

1681
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:56,460
Like his nervous hesitation before saying yeah the veggie veggie fruit fruit.

1682
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:56,980
Yeah.

1683
01:37:58,660 --> 01:37:59,460
I think so.

1684
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:02,020
I was going to say the last thought I had.

1685
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:04,300
Well do you want to do the plugs then I'll give my last my final.

1686
01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:05,220
Yeah let's do that.

1687
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:05,980
I'll throw these out.

1688
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:07,540
Hey so.

1689
01:38:07,660 --> 01:38:10,780
Oh thanks to engineer Jordan Katz here at forever dog.

1696
01:38:30,620 --> 01:38:34,180
Mike I was going to say you know Ellen they gave it.

1697
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:38,220
There was a there was a time we talked about many years ago in the universe of energy

1698
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:42,580
which started as a much drier ride and then they asked they added Bill Nye added Ellen

1699
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:44,700
to it because those are 90s icons.

1700
01:38:44,780 --> 01:38:50,500
But I mentioned him already but was there ever an idea let's throw Jay Leno on this

1701
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:51,500
thing to save it.

1702
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:53,340
Well he was an Epcot.

1703
01:38:53,380 --> 01:38:55,180
Don't forget there was that little thing in intervention.

1704
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:55,540
Yes.

1705
01:38:55,580 --> 01:39:00,820
Where you could be interviewed by him on this which imagine 10 year old me I'm like

1706
01:39:00,820 --> 01:39:05,300
biting my tie like watched it and learn the rhythms so that I wouldn't be any

1707
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:05,900
downtime.

1708
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:07,580
We got to do that as an episode too.

1709
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:09,780
Yeah we I'm sure you could find somebody's footage of it.

1710
01:39:10,540 --> 01:39:14,900
But but you know Martin Short or many people had multiple appearances in the park.

1711
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:22,060
So it really I mean you could definitely come up with a Leno sort of hosted world of

1712
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:26,180
motion where he talks about you know the invention of cars and that would have to be

1713
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:30,980
even longer because he could he would stop at every car and tell you like no this was

1714
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:33,540
you could do Seinfeld.

1715
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:35,180
You could put Seinfeld in there too.

1716
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:38,140
But you could have all the 90s car guys.

1717
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:39,260
All new clothes.

1718
01:39:39,860 --> 01:39:40,580
Yes.

1719
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:41,540
Modeling clothes.

1720
01:39:41,540 --> 01:39:45,700
If it was still around now there would be that would shut it down to put Seinfeld's new

1721
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:48,220
clothes on him that are in that photo shoot that just came out.

1722
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:53,020
I since Leno has come up I texted you guys right before we started recording.

1723
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:59,340
Bethy Squires who we've met before is a good writer and she posted about how learning

1724
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:04,700
about Jay Leno has been voicing a character in the Mickey Mouse cartoons for years.

1725
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:07,140
Oh you don't say I see it.

1726
01:40:07,180 --> 01:40:08,420
Yeah I'm excited.

1727
01:40:08,540 --> 01:40:10,460
Yeah we're the character.

1728
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:11,020
What do we know.

1729
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:13,540
I don't we will just have to find out.

1730
01:40:14,860 --> 01:40:15,940
Oh OK.

1731
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:19,060
Well we will know it's not weird or I don't think it's weird.

1732
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:20,780
I think we'll just literally have to find out.

1733
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:21,980
Oh no that was literal.

1734
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:22,260
Yeah.

1735
01:40:22,580 --> 01:40:22,820
All right.

1736
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:25,700
OK well we'll do that and get back to you.

1737
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:27,020
But for now the episode's over.

1738
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:28,820
So is over so long.

1739
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:30,620
Now I think it's a super Conan.

1740
01:40:35,540 --> 01:40:36,660
Dog.

1741
01:40:37,140 --> 01:40:42,460
