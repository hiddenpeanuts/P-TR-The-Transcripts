00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
FOREVER!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
DOG!

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:58,400
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, currently recording in a quadruple steel reinforced bunker to make

4
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,560
sure Deadpool doesn't get in. I'm Scott Gardner, Mike Carlson's hiding here with me. I'm here and

5
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:11,200
I'm scared. Scared of quips. Scared of snide remarks. Some of his ideas are a bit unorthodox.

6
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,720
They might not work for our show, Jason Sheridan. I'm so sorry, misunderstood the directive,

7
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,800
I left the door wide open so Deadpool could get in. No! Ding dong motherfuckers!

8
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,960
Wow, I hate to pitch so early in this episode, but what if they kept great movie right around,

9
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,280
but Deadpool was the one who hijacked the trams. Oh shit, yeah. They would have done that. Oh,

10
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,320
that's great. That's pretty good. And you get a current movie instead of the general idea

11
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,920
of 40s crime movies, apologies, Jason. Yeah, not that boring old crap, Jason. Yeah, not that old

12
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,560
black and white snooze fest stuff. You get a new guy. Replace the tour guides with Deadpool and

13
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,120
all the actor robots with Muppets. Well, now we're getting really wild here. Take a movie,

14
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,600
take one actor, keep him, the rest are Muppets. Now take that one actor, he's gone, now it's

15
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,240
Deadpool. Yeah! I'm sure that prompt is going to go so viral, I can't wait. Hey, well everybody,

16
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,160
happy Sunday as you're hearing this, I think. We're trying to turn this around pretty quickly.

17
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:26,880
Yesterday we all experienced Horizons, a Disney D23 experiences thing, and just as that event

18
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:34,480
itself was upgraded to prime time in a big arena, we are upgrading the D23 recap we've been tending

19
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,720
to do here to the main feed and getting it up a couple days early. So here's your main feed for

20
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:48,000
the week about all of the exciting stuff that is actively happening, that is happening,

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,080
barring any pandemics or end of our country, in theory, these things. Well, not all of the

22
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,560
announcements are for our country, so those will be fine. Unless just the general work,

23
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,240
anyone doing work in America is disrupted. But mostly shovels in the ground, anywhere from 20,

24
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:11,520
2400, 2026, restriction of the blanks. At the end, sometimes maybe not even those particular

25
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:19,440
dates. Yeah, okay, I mean, it's, all right, we've done, we've been through a number of these,

26
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:28,960
and I think we've seen cynicism levels ramp up to the point where there was a lot of, you know,

27
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,120
we did an episode where we bet on stuff and there was a lot of the betting, sometimes successful

28
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,040
betting was on no announcement of this. I polled the audience on, still calling it Twitter,

29
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,960
and there was a lot of like, all right, where do you think we're getting such and such? Here,

30
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:49,520
here, or not happening? The not happenings were huge. This is where everybody is calibrated,

31
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:56,720
and I will say, from last night's event, that was not nothing. It was not nothing. Definitely

32
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:04,320
was not nothing. If you stack up the list, and especially now you can go on the Disney Parks blog

33
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,560
and see kind of like thumbnails of a lot of it, and you're like, well, that's a lot. That is a lot

34
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,840
of stuff. So I want to say that right off the bat. And also, I will say, because the time frame,

35
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,160
yes, anything can happen. Supposedly, according to Disney people, all of the stuff they announced

36
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:28,640
yesterday will be, I think, completed in five years. That's what they're kind of guaranteeing.

37
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:35,760
But I don't think any date was said about the big one at the end. A lot of things did not have dates

38
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:46,160
on them. No dates, and also, no, this is where it's going. Yeah, some of that was missing. Well,

39
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,920
there was a lot of sleight of hand going on for various reasons. Sometimes, for instance,

40
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,040
I mean, we're going to talk about all this, but of course, the big thing is the Monsters Inc. land.

41
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,920
Where is it going? We don't know. There's two pieces of concept art, and one of them shows

42
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,360
something different than the other piece. It's arranged differently, the Monsters Inc. factory

43
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,520
where the door coaster is going. So I don't know if that's just like they thought those were two

44
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,200
splashy pieces of art. Because also, the Lion King land going in France, they said it's animated,

45
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:23,600
but the promo art shows the live action Lion King. But they did say animated. The most dull tan

46
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,400
characters ever conceived. Right, but the model does have animated Simba on Pride Rock. Oh,

47
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,600
so that, I think, is confirmed. We get animated Lion King at that land, which is good. So I don't

48
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,320
know if some of this is accidental sleight of hand, or it's like there's not saying the date yet,

49
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,960
because they don't want to commit to something very specific, and they get made fun of later.

50
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,720
They want to show cool art, and sometimes their art contradicts, but we're sort of, you know,

51
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,240
they say what we're finding out is not blue sky, but sometimes the art. You don't want the art to

52
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,560
be so like, well, don't do that, because that's not going to work for the space. Like you want it to

53
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,800
be visualized, however. But I guess what I'm saying is like, I will give them credit for saying that

54
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,760
five year thing. That is a pretty, they have not committed to things like that in the past. So

55
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,520
I guess there's a chance that in five years, Villain's Land is done, and like all this stuff

56
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,160
is done, and we're on to another round of stuff. I don't believe that. It seems hard to believe.

57
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,600
I was optimistic about all the stuff that I heard, and now this new thing you're telling me,

58
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,760
I don't believe for one second. It seems, saying it out loud, I don't know that I believe it. I'm

59
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,240
just saying that is what I believe. Unless they were saying in five years, everything will start,

60
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,880
and I misheard, because I have a couple different people have said this. I've seen people say it,

61
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,080
and I've talked to somebody about it, and that's, they're interpreting it like it will be done in

62
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,400
five years, but we'll see. Some of the timelines just feel so far out. Well, what do you mean?

63
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:55,120
Like in terms of like, and this is going to start construction next year, or 2026. I don't think

64
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,680
anything is starting this year. Like nothing is starting this year. Stuff will start like-

65
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,360
No, no, no. Or Lincoln is. Tropical America starts this year.

66
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,360
Okay. Well, that starts this year, and then the Walt robot stuff has already started.

67
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,520
But yeah, as far as there's like, they announced 2026 is when a lot of stuff,

68
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,280
or Coco was starting in Disneyland, I think. Like starting construction.

69
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,120
So therefore, and the way that they build, I think what you're saying about this five years,

70
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,040
I think they should have said, that should have been like, the number five should have been up on

71
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:32,720
the screens. If they meant that, that would have been a huge part, or like the finale would have

72
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,880
been, and this is all done in five years. I don't, I think if they meant it, they would have

73
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:43,040
underlined it more. I do not, if we're opening bets up again, and this is not a bet, this will be a-

74
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,720
I don't want to take you up on this bet. I'm not Disney. I'm not saying that. I'm just saying this

75
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,160
is what I've heard from multiple sources. Remember the Harry Anderson Disney decade.

76
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,840
I remember all of it. Like here's what's coming in 10 years.

77
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,560
I wake up in the middle of the night sweaty thinking about it.

78
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:03,280
And remember the D23 where they brought out Dick Van Dyke and said that there's American Poppins

79
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,800
right coming. Remember the Play Pavilion. I mean, that's the pall of cynicism that I think has to,

80
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,240
oh, but Eric, I was the one trying to say we got a bunch of good stuff, and look how quickly we've

81
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,720
all reigned on my parade. My new spectacular nighttime parade. I was trying to actually give

82
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,880
a little more optimism. I guess you were. I guess you were. But then I heard that five and it made

83
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:31,760
me mad. Yeah. I was trying to reign on your parade. I was trying out cynicism with this one

84
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:38,160
because the last few I went in so optimistic and I was just like, oh. Jason has been experimenting

85
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:44,400
with cynicism lately. Never encountered it before. It's really wild stuff. That's progress for you,

86
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:50,880
I guess. I feel like I was getting hit for being like this like wide-eyed optimist when I was

87
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,760
betting about D23. But then I went back to what I actually had said. And really all it was is that

88
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,520
I thought Tomorrowland was going to happen and it did not. But everything else I said was not anything

89
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,760
wild. So like my, I feel like I was actually being pretty reserved in my optimism for this.

90
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,720
But in contrast to you too, and in contrast to the last couple of these people were just like,

91
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,600
this fucking lunatic. Good luck, pal. Keep dreaming, buddy. And I was like, well,

92
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,600
maybe we'll get a new Tomorrowland. And people were like, shut the fuck up.

93
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,640
You don't know what you're talking about. I did kind of. I didn't say that in there,

94
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,680
but I think, yes, some people felt it. Now, I don't want to do this whole episode through

95
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:35,040
the prism of the betting that we did, but if you're only on main feed and you're on second gate,

96
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,760
then you should know the last week on the second gate, which is our Patreon, we did an episode

97
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,120
where we made bets about what these announcements would be at this panel. And assuredly this is

98
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,640
going to come up through the episode and we'll do a tally and we'll figure out who won the night.

99
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,840
If you want to check that out, that's at patreon.com slash podcast, the ride. But we'll explain what

100
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:02,800
our bets were and refer to them as we go. But if we're sort of going in order of how we experience

101
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,800
this thing, I feel like a brief nod needs to be given to the high difficulty of watching it.

102
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:15,120
Oh, yeah. When in the past, Disney has just provided a stream and then we set up all this

103
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,120
stuff. We're going to do a couple of episodes based on it. And then it became, huh, okay,

104
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,600
something for the cast members. And then it's going to wait, is it going to be on Fortnite?

105
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,840
No, only some of it is going to be on Fortnite. How do we do Fortnite? Jason says he can do

106
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:41,920
Fortnite. I have a Fortnite login and I forgot about the Apple Epic Games feud where Fortnite

107
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:49,360
is not in the app store. So now you have to download either Xbox Live or download Amazon Luna

108
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:56,960
and you kind of have to. The hell is Amazon Luna? It's like it's a gaming platform. Some of it is

109
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:05,120
free with a Prime membership. So you literally add it, like do the thing where you add a website

110
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:12,240
to your home page, which makes or add it to your home screen on an iPad. That makes an app launcher

111
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,680
and from there you can get into Fortnite. So it's within, it's an app within an app. It's an app

112
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:25,120
with it. There's like three or four ways to like load Fortnite without the Fortnite app. Were you

113
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,080
playing Fortnite on Luna? What were you playing it on? I have played, I have it on my Switch.

114
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,120
I was playing it on the Switch, but I don't have the online Switch service. You don't have a Switch?

115
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,280
Oh, you don't? Okay, I see. I was going to say, you found a Switch that doesn't have the online

116
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:44,240
ability? No, no, I just canceled it after the three months. He does dial up Switch. Yeah.

117
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,520
He found a third party Switch on the black market that doesn't have online play. It says Game Boy

118
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,200
Advance on it. I don't quite understand that. Oh, you're playing Fortnite on Game Boy Advance.

119
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,520
Yeah. Oh, okay. Now I see what's happening. Yeah, I really enjoyed watching the panel that way and

120
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:07,200
I thought the little dots that comprise Josh tomorrow were quite handsome. Yeah, eight handsome

121
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,560
pixels. No, I was going back and forth between two YouTube, I think we all were, multiple YouTube

122
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,080
live streams. The TikTok live stream was pretty consistent. Yeah, I was doing that one and then I

123
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,320
was doing one where there was like a streamer watching it along and it had a pretty decent

124
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,280
stream. And then I would just kind of get, oh, oh, ah, like I would get reactions from this person

125
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,080
and then they would get confused. They'd think they were about to announce something like really

126
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,480
cool and then they go, oh, whoa, what, what? And then it would be nothing. It would just be like

127
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,080
they played a little like part of the Horizons theme or they played like Kitchen Cabaret. Like

128
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,680
they played some reference to some old, oh, whoa, what are we getting? What are we getting? And

129
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,120
then it would be nothing. And then they'd just like be quiet for there. Well, I kind of did that

130
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,680
when the stream got choppy at one point because I didn't, I couldn't tell it was Billy Crystal

131
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:59,280
walking out. I was like, is that one of the songwriters? One of the songwriters? One of the

132
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:07,120
songwriters? Was it Randy Newman, the songwriter? No, no. Who was the one who did like the D23 in

133
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,840
Japan where everyone was sobbing? Ellen Menken? Ellen Menken? Yeah, I was like, is that Menken?

134
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,680
I can't make it out. One of the songwriters? Oh, so you didn't know it was Monsters Inc.? Okay,

135
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,040
I see. I couldn't tell it was Monsters Inc. And I was like, oh, is he bringing out?

136
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,240
Right, right. Yeah. He was a white haired man. Yes. I'd recognize Billy Crystal from a mile away.

137
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,200
Why, it's Mr. Saturday Night himself. That's how I recognize it. We've all been primed to know what

138
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,520
he would look like older because we all saw him, what he would look like older when he was younger.

139
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:46,240
Right. We all know Mr. Saturday Night so well. I mostly know him now as the GIF with the tissue

140
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:53,840
box that very cruel people on Twitter like tweet, Rando's tweet if someone's complaining about

141
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,840
like injustice in the world. People use Billy Crystal holding a tissue? People use the Billy

142
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:05,200
Crystal from, I think it's when Harry met Sally and he has a really like droll look on it.

143
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,160
It's like. All right. Don't be sending me any Billy Crystal. This sounds like the cruelest

144
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,440
punishment. You're getting one. If I express disappointment about these announcements and I

145
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,760
get in and I see any Billy Crystals in our feed, we say blocked forever. Yeah. I guess I have to

146
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,440
ultimately think so Cal Hansen Parks, thank you for your stamina for holding the phone up. Oh,

147
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:34,560
I know. Through a very long presentation. Yeah. This went so, so long. And some of what added to

148
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,880
the length I feel like deserves a little bit of time, which is that if you tuned in at 7 PM,

149
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,480
the announced start time and you hooked up to some guy's phone as did like 10,000 people,

150
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,840
imagine being one of the three people streaming and then you start realizing you got 10,000 people

151
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:59,680
watching what you're filming. Yeah. Again, I'm not sure. What was the Disney rationale? Why would

152
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:06,720
they not do it? You had to log in with a Disney VPN and then your stream was watermarked with

153
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,360
your name. If you're an employee, if you're an employee, put your name on it. What is the

154
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,120
why? What is the reason here? No one knows for sure. The rationale people have made online is

155
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,880
that this is the first time they've had two separate tickets for D23, one for the actual

156
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,480
convention center stuff and then one for the Honda center stuff. So people are acting like,

157
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,440
or acting like they're thinking that Disney is trying to make this thing such a spectacle that

158
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,920
you need to be there in person and you need to keep paying us an extra 100, 200, whatever it is,

159
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:44,560
$300 to go do it. That's the only thing anyone can think makes sense. And that is the only thing I

160
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,880
can think that makes sense. And then they can put it up like a, well, other than, yeah, Jason was

161
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,920
saying like, maybe I have to pay musicians if it's streamed or something. Oh yeah. Union musicians.

162
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,080
There's exactly why. I don't think so. I don't know. There was an orchestra here.

163
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,120
In terms of spectacle, there was definitely spectacle. Yeah. So this was a pretty elevated,

164
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,720
it felt like more than an upfronts, you know? Right. Yes, for sure. They made it very theatrical.

165
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,720
If you were there, it would make sense that they are in a hockey arena. Sure. That said,

166
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:25,520
did anyone want that? Do you go and you're like, oh, and I also get a musical salute to all of my

167
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:31,120
favorite Disney moments? Or because I feel like so much of the audience watching this, at least

168
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,800
ourselves, and then people we know who are writers and journalists and stuff are just like, please

169
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,800
tell me some names. Tell me some things. I have articles due. I got deadlines to meet. Why am I

170
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:49,840
sitting through? Why am I watching Shaboosie? I was told from people in the room that everyone

171
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:58,960
liked it a lot and it was fun to be there. So for some people it was fun. I think if we wanted to,

172
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,800
and we're not going to do this, is go through the whole performance and I think we could all cut out,

173
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,240
or the three of us at least, cut out half the music and still be like, okay. Because some of

174
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,760
the music felt right where it's like, oh, they're playing the Horizons theme. It's an orchestra.

175
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,560
You're like, oh, this is nice. When you get to hear the Horizons theme and the Honda Center

176
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:23,280
with an orchestra, and then it's like, oh, we're going to do like a song from a Lion King or

177
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,360
something. And you're like, I've heard this song. You're going to hear the Lion King. There were

178
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,360
some things that felt more appropriate to me or something that was like, oh my God, I'll never

179
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:38,080
hear this song in a venue like this. It has never occurred to me to want to hear

180
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:44,560
Trust In Me, the Jungle Book Ka song covered by Rita Ora.

181
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,600
Seems like a big get for this. Come on, Rita. That seems ... I mean, there was some surprise

182
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,280
about music that we liked, I think, but still it was confusing why they were there.

183
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,760
I definitely had no sense there would be this much music, which I guess is good if you're in

184
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,880
person. But yeah, if you are the type of person who is just like, please tell me some details,

185
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,400
tell me some names of rides, tell me some locations of rides.

186
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:17,920
In terms of being there, I did get a message from Neil from the band Cuckoo and Happy Place

187
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:24,800
Emporium, vintage shirt collector Neil. He was like, you can get drunk at this present.

188
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,680
Oh, we were wondering.

189
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,960
There are sessions open.

190
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,680
Great. Yeah, so maybe people were drunk, I guess. Everyone was drunk there.

191
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,320
I will also say to you both, there's a meeting. You could have a drink and not be drunk.

192
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,240
What? What do you mean?

193
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,000
Because a happy medium could be reached. So you could be blackout. You could be there and

194
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,840
then forget it all because you went too far. That was what we were asking the last time.

195
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,680
Can you get hammered?

196
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:57,040
Yeah, yeah. I wanted to be front row hammered, hammered looking at Josh

197
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,480
and then heckling him during the show. You call that an announcement, pal?

198
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,600
Where's Deadpool?

199
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,920
He's coming up later.

200
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,440
You're going to get so much of him.

201
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,760
So I don't know. Some of the music I liked, but also, yeah, I'm watching on a weird stream

202
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,160
and doing three things at once. So I'm like, all right, when's the announcement coming?

203
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,080
One or more things. I don't know if they made the calculation that the audience there wouldn't

204
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,000
want more hyper specific details about things. It almost felt like they were like, all right,

205
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
here's two pictures. You've heard it. Now we're on into a song. And I don't know if they were like,

206
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,040
we don't want them to get bored or upset. But you're like, I think this is the room

207
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,520
where they want you to talk about the paint that you're going to use to paint these rides.

208
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,760
That feels like the audience. I could be wrong, but I'd almost felt like they were partly

209
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,800
hesitant because they didn't want to commit to certain things or reveal that they're destroying

210
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,960
a beloved ride. And then another half, I felt like they were like, well, this show's got to

211
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,040
keep moving and we got to get to a song. That's what all these people are here for, a song.

212
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,800
You're like, I don't think that's right either.

213
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:08,080
I'm not sure. How do you calculate? I guess if you're at, I don't know, D23 is like broad

214
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,240
Disney fans. So maybe a big orchestral presentation. But I also feel like the same people

215
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,600
would want a little more in terms of minute detail.

216
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,400
A couple of the segments they did a little more, but a lot of it was like, here it is. Take five

217
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,560
seconds to look at this picture. Cause now we're onto a song. We're onto five more songs.

218
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:35,920
Shockingly fast moving through stuff that is like what made me, like, yeah. I would say precisely

219
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:42,320
two things in it that had me just like grinning like an idiot. And none of it was meditated on

220
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,960
for too long. I'll say what those were as we go. But let's, let's give a little time to what

221
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:58,320
happened if you tuned in at 7 PM, which is the opening act. And the opening act turned out to be

222
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:06,720
the band from the Mad Tea Party, which was this limited time California adventure, Alice in Wonderland,

223
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:14,160
not rave necessarily, dance party type musical celebration.

224
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,160
It's over in the Hollywood land area of California adventure. And it felt like

225
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,640
the year previous, it was the Tron or years previous electronic electronica. They're like

226
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,600
G rated rave. And then I feel like some of the spirit of it carried over into like a very

227
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,360
like, what would you call it? I guess Johnny Depp era Alice in Wonderland aesthetic,

228
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:43,840
which ended up being mostly covers of popular songs from 25 years or later.

229
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:51,440
And then a DJ would do like a G rated rave, DJ White Rabbit would do a G rated kind of rave

230
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,280
over in that area. But this is the, this was the band from the, from those music festivities. And

231
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,400
this is something we talked about on the Patreon, patreon.com slash podcast, the red a couple years

232
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:10,400
ago. And I was surprised to be confronted by it on this big platform to suddenly be have the Mad Tea

233
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,320
Party to talk about. And boy, did it give us all a lot to talk about before the panel itself kicked

234
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:23,520
in. Yes. A couple things happened. One, Jason said, is this the Mad Tea Party band? Mike responded,

235
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,120
I don't think so. They're not the right vibe for this event. And I was really confused by that

236
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,160
response because I'm looking at it and I'm like, wait, so we're saying it's a different band that

237
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:40,320
has Alice in the Mad Hatter in it. There's another band. And then you explained. I was first of

238
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,000
all, I was doing three things at once. I'm watching my daughter. I'm mostly listening,

239
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,600
but I'm also on at this point or whatever stream I was watching was far away. I could not see the

240
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:56,560
band. So I'm kind of listening to the background. That comment was a joke. Obviously the vibe is

241
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,520
right for the Alice band to open at D23. I didn't know if you were criticizing the music

242
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,120
you were hearing or if you were saying that the Alice band is not the right vibe. It wasn't even

243
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,680
that I should have if to punch up the joke, I would have been like that band is too hardcore

244
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,560
for this audience. They're too aggressive. They want more gentle rock bands. It would rock these

245
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:23,840
stodgy journalists too far out of their chairs. Right. Yes, exactly. But yeah, so I was hearing

246
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,120
it. And also I know I think part of it was that they were doing a mashup that I'd never heard

247
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,000
before. So I was like, well, this isn't them. This isn't the song. This is what I like about

248
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,040
you and Happy. Happy by Pharrell. Now, what'd you think of it? Not knowing what band you're as a

249
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:44,640
blind taste test. What'd you think of the mashup? I like Happy because it's playing in Universal

250
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,120
Studios a lot. So I do like it. I don't listen to, I don't choose to listen to it ever, but I like

251
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,480
it when I hear it. What I like about you, I think is one of the like 30 songs I never need to hear

252
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,080
again in my life. Yeah, we're pretty covered on that. Also a very theme parky, but I felt like

253
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:04,960
that's in Knott's Berry Farm ads. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So maybe that's part of it. They're playing what

254
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,800
I like about you. And I was like, oh, do I need to hear what I like about you ever again? Wow.

255
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:15,440
Do you hear this? Because if we, if I didn't say properly the battle lines of the argument about

256
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,280
Mad Tea Party band, this is something that at least in the Patreon episode, Mike loved was trying to

257
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:27,840
sell me on and I never understood or got on board. Jason feels more that you round up to Mike's

258
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,720
there with me in the shit. We were in the pit. We were hanging out. I used to say all that I go,

259
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,920
you know, rough in the pit. Did you guys get injured? You guys must have gotten a lot of

260
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:43,200
elbows. Roundhouse kicked a nine year old when I got spooked. You can't approach me from the sides

261
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,280
or behind him like a horse. He deserved it is what I said at the time. I didn't know. It's just

262
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:55,600
unconscious. But I, yeah, around six or seven or eight, when we would be hanging out at the park in

263
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,160
the old days, I would say, you know, we could do tonight. We get mad. Yeah. And sometimes we would

264
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,320
and I get a little grin on my face and then we would walk over there for 30 minutes, 45 minutes.

265
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:10,320
You look at the wait times. Everything's bad. Everything's bad. You walk over to the

266
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,240
back lot area, whatever they call it. And you get mad. Yeah. You hear Alice and well,

267
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,920
I do think I would have gotten mad if I'd ever joined you for this. This is what we enjoyed.

268
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,080
This was the cell that you were doing. And I saw videos then, but now I'm watching them

269
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:32,800
play the Honda Center. And so I, I, I'm coming out a little testy, just reminding everybody. So

270
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,840
remember, this is the thing that Mike was for 90 minutes was trying to tell me how great this was.

271
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:44,480
Then it goes on and they do covers of separate ways and call me. And, and I was made for loving

272
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:51,280
you by kiss. If I heard them do that before, that's new. They, they've been learning new songs.

273
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,000
Well, this was your argument. When I was kind of having some qualms about the quality,

274
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,200
you said, well, the set list is different. I said, no, in the old day, in the old days,

275
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,440
they never would have done call me. They might've done call me. They've sold out.

276
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,720
Never would they have done a call me. They would have been too busy doing rapture. Never would

277
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,120
they have done a call. Right. They've changed it up a lot. Um, but they had been at knots for the

278
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,640
last couple of years, or at least for a year. I don't know if they've been there the last year

279
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,120
or two, but what are they called there? We've said this five times on the show and I can never

280
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,280
remember what it is. Cause once they're not in the office, you know, I just can't remember the name.

281
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,560
You can't place them. Yeah. Yeah. Good. I don't want to insult them, but um,

282
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:37,600
they finished a song and then they said, uh, all right, we just got a couple more songs.

283
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,720
And again, the panel is late. They said 7 PM now it's 7 20 and we're watching the party band

284
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,720
in your feed. You heard a woman like groan very loudly. Yeah. And she said, we got a couple more

285
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:57,840
songs like a really like pained noise. They made, uh, multiple people were messaging me,

286
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,360
but I said, man, like, cause a lot of people were watching on bad streams and people were

287
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:07,760
texting me about it. Well, we w and we were all texting with Griffin Newman. And at some point

288
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:14,480
deep into their set, we lost Griffin. He officially said, Mike, I do not like this. You were again,

289
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,960
arguing set list and all things. This is not their, uh, this is not their venue. This is not

290
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,000
their venue text in which I like to see them. I like to see them at Disney's California venture

291
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,400
with all the weird furniture and the two big guys playing tweedle D and tweedle dumb with the

292
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,360
accents. Sure. Cause they didn't just fall out of a coconut tree. They exist in the context of all

293
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:42,720
that's come before. And that's never been more true than context. Sometimes it's true. Maybe

294
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,600
all the time. It's true. I think it's always true. Uh, yeah, yeah. Well, no. And I said, well,

295
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,640
of course, rock bands famously don't really work in the middle of arenas. That's not never really

296
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,880
where they shine. Uh, and then, so you're making this argument Griffin is being firm about, and

297
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,400
then I get a text from another person who will go unnamed for our purposes, who was in the room

298
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:11,840
and texted me and said, why does Mike like this? That you are, this was, this was started as a night

299
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,160
of tragedy for Mike. I got hammered all night in different ways and not the good hammered.

300
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:21,360
Not the hammer you could get in the Honda center. I got hammered all night. I did get one, uh,

301
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,760
message of encouragement from someone. Well, I guess maybe I'm revealing who it is, but he said,

302
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:32,160
as a person in a cover band, uh, I approve of this. Okay. So it was a gentleman who was showing

303
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,960
support for me. Well, this is what you just like cover bands. This is what it boils down to. It is.

304
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,840
Yeah. And you get a lot of like, I feel like it's this, these are just, this is just a difference

305
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:48,240
between you and I, you hear a song being played on instruments in front of you and you go, yeah,

306
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,080
it's not quite enough for me. Right. If it's a very good cover than wonderful, but you're in

307
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:01,120
no matter what does not matter. I like, I, the music moves me so much. It can be like less good

308
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,200
quality music. So I'm so sensitive. I'm so hypersensitive to music. He's music sensitive.

309
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,720
My brain is so music sensitive. It's kind of like superpower. Yes. So like you can put,

310
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:19,280
except for a couple songs, like what I like about you. And then maybe like those three wedding songs

311
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:25,360
we talk about all the time, Bon Jovi or whatever. Uh, yeah, I can, you can, a band can come in here

312
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,640
right now and I will just like, like Jason, when he smells a pie on a window sill, I will float

313
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,920
toward the cover band. Uh, yeah, I was going to say Mike's music sensitive and I'm at the corner,

314
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,880
uh, in the corner picking up the cool down order. It's like,

315
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:48,720
that's how you guys manage a party. Yeah. But everyone seeing them there makes me upset because

316
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,080
that's not how they should be viewed. You weren't there by thousands of people with Jason and I,

317
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,320
they didn't give them all of their extra stuff that makes the man tea party. It was like your

318
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:05,840
rec room, your rumpus room. You could sit in a big plastic chair and view the stage from there.

319
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,360
And that makes it a different viewing experience than this. They've taken them completely out.

320
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,840
They're on a little stage there, no dressing. Where were Tweedledee and Tweedledum? They weren't

321
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,560
there. So I'm just saying everybody was upset. And what did they do? What did they add to,

322
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,960
how are they going to save this for me? They had the tallest shoes. They were so big. They found

323
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,080
the biggest men I've ever seen. They were big boys. We love our big boy. It was beautiful boys.

324
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:35,280
Big boy season at Mad Tea Party, these two guys playing Tweedledee and Tweedledum would walk around

325
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:40,960
and kind of like lightly hassle people. And it was interesting and kind of scary, but it added to the

326
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,320
atmosphere of it. So if, oh, so I would understand it if I was in a different type of chair and a

327
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:53,040
big man was harassing me. That would be your own home. And if there was like six foot tall

328
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,080
playing clubs, like you haven't lived since you had a, you haven't lived until you had a

329
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:05,840
pre-made cocktail next to a six foot tall jack of clubs and a large man is bothering you.

330
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,880
That's right. Jason gets it. He was there. He lived it. How do they bother? What's an example

331
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,280
of their bothering? Hey, mate. Hello. Yeah, they'd be like, hey, mate, all the way, mate. All right,

332
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:20,640
that's all they said. Like, I feel like there's some cockney voices. Yeah, no, I think they were

333
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,320
like legit. I don't even think they were doing voices. Yeah, no, they weren't. So I'm the heaviest

334
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,880
goons you've ever seen to play Tweedledee and Tweedledum. I'm trying. I'm trying to put myself

335
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:36,000
there. Okay. Alice is dressed like Moulin Rouge, the movie from 24 years ago. The Mad Hatter's hat

336
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
is taller than most hats. Yeah. And I'm listening. I hear them singing, wake me up and wake me up.

337
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:49,920
Can't wake up. And then, and now I may get out of my way, mate. You're a piece of crud on my shoe,

338
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,880
mate. Well, you're right. I do get it. Like a Vinnie Jones type. Yeah. Yeah, Vinnie Jones type.

339
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,680
And then they switch into Shake It Off, which was still pretty new at the time. It was only four

340
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,680
years old. And all the kids were jumping up and down. You know that thing where kids don't quite

341
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:10,720
know how to dance? So they just jump up and down because they're so excited. And you've, you're

342
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,560
halfway through like a neon pink drink and there's like a little alcohol in it. But maybe you had a

343
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,280
better drink of Carthe an hour prior. So it's like, just like kind of act like helping to keep the

344
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:27,440
buzz going. Yeah. I have to rope in my, one of my favorite places to drink in order to make this

345
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,800
work. And let's not forget you're in your late twenties. Everything is possible now. You're never

346
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:38,400
going to die. You're never going to die. That's the most important part of the mad tea party is

347
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,920
that you're in your twenties when you're seeing them. So far, this thing only made me mad for the

348
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:51,440
first time. It's made me sad. Why? What? What do you mean? I don't know. I'll look, you could put,

349
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,520
I'll just listen back to that later today. I don't know what could be wrong with it. Maybe something

350
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:02,880
about what you might, what you said might make you a little sad. No, I'm just saying that's part of

351
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:09,360
it. Part of it is being in your twenties. Well, look, things are still possible now that we are

352
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,720
in our. That's true. What are you again, Mike? Whatever it is, whatever the number is, I don't

353
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:22,160
know. Does this mean mad tea party potentially could come back somewhere? They didn't say it.

354
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:28,640
They didn't say it. They didn't say it. Honestly, the first part of the D23 panel was like fan

355
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:35,040
service. Like, but, but not in a, I don't mean that in a shitty way. I mean like, oh, it's the

356
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:40,480
Soren video recreation. Oh, you mean the intro stuff. You mean the 25 minute intro where they

357
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,600
didn't get to an announcement. Oh, please, Michael, it was at least 45. Yeah, what a bunch of

358
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,960
bullshit. Anyway, let's do more mad tea party material. Let's give the people what they want

359
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:59,520
right at the top. No, I, yeah, hey, so I think as far as like turning this into a little Oscars,

360
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,520
first of all, and we didn't know it at the beginning, but the Billy Crystal's in the house,

361
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:11,200
and then that they, I mean, a cold open that's like a parody or a recreation of Soren with the

362
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:17,520
man himself, Patty Warbucks, amazing. That was great. I really enjoyed that. And I think they,

363
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:24,720
as someone who has analyzed that video and thought about it a lot, I'm like the edits are the same.

364
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,200
They could have done this a lot crudder, and it could have been knocked out by a team that

365
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,320
didn't have love for the original thing, but it was like, it was pretty pitch perfect. I'm

366
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,200
guessing they did it because whenever they had that other Soren video a couple of months ago

367
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,360
with Patrick Warb, they probably all did it at the same time, I'm guessing. He looked very similar,

368
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:48,080
yeah. Yeah, kind of PR call, which what a clever little thing that they got a couple pieces of

369
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:54,160
content out of it. And then I think the big surprise, I thought when they aren't cutting to

370
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,800
the guy with these little beauties and then we're going to cut to the mouse, I thought that was

371
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,840
going to be a cameo from Eiger or Demaro or somebody. I thought that's what they were building

372
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:10,000
too. But I was not disappointed. If anything, it was maybe better to realize it was the same guy

373
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,520
from the video the first time around. I don't know who that actor is. I don't know if he works

374
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,480
there and thus it was easy to grab him again, or if they tracked down this person again just for that.

375
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,240
But it was nice to see him. That was really fun, yeah. I feel like the audience really popped for

376
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,160
that. They were pretty excited. Yeah, well they were all hammered, so of course they're going to

377
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,280
pop. They were hammered and they were riled up from rock and roll. You got to think about,

378
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,200
if you were there, besides the person who texted me, why does Mike like this? Everybody, besides

379
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,800
that cynic, everybody else is so amped. Honestly, they were probably laughing more because of the

380
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,480
rock and roll than because of the comedy content. Well the rock and roll and the one and a half

381
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,480
ballast point IPAs in them, you know? Yeah, you're describing precisely what I can drink in a night

382
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:02,560
now safely. The end. I can drink a half. It's good. I like the session ones for many years

383
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:07,360
because they're a lot weaker. What do you think about the grapefruit? I still don't give a shit

384
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:12,560
about the grapefruit. Wow, the bald guy is back. Jason still doesn't give a shit about the grapefruit.

385
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,640
Oh and now I've bought enough medications where they're like you can do whatever you want,

386
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,400
don't eat grapefruit on this. Like what? Don't eat grapefruit apparently interacts with a lot

387
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,520
of medications. It's a pretty common thing. Birth control I believe. Yes, yeah. All right, Jason,

388
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:33,040
don't get pregnant. Stay away from the grapefruit. Yeah. Keep not giving a shit. Be careful. But then

389
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:39,600
the real big opener live is that we realize there is an orchestra there and then a lot of buildup

390
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:48,800
to a piano man center stage. Will it be Elton John? Will it be Josh Groban? No, better, way better.

391
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:59,040
John Stamos. A show kickoff by Stamos in a leather jacket reminiscent of perhaps even literally the

392
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:06,640
same one he wore when Jesse and the Rippers blew the turrets off of Cinderella Castle in the Full

393
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,360
House episode many years ago. They are, at this point in the show I'm like well they're going for

394
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:18,400
us having just done a big Full House episode and wore Burton and like. And a tea party.

395
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:25,760
And mad tea party and they're going for some of us with that. So that was fun. It was nice to see

396
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,920
Stamos get to perform for a big crowd without having to sit through Mike Love implying that

397
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:39,040
he fucked his mom. It was a nice, felt like a nice break for him. And then he seemed like

398
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:45,760
sincerely emotional about being there. I mean his fandom is very clear. He got some jokes off about

399
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:52,000
owning the sign that used to be on Harbor Boulevard. He got some jokes about Disney

400
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,080
adults you know. There were a lot of zingers tonight. There were zingers. Between Stamos

401
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:05,360
and Deadpool there was a lot of zingers. I agree. I will say, generally, I will be the first to

402
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:11,040
groan about the comedy content of something. I did not do a lot of groaning. No, I didn't either.

403
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:16,160
I actually think that whoever was writing this, if it was individually, if it was different groups

404
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:22,160
for the different bits or one team for all of it, I thought like it was, you know, nothing I thought

405
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:31,280
was corny, cringy, like inside jokes enough. And like for them a little bit biting at times,

406
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:39,280
especially with Deadpool. But I actually did like it comedically. Now do I think that it needed two

407
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:47,680
separate comedy song and dance numbers from, okay, what, Darren Criss, Skylar Astin?

408
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,160
Yeah, I don't know. That felt like, I don't know, that all was fine. But I think, Mike,

409
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,880
you were saying it felt a little redundant. Like, okay, we're now at our like third opener.

410
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,400
Right. I was like, Stamos, oh, he's okay. He's opening show the song. Yeah, I guess. And now

411
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,560
we're here with the announcements. And it's like, no, there's another host of the show? Like,

412
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,320
okay, there's another musical bit. Yes. That's where it started to feel like that's when I said

413
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,360
there's going to be 20 songs to every one announcement for every one announcement. And

414
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:20,400
I bet you wish you would put money on that. I certainly do. That is the most true statement

415
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:26,800
of the evening. Yes. So yeah, no, it was at that point, I was like, that point, I was worried.

416
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,920
Yeah. Because I went, oh shit, they don't have anything to say. Yeah, nothing. I started getting

417
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:38,160
fearful at that point because I go, they've burned 15 to 20 minutes on the main part of this

418
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,600
presentation with just songs, Stamos and these two guys. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know why I thought

419
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:50,080
this was going to be an hour or maybe 90 minutes. Me too. They said it was going to be 90 minutes,

420
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:56,640
I think. The runtime was just shy, I think, of three hours. Yeah. Yeah. But they had listed it,

421
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:02,240
I think, as 90 minutes on the schedule. Okay. Yeah. I was pretty exhausted by the end. I felt

422
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,960
worn out the way I do if you're actually sitting and watching an entire Oscar telecast. I was

423
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:14,320
starting to fall asleep, then they did the big final announcement and I woke up and then I could

424
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:21,360
not get to sleep. I slept weird last night. Well, look, I don't want to spoil. I was rammy. I don't

425
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:25,600
want to spoil. Well, I understand why you'd be rammy because you knew you were getting something

426
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:30,320
big due to that announcement, but I'll hold it to the end. Yeah. But then we start getting stuff.

427
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:37,200
Let's talk about stuff that we get. I mean, Avatar right away, right? And here we start

428
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:43,200
getting into our bets because mine ended up correct on this one, that it is Avatar for DCA

429
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:50,240
with no area named more specifically than that. Right. And we get some concept art.

430
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:57,440
I'm relieved to hear DCA, relieved that they didn't say where yet and we're still left to wonder.

431
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:03,520
But I guess before that speculation, this art looks great. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

432
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:11,040
Because it is not the animal kingdom Pandora. We're in a whole different biome. This has been

433
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:17,360
a great couple of days for those of us who are blue-pilled because you get all this stuff and

434
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:24,400
then the day before part three is called Fire and Ash. Yeah. I think maybe some people had

435
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:30,960
grown fond of the seed bearer. But if anything, years ago, before I'd made my switch and you were

436
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,840
kind of carrying the Avatar torch, Mike, I heard the seed bearer and I'm like, well, this seems like

437
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:44,800
a tedious franchise to me. And now years later, we arrive at Fire and Ash. Yeah. What a fucking

438
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,880
metal motorhead kind of name. This is rules. This is great. I can't wait for Fire and Ash.

439
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:57,120
Yeah. Number two is water. Number three is fire. Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. The every element. We're

440
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,840
hitting them all. They're not doing like floating mountains in this, but it's because it's more

441
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:06,320
water-based. It's more like land water-based, but they have this like, I don't even know how to

442
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:12,640
describe it. It's like half circle sort of pattern that the rocks have taken, like the shape,

443
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,320
this kind of crazy. You see something like that in the movie. I don't know how you describe it.

444
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:23,280
Yeah. It's like, I don't know. Like a crescent moon almost. Yeah. Sort of on its side and pointed up

445
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,080
and then it kind of shrinks in size as it goes. That's a bad way to describe it, but it's very

446
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:33,120
cool looking and doesn't, I don't immediately go, ah, they're not building the mountains.

447
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,160
Because that would be my concern if they're like, oh, we're not doing the mountains. I go, well,

448
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:41,680
that's kind of the big part of it. Also, I think there are still maybe a couple floating mountains.

449
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,960
Oh, you think so? Oh, maybe I missed it. Concept art seems to be, if you look closely,

450
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,520
it's just not like the main deal of it is the floating mountains, but I think we got a couple

451
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:55,280
little spots of floating mountain. Wow. Yeah. So that just, the idea that we'll get to go to that

452
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:02,640
whenever we want, as long as we're still living in California, that's awesome. Yes. And the ride is

453
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,600
boat ride. They showed a little bit of it before, but it looks like Shanghai pirates. That's what

454
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:12,320
people are saying. It really reminds me of, just because I know it better than, I don't,

455
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,840
I'm not too familiar with the outside of the Shanghai vehicle, but I'm looking at it like,

456
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,720
this looks very like Jurassic Park, the ride. Oh, yeah, maybe. Big old kind of,

457
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:28,560
yeah, not a little calm Disney boat ride, but a big, something equipped for adventure. Yeah.

458
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:35,120
And concept art is cool. When it gets dark, the darkness that all of those creepy,

459
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:42,720
fanged creatures crawling around, I, you know, it's still, it's so hard to parse really what,

460
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:49,200
what ride system is exactly, but it implies to me that it's indoor, outdoor, both. Yes,

461
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,240
because they show it in the like overview of the land art. Yeah. Yeah. So it looks like that goes

462
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:00,400
outdoors at a point. Love that. That's really cool. You think maybe just one ride at this rate? They

463
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,440
didn't say, I don't know. I heard someone say they think maybe one smaller ride, but I don't know.

464
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,800
I'm not sure. You can't tell from there. Somebody said Satuli canteen, some kind of it, some version

465
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,280
of it. Cause in the, like the bottom right, it looks like there's maybe at least something like

466
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:21,200
that resembling the quick service in Florida, which is good. And we still, we still don't know

467
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,560
where. I'll say this. I'm kind of coming around to this is going to be Hollywood land. Really?

468
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:31,600
What makes you say that? Well, so they didn't say anything about Disneyland forward. I wonder if

469
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:36,240
they'll ever say anything about the phrase Disneyland forward again. Cause all that was,

470
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,040
was trying to get the Anaheim city council to agree to let them build anything anywhere

471
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,960
on their own land. That's almost like the name of the mission and never what they're going to call

472
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:51,120
the land anyway. So, so I'm still of the mind that when they say it's coming to California adventure,

473
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:56,320
it could be for that land that was achieved with the Disneyland forward program. Right. So,

474
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,280
so it could, it could be the Disneyland forward area, which is next to the Disneyland hotel.

475
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,480
Like that's, that's sort of what the Disneyland forward art was. Now it doesn't necessarily have

476
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,680
to be there. They could just build a third park on the Toy Story parking lot. We don't really know

477
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,240
a hundred percent what they're going to do. I don't know that they know that, but I kind of

478
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:23,840
suspect if this is far enough along for them to announce it and then suggest that it'll be done

479
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:30,400
in five years, it might be in a place that they know for sure they can build on.

480
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,640
And I've heard enough people say Hollywood land now for months and just looking at Hollywood land.

481
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:44,160
Like the pathway in the concept art looks like a long, like kind of like the entrance to Hollywood

482
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:49,760
land. Like you're looking at, I'm showing them a Google map right now. You're looking at like

483
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:57,120
all this real estate. That is a ton of space, I think. And you think in this version, we lose

484
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:01,760
Hyperion theater. Absolutely. That has to, I think it's, I think it's everything here up until

485
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,880
Carth, like right at Carthay, it basically starts. It feels like they're not like pumping a lot of

486
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,360
life into Hyperion theater. So maybe they're like getting us ready to. Right. And I've heard people

487
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:16,400
say that's going away as well and not even in relation to Avatar going here. Now you say there's

488
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:22,320
no transition. This has been your argument. Yes. And I could get, I'm wrapping my head around this

489
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:27,920
in that like, well, there's not now. And then the toughest thing is going to be Carthay into this.

490
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:35,840
But I don't know if you're, if you lose all the rest of Hollywood, if you lose that main drag

491
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:40,720
and Marvel's far enough away, there's a world where this, where this works and you just need

492
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:46,000
to like build some jungle. Right. To get you through it. To lead you past Carthay. Yeah,

493
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,440
plants and water will do a lot for transitioning. You can put up a big, it just thematically almost

494
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:58,960
doesn't feel right to transition that hard from old Hollywood into Pandora. But if all of, you're

495
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,840
saying you mean Buena Vista Street. Yes. Yeah. Whereas Buena Vista Street into Hollywood feels

496
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:10,480
pretty natural. Buena Vista Street into whatever Condor Flats is called now. Yeah. Soren and all

497
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,840
that feels very natural into like Napa. Why all feels very natural. And Pandora would be the

498
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:20,800
strangest thing to come out of. You've just been in thirties Hollywood, the Hollywood of yesterland

499
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:29,840
and the Hollywood of the future. The made real, you know, the thing about story is that it means

500
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:34,080
so much to all of us. Well, that's true. He can't, he got out of that one. He wriggled his way out

501
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:39,280
of that. That's like a, that's a Trump card. That's a flash bomb to any argument. There's a reason

502
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:44,560
they call me little tomorrow, tomorrow junior. They do call you little tomorrow and tomorrow

503
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:49,760
junior. So that's the only reason I'm like more thinking that that's where it's going is just

504
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:56,080
because like they have, if they're committing to it and it's going to be five years, I feel like

505
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:00,720
they would want it to go in a place that they are sure they're building. And if they've planned it

506
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:05,440
out and plan what it's going to look like and what the, what the building is, like, I guess they could

507
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,240
just plug it anywhere in a Toy Story scenario where they use the Toy Story lot. Did they give

508
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,680
a date on when they are putting the shovel in the ground on this? Well, then what's this five years?

509
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,080
Well, I don't know. I think you're holding to this five years. No timeline provided says Carly

510
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:25,120
Weisel on her Instagram. So what is this five years? You got to get this five years out here.

511
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:30,160
Hey, I'm just going by what, with what they said. When did they say five years? This was people

512
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:35,680
talking to PR people. That's not in the panel. That's not anything. Yeah. Well, I'm just saying

513
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:41,600
that you also in the bet, in the betting episode, you said they have to, they have to do Tomorrowland.

514
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:46,560
Why this have to, and then they aren't, I, I'm upset. I know. Well, I'm just, this is my theory.

515
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,560
This is, I could be wrong. Obviously I was wrong about the D 23 panel. I'm just saying that enough

516
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:56,400
people have said Hollywood land now and there's enough room there for it that I'm starting to

517
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,920
believe it. I'm not going to bet. I'm not going to bet on it. I'm just going to say I'm starting to

518
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:05,680
believe that this could go here. Sure. Sure. The only reason that I'm, uh, arguing against the

519
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:11,120
possibility is that I just want as much land as possible for this. I do not want to constricted,

520
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:15,600
but what you're showing me is a lot of land. If we get rid of the theater, that is a lot of land.

521
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:23,040
Um, you know, one suspicious thing is that if you look at the vague mysterious map of what the kinds

522
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:27,840
of structures that might be in the Disneyland forward zone, it looks very much like this concept

523
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:32,000
that they're showing us. It doesn't mean anything because that's not official, but that is like,

524
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,040
but it is art made by Disney. That sure looks like what this picture looks like. They definitely

525
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:42,240
could change their minds. I don't know. They'd be able to lose a word wieners either. Oh man,

526
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,960
Jason. It's got to eat hot dogs. You love the fries at award wieners. I like the fries. I'm

527
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:52,400
more concerned about corndog castle. I don't think it's long for this world. Really? I think

528
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:57,200
that's fine, right? What are we talking about putting there? Well, I think the next thing

529
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:02,400
that they announced was cocoa. Mm hmm. But where, where in the, I don't think you have,

530
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,440
doesn't corndog castle essentially back right up to like backstage? Mike, you've got the map.

531
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:13,360
Where's corndog castle? Isn't it by the questions everyone's been asking is, is corndog castle safe?

532
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:20,560
Look, I just like that spicy corndog. Corndog castle is right here, which is next to that

533
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:25,520
little gift shop and then in between the gift shop and goofy sky school. What's behind corndog

534
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:31,920
castle? It's the hotel. Then you're fine. Okay. You're fine, Jason. All right. Relax, relax.

535
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. There will always be, you know, I don't remember Walt's quote, but isn't it

536
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,320
something like Disneyland will never be done as long as there's corndogs in the world? That's

537
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,280
right. That's what he said. That's right. It's kind of, yeah, maybe it's something the robot will say.

538
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,840
It'll be great to hear the robot. It's going to sound great out of the robot's mouth. But yeah,

539
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:53,440
if we're going in, this is where I was, I will say my two big grins in this was like, I think this

540
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:59,360
Pandora stuff looks fantastic. Yeah, yeah. And right after that, another boat ride, a boat ride

541
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,840
you've never heard of. This didn't come up in the betting. We talked about the possibility of

542
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:08,640
something Cocoa, but with no genre of ride announced. And that was more, that was something I

543
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:14,640
said about Magic Kingdom, never saw it come in California Adventure Cocoa. That was a big

544
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:19,040
gasp for me. This is one of my favorite parts of the panel. Yeah. Yeah. I've never heard it discussed.

545
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,720
I guess somebody, I was talking to somebody else after this and they were saying they had heard it

546
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:28,480
maybe Disneyland, but I had only heard it in like the idea of it going in Magic Kingdom in Florida.

547
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,640
So yeah, I was not, I was like, Ooh, okay. That's cool. Like that was surprised by that.

548
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:39,360
Yeah. That they, and now this was a kind of a big gasp at the panel, I feel, because they just sort

549
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:44,800
of showed concept art before explaining it. And you quickly see there's a boat there.

550
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,600
And then they went on to say that it's sort of inspired by the old school, that it's kind of a

551
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:56,080
pirate. Yeah. Pirates of the Caribbean reminiscent attraction. Slow moving. I love, I love the boat

552
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:01,200
situation. I love that we're two new boat rides in California. California Adventure is going to be

553
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:09,760
stacked if all this gets done. Yeah. And yeah, look, as a fan of slow moving boat rides,

554
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:15,120
besides one notable exception, I am really happy that in this day and age, we get a new one

555
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:21,280
in the parks based on a film I think is delightful. And really technologically advanced

556
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,680
audio animatronics. Oh, sure. Yeah. Oh, I'd love to see how these skeletons come to life. Yeah,

557
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:30,960
that's going to look awesome. If we have to guess where that's going. And if it's not Disneyland

558
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:37,680
forward, I do have a guess. I think it's going behind, uh, in credit coaster. Cause there is so

559
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:43,360
much real estate here behind in credit coaster. What is the building you're showing? Is that,

560
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:47,200
I mean, there's a bunch of buildings, uh, Toy Story made way mania actually is over

561
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:57,040
here. No, no, no, it's over. Where is it? Sorry. Toy Story is here. I think. Isn't this Toy Story?

562
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,880
Oh, maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I believe. And then so, so there's a good amount of room here.

563
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,120
There's a lot more room there than there is when we're talking about the like paradise.

564
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:11,680
Paradise gardens park. We say the full name. There's like no room over here. Oh, you're right.

565
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:17,360
That's what I threw out because they've been doing kind of like, uh, some cocoa festival.

566
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:22,160
Correct. Like a good thing. Uh, but yeah, you're right. That's not really ride room. Now that I

567
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:27,440
see it on an, on an overhead, but if it's a slow moving boat ride, it doesn't maybe need so much

568
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:32,720
real estate. And I feel like you could maybe put it in and slot it in here, but it could just all

569
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:39,280
be, and you're, you're thinking that because it's Pixar, it's Pixar pier. Yeah. And I don't know

570
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:44,880
what they would do the entrance to it. I sort of don't like it for, because I think the vibe of

571
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:51,840
this will not be at all like the, the carnival entry point. Yeah. And I'd love for this to have

572
00:53:53,120 --> 00:54:01,920
some exterior place setting that, you know, be, I would hate that it's like the carnival exterior

573
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,760
and then you're not in the world of cocoa until you're in the building. Yeah. Uh, that's a good

574
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,400
point. I mean, I think that's the only place to put it unless it's a Disneyland Ford and you go

575
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,640
over the road and you go over Disneyland drive, which it might be. Maybe, I mean, maybe that is,

576
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:18,640
maybe Avatar goes there, maybe Coco's next to it, but they didn't say Coco land also.

577
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:23,360
That's right. So they just said Coco ride. So that makes me more think that it,

578
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:30,880
Hey, but listener, if you're, if you're over by paradise gardens park, uh, check out the bathroom

579
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:40,000
over there has a very elaborate route 66 tile work in it that really doesn't quite make any

580
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,200
sense anymore. I think we have an episode in the can that hasn't come out in which you talked about

581
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,360
the bathroom. So you're getting ahead of the bathroom. We got a lot of content about this.

582
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:55,200
I just want to remind people to go see it. And in case God forbid it should disappear.

583
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,240
There's a lot of talk about like, I will chain myself to this building. If it doesn't Jason's

584
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,720
chained himself to those bathrooms. That's right. Yeah. I think you can fit like a pirates

585
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:10,800
of the Caribbean like size building over behind in credit coaster. Yeah. Yeah. If they wanted to do

586
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,200
that. Um, yeah, but I hear what you're saying. The facade should look kind of cool and weird

587
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:19,440
and inviting and cause they're, yeah, I think there's a chance to like, the vibe should be

588
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:24,160
more Coco ish, not just like appear there. Yeah. I want a lot of time, but I want a lobby that

589
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:29,520
lets me marinate in that, in that vibe. Uh, do we think there's any possibility

590
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:35,120
that any of what we've just said, maybe particularly avatar goes into a grizzly peak

591
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:42,240
and the grizzly peak. I've heard no talk of that. I, here's what I, I sort of don't believe it as

592
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,880
soon as it's out of my mouth. And part of that is because does that not permanently change

593
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:53,680
the fabric and the of, and the views of the grand California zone. Right. And I don't think you want

594
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,520
to do, if you're paying for that hotel, I don't think you want a lot of construction for a long

595
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:03,840
time. And while avatar could sort of that's picturesque and water, I think it ruins it.

596
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:08,800
I don't know. I, it's not, it's not what I would do if I were in charge of them. Yeah. I don't

597
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:14,080
think that's happening. I also think it's like, I don't know. I feel like, I feel like they're

598
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:19,280
going to put an IP on grizzly peak on the grizzly river rapids. One of these days when they find

599
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,200
like, I don't know, I guess, I don't know, I guess they could just demolish the whole thing. It just

600
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,040
seems like a lot of work. It seems like a lot of work. And it also seems like you're losing

601
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:33,520
something. And then the hotel is not themed anymore to the area. And those trees are finally,

602
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:39,360
it took 20 years, but those trees grew in nicely for sure. And also I don't want it. I love that

603
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:47,200
area. I don't want that area. I really like it. I, I tried looking up the, for like around my

604
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:54,880
birthday in October, like how much is it to rent vacation club points at the grand California?

605
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,720
Cause you always hear like, Oh, try running vacation club points for a cheaper

606
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:06,560
stay. And I believe it was $752 a night. Yeah. Well, you better start saving.

607
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:13,520
Well, it's only six 50 or so, the new Disneyland tower. No, I didn't know that you can rent points,

608
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,680
but I also didn't want to ask more questions about this. I knew exactly what was going on in

609
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:23,120
your head. You didn't have to say that. You clocked my silence. He doesn't know what Jason's quite

610
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:27,440
talking about. I didn't know you could do it. Uh, he doesn't want to open up this. We're already

611
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:32,400
going way long on this episode. We know this is going to be a five hour episode. Um, so no,

612
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:39,760
I saw it. I saw it happen. Okay. All right. So yeah, we moved on. Um, I now I'll, I'll say just

613
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:44,880
in order of things, one of my bets was that there will be a music performance by a performer

614
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:51,280
that I have never heard of. I wish I declared that I get $5 every time it happens because

615
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,600
it started to get set. Now I was getting worried because there were plenty that I had heard of,

616
00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:01,600
but then we start getting into, uh, Rachel Potter. I still don't know who the, uh, a cappella group

617
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:09,120
was. It was Pentatonix. Okay. That would, I would have assumed, but I, I missed the ID on that one.

618
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:18,160
Um, I, and then this is much later, but boy, do I not know what Shaboosie is. And, uh, now that I,

619
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:26,000
now that I know, I gotta keep going. That was an electric performance of again, a good night for

620
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,760
Mike musically. You got a life as a highway. I got a life as a highway. I heard of Shaboosie

621
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:37,680
actually. I don't know him very well. Um, but that I was a lot, I was not paying so I forget

622
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:42,800
what I was doing. I was giving my daughter dinner or something at this point. So I want to go back

623
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:46,640
and watch. I hope they, I do hope they put this on Disney plus so I can go back and see Shaboosie do

624
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:52,720
life highway. Yeah. Shaboosie, uh, I knew about cause Jane and I were watching some performances

625
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:57,040
from the BET awards because the musical performances, they always go really,

626
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:04,720
really all out at the BET awards. And Shaboosie, I believe, um, kind of had a big hit with kind

627
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:11,920
of a country-fied cover of the Jay Kwan song, Tipsy. And then at the end of the performance,

628
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,480
Jay Kwan. Let the record reflect. Jason checked his notes. That was not in his head. Jason looked at

629
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,400
notes. I think you could hear it. You can listen back. You can listen to the note check. Well,

630
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:26,640
just at Google, I just didn't want to get the, I knew it as everyone in the club get tipsy. I

631
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:33,840
remember the Jay Kwan song, of course. Um, but in the BET, so he does this performance, tons of

632
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:39,600
actors on the stage. There's a bar set. And then at the end, Jay Kwan comes out from behind the bar

633
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:45,920
and everyone cheers. And it was pretty fun. So when everyone does a rousing cheer, hurrah, they say

634
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:53,200
for Jay Kwan. Everybody in the club getting hammered. Everybody in the club, that being the

635
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:59,920
Honda center. When they opened up the back wall and, and like Mater was saying, my friend,

636
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:05,360
I thought it was going to be Lightning Queen. And so I wasn't disappointed to see Shaboosie,

637
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,880
but I was confused. Sounds like you were disappointed to see Shaboosie. You were

638
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:15,440
hoping to see a car, a talking car. Uh, I mean, I think Shaboosie should have come out

639
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,760
riding on Lightning McQueen. But that would have really made sense. Why was he animated?

640
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,760
And then he's like, but my friend here, and then, and then my friend here. And then Lightning McQueen

641
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,480
comes out. I just didn't even really know Mater knew Shaboosie that well. You're saying more,

642
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,720
you were surprised. You got to follow their socials. Oh, they've been, oh, they're always,

643
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:39,840
yeah, you know, like Greece together, the Bombers. Yeah. Um, let's, I mean, let's, why don't we jump

644
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:43,680
around a little bit? Sure. Let's talk about that. That's something I don't think every, like,

645
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:49,120
you know what? We kind of landed on it right before it happened. And this was this, this was

646
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:54,720
a mic bit, I believe was some version of Radiator Springs, though it's not exactly, they describe

647
01:00:54,720 --> 01:01:00,240
it as something where you leave Radiator Springs and it becomes more of a picturesque pastoral,

648
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:07,680
almost European, uh, car race. I don't know. This, this to me seems like this suggests to me

649
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:12,880
frontier land is going away in Magic Kingdom. This is in the frontier. And like, it doesn't,

650
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:17,040
I just feel like we're changing, we're changing that as a certain point. I think in Magic Kingdom,

651
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:21,680
I'm guessing, cause I'm like, where are they at? This is now we're in this weird, you know,

652
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:25,920
we're talking about behind Big Thunder and actually specifically the bet was behind Big Thunder.

653
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,040
Money might have to be returned to people if it turns out that these things are not meant

654
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,960
for behind Big Thunder. I think they're going behind Big Thunder. Okay. Okay. I think this

655
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:40,160
in Villains Land is going there. Okay. But then what's, does any, cause what, what goes away

656
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:46,640
with cars? Because not, not country bear assuredly now that there's a new show. Well,

657
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:53,120
we're talking about getting rid of the riverboat in Florida, Tom Sawyer Island. That is the rumor.

658
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,240
Chain yourself to it. The rumor is Tom Sawyer Island. Again, I don't know anything. This is

659
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:03,600
just what people say, but people are saying today that the riverboat and Tom Sawyer Island, and I

660
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:07,760
don't know if any water, like, I don't know if any water remains, but that's what, that's what the

661
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:12,880
word is. And you're hearing it more and more. We're hearing it more and more. Have you been

662
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,160
sitting here thinking the same thing that Mike's saying and a guy, and I talked to a guy and you're

663
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:20,320
hearing it and there's a lot of this and a lot of, I've heard it. This is very politician speak

664
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:24,960
coming out of me today. Yeah. Yeah. I, this is kind of par for the course. I feel like with

665
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:31,680
any theme park rumors, so I don't think it's specific to Mike, but I know what he's doing.

666
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:37,280
Sure. He's doing a lot of it. I feel I'm doing a ton of it. I mean, there's, there's a couple

667
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:42,800
like live streams I watched in anticipation of this app doing this episode. And then there were

668
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:46,400
people on the ground and then there were other people I was just talking to speculating. I'm

669
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:51,120
trying to keep everyone's, I'm trying to keep it anonymous. I'm trying to keep it. I'm not trying

670
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:56,000
to say which streamers I watched or what other videos I watched. So we're keeping it. I don't,

671
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,320
cause I don't want to get anyone in trouble necessarily either. That's true. But if you name

672
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:07,280
a name, I name a name. Yeah. We already mentioned SoCal on some parks, which I do watch live

673
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:13,840
streams pretty regularly and they will go to like six flags and not sing one night and keep the

674
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:20,480
live stream going for the drive to it. And it is very stupid. Huh? Do they set up a little tripod?

675
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,880
They have like a little tripod in the car and they just talk about what's on the radio and

676
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:33,440
say hi to the chat. Wow. Okay. So it seems like a lot of work. Yeah. Well, I think they're going to

677
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,200
read, I don't know, country bears and Tiana and everything. I think they're going to call it

678
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:42,480
something different in that area. Pecos bills is going to go away. Probably people, people in the

679
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,160
last couple of weeks were like, Oh, maybe country bear barbecue jamboree. But then I think it's

680
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:50,640
probably more Tiana's is going to go in there like a Tiana's restaurant. I don't know what they're

681
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:56,480
going to call the whole thing. We will get to it, but they've renamed our sort of greater country

682
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:02,160
area. Yeah. We're Bayou country, which I don't care for so much. I didn't know that. Yeah. That

683
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:07,520
was a quick, it was during a song. I went to the bathroom once or twice. It was 30 hours. Yeah,

684
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:13,440
I know. It was a very long. Yeah. So I think I went to the bathroom once during a medley. And then

685
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,280
one time I went to the bathroom and I came back and they're talking about the Spiderman roller

686
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:22,080
coaster. So I had to scroll back and everything. So it's got like, where is that going?

687
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:27,280
The gesture you just did for scrolling back was like what a dog would do while swimming.

688
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:34,960
Yeah. It's what I felt. I had to paddle back. I had all my devices researched where it was in

689
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:41,200
full effect. The research for it was humming. I like to think you had stuffed animal assistance.

690
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:46,560
The Apple watch was vibrating so much for the group techs blowing up, you know?

691
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:52,080
Oh yeah. Now guys, I'm at work. Jason's wrist is like shattered now because of the vibrations

692
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:56,240
had destroyed his bones from his Apple watch. Just destroyed. It's just purple like when Walter White

693
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:05,120
burns the plastic off. There'll be a Pooh Bear episode coming out of Podcast the Ride somewhat

694
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:09,120
soon, but we talk about greater country there. So obviously that's been recorded already.

695
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:13,440
So forgive us when we're talking about greater country, but it is a good, like I guess they could

696
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:18,960
call, I don't know, still greater country now, greater country now, but like you could call that

697
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:24,480
part in Magic Kingdom Bayou country. I don't know. Not sure what, I don't know. I can't picture

698
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,160
enough what it butts up against. Yeah. I'd have to, I'll have to look at the map. We're Bayou

699
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:32,720
country. We're Bayou country. Now Pooh is in Bayou country. That doesn't make any sense. That is

700
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,640
weird. Yeah. That's weird. I don't know if they're going to, I don't think they're going to change

701
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:41,440
Pooh out or anything, but that's even weirder because I, on this upcoming episode, I'll spoiler

702
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:47,600
alert, say I had a problem calling a place where Pooh is critter country because Pooh's not a

703
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:52,880
critter to me. He's an English bear from an English boy's imagination. Not a critter. A critter is a

704
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:58,640
down south kind of an animal that gets up to mischief or whatever. A certain kind of mischief.

705
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:04,480
Yeah, a different kind of mischief. Less polished, stately kind of mischief.

706
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:12,480
Mike, every few episodes, Mike starts pining for the empire. It was not the same when the British

707
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:17,520
released all their colonies. Yes. And that ties directly into me not wanting Pooh to be in a

708
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:21,840
place called critter country. So that, I don't know if that's going to have to be sorted out,

709
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:31,200
but yeah, we are Bayou country now, which is fine. It doesn't mean anything. I know. I would say

710
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,960
the day-to-day in our lives, it affects almost nothing. Not going to affect a lot, but I do,

711
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:41,440
I like the word critter. I do too. That's the only thing, and the alliteration of it. As long as we're

712
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:47,120
allowed to still refer to critters, that this is an area, but Bayou country is full of critters,

713
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:51,840
then I'm good to go. Oh, tons of critters on that ride. There's a lot of critters on there.

714
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:55,200
That's why I think critter country is still out there. And I want to get that hot sauce. I want

715
01:06:55,200 --> 01:07:00,240
to get the Mama Odie hot sauce. Sure. Where will you be able to get the Mama Odie? Is that a gift

716
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:06,960
shop or is that a restaurant? It's a glass bottle. You get it at the shop, at the Tiana shop.

717
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:12,720
All right. Cool. Great. You can get it. And that's November? November 15th. November 15th. Great.

718
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:16,960
Pushed back a little bit because the one in Florida is having so many problems.

719
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:22,480
It barely runs, apparently. It shuts down a lot. The robots are broken.

720
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:27,280
Well, good. We've got the kinks there. Right. And I think the team then, the team all had

721
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:33,520
to move to California to finish setting this one up. But there's so many problems that are not

722
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:38,640
being fixed in Florida. And I think people, I've heard like, they're not quite sure what's going

723
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:45,360
on exactly. I mean, the bones of it, Splash Mountain was not in super hot shape the last few years.

724
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:50,240
Yeah. But I think this is like robot stuff. Oh, interesting. I think this is robot stuff.

725
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:56,560
Again, I don't know what people are saying. But I think the way that the robots, I think when you

726
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:01,120
go by in the boats, like something triggers the actions and stuff. Okay. I think there's some

727
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:05,680
problem with that sometimes. But I think there's also like a hundred other problems, though.

728
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:10,880
Right. I think that's why that has been pushed more to November. I heard people saying maybe it'll be

729
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:17,200
next year, but November they've announced. Remember they said, yeah. Yeah. I now also,

730
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:24,480
elsewhere in the Splash Mountain genre of attraction, we're getting Splash Lion King.

731
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:29,200
Splash Lion King is happening because there is not a Splash Mountain in France.

732
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:36,800
No, they never did it. But now in Disney Adventure World, the soon to be name of that other park,

733
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:43,600
of the second park, because we've been shuffling around, what are the expansion zones there?

734
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:47,440
And now it's starting to seem less and less like there's some iteration of Galaxy's Edge.

735
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,160
The way they announced, frozen for there, correct?

736
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,440
Yeah. With a date for that.

737
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:57,600
Okay. That one's got a date. And then we are getting King Mountain. What are you trying to

738
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,440
think of a better Simba Mountain? Bride Rock.

739
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,800
Oh yeah. I guess. I know. But I still want it to be a mountain.

740
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,640
Simba Mountain. I want it to be Simba Mountain. Simba Mountain.

741
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,760
Yeah, I know. I mean, you look at it and there's

742
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:12,080
no question of what you're looking at. It's just so obviously a Splash Mountain inspired.

743
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,920
So go ahead. This is sort of, I mean, it is tangential,

744
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,600
but I was also thinking, I'm like, what else could you re-theme Splash Mountain to?

745
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,000
And it's like, I guess you could do like a Cave of Wonders and have

746
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:28,640
water spewing out of the cave's mouth and have a flume coming out of it.

747
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,960
Yeah, yeah. That's kind of fun.

748
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,680
Yeah. But then to sort of to Arabianize-

749
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,440
Well, where it's located, yeah.

750
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:40,000
It's where it helps that this is going to be from the ground up.

751
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:46,160
But it makes sense. I like it. I like this concept art. Everybody kind of oohed at this.

752
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:53,760
It feels sort of like, I mean, it is like not halfway around the world, but it's very far away.

753
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:58,560
So I don't feel like it's not super urgent news to me, but I like this as a genre of

754
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:06,880
ride. And it also made me think, oh, maybe this is like something that would motivate the changeover

755
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:13,120
in Tokyo, because Tokyo weirdly quietly just is staying Splash Mountain. Just no kind of

756
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:18,240
nobody's talking about it. But maybe this will open, be well received, be enticing enough that-

757
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,720
Maybe Tokyo votes to do this. I don't know.

758
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,600
Could they do this in Animal Kingdom? Maybe that'd be fun.

759
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,640
They could. It's just then they have another Splash Mountain, I guess.

760
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,560
They do. But there was a time where there was Star Tours and Body Wars.

761
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:30,640
Yeah, that's true.

762
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,360
And those were essentially the same. I think that was a wonderful time.

763
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,800
And if the cars- I don't get enough.

764
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:39,760
And if the cars thing beyond Big Thunder is Radiator Springs, basically,

765
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:43,760
with just new stuff, it's the same ride system. So it's test track, I mean.

766
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,480
So yeah, I guess it's precedent for that.

767
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,960
That's not unprecedented in Disney.

768
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:54,080
I bet the exterior of that will look different than the Radiator Springs out here.

769
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:54,560
Sure.

770
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:57,520
And these both look like Splash Mountain. These both look like-

771
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:01,600
Tiana's looks like Splash Mountain, and Lion King would look like Splash Mountain.

772
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,160
Sure.

773
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:05,520
Sure. Maybe that's the only thing that would prevent it, but maybe not. Who knows?

774
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,120
Yeah. Maybe they don't care.

775
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:12,480
I will give them credit because it does feel like, at least this time in Imagineering,

776
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:17,840
they are conscious of not just making the exact same ride on a different coast.

777
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,400
They are, at the very least, dressing things up.

778
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,120
Even if Radiator Springs is the exact same layout,

779
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,040
it's going to be a different ride in a different location.

780
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,760
And it feels like that's common across the board.

781
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,760
It's not just going to be an Indy from Japan or Indy from California.

782
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,880
They're going to do a new thing, even if it's the same track.

783
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,760
It's a different layout, and it's a lot of the same basic stuff.

784
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:46,480
I wonder what the internal feeling ended up being about Galaxy's Edge, because it's odd.

785
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,760
And what they would have if the two were slightly different and not,

786
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:56,320
in this kind of singular case in Park's history, exactly, eerily the same.

787
01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:01,280
Yeah. Because, yeah, at the very least, you would change up the restaurants in Galaxy's Edge or

788
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,720
something. A couple things could be different, obviously.

789
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,040
But each prop is the same. It's so weird.

790
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,480
I bet they feel like that was a little bit of a mistake.

791
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:10,960
Yeah.

792
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:11,920
It's very exact.

793
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:14,400
Hey, while we're talking Galaxy's Edge,

794
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:20,320
there was a Galaxy's Edge mention in the middle of the Fortnite stuff.

795
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,920
Oh, yeah. If you went deep into the Fortnite forest.

796
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,680
There was an actual announcement.

797
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:30,000
Yeah. So there was a weird tune-in on Fortnite at 830.

798
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,520
It was way later than that by the time it happened.

799
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,720
And then, boy, was there a lot of Fortnite time.

800
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:44,000
This was what occupied that slot, the Brian Cornell target, the arranged-in-a-board room.

801
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,640
This was the thing that was the most like, well, this has to be done.

802
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:52,960
We are going to do 15 minutes or more about Fortnite.

803
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:57,520
What I was shocked by was that all of the biggest power players in Hollywood are in...

804
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:04,480
You're giving me Pete Docter and Feige and Filoni all at the same time, and it's for this?

805
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,040
It's the Fortnite tie-in.

806
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:07,600
Very weird.

807
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,240
So strange.

808
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:09,200
And Chromio.

809
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:11,200
There we go.

810
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,720
That popped me big.

811
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:13,840
Chromio.

812
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,080
I was going to say I like them, but you say pop,

813
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,400
and I don't want to support anything that gets the...

814
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:22,240
Aren't you guys creeped out every time you say popping or they popped?

815
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,560
It's a wrestling term.

816
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:25,760
Very comfortable with it.

817
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,960
I know, but if you take it out, imagine if you're me.

818
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,640
Aren't you weirded out?

819
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,360
Do you understand why I find it so creepy?

820
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,560
If you're not used to the weirdness on this show after so many years,

821
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:37,600
I don't know what to tell you.

822
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:37,920
Yeah.

823
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,440
You're going to have to get another job.

824
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:40,320
Yeah, I'm sorry.

825
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,600
So that's all I have to say.

826
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,800
I'll do my best to say big applause break.

827
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,800
I get if I'm popping out a new phrase, but that's it.

828
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,400
We've been saying that for years at this point.

829
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,440
It's never...

830
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,280
No part of it has diminished for me.

831
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,480
It creeps me out.

832
01:13:54,480 --> 01:14:00,080
I almost said it popped me hard, which I guess that's a little closer to being a dirty annuant.

833
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:05,760
I would say it is 100% absolutely something you would say about sex.

834
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:06,720
It popped me big.

835
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:13,920
Usually it just means John Cena showed up for The Undertaker or whatever.

836
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,520
And who wouldn't pop big and hard?

837
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,560
But yeah, no, we got a big Chromio performance.

838
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:20,640
This is the first of all.

839
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,080
The kind of music that they pull from is always so confusing to me,

840
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,120
but I really like Chromio.

841
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:25,840
I've seen them live.

842
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:30,800
It was, I would say, a lesser experience to watch them doing grim grinning ghosts

843
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,640
and then saying, y'all heard of Fortnite?

844
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,360
Heard of it.

845
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,720
But still fun.

846
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:39,200
I don't know.

847
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,280
Yeah, that was funny.

848
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:44,240
My kid's onto Roblox now.

849
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:45,040
Roblox.

850
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:48,480
I have to get Robux for his birthday every year.

851
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,440
Robux?

852
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,280
Robux is the currency, I believe.

853
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,320
Oh, is that what it is?

854
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,560
I thought you meant the juice store.

855
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:54,720
Oh, no.

856
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:55,840
No, that's Robux.

857
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:56,080
No.

858
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:57,600
Too much sugar.

859
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,840
No, but then, yeah, deep within that, if you were,

860
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:06,000
I was really barely holding on there until buried deep in it was a,

861
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,600
oh, wait, oh, they're saying a ride thing.

862
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,680
OK, and that's, hey, this is actually a quietly big one.

863
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:12,080
This is awesome, yeah.

864
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:15,040
One of the biggest Galaxy's Edge complaints

865
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:18,640
that we have not had any other missions on Millennium Falcon Smuggler's run,

866
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,360
and we're getting it.

867
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,040
And it is Mandalorian and Grogu.

868
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:22,800
Mike, what's his face?

869
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:23,680
I'm Mike.

870
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:26,240
Who has a damn problem with this favorite movie?

871
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:28,320
Not what you think, not what you think.

872
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,480
Aren't you proud of the favorite movie?

873
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:31,840
Not what you think.

874
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:32,400
OK.

875
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,920
I'm upset with myself because when we were making the bets,

876
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,960
there were two things I was thinking about Galaxy's Edge.

877
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,160
What could I bet on?

878
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,480
Number one, old characters in the land,

879
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:45,680
or number two, a new level for the Millennium Falcon ride.

880
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,640
He thought about saying it.

881
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:47,840
And I thought about both of them.

882
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:51,040
But then I said one is much more expensive than the other.

883
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,320
I bet they're not going to do it,

884
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,520
and I bet there won't be an announcement.

885
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:57,680
I'm kicking myself for that reason and not because it's not my old friend.

886
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:58,240
OK, OK.

887
01:15:58,240 --> 01:15:59,680
That's now why I'm upset.

888
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:00,400
I was worried.

889
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,160
That was a grouchy face.

890
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:05,680
I was really mad at myself last night for not going with the other one.

891
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:07,840
Well, if we're checking in on the betting here and there,

892
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,520
that was one of your biggest mistakes.

893
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,640
It was a big bet on that we were opening up the floodgates

894
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,760
and we're meeting all the characters in the Galaxy's Edge.

895
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,040
I still think that's happening, but it was not an announcement.

896
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,640
They didn't say it there, and it was a bigger bet.

897
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,120
And I think both Jason and I benefited from it.

898
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:21,600
Yes.

899
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,400
Well, Jason, though, had the no mention of Galaxy's Edge at all bet.

900
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,280
So I lost that.

901
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,800
So that canceled itself out.

902
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,480
He said they weren't going to even mention it all.

903
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:29,680
But certainly, you know what?

904
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,520
Oh, this changes my calculations.

905
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,960
If you took a snack break during the Fortnite segment,

906
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:38,000
you would think they had to mention Galaxy's Edge.

907
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:38,720
That's true.

908
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:41,120
If you didn't hear it, then yes, Jason won.

909
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,800
But does that mean if it was a $10 bet,

910
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,760
does that mean I get the $10 because of the three statements?

911
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:48,800
I was the only correct one.

912
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,680
What did you say about it?

913
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:52,640
I said there would be no none of any.

914
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:55,280
Jason would be incorrect if he said there's no Galaxy's Edge mention.

915
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:58,960
I was correct in saying no new characters added.

916
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:02,720
Yeah, but then you also said you thought there was going to be a hotel mention, I think.

917
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:03,220
What?

918
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:04,560
Star Cruiser?

919
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,360
Yeah, it's a different bet.

920
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,000
Different bet, OK.

921
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:06,400
Uh-huh.

922
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,600
Oh, I accounted for that.

923
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,400
But am I right?

924
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,680
Because can we make this ruling?

925
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:12,080
Do I get $10 in this category?

926
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:17,600
I guess you didn't make the bet, although I guess Jason's is a separate bet.

927
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:20,400
So in a way.

928
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,400
It is a separate bet.

929
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:24,880
OK.

930
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:25,440
Yeah, OK.

931
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:31,680
But then doesn't his bet imply, sorry, listener, so this isn't interesting at all.

932
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:33,200
Yeah, this is very dry.

933
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:38,400
If the bet was no mention of Galaxy's Edge characters, Mike said yes, I said no,

934
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,880
and Jason said there will not be Galaxy's Edge at all.

935
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,120
Is that his bet in this category?

936
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:48,240
I think it's in the category.

937
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:51,600
It's probably in the category, but then your bet is almost the same as Jason's,

938
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,240
but you're just abstaining from even betting at all.

939
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:54,960
No, I know.

940
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:58,720
I specifically bet that there would be no characters added.

941
01:17:58,720 --> 01:17:59,200
All right.

942
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,680
We all made three statements and only mine was correct.

943
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:04,240
We did a lot of bad betting in this episode.

944
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:07,600
This changes because this changes a lot what's going on.

945
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:08,160
Sure, yeah.

946
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,200
Ooh, actually.

947
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:09,840
Oh, shit.

948
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,240
That gets another bunch of money.

949
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:12,720
Yeah.

950
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,960
Oh, I mean, not radically, but something.

951
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,440
But I am mad at myself because that was absolutely,

952
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:20,480
I was going to pick one of the two to make a bet on and I picked the wrong one.

953
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:24,400
I like when I'm heading into something and feel the need to apologize to the listeners.

954
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,240
Yeah, you were right to apologize.

955
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,760
But anyway, here we go.

956
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:32,160
This is buried in the show, but a big old Galaxy's Edge.

957
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,680
This could change so much.

958
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:39,120
Yeah, and if it goes well and then they keep doing it.

959
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,160
Well, that would be amazing.

960
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,760
Yeah, then we're, yeah.

961
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:47,200
And the tie-in was that it uses Unreal Engine as well as the Fortnite stuff.

962
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,240
So cool, whatever.

963
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:54,400
And in the artwork, they show Mandalorian kind of like zooming by on a jet pack.

964
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,760
Character in the actual ride part of it.

965
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:58,800
That's really good.

966
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,840
Yeah, yeah.

967
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:04,160
Because I don't like that there's things that Star Tours can do that Falcon can't.

968
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:07,440
And now we're sort of getting away from, we're getting closer.

969
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:13,120
Yes, because all the complaints we've had is Star Tours.

970
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,760
There's like these moments you remember on the actual ride

971
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,080
that you don't get in Millennium Falcon because it's a game

972
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,880
and they just didn't put stuff like that in there.

973
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:25,120
You don't get actual characters in the video part of the Millennium Falcon ride

974
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,800
like you do on Star Tours.

975
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,040
It feels like maybe they can address all of it.

976
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,680
They could truly fix the ride.

977
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:33,760
They could fix it.

978
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,160
I mean, maybe the controls are still going to be a problem

979
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:39,280
because they find those annoying still, but they could do something to those.

980
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:42,720
But if we're not, if it's not that you get to be in a place

981
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:45,920
that you maybe have worshipped and thought about since you were a kid,

982
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,120
and you see an incredible animatronic and then you go,

983
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:52,240
and then the aftermath is that you go and deal with coaxium.

984
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:57,440
If instead you go on an adventure with currently relevant popular heroes,

985
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:02,240
that's a pretty big, that's a big shift in just like what are the acts of that experience.

986
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:04,160
So this one's kind of quietly a really good one.

987
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,760
Yes, I completely agree.

988
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:10,240
But you might be helping the Mandalorian and Grogu score some coaxium.

989
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:12,720
I hadn't thought about that.

990
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,120
Am I the only one falling for that?

991
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:16,000
I don't hate that.

992
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:16,720
I don't hate that.

993
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:17,120
Yeah.

994
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:17,600
That's fine.

995
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,280
They can go after coaxium.

996
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:19,840
Yeah, sure.

997
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,120
That's not like that's the problem.

998
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:23,200
Yeah, yeah.

999
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,560
If you're running through their lens.

1000
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:25,280
Don't eat that.

1001
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,600
We need to go get coaxium.

1002
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:33,680
So here's something to maybe devote a little bit of time to.

1003
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:37,280
Is this Monsters, Inc. situation.

1004
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:41,600
So undeniably good news, Monsters, Inc. land.

1005
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,240
Entire Monstropolis coming.

1006
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,960
Nothing much said about the specific details of that,

1007
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:51,440
although there was concept art where people have kooky googly-eyed ice cream cones.

1008
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:52,080
Those are cool, yeah.

1009
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,040
That seems like fun.

1010
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:56,800
But like, you know, seems like a pleasant little, as Monstropolis is,

1011
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,840
when they're taking a walk to work, you're like, what a pleasant little town,

1012
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,080
and it's cool you get to be there.

1013
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:06,160
Then big piece of this, the door coaster.

1014
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:09,600
And I saw a lot of, I'm ripping off this observation from online,

1015
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:14,800
but this is a big year for things that have been rumored for 20 years.

1016
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:15,360
Right.

1017
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:15,920
Yeah.

1018
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:19,840
We're going back to some old internet rumors with a door coaster.

1019
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,160
And I remember always wondering, OK, but what are we?

1020
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:23,360
Are we a door?

1021
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,320
How is this going to work?

1022
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:28,880
And then the concept art is pretty jaw-dropping where, no, you're not a door.

1023
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:33,200
You're next to Boo and Mike and Sully, and they're on a door,

1024
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:41,840
and you are on some souped-up suspended vehicle that is powered by the canisters of screams

1025
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:42,400
or laughs.

1026
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,840
I don't know where we are in the timeline.

1027
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:44,080
Right.

1028
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,480
Presumably screams, because you'll be screaming on the ride.

1029
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:47,280
Makes sense.

1030
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:52,560
So like big old, the big tanks at the top, and your vehicle is the same color as the tank.

1031
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:53,760
This is cool design.

1032
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:58,480
This is like a way to get into that world, which I continue to love and my son likes very much.

1033
01:21:59,200 --> 01:21:59,920
All for this.

1034
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,120
This ride seems great.

1035
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:01,600
Yeah.

1036
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,440
First suspended coaster.

1037
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,480
Can't believe this.

1038
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:04,960
Yeah, I know.

1039
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:06,880
Isn't that odd?

1040
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,000
It is true.

1041
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
The more I thought of it, I was like, yeah, I guess they're right.

1042
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:16,960
But yeah, this rumor is certainly like, this rumor is old enough to get a driver's license.

1043
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:18,880
Yeah, I know.

1044
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,480
Yeah, two have long ago, too, yeah.

1045
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:25,360
I mean, there's pictures of the balloons, like the whatever they call them,

1046
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:28,800
not trial balloons, but what do they call the balloons?

1047
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,200
It might be trial balloons.

1048
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,120
Yeah, test balloons, high balloons.

1049
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:38,960
Here in Disney California Adventure, in the area with Monsters Inc, with the Manatee Party area,

1050
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:39,520
of course.

1051
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:43,920
But there are pictures people have of like, oh, here's, they're trying to see how high

1052
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:47,200
a show building would be for a Monsters Inc door coaster.

1053
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:51,200
I remember this over a decade ago, over in that area.

1054
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:57,440
So this has been floating around so long, and it's finally happening in five years.

1055
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:05,760
And we get it with Billy Crystal's blessing, which is fun, he's fun.

1056
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:12,720
I don't want to get distracted by Billy Crystal material, because I think what we really have to

1057
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:15,280
talk about is kind of not jokey.

1058
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:19,840
It's the most serious thing we have to talk about, because this is, of course, great news,

1059
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:24,480
great news for Disney's Hollywood studios, which despite having all these blockbuster attractions,

1060
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,000
still feels odd and incomplete.

1061
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,520
So this is great.

1062
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:34,400
However, as I was looking at it online, there seemed to be an almost definitive group think

1063
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:40,560
that this is replacing Muppet Vision 3D, and maybe even Star Tours.

1064
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,240
I don't like this one bit.

1065
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,040
It's selfish.

1066
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:53,360
I don't buy any, even with a new experience, I don't buy that Millennium Falcon somehow

1067
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,120
makes Star Tours irrelevant.

1068
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,080
Love Star Tours.

1069
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:57,760
Why would you get rid of Star Tours?

1070
01:23:57,760 --> 01:23:59,520
And then Muppets, come on.

1071
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,760
That's the last place we got it.

1072
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:03,280
Did they ever put it back in California?

1073
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:04,080
I genuinely don't know.

1074
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:08,240
No, it's still, is it still, is it even open?

1075
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:10,800
Oh, it's Fuller Magic, Fuller Magic, yeah.

1076
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,280
God, I forgot, I just never heard that part of town.

1077
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:17,760
So I just think, why?

1078
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:24,480
Why do you kill two attractions when, in my mind, there is a real dead zone in this park,

1079
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:28,720
and that is Star Wars Launch Bay, former animation courtyard.

1080
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:34,320
Kills me that it's a dead zone because, oh my God, taking this animation tour when I was a kid,

1081
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,200
the heart of the park changed my life.

1082
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:43,120
I ate up that tour, and it's so sad that it's been nothing for a long time,

1083
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,560
but it has been nothing for a long time.

1084
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,920
I feel like, how do you not fill in that dead zone?

1085
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:52,240
Why do you evict the Star Wars and Muppet universes?

1086
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:52,800
I don't know.

1087
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:53,600
I will say this.

1088
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,440
I didn't see a consent.

1089
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:58,800
I saw people very sure they knew what they were talking about and say it was

1090
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:02,000
Star Wars and Muppets, but then there were people that were sure it was not,

1091
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,440
and it was what you were saying.

1092
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:03,760
Okay.

1093
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,480
Then there were people, I don't know what she landed on,

1094
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:09,440
and I saw Alicia Stella saying Rock and Roller Coaster,

1095
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:10,560
and I was like, oh, I don't think it's that.

1096
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:11,920
I'm not that up as a possibility.

1097
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:12,960
It could be.

1098
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:13,440
It could be.

1099
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:17,520
I mean, it felt like there were three or four places people thought it could be,

1100
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:21,520
and I couldn't find, like, I couldn't find a consensus among everyone.

1101
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,440
Everyone seemed confused, and like I said earlier,

1102
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,480
the art seemed to suggest different things.

1103
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,960
The different pieces of art suggested different places.

1104
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,000
I polled our audience, and this is just people's feeling.

1105
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:32,480
I don't know.

1106
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:35,280
Maybe some people voting know something,

1107
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:37,920
but when I say where is Monsters, Inc. going,

1108
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:42,720
65% as of this record say animation slash launch bay.

1109
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:43,200
Yeah.

1110
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:47,440
21% roughly say Rock and Roller, and only 13 say Muppets.

1111
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:52,080
This at least shows you, like, this is more about, like, common sense.

1112
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:52,640
Yeah, common sense.

1113
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:55,440
I think it would be so shocking if it turned out to be Muppets.

1114
01:25:55,440 --> 01:26:00,400
I feel like they put so much time and money into making that baseline taphouse,

1115
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,320
buy the Muppets, knowing that Star Wars was going to be a mess.

1116
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:07,840
They had to have a pocket that was pleasant to be in,

1117
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,800
and kind of in the same way of thinking,

1118
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:16,560
back by Rock and Roller Coaster, that Lightning McQueen show is not that old.

1119
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:16,960
True.

1120
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:22,000
So to bulldoze either of those does seem a little out of left field,

1121
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:26,480
as opposed to the animation courtyard in Star Wars launch bay,

1122
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,720
which is kind of nothing.

1123
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:32,000
I guess that Little Mermaid show is getting redone soon.

1124
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,560
That's the biggest issue here, is that that is new.

1125
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:37,040
But is there a way to, I don't know the space well enough,

1126
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,280
is there a way to sort of leave that its own thing?

1127
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,040
Yeah, that's a good question.

1128
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:46,880
Turn the entrance around, like, make you come in from a different part of the building.

1129
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:48,400
I don't know.

1130
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:52,160
I'm looking at it, that's some animation courtyard right here,

1131
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,000
and launch bay right here.

1132
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,480
I just don't know what the size, it's a land which makes me think they need more space

1133
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,760
than the animation courtyard and the launch bay.

1134
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,920
But then if you go over here and buy Star Tours, I'm like,

1135
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:07,360
I don't really know how it fits in.

1136
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,320
Like, I don't know, what does it take out?

1137
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,280
Like, does it, Indiana Jones stunt show is over here.

1138
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,680
Well, is that a possibility as well?

1139
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:17,120
It's possible, I guess.

1140
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,680
I just, I don't know, is really what I'm saying.

1141
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,760
Like, I look at it and it looks difficult to put it,

1142
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:25,840
it looks difficult to slot a land in, in both of these places to me.

1143
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:26,640
It's all strange.

1144
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,800
So I'm not sure, I'm really not sure.

1145
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,880
I didn't think about Indiana Jones, but with a ride going in Animal Kingdom

1146
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:36,720
is a justification for no two Indies.

1147
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,640
But they own Lucasfilm now.

1148
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:42,640
Yeah, and if that's still eating people, if that's still getting the crowd.

1149
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:44,800
It takes people off the board, you know,

1150
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:48,080
it takes people out of the walkways and rides and restaurants.

1151
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,400
For a long span of time, yeah.

1152
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:55,760
I just think in that park, where the real problem with that park is like little experiences,

1153
01:27:55,760 --> 01:28:00,320
which this isn't going to rectify because that's going to be another like two-hour line kind of.

1154
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,880
It's all great, there's just, we're missing like,

1155
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,440
we need a lot of D tickets here that we don't have.

1156
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:06,080
Yeah, I mean like.

1157
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,120
This remains the problem.

1158
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:08,640
So don't get rid of Muppets.

1159
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:09,920
I know, that's, yes.

1160
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,640
Or Star Tours, they're both in that category, I think.

1161
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:15,760
But like you look at the just, this is Toy Story Land right here,

1162
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,760
and maybe it's not going to be as big as Toy Story Land,

1163
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:20,400
but that coaster needs a lot of real estate.

1164
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:24,080
But do you not just like kill offices?

1165
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:26,880
What's behind Animation Courtyard that we can't get rid of?

1166
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,240
Maybe that's what it is.

1167
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:29,360
Maybe that's what it is.

1168
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:32,880
Yeah, I think if you look at a theme park map, like what they give you in the park.

1169
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,880
Not the overheads, but what they give you in the park.

1170
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,640
And it's green in the map.

1171
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:38,960
Green means go away.

1172
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,600
That means anything that is green can go away.

1173
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:42,400
I mean, yeah, maybe you're right.

1174
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:45,120
Maybe you just take out all these office buildings here

1175
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,520
and you go in through where Animation Courtyard was.

1176
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:48,160
I think so.

1177
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:49,840
I mean, that's the most room.

1178
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:50,960
This is what I want.

1179
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:56,320
Why do you punish these good characters who we know and love?

1180
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,400
Hopefully that's what it is.

1181
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:05,040
Because yeah, I feel like it butts up against like the perimeter of the park

1182
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:06,560
if you put it over by Star Tours.

1183
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:15,440
There's also very few, they're running out of room for just like kind of chill area,

1184
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:21,360
I guess around the lake and then Sunset Boulevard back at that opening or food court.

1185
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:27,920
There aren't a lot of places to just chill while everything's like a 90 minute wait, you know?

1186
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,600
True, and you're saying that Muppet Zone's a little mellow.

1187
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:32,560
Yeah, a little mellow.

1188
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:34,320
Because no one's going in it anymore.

1189
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,000
It's sparsely attended.

1190
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Mama Melrose there.

1191
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:38,720
I don't like it.

1192
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,640
I just feel like that might be the case.

1193
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:42,000
I mean, yeah, yeah.

1194
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,120
I want it to stay.

1195
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:46,800
Like, they cannot possibly get rid of Pizza Rizzo, can they?

1196
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,480
A Pizza Rizzo-less Disney world?

1197
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,320
Not before we do our episode.

1198
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:53,440
We have to, yeah, we got a lot of-

1199
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,680
Next time we go, we gotta do a Pizza Rizzo episode.

1200
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:56,180
Yeah, yeah.

1201
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,320
I love Muppets.

1202
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,160
I'm not saying that because I don't like it.

1203
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:01,120
I'm just wondering.

1204
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:02,800
I just find that you said like,

1205
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,800
oh, you gotta chill out at a place where there's not a lot of people,

1206
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,320
and you said Muppets is that area.

1207
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:06,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1208
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:09,040
Well, he means a good kind of chill,

1209
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:10,000
like the tap house.

1210
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,720
Fairfax area, the tap house.

1211
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:13,220
Sure.

1212
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:15,200
Yeah, around Gertie.

1213
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,280
If I had to bet, I don't think it's going away.

1214
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,040
I think it's this other, but I think you're right.

1215
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:19,360
Okay.

1216
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:22,000
That's my guess, but I've been wrong many times.

1217
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,840
I saw someone online going like,

1218
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,360
well, they build an animation court,

1219
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:28,160
or they can connect it to Toy Story Land,

1220
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:30,960
and that feels copacetic having those two lands-

1221
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:31,460
Sure.

1222
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:32,900
... next to each other.

1223
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:33,460
Yeah.

1224
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:35,140
If anyone from Disney is...

1225
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:38,340
Because you just knew, there's no way,

1226
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:40,820
even if it is true and it is Muppets,

1227
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:41,380
they're not going to...

1228
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:43,780
If they say it in that arena somehow,

1229
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:46,180
if they say, we're saying goodbye to the Muppets,

1230
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:48,980
then everybody takes the many, many drinks

1231
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:51,300
in which they're getting hammered in the Honda Center,

1232
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:53,620
and those are all on Josh Demaro's head.

1233
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:55,220
Those voodoo rangers.

1234
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:56,260
Yeah, they're going right for it.

1235
01:30:56,260 --> 01:30:57,220
No, yeah.

1236
01:30:57,220 --> 01:30:58,260
That would have been bad news.

1237
01:30:58,260 --> 01:30:58,820
Yeah, for sure.

1238
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:00,740
Is there a timetable on this?

1239
01:31:00,740 --> 01:31:01,300
Did they say?

1240
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:04,900
I don't think so, but maybe I'm wrong.

1241
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:07,380
Assaulting Cart, because Carly laid it out with a nice post.

1242
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:08,660
Oh, yeah, she had a whole...

1243
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:09,300
With the dates.

1244
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:10,180
Scan the F.Crew there.

1245
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:12,260
I don't think so, but I could be wrong.

1246
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:16,260
So, well, I guess I only ask that-

1247
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:17,620
Oh, construction begins 2025.

1248
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:18,340
Oh, they did say that.

1249
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:18,900
Okay, 2025.

1250
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:19,700
So, we'll know soon.

1251
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:20,580
I mean, we'll know soon,

1252
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:23,780
because they'll start demolishing those buildings

1253
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:25,860
behind animation courtyard, if that's the case.

1254
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:26,260
Yeah.

1255
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:26,760
Yeah.

1256
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:28,820
What else?

1257
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:30,740
I feel like that's a lot of the biggest stuff.

1258
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:31,540
Animal Kingdom.

1259
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:34,420
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's the big one we haven't hit.

1260
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:35,380
Yeah, Tropical Americas.

1261
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:37,700
Yeah, so Indiana Jones.

1262
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:39,620
No Harrison on stage.

1263
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:41,540
No Harrison, they got a short round, though.

1264
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:42,660
Yeah, yeah, he was up there.

1265
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:44,500
He's great.

1266
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:45,700
It was so nice to see him.

1267
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:46,580
I wish he was on the ride.

1268
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:47,620
That was a cool trick.

1269
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:50,340
Is he on the ride?

1270
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:51,860
No, I said I wish he was going to be on the ride.

1271
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:52,660
I wish he was on the ride.

1272
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:53,060
It'd be fun.

1273
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:56,340
But yeah, No Harrison, that's a little lost for Mike.

1274
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:56,820
That's right.

1275
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:57,460
We're tracking it.

1276
01:31:57,460 --> 01:31:59,380
This was the Harrison spot for this.

1277
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:00,580
They thought about it.

1278
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:03,060
I was getting nervous the whole time.

1279
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:04,820
You mean they prepared it in case he decided that.

1280
01:32:04,820 --> 01:32:07,940
Well, I think the guest conductor joke,

1281
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:10,260
and it turns around and it's him.

1282
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:11,540
That could have been Harrison.

1283
01:32:11,540 --> 01:32:13,060
Could have been Harrison, yeah.

1284
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:14,260
But it was happy to see Key.

1285
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:16,900
You think he's going to wave his arms around

1286
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:18,500
to the degree a conductor does?

1287
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:22,020
You got to put $10,000 in his pocket.

1288
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:24,180
He holed up at Comic-Con.

1289
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:26,820
His arms were going flailing wildly.

1290
01:32:26,820 --> 01:32:27,620
I guess that's true.

1291
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:29,860
Maybe he got $10,000 for it.

1292
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:30,900
He might, yeah, possibly.

1293
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:33,300
Just saying, he did his arms.

1294
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:36,900
You better have that Trader Joe's Peanut Butter Pretzel Nuggets

1295
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:38,580
if you're getting me to Orange County.

1296
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:42,260
Are you just saying what you need to get to Orange County

1297
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:42,660
in a Harrison voice?

1298
01:32:42,660 --> 01:32:44,660
Peanut Butter Pretzel Nuggets in a bottle,

1299
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:48,660
that wolf bottle of Chardonnay for Trader Joe's.

1300
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:50,500
That he brings to a Halloween party?

1301
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:51,540
Yeah, he brings to Halloween.

1302
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:54,820
I think he could go nicer than the wolf or the stomping grape.

1303
01:32:55,380 --> 01:32:55,940
Hopefully.

1304
01:32:55,940 --> 01:32:57,540
I like the stomping grape.

1305
01:32:57,540 --> 01:32:59,940
But we're getting, yeah, Indiana Jones,

1306
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:01,940
where Dinosaur is being rethemed.

1307
01:33:01,940 --> 01:33:02,820
Yes, confirmed.

1308
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:03,860
This is another one I got right.

1309
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:04,980
Confirmed, but no name.

1310
01:33:05,540 --> 01:33:06,660
Yes, I said name, right?

1311
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:07,540
I thought we were getting a name.

1312
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:08,980
I think you stayed out of it.

1313
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:09,620
Oh, OK.

1314
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:10,100
Good.

1315
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:10,660
Thank God.

1316
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:13,700
I was thinking we might get a name, though.

1317
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:14,740
Yeah, no.

1318
01:33:14,740 --> 01:33:16,260
They kind of, well, yeah.

1319
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:17,700
Well, some names, some no names.

1320
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:19,620
This is starting soon, too.

1321
01:33:19,620 --> 01:33:20,900
The construction is happening.

1322
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:21,860
So it's interesting they didn't get it.

1323
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:23,140
It seems like end of the year, yeah.

1324
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:23,940
They didn't give a name.

1325
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:27,460
They aren't sure yet.

1326
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:31,940
But they're closing Dino Land in phases

1327
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:34,020
so that they're giving us all the opportunity

1328
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:36,260
to say goodbye to Dinosaur.

1329
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:39,380
I don't think I'm going to take them up on that opportunity.

1330
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:44,180
I'm not going to get screamed at by the Allosaurus one more time.

1331
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:45,780
I'm scared of the ride, apparently.

1332
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:47,620
So I don't need to do it again.

1333
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:49,780
Well, it'll be a calmer experience for you.

1334
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:50,660
Maybe.

1335
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:51,780
But this should be fun, good.

1336
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:54,740
I mean, all of this is just like home run to me.

1337
01:33:54,740 --> 01:33:58,340
And then Encanto, I mean, that's just the Encanto house

1338
01:33:58,340 --> 01:33:59,460
is something like that.

1339
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:01,620
There's an iconic structure that absolutely

1340
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:04,180
has to be represented in the parks.

1341
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:08,980
And then I feel like they, boy, they just barely show you.

1342
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:10,740
They show you enough of the ride vehicle

1343
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:14,180
to show you that people will be close together.

1344
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:15,380
But other than that, I don't know.

1345
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:18,660
It feels like OmniMover or I don't know.

1346
01:34:18,660 --> 01:34:19,300
I don't know.

1347
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:21,620
It's not a big boxy trackless thing.

1348
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:25,220
It seems like more of a ride you can send a lot of people

1349
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:27,300
through all at once, which sounds great.

1350
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:28,500
They need more stuff like that.

1351
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:29,140
But I don't know.

1352
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:31,300
They don't really show you the ride vehicle on this.

1353
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:33,700
This is one of those where I was like, this is so close

1354
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:35,460
to actually being built.

1355
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,500
Give us another two minutes.

1356
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:40,820
Don't give us spoilers, I guess, big spoilers on the ride.

1357
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:42,500
But I'm like, you could give this room

1358
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:44,420
two more minutes of info.

1359
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:45,780
I mean, I guess they did it kind of.

1360
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:46,900
They did say a lot.

1361
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:51,060
It's the rainforest room.

1362
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:52,580
They talked about restaurants.

1363
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:56,340
They talked about the carousel, which is like lovingly

1364
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:58,420
handcrafted and I don't know.

1365
01:34:58,420 --> 01:34:59,220
All sounds very...

1366
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:00,180
It sounds good.

1367
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:02,260
I just mean like because it's so close

1368
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:04,100
and I'm sure details are finalized.

1369
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:06,820
The carousel looks very good.

1370
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:08,180
It looks very cool.

1371
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:11,780
But I did immediately think of a joke of, oh, thank God.

1372
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:14,180
Animal Kingdom finally has a carousel.

1373
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:18,100
Because they opened it with such like,

1374
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:20,180
this isn't the normal kind of theme park.

1375
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:21,380
And now...

1376
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:23,460
But Dino Land was always like a theme park.

1377
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:26,900
Dino Land was pretty, yeah, kitschy and part of the league.

1378
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:29,540
It makes, you know, there's precedent is all I'm saying.

1379
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:34,660
Is the theme park fan party line supposed to be

1380
01:35:34,660 --> 01:35:37,540
that you're somehow upset that Dino Land's going away?

1381
01:35:37,540 --> 01:35:39,380
That I am or we are supposed to?

1382
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:40,980
Yeah, what are we?

1383
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:42,660
Yes, the general we.

1384
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:45,460
There is a little groundswell, I feel like,

1385
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:48,660
for like Dino Land is good, but I don't sense it's so strong.

1386
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:53,540
I think people, certainly people a few years younger than us

1387
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:54,660
look on it very fondly.

1388
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:55,780
She grew up with it, sure.

1389
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:56,500
Yeah.

1390
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:59,700
But I don't sense it's gonna be like

1391
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:01,140
if they close Muppets or something.

1392
01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:03,620
I don't think it's at that level.

1393
01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:05,380
But there's a little, I've heard there's rumblings

1394
01:36:05,380 --> 01:36:06,580
of like Dino Land is good.

1395
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:10,180
Do you think they'll let me personally

1396
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:11,780
take a wrecking ball to Aladar?

1397
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:14,660
Will you drive the thing, you'll drive the...

1398
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:17,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll learn how to operate it quickly.

1399
01:36:17,060 --> 01:36:19,940
I'll apply for a construction job just in time.

1400
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:21,620
You put on a Deadpool outfit,

1401
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:23,700
you might be able to get away with anything.

1402
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:26,740
Well, that's true for life, true for being in life.

1403
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:30,660
So yeah, I don't know, this all seems pretty good

1404
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:37,060
and a good like as classy a way to shove IP

1405
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:38,500
into Animal Kingdom as you're gonna get.

1406
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:43,540
They're doing, they're treating it with care,

1407
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:44,180
they're not just.

1408
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:45,460
They're shoving it with care.

1409
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:46,740
They're shoving it in with care.

1410
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:49,700
I saw a picture of Joe Rhodey taking a photo

1411
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:52,980
of the model this morning from Animal Kingdom.

1412
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:56,100
What if it was for his shitting on?

1413
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:57,300
Oh, it's his burn book.

1414
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:58,740
It's going in his burn book.

1415
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:01,620
He's gonna take it and print it out

1416
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:03,700
and burn a big poster of it when he gets home.

1417
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:06,260
Some sort of ritual that he learned

1418
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:07,460
somewhere in a different country.

1419
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:11,220
Yeah, so yeah, no, it all looks cool

1420
01:37:11,220 --> 01:37:14,420
and it will fit thematically with Animal Kingdom.

1421
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:15,860
The look of it I think will fit

1422
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:17,460
with some of the Animal Kingdom stuff.

1423
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:20,100
Yeah, let's bring it back to California

1424
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:21,700
and California Adventure, Avenger stuff,

1425
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:23,220
a lot of Avenger stuff.

1426
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:25,700
Yes, I will say the thing that popped me the hardest

1427
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:31,140
that was, that didn't live up to the popping

1428
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:33,460
that I was experiencing was when they said.

1429
01:37:33,460 --> 01:37:35,060
You would say it's a ruined pop.

1430
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:37,060
I don't know if it was a ruined pop.

1431
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:39,540
Not a premature pop.

1432
01:37:39,540 --> 01:37:40,740
No, no, no, not premature.

1433
01:37:40,740 --> 01:37:41,780
It was the right time.

1434
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:42,740
It happened at the right moment.

1435
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:43,620
Time perfectly.

1436
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:44,260
Time perfectly.

1437
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:45,140
It was just that.

1438
01:37:45,140 --> 01:37:47,860
I popped for what I thought was gonna be a bigger deal

1439
01:37:47,860 --> 01:37:49,940
because they said fourth ride in Avengers campus.

1440
01:37:52,420 --> 01:37:54,900
And I got excited and then it was like cool,

1441
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:58,020
but it wasn't, I didn't think it was gonna be X-Men ride.

1442
01:37:58,020 --> 01:37:59,060
I disagree with you.

1443
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:01,940
Well, here we're in a meet your friends situation.

1444
01:38:01,940 --> 01:38:03,380
I'm not friends with any of these people.

1445
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:04,100
Yeah, yeah, these are my friends.

1446
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:05,460
So I just look at the vehicle

1447
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:06,580
and I think the vehicle seems great.

1448
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:07,860
Oh no, I think it'll be really fun.

1449
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:09,060
I think it will be really fun.

1450
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:10,340
This is, wait, what's the name of it?

1451
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:11,300
What are we?

1452
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:11,860
Stark.

1453
01:38:11,860 --> 01:38:12,980
Stark something.

1454
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:13,940
Flight lab?

1455
01:38:13,940 --> 01:38:14,660
Flight lab.

1456
01:38:14,660 --> 01:38:18,260
Flight lab, which is you're on a Kuka arm kind of thing.

1457
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:21,860
So you're able to like swing around, rotate a lot.

1458
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:25,700
And it seems, and you are testing the variety of,

1459
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:29,220
like it's, you can fly seemingly in different ways.

1460
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:32,020
Maybe you pick like, you're pulling the flight patterns

1461
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:33,940
of different characters or suits

1462
01:38:33,940 --> 01:38:35,860
depending on which vehicle you get on.

1463
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:37,780
Yeah, I'm guessing like it'll be like,

1464
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:41,380
yeah, you fly like Iron Man, you fly like Spider-Man.

1465
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:43,940
I think they're gonna do like,

1466
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:45,620
I'm trying to think who else, Captain Marvel,

1467
01:38:45,620 --> 01:38:46,500
who else flies?

1468
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:47,460
War Machine.

1469
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:48,180
War Machine, I mean,

1470
01:38:48,180 --> 01:38:49,620
it's gonna be similar to Iron Man though.

1471
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:50,180
Yeah, I guess.

1472
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:55,140
It looks very similar to the Some of All Thrills.

1473
01:38:55,140 --> 01:38:56,420
Some of All Thrills, yeah.

1474
01:38:56,420 --> 01:39:00,660
The Raytheon sponsored attraction and interventions.

1475
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:02,980
Yeah, yeah, interventions, Some of All Thrills.

1476
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:04,740
You would program a roller coaster

1477
01:39:04,740 --> 01:39:07,060
and then ride it basically.

1478
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:07,620
But it was.

1479
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:08,340
That one too?

1480
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:10,900
Okay, I get confused with Some of All Thrills.

1481
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:12,180
And it's on a big arm like that?

1482
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:13,060
It's on a cuckoo arm.

1483
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:14,500
But it looks like it, yeah, you strap,

1484
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:15,780
it's like strapped over.

1485
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:17,780
But there's no car, you're inside.

1486
01:39:17,780 --> 01:39:21,460
Can I ask, is this Stark thing indoors or outdoors?

1487
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:22,740
It's outdoors.

1488
01:39:22,740 --> 01:39:23,060
It is.

1489
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:25,940
It looks to be outdoors but like under like a big awning,

1490
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:29,060
like basically they're gonna open up that wall

1491
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:32,500
that's right by the Future Avengers ride.

1492
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,260
So like you'll walk down and on the left

1493
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:37,220
is where you'll enter for the new multiverse, whatever ride.

1494
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:38,500
Infinity Defense.

1495
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:40,180
Infinity Defense, thank you.

1496
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:42,580
And then the ride is like right next to,

1497
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:47,140
the Stark Flight Lab is right next to the E-Ticket ride.

1498
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:47,540
Yeah, it's interesting.

1499
01:39:47,540 --> 01:39:49,780
And it looks to be kind of outside almost.

1500
01:39:49,780 --> 01:39:53,700
Like there's like a, like it'll be open air essentially

1501
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:56,660
but you're like kind of under a covering or something

1502
01:39:56,660 --> 01:39:59,540
of the actual E-Ticket show building.

1503
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:02,500
And they said this will all like double the footprint

1504
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:04,180
of Avengers campus, which.

1505
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:04,980
Yes, they did say that.

1506
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:05,460
I don't know if that means.

1507
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:06,340
I'm into it.

1508
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:07,620
I like it, yeah.

1509
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:08,660
Sure, but it's a good.

1510
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:11,300
I like Avengers campus as it is.

1511
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:12,900
I think it's really gonna ruin the purity

1512
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:15,220
of the one thing in the restaurant.

1513
01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:16,420
Scott wants it smaller, he said.

1514
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:17,780
Yeah, yeah, downside.

1515
01:40:17,780 --> 01:40:19,300
Actually, yeah, smaller.

1516
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:22,420
Cut to Guardians, that ride's a little showy for me.

1517
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:24,820
I mean the bar has a lot of variety

1518
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:26,820
and it's a pretty pleasant place to sit.

1519
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:29,940
So for a second I was like, is he joking?

1520
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:30,820
Does he mean?

1521
01:40:30,820 --> 01:40:33,220
No, we're just finally, like we gotta land now.

1522
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:35,860
And also just as a, I mean I was maybe,

1523
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:39,780
I consider California Adventure my park in a way.

1524
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:43,540
And just because I've like, as we all did,

1525
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:46,580
we've like gotten to be around it as it got good.

1526
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:50,980
And as it got mad, it was the place we went to get mad

1527
01:40:50,980 --> 01:40:52,900
when we were young, so young were we.

1528
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:58,740
But I'm like, we got four ride announcements.

1529
01:40:58,740 --> 01:41:02,980
This park is, does all this not, if it's not already true,

1530
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:05,620
do the four rides not get us to the point

1531
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:08,900
that DCA is maybe in the top three theme parks

1532
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:10,660
in the country, top two, number one.

1533
01:41:10,660 --> 01:41:12,500
Number one, does it make it number one?

1534
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:14,020
I don't know that I would say one,

1535
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:17,380
but if Avatar is slotted in there,

1536
01:41:17,380 --> 01:41:18,820
that is a massive upgrade.

1537
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:20,900
If the Marvel ride.

1538
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:22,740
What is number one, if not,

1539
01:41:22,740 --> 01:41:25,060
is it Islands of Adventure or one of those?

1540
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:25,460
Right now?

1541
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:26,740
Just individual park.

1542
01:41:26,740 --> 01:41:27,620
Individual park.

1543
01:41:28,740 --> 01:41:32,740
I mean a lot of people still make the claim that Disney's a question.

1544
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:34,340
The people will still claim, and I don't know,

1545
01:41:34,340 --> 01:41:36,900
maybe I'm one of the Disneyland is still the best.

1546
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:40,260
And all the parks, just park itself, not resort.

1547
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:41,860
I think after all this,

1548
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:43,300
California Adventure is better than Disneyland.

1549
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:46,100
I could see that argument.

1550
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:47,940
For an adult, different for kids.

1551
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:48,660
Right, right.

1552
01:41:48,660 --> 01:41:49,700
I could see that argument.

1553
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:52,740
I mean, yeah, again, Avatar blows everyone away

1554
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:53,540
like it looks like it will.

1555
01:41:54,180 --> 01:41:56,580
We did a just Disneyland,

1556
01:41:56,580 --> 01:41:58,500
we did a just California Adventure rather,

1557
01:41:59,140 --> 01:42:00,660
with our then three-year-olds,

1558
01:42:01,620 --> 01:42:02,740
didn't go into Disneyland at all.

1559
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:04,260
Great kick-ass day.

1560
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:05,380
Worked for him, too.

1561
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:06,020
Yeah.

1562
01:42:06,020 --> 01:42:06,660
Well, that, yeah.

1563
01:42:07,620 --> 01:42:09,380
No, I wouldn't argue with that.

1564
01:42:09,380 --> 01:42:11,220
I would have to think about.

1565
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:13,460
I would have to, if I was really going to debate against Disneyland.

1566
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:14,740
Still sacrilegious in a way.

1567
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:15,700
Yeah, I'm not upset by it.

1568
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:16,420
But I think.

1569
01:42:16,420 --> 01:42:19,220
But I get that Disneyland is the best argument

1570
01:42:19,220 --> 01:42:20,180
as far as its parks,

1571
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:22,020
and Disneyland has so many rides in it.

1572
01:42:22,660 --> 01:42:25,620
At the end of the day, there's like something for everyone there.

1573
01:42:25,620 --> 01:42:29,140
But as far as feeling like big, cool, new stuff,

1574
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:30,420
yeah, California Adventure is going to,

1575
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:33,060
it's really going to be somewhere in five years.

1576
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:33,860
Press your fingers.

1577
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:34,500
Yes, yes.

1578
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:35,780
In five years.

1579
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:37,060
Do we get timeline on all this?

1580
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:39,540
No, not specifically.

1581
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:42,980
Or no, Avengers, no, Avengers will start next year.

1582
01:42:42,980 --> 01:42:44,980
Ray Crayons in 2025, I think.

1583
01:42:44,980 --> 01:42:45,620
Yeah.

1584
01:42:45,620 --> 01:42:45,940
Oh, okay.

1585
01:42:45,940 --> 01:42:48,420
So I had two or three years then, probably, for it.

1586
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:50,180
And it seems like they'll be building these at the same time

1587
01:42:50,180 --> 01:42:52,340
because they're connected to each other.

1588
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:56,100
So I'm guessing 2027 or 2028.

1589
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:58,180
So then, Infinity Defense.

1590
01:42:58,180 --> 01:42:59,140
Yes.

1591
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:00,500
Avengers Infinity Defense.

1592
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:02,980
Which looks, which is funny because Scott Trowbridge,

1593
01:43:02,980 --> 01:43:05,780
Mr. Islands of Adventure Spider-Man,

1594
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:10,980
is making a new screen ride with superheroes,

1595
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:12,660
which is funny.

1596
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:16,740
But yes, it's called Infinity Defense,

1597
01:43:16,740 --> 01:43:19,060
which is not my favorite title.

1598
01:43:20,180 --> 01:43:21,140
It's fine, I guess.

1599
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:24,340
It's not so dynamic, but okay.

1600
01:43:25,140 --> 01:43:26,100
I look at that and I'm like,

1601
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:28,740
well, that's the way Marvel things are named.

1602
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:30,900
That sure is the way they name shit.

1603
01:43:30,900 --> 01:43:32,340
Infinity War is cool.

1604
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:35,060
Secret Wars is cool.

1605
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:35,860
That is all cool.

1606
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:39,140
Infinity Defense is less fun.

1607
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:40,180
But okay, fine.

1608
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:42,660
That doesn't have to bring us down.

1609
01:43:42,660 --> 01:43:44,500
But yeah, they showed a little bit of that.

1610
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:49,460
And yeah, I mean, we've kind of covered this in some ways.

1611
01:43:49,460 --> 01:43:52,260
Like, it's going to be mostly screen ride.

1612
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:54,740
I think there's some practical set elements.

1613
01:43:54,740 --> 01:43:56,260
And I don't know about robots.

1614
01:43:56,660 --> 01:43:59,940
But it's probably that Peter Pan system

1615
01:44:00,660 --> 01:44:02,420
that they have in Tokyo Disney.

1616
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:05,220
And I don't know, I'm excited to do it.

1617
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:08,020
I don't know that it's going to be like

1618
01:44:08,020 --> 01:44:09,860
a revolutionary new ride or anything.

1619
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:11,460
But that's what I'm worried about,

1620
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:12,740
that it'll feel a little bit like,

1621
01:44:12,740 --> 01:44:15,780
yep, this is what rides have been for a little while.

1622
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:20,580
And maybe that's, overall, of all the stuff we've got,

1623
01:44:20,580 --> 01:44:21,940
I don't know that there's anything

1624
01:44:21,940 --> 01:44:24,820
that's going to physically blow me away,

1625
01:44:24,820 --> 01:44:28,580
like Velocicoaster or Guardians in Florida.

1626
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:31,060
Well, it's also not really what Disney does.

1627
01:44:31,060 --> 01:44:32,020
It's true, sure.

1628
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:34,180
But yeah, that was the only thought I had.

1629
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:37,860
But yes, this one, and I know I'm just mourning the loss

1630
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:40,100
of the much more ambitious ride they had planned,

1631
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:42,020
that I don't even really know fully what it was,

1632
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:43,460
but it looked a lot more ambitious.

1633
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:46,180
So I think it might've had elements of this flight.

1634
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:49,220
Possible, yes, possible.

1635
01:44:49,220 --> 01:44:50,980
That you were in little kooka arms or something.

1636
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:52,340
That might've been the way they did it.

1637
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:53,780
But yeah, I don't know.

1638
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:56,660
I'm excited to see what it looks like,

1639
01:44:57,380 --> 01:44:59,460
and my friends will be on the ride.

1640
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:04,100
I mean, there were more exciting Marvel announcements

1641
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:07,460
in other countries, I would say, overall.

1642
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:08,340
Yeah, I know, yes.

1643
01:45:09,940 --> 01:45:15,780
Those are what, again, it is that Hong Kong is getting

1644
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:17,540
what looks like a drop tower.

1645
01:45:17,540 --> 01:45:19,300
Yes, Tower of Terror Spider-Man,

1646
01:45:19,940 --> 01:45:24,020
which looks awesome and looks like this art

1647
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:26,180
that we've talked about many times on the show

1648
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:28,580
that was gonna be this Dubai Marvel park.

1649
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:30,660
And to me, there was a piece of art that looked

1650
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:32,900
like it was a Tower of Terror with Spider-Man

1651
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:35,460
and his web catching the big elevator

1652
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:38,420
or whatever big box that the people were in.

1653
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:38,820
Yeah, yeah.

1654
01:45:38,820 --> 01:45:42,100
And that's haunted me for many, many years now,

1655
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:42,980
if you can find that.

1656
01:45:43,540 --> 01:45:46,580
And now they're doing it in a different way.

1657
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:51,140
And they're doing it, finally, with a Spider-Man villain,

1658
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:52,820
which has been a complaint of mine

1659
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:55,620
about the other Spider-Man ride that we've got.

1660
01:45:55,620 --> 01:45:56,900
It's like, where are the villains?

1661
01:45:56,900 --> 01:45:58,660
He's got the almost fun villains.

1662
01:45:58,660 --> 01:45:59,780
But what's the villain in this?

1663
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:00,500
Doc Ock.

1664
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:01,540
Oh, OK.

1665
01:46:01,540 --> 01:46:03,860
Doctor Octopus attacking what looks to be

1666
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:06,980
like an elevator car and Spider-Man catching you

1667
01:46:06,980 --> 01:46:08,660
with his web and pulling you back up

1668
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:11,060
and dropping you down while he's fighting with Doc Ock.

1669
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:11,860
Sounds really good.

1670
01:46:11,860 --> 01:46:12,580
It sounds great.

1671
01:46:12,580 --> 01:46:15,380
And it looks like, if I'm guessing how it works,

1672
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:19,620
I'm guessing there's a screen in the top of the tower base.

1673
01:46:19,620 --> 01:46:20,180
Or the vehicle.

1674
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:21,700
You can see Spidey on top of your car.

1675
01:46:21,700 --> 01:46:22,660
That's what I'm guessing.

1676
01:46:22,660 --> 01:46:23,140
Oh, cool.

1677
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:23,460
Yes.

1678
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:26,340
You see Doc Ock arms and you see webbing.

1679
01:46:26,340 --> 01:46:28,740
So yeah, so basically, again, this is just guess,

1680
01:46:28,740 --> 01:46:31,460
but Guardians Tower style, you go up

1681
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:34,260
and you see different screens of action that's happening.

1682
01:46:34,980 --> 01:46:36,180
Maybe a robot, who knows?

1683
01:46:36,180 --> 01:46:38,260
You could have one Doc Ock robot or something.

1684
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:40,020
But then, yeah, you have a screen above you

1685
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:42,580
where Spider-Man keeps catching you

1686
01:46:42,580 --> 01:46:44,100
and jumping on the top of the car,

1687
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:46,740
fights with Doc Ock on the top, in the front.

1688
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:47,940
I'm guessing that's what it'll be.

1689
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:49,540
And it sounds awesome if that's what it is.

1690
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:50,980
That's really good.

1691
01:46:50,980 --> 01:46:52,900
That is much more exciting to me,

1692
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:55,140
because that's a legit thrill ride.

1693
01:46:55,940 --> 01:46:57,700
And they figured out a way to sort of have

1694
01:46:57,700 --> 01:47:00,020
dynamic action happening at the same time.

1695
01:47:00,020 --> 01:47:02,180
That's a good reframing of this type of ride.

1696
01:47:02,180 --> 01:47:05,620
They've done a few times, but every iteration's great.

1697
01:47:07,220 --> 01:47:12,020
Then Shanghai is a Spidey coaster, also really good.

1698
01:47:12,020 --> 01:47:12,740
That's really fun.

1699
01:47:12,740 --> 01:47:13,240
Yeah.

1700
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:15,960
I mean, I think that'll be really fun,

1701
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:20,280
but I don't know how much actual Spider-Man you'll get.

1702
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:21,560
Because it goes outside.

1703
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:23,560
And I see they showed a piece of art

1704
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:25,960
that's got Spider-Man above you,

1705
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:27,560
and then I think you take off or something.

1706
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:29,400
So you might lose characters throughout.

1707
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:30,280
That's what I'm guessing.

1708
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:31,800
I'm sure it'll be cool and fun,

1709
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:35,400
but it seems like that one will be less full story

1710
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:36,680
you're watching the whole time.

1711
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:39,400
And it's hard to do that on a coaster as it is.

1712
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:42,520
And I guess one big downside is that several weeks ago,

1713
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:46,200
Jaquice Neal essentially confirmed that I will never

1714
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:47,880
go to Shanghai, does he?

1715
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:54,120
I walked out of that episode like, well, cross-off list.

1716
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:55,080
I mean, maybe someday.

1717
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:56,040
Didn't deter me.

1718
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:57,400
Not that I'm going any time soon.

1719
01:47:57,400 --> 01:47:58,600
It sounded terrible.

1720
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:00,280
Some of it seemed unpleasant.

1721
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:03,080
If you pick up cigarettes, you start smoking.

1722
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:05,480
Start smoking at 40.

1723
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:10,520
We can finally start smoking on rides, though.

1724
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:12,200
We've talked about this for years now,

1725
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:15,320
and if we go, maybe just light it up.

1726
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:17,960
But yeah, Shanghai, anywhere, I guess.

1727
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:19,800
But yeah, I was like, oh, shit.

1728
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:22,600
This Spider-Man, or Tower of Terror, man.

1729
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:23,800
I know.

1730
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:24,120
Very exciting.

1731
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:25,400
It sounds a little bit cooler.

1732
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:26,840
And I'd start demanding that here,

1733
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:28,600
except Guardians is pretty great.

1734
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:29,800
Yeah, Guardians is great.

1735
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:32,360
So right, I understand why they're not going to make it, but.

1736
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:36,440
Ooh, maybe they end up doing that over in Adventure World.

1737
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:38,360
The Paris one, yeah.

1738
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:41,000
Because that's close to Marvel, their Tower of Terror.

1739
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,120
They've got to re-theme it, though, and if it's like a new.

1740
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:46,200
I don't know how much new technology is on it.

1741
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:46,840
So you might.

1742
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:47,480
Oh, that's true.

1743
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:47,880
Yeah, I don't know.

1744
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:48,600
It might be too hard to do that.

1745
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:50,040
I'm assuming maybe it's not.

1746
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:50,920
It's something they can overlay.

1747
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:54,200
I mean, I don't know how any of the technology works,

1748
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:56,920
but if you could build a Tower of Terror vehicle

1749
01:48:58,360 --> 01:49:01,560
that is probably the same thing where it's suspended with cables

1750
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:05,720
or whatever, but you could tilt the actual seats inside as well.

1751
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:07,480
Ooh, to make you look up to the top.

1752
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:09,480
Right, so you could more comfortably look up

1753
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:11,560
and see what the screen is showing you.

1754
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:13,480
Yeah, and I'm guessing you could do it where

1755
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:16,520
there's like almost like two layers

1756
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:19,880
that makes the screen look a little more like real versus

1757
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:23,000
just having it be like an LCD screen above your head.

1758
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:26,840
But yeah, if you could tilt it up as well to sort of see things.

1759
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:30,040
I don't know if that's what they're doing, but I don't know if there's anything

1760
01:49:30,040 --> 01:49:32,920
they couldn't do easily and re-theme.

1761
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:37,480
That's a pretty big upgrade from hard metal benches.

1762
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:38,440
Yes.

1763
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:40,360
Oh, yeah, and again, I don't know if they're doing it.

1764
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:43,080
I was just trying to think of a way to comfortably make people

1765
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:46,120
be able to look up while they're dropping.

1766
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:49,640
In the Marvel neck of the woods, let's talk about Deadpool.

1767
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:53,400
Deadpool, we completely called this in general,

1768
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:56,200
that of Deadpool appearing on stage.

1769
01:49:56,200 --> 01:50:01,400
And boy, we had no idea that it would just become Deadpool for a long time.

1770
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:02,360
And let me say this.

1771
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:04,040
We've snarked about Deadpool.

1772
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:06,600
We've said Chimichanga derisively.

1773
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:07,880
It's not really my deal.

1774
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:10,760
I even rushed out to see this film.

1775
01:50:10,760 --> 01:50:13,400
All that said, I enjoyed all of this.

1776
01:50:13,400 --> 01:50:13,880
It was good.

1777
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:15,480
I thought it was funny.

1778
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:17,960
I thought it was the best musical performance.

1779
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:18,360
Yeah.

1780
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:23,080
This big performance of Like a Prayer, which is apparently Deadpool's song now.

1781
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:28,440
But this conceit that he had made all of this concept art for rides that he wants to do

1782
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:34,040
and that he did for this kind of thing, cutting jokes.

1783
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:36,280
He joked about Broken Yeti.

1784
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:42,440
He joked about several times about Phantasmac Dragon lighting on fire.

1785
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:46,040
These were like, there's a different type of Disney company that does not

1786
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:49,880
like any sass about any of this stuff.

1787
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:51,240
And I was pretty impressed.

1788
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:58,440
I think I liked the comedic tenor and the aesthetics of this Deadpool appearance very much.

1789
01:50:58,440 --> 01:50:58,840
Sure.

1790
01:50:58,840 --> 01:50:59,080
I agree.

1791
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:04,440
Did he make a little joke about like, Josh, go backstage, find yourself a new sweater?

1792
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:06,040
Well, this is something I wanted to bring up.

1793
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:07,800
The debate?

1794
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:11,800
Let's go to our From the Second Gate episode.

1795
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,480
We all agreed that Deadpool would appear.

1796
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:16,360
So that's the base.

1797
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:18,600
So that's a given.

1798
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:20,280
We were smart about something.

1799
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:24,680
My bet was, well, here, let me say, it's better to go in this order.

1800
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:29,320
Jason's bet was that he would roast the underwhelming nature of previous D23s.

1801
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:33,960
Mike's bet was that he would joke about the attractiveness of Josh Demaro.

1802
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:36,840
I said he would appear, but he would not make any of these jokes.

1803
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:39,960
Now, I was getting ready to say that I was correct on this.

1804
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:41,560
Jason, unfortunately, was incorrect.

1805
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:46,920
Mike, I think you and I have to sign off on this and turn the keys, Jason.

1806
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:51,800
I think that referring to, why don't you go find yourself another tight-knit sweater?

1807
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:55,640
Though it's about the clothes and not the physical appearance,

1808
01:51:55,640 --> 01:52:00,360
I am willing to say that this is a joke about Josh Demaro's being daddy.

1809
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:01,560
I will give it to Mike.

1810
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:01,960
OK.

1811
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:02,440
Thank you.

1812
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:06,120
He also called him a dime store something, and I forget what it was.

1813
01:52:06,120 --> 01:52:07,160
Dime store Eiger?

1814
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:08,840
I don't know.

1815
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:09,720
I forget what it was.

1816
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:14,200
And then he did make a comment about Stamos being attractive, too.

1817
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:14,700
Oh, right.

1818
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:19,080
But I feel like all that adds up to I was right.

1819
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:19,400
Yeah.

1820
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:19,960
No, you're right.

1821
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:21,960
So that's a win for you.

1822
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:22,920
So yeah, good job.

1823
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:23,320
And you know what?

1824
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:25,080
It was later in the segment, too.

1825
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:28,120
He actually came back, and that was a later thing he did.

1826
01:52:28,120 --> 01:52:31,880
So I put that as a win for me, but we're putting it in the column for you.

1827
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:32,680
So congratulations.

1828
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:34,440
I love that we're all right about Deadpool.

1829
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:34,920
Yeah, yeah.

1830
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:35,560
That's right.

1831
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:39,080
And yeah, I think I saw some reaction of like, jeez, they really had.

1832
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:42,120
We had no idea how much it would be Deadpool.

1833
01:52:42,120 --> 01:52:49,800
Down to where, let me say, I think if they did a ride with this tenor, I think it'd be good.

1834
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:57,480
I think, imagine something that Deadpool has set up that is like a parody of rides.

1835
01:52:57,480 --> 01:53:01,560
Something that if we lose the Simpsons ride, there won't really be that.

1836
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:08,600
So if Deadpool has set up some sort of thing to shit on Disney and rides and theme park tropes

1837
01:53:08,600 --> 01:53:16,120
in general, and maybe the ride itself is cruddy and does bad impressions of the kind of moves

1838
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:22,840
that we know a ride can do, but then there is a sincere threat halfway through and he has to

1839
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:26,360
commit more fully and save us from something.

1840
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:31,320
But does that not seem like if I would not complain about a ride that's all set up,

1841
01:53:31,320 --> 01:53:37,320
all shitty, it kind of makes good on the promise of remember that there's that idea of like a

1842
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:39,240
Muppet ride.

1843
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:39,720
Oh, yeah.

1844
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:43,000
I'm conflating the movie in there.

1845
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,240
Yeah, there was going to be a Muppet movie where the budget got slashed,

1846
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:47,000
that she was a Muppet movie or made.

1847
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:49,080
But like, I don't know.

1848
01:53:49,080 --> 01:53:50,360
That is a ride premise.

1849
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:51,720
I think it'd be kind of cool.

1850
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:52,040
Yeah.

1851
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:53,880
Well, a couple of weeks ago, I said,

1852
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:58,600
Deadpool ride after this thing makes a billion dollars and it just crossed a billion dollars.

1853
01:53:58,600 --> 01:53:59,080
Wow.

1854
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:02,920
And the story time is a big hit.

1855
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:03,880
Big hit.

1856
01:54:03,880 --> 01:54:04,760
In the park.

1857
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:06,040
It's making body jokes.

1858
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:06,440
I'll say this.

1859
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:07,480
I can't wait to see it.

1860
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:14,440
I think most characters at this point in time are technically Avengers in the Marvel Universe

1861
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:15,640
at some point or another.

1862
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:16,920
Oh, he's in the Avengers movies.

1863
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:21,400
No, obviously, I'm saying put Deadpool in the Avengers ride.

1864
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:22,840
Oh, I think he will pop up.

1865
01:54:23,080 --> 01:54:25,240
Because see, it's the latest movie.

1866
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:26,440
I haven't seen it either.

1867
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:28,440
But there's a multiverse element.

1868
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,760
The ride's a multiverse story.

1869
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:31,880
Yeah, get him in there.

1870
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:32,360
But yeah.

1871
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:33,720
Get him in Jackman.

1872
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:34,220
Yes.

1873
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:41,080
Hopefully, they will do something like this because Deadpool being in the parks,

1874
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:44,680
and this is it's embarrassing to say something where you're like,

1875
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:46,760
Deadpool gives an energy to the parks.

1876
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:48,120
That is good.

1877
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:50,200
And like, did to the panel.

1878
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:51,480
And did to the panel.

1879
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:53,960
And Deadpool, the guy, whoever they have playing,

1880
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:57,560
probably multiple people, but whoever they have playing Deadpool is doing a good job.

1881
01:54:57,560 --> 01:55:01,480
I have on this show said that I prefer a certain characterization of Deadpool

1882
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:03,560
versus the Reynolds characterization.

1883
01:55:03,560 --> 01:55:07,080
But you got to give Ryan some credit for making it work

1884
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:10,280
and making Deadpool like the Bugs Bunny of the modern era,

1885
01:55:10,280 --> 01:55:11,800
which is what Deadpool is.

1886
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:12,300
Yeah.

1887
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:17,640
It's certainly a type of, like as not a Marvel person,

1888
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:24,840
I just from the outside, a lot of parts of it just seem like piss could be taken out of it.

1889
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:25,400
Right?

1890
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:25,720
Sure.

1891
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:28,840
That's what he's doing, then neat.

1892
01:55:28,840 --> 01:55:34,440
Well, it speaks more to how uptight the Disney company is

1893
01:55:35,480 --> 01:55:38,440
more than crazy Deadpool is, I think.

1894
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:41,000
But Deadpool, watching these story times with Deadpool,

1895
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
I'm just like, wow, he went there.

1896
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:47,080
I'm like an older, like, oh my goodness, what is he saying?

1897
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:48,760
And like, this is outrageous.

1898
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:49,960
Collecting your pearls.

1899
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:50,920
Yeah, yeah.

1900
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:52,920
But I go, well, maybe I like this.

1901
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:55,960
Maybe I like a little bit of a bawdier entertainment at Disney.

1902
01:55:55,960 --> 01:56:00,680
My God, I thought I was offended, but here I am and I think that I'm popping.

1903
01:56:00,680 --> 01:56:02,280
Right, I'm popping hard.

1904
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:03,960
I'm popping hard is what I said.

1905
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,040
But yeah, you know, you're right.

1906
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:10,440
And everything seems like it takes forever at Disney

1907
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:13,560
and like, because all these ideas finally 20 years later, they're getting built.

1908
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:15,400
So maybe in 20 years, they'll do Deadpool.

1909
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:17,400
But there's so much stuff.

1910
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:20,840
There's so much Marvel stuff that would make incredible rides.

1911
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:22,760
And this is absolutely one of them.

1912
01:56:22,760 --> 01:56:25,720
And it's got the money now to back it up.

1913
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:29,000
What if you did a ride that what I was saying about it, he set it up all shitty.

1914
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:35,640
What if it felt like at the beginning, like a janky carnival, like an awful haunted house?

1915
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:36,120
Yeah.

1916
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:40,440
Like, you know, the kind of just like skeletons popping out, like,

1917
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:46,360
and where it's it does feel like rusty, dangerous, barely dressed at times.

1918
01:56:46,360 --> 01:56:50,680
And then it opens up and turns into and you think that the vehicle can't actually do anything.

1919
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:51,240
Awesome.

1920
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:51,720
Yeah.

1921
01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:52,520
Yeah.

1922
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:54,040
I'll give Ryan Reynolds credit for this, too.

1923
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:59,720
He was saying that he pitched an idea for the movie that was just an indie budget

1924
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:01,880
road trip Deadpool movie with no fighting.

1925
01:57:01,880 --> 01:57:02,600
Something about this.

1926
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:04,360
I'm like, that'd be great.

1927
01:57:04,360 --> 01:57:07,800
Like with I forget the character's name, who's like the cab driver

1928
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:09,800
or whatever from the first two movies.

1929
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:11,640
And I'm like, yeah, why don't they do that?

1930
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:15,880
Like, I've argued for this for years now, but it's just like the house style.

1931
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:17,240
It seems very oppressive.

1932
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:18,040
That's what I mean.

1933
01:57:18,040 --> 01:57:19,320
It's like, yeah, like, I don't know.

1934
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:22,920
Do a movie where like the costs five million dollars.

1935
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:24,120
That's a talkie movie.

1936
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:25,800
And that looks different.

1937
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:27,880
But yeah, I that's a great idea.

1938
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:31,960
I said we should all blue sky on Deadpool rides and maybe we do that soon.

1939
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:32,360
Okay.

1940
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:34,920
Yeah, maybe that's the second case.

1941
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:39,640
There's a lot of Deadpool buzz after his stunning appearance.

1942
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:42,040
He really blew the crowd away.

1943
01:57:42,040 --> 01:57:42,680
Yeah.

1944
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:45,800
But yeah, he's he's made a joke about Logan's run.

1945
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:50,440
There was there was some there was a Wolverine thing because Wolverine's name is Logan Logan.

1946
01:57:50,440 --> 01:57:53,160
But then that results in a Logan's run reference.

1947
01:57:53,160 --> 01:57:54,360
Well, you're after my heart did.

1948
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:56,120
I think he was doing it run.

1949
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:57,800
Not run dancing.

1950
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:00,200
Run Disney.

1951
01:58:00,920 --> 01:58:01,400
Oh, right.

1952
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:01,560
Right.

1953
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:02,280
Oh, that was that.

1954
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:02,760
That was that.

1955
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:03,080
Yeah.

1956
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:03,240
All right.

1957
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:05,400
That's a nice running experience.

1958
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:05,900
Okay.

1959
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:08,860
Um, Walt Robot.

1960
01:58:08,860 --> 01:58:10,060
I feel like I'm speed rounding.

1961
01:58:10,060 --> 01:58:10,460
Oh, yeah.

1962
01:58:10,460 --> 01:58:11,020
Walt Robot.

1963
01:58:11,820 --> 01:58:13,340
Another one Mike was right about.

1964
01:58:13,340 --> 01:58:13,820
Yeah.

1965
01:58:13,820 --> 01:58:14,300
Robot.

1966
01:58:14,300 --> 01:58:15,980
And this was all robot.

1967
01:58:15,980 --> 01:58:16,300
Yeah.

1968
01:58:16,300 --> 01:58:21,660
And this one, I will say this, I by betting the way I bet this year was was I was trying not to

1969
01:58:21,660 --> 01:58:22,780
just go with the conservative.

1970
01:58:22,780 --> 01:58:25,580
This was the closest to a conservative bet I made.

1971
01:58:25,580 --> 01:58:27,260
I was trying to not just go.

1972
01:58:27,260 --> 01:58:27,500
Okay.

1973
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:28,380
This is what the.

1974
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:29,020
You've gotten strong.

1975
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:30,380
YouTubers.

1976
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:33,900
But yeah, so so this was the most sure thing bet I made.

1977
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:34,380
Yeah.

1978
01:58:34,380 --> 01:58:36,780
Because it just seemed like, well, what else is going in there?

1979
01:58:36,780 --> 01:58:39,260
Everyone is saying it's some sort of Walt show.

1980
01:58:39,820 --> 01:58:41,020
And yes, they confirmed it.

1981
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:42,780
Walt Disney in his office.

1982
01:58:43,420 --> 01:58:45,820
You will get to see a little show that he does.

1983
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:52,060
Will there be a Meghan Trainor feed the birds audio track playing during it?

1984
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:52,460
I don't know.

1985
01:58:52,460 --> 01:58:55,020
Hopefully the original will be playing.

1986
01:58:55,020 --> 01:58:55,740
That was yeah.

1987
01:58:55,740 --> 01:58:57,660
So yeah, we got because they tie it.

1988
01:58:57,660 --> 01:59:02,060
You know, they get into emotion when Walt comes up and they get into Sherman Brothers

1989
01:59:02,060 --> 01:59:06,860
and that he's just the kind of imagine just sitting in his office and hearing a song

1990
01:59:06,860 --> 01:59:07,740
that he loves.

1991
01:59:07,740 --> 01:59:11,340
Then you get the full performance of feed the birds.

1992
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:12,060
He did all of it.

1993
01:59:12,060 --> 01:59:12,540
And train her.

1994
01:59:12,540 --> 01:59:13,260
Yeah.

1995
01:59:13,260 --> 01:59:17,740
Which what I don't like about it, as of noted, Meghan Trainor fan.

1996
01:59:17,740 --> 01:59:17,980
Yeah.

1997
01:59:17,980 --> 01:59:21,660
I feel like they kind of zapped the personality out of her and made her just do it.

1998
01:59:22,460 --> 01:59:23,180
Serious.

1999
01:59:23,180 --> 01:59:25,100
And that's not what Megan's about.

2000
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:26,540
And I feel like they should have done.

2001
01:59:26,540 --> 01:59:28,220
They should have let her go.

2002
01:59:28,220 --> 01:59:29,100
Megan with it.

2003
01:59:29,100 --> 01:59:29,500
You know.

2004
01:59:29,500 --> 01:59:29,900
Sure.

2005
01:59:29,900 --> 01:59:36,300
Do it like a bubblegum pop song from 1960 with really tinny drums, you know?

2006
01:59:36,300 --> 01:59:39,260
Why was it not more like a feed the birds?

2007
01:59:39,260 --> 01:59:40,300
A tuppence of it.

2008
01:59:41,020 --> 01:59:42,220
You got to feed the birds.

2009
01:59:42,220 --> 01:59:43,740
Gotta gotta feed the birds.

2010
01:59:45,260 --> 01:59:49,100
The Megan Maniac has hijacked the show again.

2011
01:59:49,100 --> 01:59:50,060
Yeah, feed the birds.

2012
01:59:50,060 --> 01:59:51,580
But is she serving the birds?

2013
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:52,220
You know what I'm saying?

2014
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:54,700
Is she serving the birds?

2015
01:59:54,700 --> 01:59:55,580
Tuppence of bag.

2016
01:59:55,580 --> 01:59:57,100
But is it a Gucci bag?

2017
01:59:57,980 --> 01:59:59,900
Is it from a Gucci bag?

2018
01:59:59,900 --> 02:00:00,460
La la la.

2019
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:03,820
Oh, man.

2020
02:00:03,820 --> 02:00:04,700
You should have bet on that.

2021
02:00:04,700 --> 02:00:06,220
I mean, it wouldn't come true, but you should have bet on that.

2022
02:00:06,220 --> 02:00:07,740
Why didn't I bet on Meghan Trainor?

2023
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:08,460
That's as sure of a bet as you're going to get.

2024
02:00:08,460 --> 02:00:09,980
I swear that's another thought I had.

2025
02:00:09,980 --> 02:00:11,340
I go, when is Meghan Trainor show?

2026
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:13,900
I guess it was not when we ruined the betting, but when the thing started

2027
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:16,780
and I saw how many musical performances there was, I was like,

2028
02:00:16,780 --> 02:00:18,380
Meghan Trainor's got to be coming.

2029
02:00:18,380 --> 02:00:18,700
Yeah.

2030
02:00:18,700 --> 02:00:19,740
She's got to be here.

2031
02:00:19,740 --> 02:00:26,860
Well, and then we got the kind of a tenuous connection of all for one is here to announce.

2032
02:00:27,180 --> 02:00:28,940
Four new cruise ships.

2033
02:00:28,940 --> 02:00:29,420
Yeah.

2034
02:00:29,420 --> 02:00:29,980
All right.

2035
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:30,300
Yeah.

2036
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:35,660
Bunch of cruise ship stuff in their name, but they don't explain that.

2037
02:00:35,660 --> 02:00:39,500
You just get a full performance of I swear and unexplained,

2038
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:42,700
and then they say, but why are their names very appropriate for this?

2039
02:00:42,700 --> 02:00:49,100
Because we're opening one, two, three, four, four new ships.

2040
02:00:49,100 --> 02:00:52,460
But the ships are not going to be all for one.

2041
02:00:52,460 --> 02:00:53,020
No.

2042
02:00:53,020 --> 02:00:56,860
There is not going to be one price that gets you access to all four of the ships.

2043
02:00:56,860 --> 02:00:59,740
So if anything, I'd say their name is absolutely inappropriate.

2044
02:01:00,700 --> 02:01:02,700
This was one of the most confusing things.

2045
02:01:02,700 --> 02:01:05,180
I'm never mad when I see all for one, by the way.

2046
02:01:05,180 --> 02:01:05,660
Not their fault.

2047
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:07,100
No problem with that, no.

2048
02:01:07,100 --> 02:01:12,460
But I was like, whoa, this was tenuous at best, this connection.

2049
02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:13,020
Yeah, yeah.

2050
02:01:14,140 --> 02:01:20,140
And I feel like there's more cruise ship stuff to talk about before we do it.

2051
02:01:20,140 --> 02:01:23,180
I'd just like to do a brief performance of the entire song,

2052
02:01:23,180 --> 02:01:25,260
I Love You Always Forever by Donna Lewis.

2053
02:01:25,260 --> 02:01:25,820
Is that OK?

2054
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:27,020
Yeah, sure.

2055
02:01:27,020 --> 02:01:29,100
I love you always forever.

2056
02:01:32,620 --> 02:01:37,660
It's as, because I will love going on ships always and forever.

2057
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:41,900
On that ship front, here's a bet.

2058
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:43,580
I started a stopwatch on this.

2059
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:47,420
One of the bets was how many minutes, this is my proposal,

2060
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:49,500
was how many minutes they will do on cruise ships.

2061
02:01:51,100 --> 02:01:54,220
Mike's bet was five, I was eight, Jason went with 12.

2062
02:01:54,220 --> 02:01:58,380
But I did say price is right rules, closest without going over.

2063
02:01:58,380 --> 02:02:04,140
And actually, either way, even without that, because it nudged up to 10 minutes,

2064
02:02:04,140 --> 02:02:07,820
and I'd say 15 seconds, thus getting it.

2065
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:10,620
And now, but Mike had a point of debate.

2066
02:02:10,620 --> 02:02:11,180
Well, right.

2067
02:02:11,180 --> 02:02:15,580
My question was, do the musical performances then count in our bet?

2068
02:02:15,580 --> 02:02:19,340
Because we said how much talk, I do think we said talk specifically.

2069
02:02:19,340 --> 02:02:21,660
How much cruise ship talk would there be?

2070
02:02:21,660 --> 02:02:22,380
Talk.

2071
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:26,220
So obviously, that all for one thing was part of the cruise ship announcement,

2072
02:02:26,220 --> 02:02:27,900
but it was not talk, it was sing.

2073
02:02:27,900 --> 02:02:30,060
We didn't say how much cruise ship sing will there be.

2074
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:33,260
There was so much music.

2075
02:02:33,260 --> 02:02:39,820
I think it would be impossible to, it would take days to figure out how much talk.

2076
02:02:39,820 --> 02:02:43,260
This is also the template, this whole show is a template going forward for these.

2077
02:02:43,900 --> 02:02:45,740
I think all of our bets will be different now,

2078
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:49,500
because as soon as the show felt different immediately from years past,

2079
02:02:49,500 --> 02:02:52,460
and I was like, ah, I would bet differently on a few things maybe.

2080
02:02:52,460 --> 02:02:52,940
Well, we're learning.

2081
02:02:52,940 --> 02:02:57,100
As soon as the cruise ship segment started, I went, I should have said 10.

2082
02:02:57,740 --> 02:02:59,580
I got too greedy with 12.

2083
02:02:59,580 --> 02:03:02,460
But then, I don't know, actually, I felt the opposite.

2084
02:03:02,460 --> 02:03:06,140
As soon as it started, I tweeted smart monies on Jason here,

2085
02:03:06,140 --> 02:03:07,340
the way these have been paced.

2086
02:03:07,340 --> 02:03:10,540
I think they say ships, and they finish talking about ships.

2087
02:03:10,540 --> 02:03:15,420
And if they fill that with two entire songs, then they do, I'm giving it to Jason.

2088
02:03:15,660 --> 02:03:16,540
All right, he can have it.

2089
02:03:16,540 --> 02:03:24,060
I just, I was upset with my thinking after this, because I was like, ah, this music patted out.

2090
02:03:24,060 --> 02:03:26,700
Because really, they didn't talk that much about the ships.

2091
02:03:26,700 --> 02:03:29,740
I think there was a world where you were thinking there would be 10 minutes of-

2092
02:03:29,740 --> 02:03:31,340
With talk, I think it's you.

2093
02:03:31,340 --> 02:03:32,380
Right, yes.

2094
02:03:32,380 --> 02:03:37,820
I was technically more correct, because they oftentimes go on and on about these ships,

2095
02:03:37,820 --> 02:03:38,700
I feel like, of these things.

2096
02:03:38,700 --> 02:03:41,900
And this was a quick one, by the way, we're tripling the fleet,

2097
02:03:41,900 --> 02:03:44,940
or doubling the fleet, whatever it is, four, I don't know.

2098
02:03:45,660 --> 02:03:50,460
And it's just like, we're continuing, we're going to have 10 million people at sea,

2099
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:52,860
every moment of every day for the rest of our lives.

2100
02:03:52,860 --> 02:03:55,900
Not to suddenly bring up environmental concerns,

2101
02:03:55,900 --> 02:03:58,540
but I've seen a lot of cruise ship companies go like,

2102
02:03:58,540 --> 02:03:59,980
we're building more ships.

2103
02:03:59,980 --> 02:04:02,700
And I was like, oh, do we need, do we need that?

2104
02:04:03,740 --> 02:04:06,460
Do we need that many ships in the ocean?

2105
02:04:06,460 --> 02:04:08,940
I'm not excited, any thoughts about what that does.

2106
02:04:08,940 --> 02:04:10,620
I mean, it's probably been good.

2107
02:04:10,620 --> 02:04:12,300
Flying a plane is also bad.

2108
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:15,420
So Price is Right rules, wouldn't that be you won that bet?

2109
02:04:15,420 --> 02:04:17,020
No, close this without going over.

2110
02:04:17,580 --> 02:04:19,260
I think that's right.

2111
02:04:19,260 --> 02:04:20,380
What did Jason say it was?

2112
02:04:20,380 --> 02:04:21,180
I said 12.

2113
02:04:22,060 --> 02:04:23,340
Oh, but we all went over then.

2114
02:04:24,300 --> 02:04:24,860
Oh, wait.

2115
02:04:25,900 --> 02:04:28,620
Wait, you said it was like 10 and change.

2116
02:04:28,620 --> 02:04:30,940
It does, I thought it meant that it doesn't go over you.

2117
02:04:30,940 --> 02:04:32,300
Oh, you could go over the-

2118
02:04:32,300 --> 02:04:33,900
Oh, God, what is the Price is Right rule?

2119
02:04:33,900 --> 02:04:35,500
Sorry, listener, sorry.

2120
02:04:35,500 --> 02:04:38,220
So if you bet, so somebody says a dollar on Price is Right,

2121
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:42,220
then the next person says 99 cents, anything under 99 cents wins.

2122
02:04:42,540 --> 02:04:43,900
Basically, right?

2123
02:04:44,780 --> 02:04:45,900
Isn't that how it works?

2124
02:04:45,900 --> 02:04:47,820
God, did you undercut the person?

2125
02:04:47,820 --> 02:04:51,420
Oh, so why don't I know this before I say it?

2126
02:04:52,540 --> 02:04:53,820
Well, welcome to podcast.

2127
02:04:56,060 --> 02:05:01,340
If I think at eight, you are not going over.

2128
02:05:02,380 --> 02:05:04,940
It's 10 and change, but I went over with 12.

2129
02:05:04,940 --> 02:05:05,980
Oh, okay.

2130
02:05:05,980 --> 02:05:07,900
So I'm being honest here.

2131
02:05:07,900 --> 02:05:14,300
Oh, yeah, if the calculation for music and talking was 10, 15,

2132
02:05:14,300 --> 02:05:15,820
then Scott wins.

2133
02:05:15,820 --> 02:05:16,940
Jason went over, yeah.

2134
02:05:16,940 --> 02:05:17,980
Oh, all right.

2135
02:05:17,980 --> 02:05:19,100
Yeah, good catch.

2136
02:05:19,900 --> 02:05:20,940
I think I understand the rules,

2137
02:05:20,940 --> 02:05:22,860
and I didn't even catch that when you were talking about it.

2138
02:05:22,860 --> 02:05:25,260
Oh, okay, jeez, this will be driving

2139
02:05:25,260 --> 02:05:27,980
Price is Right contestant Aaron, my wife, crazy.

2140
02:05:29,980 --> 02:05:31,500
I still technically won, but you win.

2141
02:05:32,220 --> 02:05:33,740
You went over, wow, wow.

2142
02:05:34,540 --> 02:05:35,420
I thought I went over.

2143
02:05:35,420 --> 02:05:36,220
Anyway, sorry, boring.

2144
02:05:37,180 --> 02:05:40,700
Okay, I mean, what do we think about this Walt show, though?

2145
02:05:40,700 --> 02:05:42,940
The Walt show, here's what?

2146
02:05:42,940 --> 02:05:44,460
We make a lot of fun Walt.

2147
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:46,140
There's a lot of bad things about Walt.

2148
02:05:47,180 --> 02:05:48,860
Will I cry during the show?

2149
02:05:49,740 --> 02:05:52,220
Maybe, I feel like they're going to get you.

2150
02:05:52,220 --> 02:05:55,420
They're going to get you on some kid level of like,

2151
02:05:55,420 --> 02:05:57,900
I'll be with my parents or something and my daughter,

2152
02:05:57,900 --> 02:06:01,660
and then it'll be like they'll play the original Feed the Bird or something.

2153
02:06:01,660 --> 02:06:03,580
I feel like it's going to be good is what I'm saying.

2154
02:06:03,660 --> 02:06:05,180
I feel like they're going to get you

2155
02:06:05,740 --> 02:06:07,580
and all the jokes over the years of Walt.

2156
02:06:07,580 --> 02:06:08,940
It's the Walt show.

2157
02:06:08,940 --> 02:06:12,860
I read, I think it was in the LA Times and Tom Martin's article

2158
02:06:13,820 --> 02:06:18,140
that maybe it was Theme Park Insider Attractions magazine.

2159
02:06:18,140 --> 02:06:20,220
I've read so many roundups, I've lost track,

2160
02:06:20,780 --> 02:06:23,740
that it will have an initial run,

2161
02:06:23,740 --> 02:06:29,020
and then after that, it's going to play in conjunction with Lincoln.

2162
02:06:29,020 --> 02:06:31,740
Right, so it's not, I think what people were thinking before was,

2163
02:06:32,060 --> 02:06:34,940
Walt will introduce Lincoln, but that's I don't think what it is.

2164
02:06:34,940 --> 02:06:37,340
It's going to be just a full Walt show.

2165
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:39,020
It'll run through the 70th,

2166
02:06:39,020 --> 02:06:43,340
and then they'll alternate the Walt show and Lincoln during the day going forward.

2167
02:06:43,340 --> 02:06:46,220
I think it's so funny that with any Lincoln chain,

2168
02:06:46,220 --> 02:06:47,500
and they've done this before,

2169
02:06:47,500 --> 02:06:50,380
it's always like they want to do something else in there.

2170
02:06:51,340 --> 02:06:55,900
It keeps being like, well, think about who thought of this Lincoln show is Walt.

2171
02:06:55,900 --> 02:06:56,780
It's Walt.

2172
02:06:56,780 --> 02:07:01,340
So if we put a Walt thing in there, that basically is a Lincoln thing.

2173
02:07:01,420 --> 02:07:03,660
Well, basically is Abraham Lincoln.

2174
02:07:03,660 --> 02:07:06,300
So you don't get to be mad, do you?

2175
02:07:06,300 --> 02:07:07,820
Actually, you should be very happy, shouldn't you?

2176
02:07:07,820 --> 02:07:11,180
I feel like those meetings boil down to someone going,

2177
02:07:11,180 --> 02:07:14,860
fine, you take a sledgehammer to Abraham Lincoln then.

2178
02:07:16,220 --> 02:07:20,940
This is like a sneaky way to get a different show in there, though,

2179
02:07:20,940 --> 02:07:24,220
in a way where you're like, can you argue with Walt?

2180
02:07:24,220 --> 02:07:26,540
You can't argue with Walt, he's in there.

2181
02:07:26,540 --> 02:07:29,340
And then like, because I think it's a rotating stage now

2182
02:07:29,340 --> 02:07:31,020
where you just rotate the show.

2183
02:07:31,340 --> 02:07:33,100
You do the Lincoln show, you do the Walt show.

2184
02:07:34,380 --> 02:07:38,460
So yeah, I guess you could like, in the middle of the night, in like 2028,

2185
02:07:38,460 --> 02:07:40,380
somebody goes in there and just removes Lincoln.

2186
02:07:40,380 --> 02:07:41,900
And it's like, just shut down.

2187
02:07:42,620 --> 02:07:46,060
And then you don't have to worry about the empty seats in the Lincoln theater.

2188
02:07:47,180 --> 02:07:51,180
Now, do we think it's Walt at a desk talking to you about his ideas,

2189
02:07:51,180 --> 02:07:55,420
or is there any chance that it's him

2190
02:07:56,220 --> 02:07:58,940
needing a little bit of extra nursing of that polo injury?

2191
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:03,820
And we also build a robot of his nurse or helper or whatever.

2192
02:08:04,380 --> 02:08:05,660
Yes, I had the same thought.

2193
02:08:05,660 --> 02:08:08,780
Will we see the office that Walt would go into

2194
02:08:08,780 --> 02:08:11,260
with his nurse to get his polo injury worked on?

2195
02:08:11,260 --> 02:08:11,660
Yeah.

2196
02:08:11,660 --> 02:08:14,460
Which we determined had to be some sex thing.

2197
02:08:14,460 --> 02:08:15,260
So is it going to be?

2198
02:08:16,700 --> 02:08:17,200
Possibly.

2199
02:08:18,220 --> 02:08:18,700
Yeah.

2200
02:08:18,700 --> 02:08:21,180
A weird, whatever it was, it was weird, I believe.

2201
02:08:21,740 --> 02:08:24,700
Like she would put a glove on and like just stimulate him over his pant.

2202
02:08:24,700 --> 02:08:26,540
Like something was odd about it, I bet.

2203
02:08:26,540 --> 02:08:27,660
That was very odd.

2204
02:08:28,140 --> 02:08:29,580
She put a glove on.

2205
02:08:29,580 --> 02:08:30,860
It just is off the top of my head.

2206
02:08:30,860 --> 02:08:32,620
It keeps it medical if there's a glove.

2207
02:08:32,620 --> 02:08:33,180
That's what I'm saying.

2208
02:08:33,180 --> 02:08:36,460
I think there's some version of it we're not even imagining

2209
02:08:36,460 --> 02:08:39,820
that made whatever the sexual encounter was that he would have odd.

2210
02:08:40,460 --> 02:08:41,980
But it was no doubt odd.

2211
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:43,020
That's what I believe.

2212
02:08:43,020 --> 02:08:43,580
Yeah.

2213
02:08:43,580 --> 02:08:46,780
Well, then the question is, will it be like real audio of him?

2214
02:08:46,780 --> 02:08:49,340
And like, we'll never forget it all started with him.

2215
02:08:49,340 --> 02:08:55,180
Or is it mostly, oh, oh, right there, right there.

2216
02:08:55,660 --> 02:09:01,180
Actually, actually a different part needs some massaging at the moment.

2217
02:09:01,180 --> 02:09:04,860
Maybe it's not on my back right now.

2218
02:09:04,860 --> 02:09:05,900
What is this woman's name?

2219
02:09:05,900 --> 02:09:06,540
We've talked about her before.

2220
02:09:06,540 --> 02:09:06,860
I know.

2221
02:09:06,860 --> 02:09:07,340
I don't remember.

2222
02:09:07,340 --> 02:09:07,820
Look her up.

2223
02:09:07,820 --> 02:09:08,300
Somebody look her up.

2224
02:09:08,300 --> 02:09:09,660
It's been a long time.

2225
02:09:09,660 --> 02:09:11,500
I think it'll be like Carousel of Progress,

2226
02:09:11,500 --> 02:09:13,500
where they can like light that area of the room.

2227
02:09:14,700 --> 02:09:15,340
Oh, sure.

2228
02:09:15,340 --> 02:09:16,700
And then you could see through his office

2229
02:09:16,700 --> 02:09:18,940
and the nurses in there like waiting for him.

2230
02:09:18,940 --> 02:09:19,260
All right.

2231
02:09:19,260 --> 02:09:21,900
Google, Walt Scotch Mist Glove Lady.

2232
02:09:21,980 --> 02:09:25,260
Walt Scotch Mist Glove Lady Massage Butt Sex.

2233
02:09:26,860 --> 02:09:28,060
It's not coming together.

2234
02:09:28,940 --> 02:09:30,300
Another drink.

2235
02:09:30,300 --> 02:09:31,260
Easy on the ice.

2236
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:33,180
Hazel George.

2237
02:09:33,180 --> 02:09:34,540
Nurse Hazel George.

2238
02:09:34,540 --> 02:09:35,100
That's right.

2239
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:35,580
That's right.

2240
02:09:35,580 --> 02:09:36,540
We've done an episode on this.

2241
02:09:36,540 --> 02:09:38,780
Who then like spent a lot of time with Michael Jackson.

2242
02:09:38,780 --> 02:09:39,660
Yes.

2243
02:09:39,660 --> 02:09:39,980
Yes.

2244
02:09:39,980 --> 02:09:41,100
That's a second gate episode.

2245
02:09:41,100 --> 02:09:44,220
If you haven't heard, go back and listen too.

2246
02:09:44,220 --> 02:09:45,500
Because that's fascinating.

2247
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:45,980
Yeah.

2248
02:09:45,980 --> 02:09:50,060
Michael sought out Walt's nurse, Hazel George,

2249
02:09:50,860 --> 02:09:52,780
and asked her a bunch of questions about Walt.

2250
02:09:52,780 --> 02:09:55,500
Like did Walt, I think, didn't he like, did Walt swear?

2251
02:09:55,500 --> 02:09:57,340
You're also a glove enthusiast.

2252
02:09:57,340 --> 02:09:59,340
Can I bring up Michael real quick?

2253
02:09:59,340 --> 02:10:02,060
The night before the panel with all the movies

2254
02:10:02,060 --> 02:10:05,020
where they just like everything was a sequel and stuff,

2255
02:10:05,020 --> 02:10:06,220
it felt to me in a similar way

2256
02:10:06,220 --> 02:10:08,700
when Michael Jackson announced those like 50 concerts

2257
02:10:09,580 --> 02:10:11,660
on both like in England and here where you're like,

2258
02:10:11,660 --> 02:10:12,620
oh, they need money.

2259
02:10:12,620 --> 02:10:13,980
They're looking for money here.

2260
02:10:13,980 --> 02:10:14,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2261
02:10:14,620 --> 02:10:16,780
Like there was a similar feeling I had where it was like,

2262
02:10:16,780 --> 02:10:18,460
oh, they need the money.

2263
02:10:18,460 --> 02:10:19,020
OK, got it.

2264
02:10:19,020 --> 02:10:21,580
Yeah, the famous announced tour, Michael Jackson's

2265
02:10:21,580 --> 02:10:22,700
This Will Happen.

2266
02:10:22,700 --> 02:10:23,180
Right.

2267
02:10:24,380 --> 02:10:26,380
I remember staring at that schedule going,

2268
02:10:26,380 --> 02:10:29,900
oh, whoa, no, no, Michael needs money,

2269
02:10:29,900 --> 02:10:31,500
and oh, I don't think this is going to happen.

2270
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:35,580
And it did not happen for one very apparent reason.

2271
02:10:35,580 --> 02:10:39,660
The real name, This Is It, which proved eerily correct.

2272
02:10:39,660 --> 02:10:40,540
Yes, that was it.

2273
02:10:40,540 --> 02:10:43,260
They meant the press conference, not the shows.

2274
02:10:43,260 --> 02:10:46,620
When Michael Jackson died, did any police detective go like,

2275
02:10:47,420 --> 02:10:51,340
this woman was involved with Walt Disney and Michael Jackson.

2276
02:10:51,340 --> 02:10:53,100
Was she a person of interest as well?

2277
02:10:53,100 --> 02:10:55,020
Did Hazel George give him the propofol?

2278
02:10:55,020 --> 02:10:57,100
Oh, she gave him the special.

2279
02:10:57,100 --> 02:11:00,460
I'm just saying they both passed not too long after.

2280
02:11:00,460 --> 02:11:02,460
Jason's and Michael Jackson truth are in the sense

2281
02:11:02,460 --> 02:11:05,420
that he thinks that Hazel George gave him the propofol,

2282
02:11:05,420 --> 02:11:07,340
not Dr. Conrad Murray.

2283
02:11:07,340 --> 02:11:08,620
Wow, I've never heard this before.

2284
02:11:08,620 --> 02:11:09,420
This is a new one.

2285
02:11:09,420 --> 02:11:13,020
OK, look, there's been a lot of smirching of my godfather,

2286
02:11:13,020 --> 02:11:14,140
Dr. Conrad.

2287
02:11:17,580 --> 02:11:21,100
Well, I'd say, and then you go like, well,

2288
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:23,900
we did a forensic search, which led us to discover

2289
02:11:23,900 --> 02:11:26,780
that Hazel George died in 1996.

2290
02:11:26,780 --> 02:11:30,140
But other than that, I don't see why Mr. Sheridan's theory

2291
02:11:30,140 --> 02:11:31,820
couldn't be partially true.

2292
02:11:31,820 --> 02:11:36,140
I would like to see him do his Jesse Ventura-style conspiracy

2293
02:11:36,140 --> 02:11:38,060
theory show, where he talks about some of his theories.

2294
02:11:38,060 --> 02:11:41,420
I'm going to find the culprit in the Black Dahlia case.

2295
02:11:41,420 --> 02:11:43,260
I'm going to find the Zodiac killer.

2296
02:11:43,260 --> 02:11:46,060
A nurse or so she says.

2297
02:11:46,140 --> 02:11:47,900
What does that even mean, really?

2298
02:11:51,820 --> 02:11:53,980
So what have we missed?

2299
02:11:53,980 --> 02:11:55,660
I mean, I don't think we have to name check

2300
02:11:55,660 --> 02:11:57,020
everything in any particular.

2301
02:11:57,020 --> 02:11:58,780
But are we missing a big area?

2302
02:11:58,780 --> 02:11:59,260
Probably somewhere.

2303
02:11:59,260 --> 02:12:00,380
Before we kind of like wrap up.

2304
02:12:00,380 --> 02:12:01,580
With the big stuff.

2305
02:12:01,580 --> 02:12:02,700
Yeah, and where's the bets?

2306
02:12:02,700 --> 02:12:04,860
Before we end with the big thing is this.

2307
02:12:04,860 --> 02:12:06,860
There's no Tomorrowland announcement.

2308
02:12:08,620 --> 02:12:11,180
I will tell you, my confidence level of Tomorrowland

2309
02:12:11,180 --> 02:12:14,140
announcement happening during the whole ceremony,

2310
02:12:14,140 --> 02:12:15,340
or whatever it's called, show.

2311
02:12:16,140 --> 02:12:16,700
Was high.

2312
02:12:17,260 --> 02:12:17,820
Really?

2313
02:12:17,820 --> 02:12:18,540
It was high.

2314
02:12:18,540 --> 02:12:21,100
Because, and it kept getting higher and higher and higher.

2315
02:12:21,100 --> 02:12:23,580
They teased Tomorrowland.

2316
02:12:23,580 --> 02:12:25,020
They played some Space Mountain early on.

2317
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:26,380
Obviously, they played other things, too.

2318
02:12:26,380 --> 02:12:27,980
But there was like Tomorrowland.

2319
02:12:27,980 --> 02:12:29,580
They did a little Space Mountain.

2320
02:12:29,580 --> 02:12:31,900
And then as it's going on, I go, OK, they did it.

2321
02:12:31,900 --> 02:12:32,620
Avatar first.

2322
02:12:32,620 --> 02:12:34,460
That's Disneyland, a California venture.

2323
02:12:34,460 --> 02:12:35,260
But OK.

2324
02:12:35,260 --> 02:12:36,380
Then they did Walt in the middle.

2325
02:12:37,100 --> 02:12:39,100
And we're going along, and I'm like, they haven't

2326
02:12:39,100 --> 02:12:41,500
announced one big Disneyland thing yet.

2327
02:12:41,500 --> 02:12:42,460
Nothing for Disneyland.

2328
02:12:42,460 --> 02:12:44,700
Nothing for Disneyland other than Walt Robot.

2329
02:12:44,700 --> 02:12:45,740
That is crazy.

2330
02:12:46,060 --> 02:12:47,020
Right, which is crazy.

2331
02:12:47,020 --> 02:12:49,420
So we're going along, and I'm like, they're saving it

2332
02:12:49,420 --> 02:12:49,980
for the end.

2333
02:12:49,980 --> 02:12:51,340
What else could they end?

2334
02:12:51,340 --> 02:12:55,260
I'm like, I was so sure that we were getting it at the end.

2335
02:12:55,260 --> 02:12:57,260
Because I was like, they have to do one big thing

2336
02:12:57,260 --> 02:12:57,900
for Disneyland.

2337
02:12:57,900 --> 02:13:01,340
It would be wild not to do one big announcement for Disneyland

2338
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:03,420
as far as a new ride or an overlay or something.

2339
02:13:03,420 --> 02:13:04,460
They went wild.

2340
02:13:04,460 --> 02:13:05,980
And they went wild.

2341
02:13:05,980 --> 02:13:09,500
They ended with a thing that was obviously very exciting

2342
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:12,140
to see for an American park.

2343
02:13:12,140 --> 02:13:15,740
But my confidence was high during the ceremony.

2344
02:13:15,740 --> 02:13:18,700
As opposed to, here's our audience, a poll

2345
02:13:18,700 --> 02:13:19,820
right before the show.

2346
02:13:19,820 --> 02:13:20,860
What do you think we get tonight?

2347
02:13:20,860 --> 02:13:22,060
Tomorrowland plus PeopleMover?

2348
02:13:22,060 --> 02:13:23,340
Tomorrowland, no PeopleMover.

2349
02:13:23,340 --> 02:13:24,220
Neither one.

2350
02:13:24,220 --> 02:13:26,540
Neither one, 70%.

2351
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:28,860
Well, that's always the easy bet when you're talking

2352
02:13:28,860 --> 02:13:30,700
about Disney and a thing like this.

2353
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:32,700
Well, I understand why they said that.

2354
02:13:32,700 --> 02:13:35,580
It's where our audience, that's what they felt.

2355
02:13:35,580 --> 02:13:38,700
Though they were also wrong then on the nothing yet

2356
02:13:38,700 --> 02:13:42,140
for Behind Big Thunder, where we did get some stuff, obviously.

2357
02:13:42,140 --> 02:13:43,500
But yeah, Tomorrowland after.

2358
02:13:43,500 --> 02:13:46,700
It's also funny that, because we've had this Tomorrowland

2359
02:13:46,700 --> 02:13:47,900
plan for a while.

2360
02:13:47,900 --> 02:13:50,540
And we're going to step through these big things

2361
02:13:50,540 --> 02:13:52,220
about Tomorrowland and talk about the decay

2362
02:13:52,220 --> 02:13:53,980
in New Tomorrowland and Rocket Rods

2363
02:13:53,980 --> 02:13:55,740
and then culminate in the Fixing Tomorrowland

2364
02:13:55,740 --> 02:13:56,860
episode that just came out.

2365
02:13:56,860 --> 02:13:58,780
And Mike started putting the heat on us about that,

2366
02:13:58,780 --> 02:13:59,980
like, we got to do that fixing.

2367
02:14:01,740 --> 02:14:04,620
Scott Jason, we got to do that fixing because it's coming up

2368
02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:05,260
and we're going to get it.

2369
02:14:05,260 --> 02:14:06,060
We're getting it this year.

2370
02:14:06,060 --> 02:14:07,020
So make sure that we do it.

2371
02:14:07,020 --> 02:14:07,740
And we got to do it.

2372
02:14:07,740 --> 02:14:08,540
We got nothing.

2373
02:14:08,540 --> 02:14:09,580
We got nothing.

2374
02:14:09,580 --> 02:14:13,260
A prominent source that was correct about other things

2375
02:14:13,340 --> 02:14:16,860
said that this was happening and it did not happen.

2376
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:21,660
So yes, that source was wrong.

2377
02:14:21,660 --> 02:14:22,140
I don't know.

2378
02:14:22,140 --> 02:14:23,420
There was a lot of talk about it.

2379
02:14:23,420 --> 02:14:25,020
A lot of stuff came out of this as well.

2380
02:14:25,020 --> 02:14:26,460
Like, pull was pulled out.

2381
02:14:26,460 --> 02:14:27,740
Obviously, they weren't going to pull Tomorrowland.

2382
02:14:27,740 --> 02:14:29,980
It's a big thing if it was really ready to go

2383
02:14:29,980 --> 02:14:32,300
and they were going to put shovels in the ground immediately.

2384
02:14:32,300 --> 02:14:35,900
But I'm sure they're working on something.

2385
02:14:35,900 --> 02:14:37,420
But will it ever happen?

2386
02:14:37,420 --> 02:14:37,980
I don't know.

2387
02:14:37,980 --> 02:14:39,500
I'm still holding out hope.

2388
02:14:39,500 --> 02:14:43,260
There's a destination D next year, the D23 in two years.

2389
02:14:43,820 --> 02:14:45,580
I think we get it before Disneyland Ford.

2390
02:14:45,580 --> 02:14:46,940
I still believe that.

2391
02:14:46,940 --> 02:14:49,500
And I still think I'm still holding out hope

2392
02:14:49,500 --> 02:14:50,620
even though it did not happen here.

2393
02:14:50,620 --> 02:14:53,420
And I'm glad we did the episode because also there's a chance

2394
02:14:53,420 --> 02:14:55,740
that Friday morning they were ready to go

2395
02:14:55,740 --> 02:14:57,260
with big Tomorrowland plans.

2396
02:14:57,260 --> 02:14:58,700
Somebody threw their phone on the desk

2397
02:14:58,700 --> 02:15:00,860
with an Apple podcast app open and they said,

2398
02:15:00,860 --> 02:15:01,900
listen to this.

2399
02:15:01,900 --> 02:15:04,860
And they heard our pitches for Tomorrowland

2400
02:15:04,860 --> 02:15:06,220
and they said, this is so much better

2401
02:15:06,220 --> 02:15:07,580
than what we have planned.

2402
02:15:07,580 --> 02:15:08,700
We got to scrap the whole thing.

2403
02:15:09,660 --> 02:15:11,900
Or they heard they're on to us about the sod.

2404
02:15:11,900 --> 02:15:13,180
They'll think we stole it from them.

2405
02:15:13,900 --> 02:15:15,100
We don't want a sod gate on our hands.

2406
02:15:15,100 --> 02:15:17,820
It's possible that maybe they didn't even think about sod.

2407
02:15:17,820 --> 02:15:18,700
Maybe they said, you know what?

2408
02:15:18,700 --> 02:15:20,140
We should put a new sod in this.

2409
02:15:20,140 --> 02:15:22,540
We don't put this into the actual presentation.

2410
02:15:22,540 --> 02:15:23,660
People are going to riot.

2411
02:15:23,660 --> 02:15:25,500
And they pulled it out and they decided to go

2412
02:15:25,500 --> 02:15:27,020
with Villain's Land as the end.

2413
02:15:27,020 --> 02:15:30,140
The little one was kind of prickly about the Ant-Man ride.

2414
02:15:30,140 --> 02:15:31,580
We need to remove it now.

2415
02:15:32,220 --> 02:15:32,460
Right?

2416
02:15:32,460 --> 02:15:33,420
Or that could be, yeah.

2417
02:15:34,220 --> 02:15:34,940
Last minute.

2418
02:15:34,940 --> 02:15:36,860
So we had to do it just in case.

2419
02:15:36,860 --> 02:15:38,780
We threw a grenade into their entire operation.

2420
02:15:38,780 --> 02:15:41,420
Mike, I appreciate your optimism in this area.

2421
02:15:42,060 --> 02:15:47,900
But since I first came to LA for school in 2006,

2422
02:15:47,900 --> 02:15:49,420
they have been talking.

2423
02:15:49,420 --> 02:15:51,740
People have been talking about they got to do something

2424
02:15:51,740 --> 02:15:52,460
with Tomorrowland.

2425
02:15:52,460 --> 02:15:54,380
Oh, there's something coming for Tomorrowland.

2426
02:15:54,380 --> 02:15:55,660
And it just doesn't happen.

2427
02:15:55,660 --> 02:15:57,180
Do we want to go double or nothing

2428
02:15:57,180 --> 02:15:58,700
for another Tomorrowland bet?

2429
02:15:58,700 --> 02:15:59,420
Sure.

2430
02:15:59,420 --> 02:15:59,900
OK.

2431
02:15:59,900 --> 02:16:03,020
I would love to get that easy, easy money, Mike.

2432
02:16:03,020 --> 02:16:05,660
I would love to take the easy money from you.

2433
02:16:05,660 --> 02:16:06,300
OK.

2434
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:07,340
Jason, same.

2435
02:16:07,340 --> 02:16:08,060
Double or nothing.

2436
02:16:08,060 --> 02:16:11,180
I also, by the way, think that we should keep bets going.

2437
02:16:12,300 --> 02:16:14,860
A friend of the show, Van Roba Show, was proposing a bet.

2438
02:16:14,860 --> 02:16:17,660
I think if any guest who comes on the show,

2439
02:16:17,660 --> 02:16:19,340
we're open for business on the bets.

2440
02:16:19,340 --> 02:16:20,940
I think this is a part of the show now.

2441
02:16:20,940 --> 02:16:22,140
It is a part of the show now.

2442
02:16:22,140 --> 02:16:24,940
And I'm trying to determine what my bet is.

2443
02:16:24,940 --> 02:16:27,740
First of all, let's just take a temperature here.

2444
02:16:27,740 --> 02:16:29,660
Do you think we will get a Tomorrowland

2445
02:16:29,660 --> 02:16:33,340
before some sort of Disneyland forward stuff starts being built?

2446
02:16:33,340 --> 02:16:33,840
No.

2447
02:16:34,300 --> 02:16:34,620
No.

2448
02:16:34,620 --> 02:16:37,820
You think People Mover Track is there forever,

2449
02:16:37,820 --> 02:16:39,180
or at least for the next 30 years?

2450
02:16:39,180 --> 02:16:41,980
I don't know if it's there forever, but I don't know.

2451
02:16:41,980 --> 02:16:44,140
Because I think that's all except.

2452
02:16:44,140 --> 02:16:45,660
This hasn't been said, and I think

2453
02:16:45,660 --> 02:16:48,380
this is the real reason why Tomorrowland didn't happen.

2454
02:16:48,380 --> 02:16:50,540
In addition to what would be cool for the parks,

2455
02:16:50,540 --> 02:16:53,260
there is also a broader Disney company need

2456
02:16:53,260 --> 02:16:57,340
to service the buckets of what are the big IP and areas

2457
02:16:57,340 --> 02:16:58,700
and things that we own.

2458
02:16:58,700 --> 02:17:01,420
And you do have to think about these presentations as that.

2459
02:17:01,420 --> 02:17:02,860
We've got to service a lot of Marvel.

2460
02:17:02,860 --> 02:17:04,780
We've got to service a lot of Star Wars,

2461
02:17:04,780 --> 02:17:09,180
which is where I realized was maybe the foolishness

2462
02:17:09,180 --> 02:17:09,740
in your thinking.

2463
02:17:09,740 --> 02:17:10,540
You weren't so far off.

2464
02:17:10,540 --> 02:17:11,260
No, you're right.

2465
02:17:11,260 --> 02:17:15,260
But in Galaxy's Edge, the reason to say Galaxy's Edge

2466
02:17:15,260 --> 02:17:18,460
is because this is also for shareholders.

2467
02:17:18,460 --> 02:17:19,500
And we've got to assure everybody

2468
02:17:19,500 --> 02:17:22,060
we're doing stuff with Star Wars all the time to some extent.

2469
02:17:22,060 --> 02:17:24,060
So they're going to say something, I think.

2470
02:17:24,060 --> 02:17:28,220
Tomorrowland is not something that anybody's got eyes on.

2471
02:17:28,220 --> 02:17:30,060
There's no masters to serve there.

2472
02:17:31,020 --> 02:17:31,820
So that's why.

2473
02:17:31,820 --> 02:17:34,940
And Avatar is clearly one of those, too.

2474
02:17:34,940 --> 02:17:37,980
I think they have to show activity in these IP buckets.

2475
02:17:37,980 --> 02:17:41,660
And Tomorrowland is not attached enough to one of those

2476
02:17:41,660 --> 02:17:43,900
other than that Tron is maybe part of it.

2477
02:17:43,900 --> 02:17:45,180
And that's sort of it.

2478
02:17:45,180 --> 02:17:49,740
If the Tomorrowland movie had hit and hit big,

2479
02:17:49,740 --> 02:17:51,580
Tomorrowland would have been fixed by now.

2480
02:17:51,580 --> 02:17:53,100
Or, yeah.

2481
02:17:53,100 --> 02:17:55,100
I think he's doing an incredible three now.

2482
02:17:55,100 --> 02:17:57,180
I'm not saying it's going to be a crazy over.

2483
02:17:57,180 --> 02:17:58,300
I think they will.

2484
02:17:58,300 --> 02:17:59,660
I think the people mover track will

2485
02:17:59,660 --> 02:18:04,620
be gone by the time Disneyland Forward starts, whatever it is.

2486
02:18:04,620 --> 02:18:05,100
Boy.

2487
02:18:05,100 --> 02:18:06,460
But I guess that's going to be hard because we

2488
02:18:06,460 --> 02:18:07,580
have to parse what that means.

2489
02:18:07,580 --> 02:18:09,820
If Disneyland Forward is Avatar.

2490
02:18:09,820 --> 02:18:13,500
Mike, do you want to bet that there is an actual bunny who

2491
02:18:13,500 --> 02:18:16,700
delivers eggs to your backyard?

2492
02:18:16,700 --> 02:18:18,380
Yeah, he comes every year.

2493
02:18:18,380 --> 02:18:19,420
Jason agrees with that, though.

2494
02:18:19,420 --> 02:18:21,740
So I'll be on one side of this one.

2495
02:18:21,740 --> 02:18:24,300
Yeah, that is a different argument.

2496
02:18:24,380 --> 02:18:28,860
I think we will get a Tomorrowland announcement

2497
02:18:28,860 --> 02:18:32,380
of some kind in the next two years.

2498
02:18:32,380 --> 02:18:32,860
No.

2499
02:18:32,860 --> 02:18:33,580
That's what I bet.

2500
02:18:33,580 --> 02:18:35,100
No.

2501
02:18:35,100 --> 02:18:35,900
Jason, how do you feel?

2502
02:18:35,900 --> 02:18:38,940
Are you including the next D23?

2503
02:18:38,940 --> 02:18:39,900
Yes.

2504
02:18:39,900 --> 02:18:41,260
It could be Destination D. It could

2505
02:18:41,260 --> 02:18:43,900
be during the 70th anniversary of Disneyland.

2506
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:46,220
It could be the next D23.

2507
02:18:46,220 --> 02:18:48,460
I believe there will be a Tomorrowland announcement

2508
02:18:48,460 --> 02:18:48,940
in that time.

2509
02:18:48,940 --> 02:18:50,140
Those don't feel big enough.

2510
02:18:50,140 --> 02:18:54,220
I feel like next D23.

2511
02:18:54,220 --> 02:18:54,940
You fool.

2512
02:18:54,940 --> 02:18:56,620
Let him make a bet about Destiny.

2513
02:18:56,620 --> 02:18:59,740
Let him think Destination D is anything.

2514
02:18:59,740 --> 02:19:01,820
They say things at Destination D.

2515
02:19:01,820 --> 02:19:03,580
Yeah, what did they say last year?

2516
02:19:03,580 --> 02:19:05,420
That they were thinking about things.

2517
02:19:05,420 --> 02:19:05,900
Oh, yeah.

2518
02:19:05,900 --> 02:19:07,260
Yeah, right.

2519
02:19:07,260 --> 02:19:09,020
But it's a whole new company now.

2520
02:19:09,020 --> 02:19:09,980
Jason, what do you think?

2521
02:19:09,980 --> 02:19:12,060
It was two years ago.

2522
02:19:12,060 --> 02:19:14,380
And the Mad Tea Party set lists are way different.

2523
02:19:14,380 --> 02:19:18,380
And when I say announcement about Tomorrowland,

2524
02:19:18,380 --> 02:19:20,220
it means they could just be pulling the people mover

2525
02:19:20,220 --> 02:19:22,380
track out and re-theming Buzz Lightyear

2526
02:19:22,460 --> 02:19:24,140
and painting everything.

2527
02:19:24,140 --> 02:19:24,620
Yeah.

2528
02:19:24,620 --> 02:19:26,060
It could be that.

2529
02:19:26,060 --> 02:19:29,420
It's not like an amazing sort of.

2530
02:19:29,420 --> 02:19:31,740
I think because of serving the IP.

2531
02:19:31,740 --> 02:19:33,100
That's why I know.

2532
02:19:33,100 --> 02:19:34,060
Look, here's the thing.

2533
02:19:34,060 --> 02:19:36,860
I think they're going to get really excited about all

2534
02:19:36,860 --> 02:19:38,860
the new stuff they've announced.

2535
02:19:38,860 --> 02:19:42,060
And then I think they're going to get really excited

2536
02:19:42,060 --> 02:19:46,780
about the Disneyland Ford expansion by the hotels.

2537
02:19:46,780 --> 02:19:49,660
And I think with Tomorrowland, they're going to go,

2538
02:19:49,660 --> 02:19:51,820
that is Space Mountain and Star Tours.

2539
02:19:51,900 --> 02:19:53,340
And that's good enough.

2540
02:19:53,340 --> 02:19:53,660
Yeah.

2541
02:19:53,660 --> 02:19:54,540
So you're with Scott.

2542
02:19:54,540 --> 02:19:55,740
There will not be an announcement.

2543
02:19:55,740 --> 02:19:56,300
You don't believe.

2544
02:19:56,300 --> 02:19:57,180
Give us an amount.

2545
02:19:57,180 --> 02:19:57,900
I want to.

2546
02:19:57,900 --> 02:20:01,260
This is another time where I want to be wrong.

2547
02:20:01,260 --> 02:20:02,300
This one was 10.

2548
02:20:02,300 --> 02:20:04,620
You were going to get five if it was at the end.

2549
02:20:04,620 --> 02:20:05,820
You guys are making it even.

2550
02:20:05,820 --> 02:20:08,060
You were actually making it even more extreme.

2551
02:20:08,060 --> 02:20:09,420
Because I'm saying I think it will be an announcement

2552
02:20:09,420 --> 02:20:10,540
in the next two years.

2553
02:20:10,540 --> 02:20:11,900
And you're saying they're not going

2554
02:20:11,900 --> 02:20:14,540
to pull that people mover track out in the next 10 years.

2555
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:18,380
What would the last 10 years have been like?

2556
02:20:18,380 --> 02:20:19,980
How is this so insane?

2557
02:20:19,980 --> 02:20:22,540
No, I'm just trying to get on the same page here.

2558
02:20:22,540 --> 02:20:23,580
I grew up here.

2559
02:20:23,580 --> 02:20:24,940
These are my streets.

2560
02:20:24,940 --> 02:20:26,140
I've watched them decay.

2561
02:20:26,780 --> 02:20:28,380
I lived through every bit of it.

2562
02:20:28,380 --> 02:20:30,060
Each year, it got worse and worse.

2563
02:20:30,700 --> 02:20:32,700
You want to tell me about my land?

2564
02:20:32,700 --> 02:20:34,860
Mayor of Kingston over here.

2565
02:20:34,860 --> 02:20:38,060
I mean, I guess if Tron Aries is a hit, which I don't know

2566
02:20:38,060 --> 02:20:39,740
if that's possible, it's cool.

2567
02:20:39,740 --> 02:20:40,860
Nine Inch Nails is doing it.

2568
02:20:40,860 --> 02:20:44,780
But none of the other ones have been big hits.

2569
02:20:46,300 --> 02:20:48,940
Well, the charisma of Jared Leto could fill any number

2570
02:20:48,940 --> 02:20:50,140
of computer mainframes.

2571
02:20:50,140 --> 02:20:52,780
I've seen people say a Fantastic Four is a hit.

2572
02:20:52,780 --> 02:20:54,460
Well, now there we go.

2573
02:20:55,260 --> 02:20:57,100
Aesthetically speaking, that's perfect

2574
02:20:57,100 --> 02:21:02,140
because it's an Elseworlds 60s aesthetic in Fantastic Four.

2575
02:21:03,180 --> 02:21:04,300
Maybe that could do it.

2576
02:21:04,300 --> 02:21:05,340
Yeah, that's interesting.

2577
02:21:06,940 --> 02:21:10,380
If you turn Tomorrowland into a world fair,

2578
02:21:10,380 --> 02:21:14,060
if you turn into the first 90 seconds of the Tomorrowland

2579
02:21:14,060 --> 02:21:15,820
movie, you know.

2580
02:21:15,820 --> 02:21:16,320
Sure.

2581
02:21:16,880 --> 02:21:19,920
OK, my bet is within two years, there

2582
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:23,760
will be a Tomorrowland announcement of some new version.

2583
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:26,560
So does the two years include the next D23?

2584
02:21:26,560 --> 02:21:27,040
Yes.

2585
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:27,840
OK.

2586
02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:28,320
All right.

2587
02:21:28,320 --> 02:21:29,600
That seems like I've, yeah.

2588
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:30,320
What's the number?

2589
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:32,000
What did we bet last time?

2590
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:32,240
10?

2591
02:21:32,240 --> 02:21:32,880
10.

2592
02:21:32,880 --> 02:21:34,640
Well, double or nothing, it's 20.

2593
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:36,800
And you put five, it was going to be an extra five

2594
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:38,640
if people were there.

2595
02:21:38,640 --> 02:21:40,560
All right, well, double them both.

2596
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:41,360
20 and 10?

2597
02:21:41,360 --> 02:21:42,000
That's right.

2598
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:42,500
OK.

2599
02:21:43,460 --> 02:21:47,140
Well, I'll double or nothing again in two years.

2600
02:21:47,140 --> 02:21:49,140
I'll say, well, two more years, that's what it'll be.

2601
02:21:49,140 --> 02:21:50,740
And the bet will keep going higher.

2602
02:21:50,740 --> 02:21:51,940
It'll just keep going and going.

2603
02:21:51,940 --> 02:21:53,540
Yeah, yeah.

2604
02:21:53,540 --> 02:21:55,140
And it's hard to count with interest rates

2605
02:21:55,140 --> 02:21:56,660
by then and the value of the dollar,

2606
02:21:56,660 --> 02:21:58,580
what that 20 or 10 will mean by then.

2607
02:21:58,580 --> 02:21:59,060
Right.

2608
02:21:59,060 --> 02:22:00,180
It'll be a whole other world.

2609
02:22:00,180 --> 02:22:01,300
Of course.

2610
02:22:01,300 --> 02:22:03,060
Anything else, like, news-wise to cover,

2611
02:22:03,060 --> 02:22:06,180
should I get into the betting stuff and where we landed?

2612
02:22:06,180 --> 02:22:06,900
Well, just the villains.

2613
02:22:06,900 --> 02:22:07,220
Oh, wait.

2614
02:22:07,220 --> 02:22:07,940
OK, well, here.

2615
02:22:07,940 --> 02:22:09,620
Villains will segue into betting.

2616
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:12,500
So the big announcement, because it was seeming kind of done.

2617
02:22:12,500 --> 02:22:14,020
They actually did get me.

2618
02:22:14,020 --> 02:22:15,620
And then it was not done.

2619
02:22:15,620 --> 02:22:17,700
There was a scary music cue.

2620
02:22:17,700 --> 02:22:21,700
And then the face in the mirror admonished Josh

2621
02:22:21,700 --> 02:22:24,420
tomorrow for withholding something.

2622
02:22:24,420 --> 02:22:27,620
And we got a big final announcement

2623
02:22:27,620 --> 02:22:30,660
of there's no name for it, but we're just, for now,

2624
02:22:30,660 --> 02:22:34,180
calling it Villains Land, going in Magic Kingdom.

2625
02:22:34,180 --> 02:22:35,700
So let's talk about it first.

2626
02:22:35,700 --> 02:22:37,700
And then we'll talk about what it means for us.

2627
02:22:37,700 --> 02:22:38,180
Yeah.

2628
02:22:38,180 --> 02:22:39,700
It is great.

2629
02:22:39,700 --> 02:22:40,980
Great concept art.

2630
02:22:40,980 --> 02:22:44,580
This is another one of those rumored forever exciting way

2631
02:22:44,580 --> 02:22:45,220
to present it.

2632
02:22:45,220 --> 02:22:46,740
We got a little bit of specifics.

2633
02:22:46,740 --> 02:22:52,500
We got two attractions, restaurants, shops.

2634
02:22:52,500 --> 02:22:54,260
Basically, just one piece of concept art

2635
02:22:54,260 --> 02:22:55,860
that kind of implies a coaster.

2636
02:22:55,860 --> 02:22:58,340
But we don't really know what villains we're dealing with yet.

2637
02:22:58,340 --> 02:23:02,180
Maleficent Coaster in the art, because the dragons sort of buy it.

2638
02:23:02,180 --> 02:23:02,660
Oh, OK.

2639
02:23:02,660 --> 02:23:02,980
All right.

2640
02:23:02,980 --> 02:23:04,980
So that's what people, and it's thorny.

2641
02:23:04,980 --> 02:23:06,820
And that's what people assume.

2642
02:23:06,820 --> 02:23:07,860
I don't know that to be a fact.

2643
02:23:07,860 --> 02:23:08,660
But yes.

2644
02:23:08,660 --> 02:23:13,620
So that looks like, if that art is accurate, like an outdoor coaster,

2645
02:23:13,620 --> 02:23:17,140
it's kind of this, I don't know what the actual other ride is.

2646
02:23:18,820 --> 02:23:23,060
But it is sort of like Epic Universe's Monsters Luria.

2647
02:23:23,060 --> 02:23:25,140
It's got a coaster, and it's got some other maybe indoor.

2648
02:23:25,140 --> 02:23:26,580
Kind of looks a lot like Epic Universe.

2649
02:23:26,580 --> 02:23:28,420
It's very similar to Epic Universe's.

2650
02:23:28,420 --> 02:23:28,920
Yeah.

2651
02:23:30,500 --> 02:23:31,140
Yeah, I don't know.

2652
02:23:31,140 --> 02:23:31,700
I mean, it's great.

2653
02:23:31,700 --> 02:23:32,260
Sounds great.

2654
02:23:32,260 --> 02:23:34,660
It was all of a way to close it.

2655
02:23:34,660 --> 02:23:36,900
The concern maybe is no timeline.

2656
02:23:37,780 --> 02:23:39,300
Five years, I think, keep dreaming.

2657
02:23:39,300 --> 02:23:40,660
You want to put money on that five years?

2658
02:23:40,660 --> 02:23:42,500
We're not going to get that money for five years.

2659
02:23:42,500 --> 02:23:43,620
But I don't need.

2660
02:23:43,620 --> 02:23:44,580
I don't care about that.

2661
02:23:46,260 --> 02:23:47,300
I don't need to do that.

2662
02:23:47,300 --> 02:23:52,500
This moment with the face in the mirror,

2663
02:23:52,500 --> 02:23:56,420
this was the most professional wrestling thing of the night,

2664
02:23:56,420 --> 02:23:58,740
where it's like, well, that's the end of the show.

2665
02:23:58,740 --> 02:23:59,620
Thanks for coming.

2666
02:23:59,620 --> 02:24:01,140
And then he pops up.

2667
02:24:01,940 --> 02:24:03,540
And that was very fun.

2668
02:24:03,540 --> 02:24:04,100
Yeah.

2669
02:24:04,180 --> 02:24:07,140
But I think, so look, there's not much to say about it.

2670
02:24:07,140 --> 02:24:09,220
It's cool concept art, and it sounds great.

2671
02:24:09,220 --> 02:24:11,540
And I think it'll be really fantastic.

2672
02:24:12,500 --> 02:24:14,740
But let's talk about the ramifications for us.

2673
02:24:14,740 --> 02:24:20,660
Because, well, OK, actually a couple things.

2674
02:24:22,660 --> 02:24:26,100
One, right before we get to that, let's get to our bets.

2675
02:24:26,100 --> 02:24:31,780
One of the bets was Disney words said out loud, recurring Disney words.

2676
02:24:31,780 --> 02:24:33,780
Mike went with imagination.

2677
02:24:33,860 --> 02:24:35,220
I went with magic.

2678
02:24:35,220 --> 02:24:37,060
Jason went with dream.

2679
02:24:37,060 --> 02:24:40,260
Now, this tally got a little wonky for me.

2680
02:24:40,260 --> 02:24:42,820
I tried to keep track, but this was a long, long panel.

2681
02:24:42,820 --> 02:24:46,740
However, there was an early lead taken early in the panel.

2682
02:24:46,740 --> 02:24:47,540
This was a big one.

2683
02:24:47,540 --> 02:24:49,620
I threw this out and said it's for $20.

2684
02:24:49,620 --> 02:24:50,100
Why not?

2685
02:24:50,100 --> 02:24:51,780
Make this the big bonus.

2686
02:24:51,780 --> 02:24:55,380
And here's my calculation on this.

2687
02:24:57,220 --> 02:25:02,900
I think there was an insurmountable lead gained very, very early on by Dream,

2688
02:25:02,900 --> 02:25:04,420
which is Jason's word.

2689
02:25:05,220 --> 02:25:06,820
My count is 11.

2690
02:25:08,260 --> 02:25:12,420
If I missed part of this, if I went to the bathroom during it,

2691
02:25:12,420 --> 02:25:17,860
if I missed Shaboosie doing a rapid fire imagination, imagination, imagination

2692
02:25:17,860 --> 02:25:20,020
many, many times, then I did.

2693
02:25:20,020 --> 02:25:29,140
But I think count is 11, dream, magic for I'm not sure I heard imagination once in the panel.

2694
02:25:29,140 --> 02:25:34,020
Which, speaking of, that means no journey into imagination either.

2695
02:25:34,020 --> 02:25:36,420
The horizon's name didn't really lead to anything.

2696
02:25:36,420 --> 02:25:37,220
Nothing.

2697
02:25:37,220 --> 02:25:39,140
Except for the Spaceship Earth Lounge.

2698
02:25:39,940 --> 02:25:42,020
The former Siemens Lounge.

2699
02:25:42,020 --> 02:25:44,740
But now everybody can go to this lounge.

2700
02:25:46,020 --> 02:25:48,500
Pirate's Lounge at Magic Kingdom.

2701
02:25:48,500 --> 02:25:50,180
But yeah, no, Epcot, nothing.

2702
02:25:50,180 --> 02:25:50,680
No.

2703
02:25:51,380 --> 02:25:52,580
Epcot will spill decay.

2704
02:25:54,180 --> 02:25:55,540
That's what I'm telling you, Mike.

2705
02:25:55,540 --> 02:25:57,700
The Disney is okay with decay.

2706
02:25:57,700 --> 02:26:00,340
And I don't just mean in the villainous villain's world.

2707
02:26:00,980 --> 02:26:01,780
Two years.

2708
02:26:01,780 --> 02:26:02,900
Okay, all right.

2709
02:26:04,420 --> 02:26:09,620
Anyway, then I had another question because we got really thrown by that.

2710
02:26:09,620 --> 02:26:16,180
The first number of the show is John Stan was performing A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes.

2711
02:26:16,180 --> 02:26:17,940
Really made me wish I'd bet on Wish.

2712
02:26:19,060 --> 02:26:22,900
But then I had a question, does music count?

2713
02:26:22,900 --> 02:26:24,980
I asked the audience, does music count?

2714
02:26:24,980 --> 02:26:25,860
They said yes.

2715
02:26:25,860 --> 02:26:27,700
It was a close margin, but they said yes.

2716
02:26:27,700 --> 02:26:31,060
If we're counting music, imagination's still zero.

2717
02:26:31,060 --> 02:26:35,540
Magic 6, Dream 21 becomes a crush by Jason.

2718
02:26:35,540 --> 02:26:38,740
But even if you take music out of it, it's still Jason.

2719
02:26:39,540 --> 02:26:42,580
So congratulations to Jason on the big bet of the night.

2720
02:26:42,580 --> 02:26:46,740
$20 go into your pocket on that one.

2721
02:26:46,740 --> 02:26:51,940
Now, if we're talking purely financially, if we were to take that one.

2722
02:26:51,940 --> 02:26:55,220
Oh, and also, by the way, if Story, if anybody had grabbed Story,

2723
02:26:55,220 --> 02:26:56,500
they would have run away with it.

2724
02:26:56,500 --> 02:26:57,780
That would have been so much better.

2725
02:26:57,780 --> 02:27:00,020
We're all idiots to not say Story.

2726
02:27:01,060 --> 02:27:05,460
So let me say what happens if that one's out.

2727
02:27:10,020 --> 02:27:15,380
If not for that final bet, then I'm up $22.50.

2728
02:27:15,380 --> 02:27:17,140
This is the high stakes that we're dealing with here.

2729
02:27:18,660 --> 02:27:23,780
Jason is down 9 and Mike is down 13.50.

2730
02:27:23,780 --> 02:27:28,020
With the final bet, this brings us to, oh, wait a minute.

2731
02:27:28,020 --> 02:27:30,100
And actually, this is kind of crazy.

2732
02:27:30,100 --> 02:27:33,300
With the little nudging that has happened during this episode

2733
02:27:33,300 --> 02:27:34,100
and evaluate it.

2734
02:27:34,100 --> 02:27:35,620
And I'll let you guys check the math on this.

2735
02:27:35,620 --> 02:27:38,340
But this is what I'm seeing at this point in time.

2736
02:27:39,860 --> 02:27:52,100
Jason up $11, me up $12.50, Mike down $23.50, Mike down a lot.

2737
02:27:52,100 --> 02:27:53,780
I think the key, it was those tens.

2738
02:27:53,780 --> 02:27:54,980
You lost a lot of tens.

2739
02:27:54,980 --> 02:27:55,780
I know.

2740
02:27:55,780 --> 02:28:00,020
Now, when I sat down with you guys before I made some changes,

2741
02:28:00,020 --> 02:28:00,820
Jason was up.

2742
02:28:00,820 --> 02:28:02,100
And I was exactly even.

2743
02:28:02,100 --> 02:28:04,980
I was at literally $0 thanks to some changes.

2744
02:28:04,980 --> 02:28:07,700
I have won financially.

2745
02:28:07,700 --> 02:28:10,980
However, however, and this is how I was starting to feel

2746
02:28:10,980 --> 02:28:11,940
until the big reveal.

2747
02:28:11,940 --> 02:28:13,140
Oh my god, they aren't done.

2748
02:28:13,140 --> 02:28:16,580
Oh my god, Villains Land, Magic Kingdom, oh my god.

2749
02:28:16,580 --> 02:28:21,940
Jason gets a double scoop of Baskin Robbins flavors

2750
02:28:21,940 --> 02:28:22,740
of his choice.

2751
02:28:22,740 --> 02:28:25,620
And due to them saying location, though maybe they

2752
02:28:25,620 --> 02:28:28,180
didn't clarify behind Big Thunder, I said location.

2753
02:28:28,180 --> 02:28:29,540
I didn't say there.

2754
02:28:29,540 --> 02:28:33,620
Magic Kingdom equals Jason also gets sprinkles.

2755
02:28:33,620 --> 02:28:34,100
Wow.

2756
02:28:34,100 --> 02:28:37,940
And therefore, because I only beat you in terms of numbers

2757
02:28:37,940 --> 02:28:41,620
by $1.50, once you have calculated the split price

2758
02:28:41,620 --> 02:28:45,220
between Mike and I of a double scoop at Baskin Robbins,

2759
02:28:45,220 --> 02:28:49,060
Jason is the winner of the 2024 D23 bet.

2760
02:28:49,060 --> 02:28:49,700
Wow.

2761
02:28:49,700 --> 02:28:50,340
Wow.

2762
02:28:50,340 --> 02:28:51,140
Congratulations.

2763
02:28:51,140 --> 02:28:51,620
Jeez.

2764
02:28:51,620 --> 02:28:54,820
And not to mention, I think even if the numbers didn't add up,

2765
02:28:54,820 --> 02:28:56,980
the joy that came from the ice cream

2766
02:28:56,980 --> 02:29:00,900
would surmount any financial loss.

2767
02:29:00,900 --> 02:29:03,780
So it's Jason no matter what.

2768
02:29:03,780 --> 02:29:05,060
Jason, congratulations.

2769
02:29:05,060 --> 02:29:05,540
My god.

2770
02:29:05,540 --> 02:29:06,100
Thank you so much.

2771
02:29:06,100 --> 02:29:08,740
You win the first ever round of PTR betting.

2772
02:29:08,740 --> 02:29:11,380
I mean, I don't want to get into the weeds here,

2773
02:29:11,380 --> 02:29:14,100
but were you talking about those salt and straw prices,

2774
02:29:14,100 --> 02:29:14,580
Scott?

2775
02:29:14,660 --> 02:29:16,740
Or were you talking more reasonable prices,

2776
02:29:16,740 --> 02:29:18,420
like a dryers at a home in a freezer section?

2777
02:29:18,420 --> 02:29:20,180
Well, thank god we didn't get into a salt.

2778
02:29:20,180 --> 02:29:21,860
So maybe if it had been an Ample Hills,

2779
02:29:21,860 --> 02:29:23,540
it would have been a different situation.

2780
02:29:23,540 --> 02:29:24,100
Oh, man.

2781
02:29:24,100 --> 02:29:25,540
Rest in peace.

2782
02:29:25,540 --> 02:29:26,660
Rest in peace.

2783
02:29:26,660 --> 02:29:29,700
But thankfully, you chose a reasonably priced,

2784
02:29:29,700 --> 02:29:32,980
and I'm glad it's something we can go to very soon.

2785
02:29:32,980 --> 02:29:34,580
Do we want to go right now?

2786
02:29:34,580 --> 02:29:36,740
I want to go to bed right now.

2787
02:29:36,740 --> 02:29:38,340
You want to go to bed right now?

2788
02:29:38,340 --> 02:29:41,380
We will take a rain check on the OK.

2789
02:29:41,380 --> 02:29:42,140
Well, you're right.

2790
02:29:42,140 --> 02:29:44,220
It has been a long episode, so we will not.

2791
02:29:44,460 --> 02:29:48,380
You'll have to wait for photos of Jason and the ice cream

2792
02:29:48,380 --> 02:29:50,620
and the grin on his face from the ice cream.

2793
02:29:50,620 --> 02:29:53,900
Will you wait as long as we'll wait for Tomorrowland News?

2794
02:29:53,900 --> 02:29:54,620
Hopefully not.

2795
02:29:54,620 --> 02:29:55,980
Jason, hold us to it.

2796
02:29:55,980 --> 02:29:57,580
This is not blue sky.

2797
02:29:57,580 --> 02:30:01,740
We're putting shovels, as I call spoons, into cream,

2798
02:30:01,740 --> 02:30:04,460
into dirt, which is, by that I mean,

2799
02:30:04,460 --> 02:30:06,060
the dirt that's ground up Oreo.

2800
02:30:06,060 --> 02:30:06,460
Rocky Road.

2801
02:30:06,460 --> 02:30:08,300
We're putting little shovels into dirt.

2802
02:30:08,300 --> 02:30:10,300
Rocky Road, ease one of the scoops.

2803
02:30:10,940 --> 02:30:12,060
Oh, that's one of your choices.

2804
02:30:12,060 --> 02:30:13,180
That is confirmed.

2805
02:30:13,820 --> 02:30:15,020
Let's blue sky here.

2806
02:30:15,020 --> 02:30:17,180
Do you want to make your choices?

2807
02:30:17,180 --> 02:30:19,340
Copper cone, flavors, and type of sprinkle.

2808
02:30:19,340 --> 02:30:19,740
Do you want to say it here?

2809
02:30:19,740 --> 02:30:21,020
I'm going to go with cone.

2810
02:30:21,020 --> 02:30:21,520
Great.

2811
02:30:23,180 --> 02:30:25,660
Probably sugar cone, the chewy one.

2812
02:30:25,660 --> 02:30:26,700
OK, more expensive.

2813
02:30:27,900 --> 02:30:28,860
The chewy one?

2814
02:30:28,860 --> 02:30:29,420
I don't know.

2815
02:30:29,420 --> 02:30:32,220
Sugar cone or cake cone are usually the default cones.

2816
02:30:32,220 --> 02:30:33,580
OK, so you're saying that's a cheaper one.

2817
02:30:33,580 --> 02:30:33,900
Yeah.

2818
02:30:33,900 --> 02:30:34,940
OK, sorry, my apologies.

2819
02:30:36,140 --> 02:30:39,020
Waffle cone is usually a little too overwhelming for me.

2820
02:30:39,020 --> 02:30:40,140
OK, all right.

2821
02:30:40,140 --> 02:30:41,420
Well, you've got to know yourself.

2822
02:30:41,420 --> 02:30:42,860
And what flavors are we thinking?

2823
02:30:42,940 --> 02:30:44,300
I don't know the second one yet.

2824
02:30:44,300 --> 02:30:44,620
OK.

2825
02:30:44,620 --> 02:30:44,940
Oh, all right.

2826
02:30:44,940 --> 02:30:48,380
I'm thinking about going a wild card, like pecan praline.

2827
02:30:48,380 --> 02:30:49,020
OK.

2828
02:30:49,020 --> 02:30:49,500
Whatever praline.

2829
02:30:49,500 --> 02:30:52,060
So you'd say that you're dreaming up some.

2830
02:30:52,060 --> 02:30:55,020
You're starting to think about the kinds of flavors.

2831
02:30:55,020 --> 02:30:58,300
Yeah, I don't have shovels in the dirt yet, so.

2832
02:30:58,300 --> 02:31:00,540
OK, sprinkles just rainbow?

2833
02:31:01,580 --> 02:31:02,860
Maybe chocolate jimmies.

2834
02:31:04,140 --> 02:31:04,700
Oh, right.

2835
02:31:04,700 --> 02:31:06,380
I forgot it was Jason we're dealing with,

2836
02:31:06,380 --> 02:31:08,300
and it could be chocolate jimmies.

2837
02:31:08,300 --> 02:31:10,700
Just don't say that to the California teens

2838
02:31:10,700 --> 02:31:11,660
at the Baskin Robbins.

2839
02:31:11,660 --> 02:31:13,260
They will not know what you're talking about.

2840
02:31:13,260 --> 02:31:15,980
Well, I've got some stories for them if they don't.

2841
02:31:15,980 --> 02:31:18,300
You know, on the other side of the country,

2842
02:31:18,300 --> 02:31:19,500
there's a wide variety.

2843
02:31:19,500 --> 02:31:21,980
You know, about 100 years ago.

2844
02:31:23,500 --> 02:31:25,020
Well, we will make good on this.

2845
02:31:25,020 --> 02:31:27,900
The only dark side to this great ice cream news

2846
02:31:27,900 --> 02:31:32,140
is this is going to help his problem.

2847
02:31:32,140 --> 02:31:33,900
He's got a problem with the penny slots,

2848
02:31:33,900 --> 02:31:36,060
and this is only going to encourage him further.

2849
02:31:36,060 --> 02:31:36,540
Oh, yeah, gambling wins.

2850
02:31:36,540 --> 02:31:39,260
This could be a real problem for Gamblin' Joe over here.

2851
02:31:39,260 --> 02:31:40,700
Uh-oh.

2852
02:31:40,700 --> 02:31:43,100
Well, let's take you to the casino after this.

2853
02:31:43,100 --> 02:31:43,420
Hey.

2854
02:31:43,420 --> 02:31:44,620
Oh, after the nap, after the nap.

2855
02:31:44,620 --> 02:31:45,500
Oh, yeah.

2856
02:31:46,540 --> 02:31:48,540
You can nap in the car as we go to Pechanga.

2857
02:31:48,540 --> 02:31:49,820
Oh, yeah, I'll put the seat down,

2858
02:31:49,820 --> 02:31:51,740
and you'll nap in the car as we go to Pechanga.

2859
02:31:51,740 --> 02:31:52,380
Oh, good.

2860
02:31:54,060 --> 02:31:56,460
All right, this luck all the way to Temecula.

2861
02:31:56,460 --> 02:31:58,540
All right, but for now, I guess we'll wrap it up.

2862
02:31:58,540 --> 02:31:59,900
Boy, supersized episode.

2863
02:31:59,900 --> 02:32:02,620
Boy, hey, we still shorter than the panel,

2864
02:32:02,620 --> 02:32:05,500
but boy, do the three of us love to talk about this shit.

2865
02:32:06,140 --> 02:32:09,180
Even on a sad Sunday when we're rushing it out, here we are.

2866
02:32:09,180 --> 02:32:10,300
Could have done more, too.

2867
02:32:10,540 --> 02:32:11,100
Yeah, I know.

2868
02:32:11,100 --> 02:32:12,540
If it came up, and there will be,

2869
02:32:13,740 --> 02:32:15,660
we'll start picking up parts of it.

2870
02:32:15,660 --> 02:32:18,540
And you know what we'll have to do, what it'll motivate is,

2871
02:32:19,420 --> 02:32:21,820
as they start saying attractions that are closing,

2872
02:32:21,820 --> 02:32:24,380
we will have to start saying goodbye to those.

2873
02:32:24,380 --> 02:32:26,940
And in fact, have we missed anything in Dino Land?

2874
02:32:26,940 --> 02:32:28,300
Or do we do all of Dino Land?

2875
02:32:28,300 --> 02:32:29,100
I don't remember.

2876
02:32:29,100 --> 02:32:30,140
I don't remember.

2877
02:32:30,140 --> 02:32:32,380
I don't believe we have.

2878
02:32:32,380 --> 02:32:33,740
Forget how we broke that up.

2879
02:32:33,740 --> 02:32:35,740
If it was Chester and Hester only.

2880
02:32:35,740 --> 02:32:36,380
I don't.

2881
02:32:36,380 --> 02:32:37,900
Did we do Chester and Hester?

2882
02:32:37,900 --> 02:32:39,980
Did we just do the roller coaster?

2883
02:32:40,380 --> 02:32:41,820
Oh, we did Primeval World.

2884
02:32:41,820 --> 02:32:45,500
Well, we haven't done Chester and Hester alone.

2885
02:32:45,500 --> 02:32:46,060
All right.

2886
02:32:46,060 --> 02:32:48,300
Well, that list will grow.

2887
02:32:49,020 --> 02:32:52,620
But for now, I mean, man, boy, that's a blue, blue sky

2888
02:32:52,620 --> 02:32:55,500
with Chester and Hester as a PTR listener.

2889
02:32:55,500 --> 02:32:59,020
But for now, you survived Podcast the Ride,

2890
02:32:59,020 --> 02:33:01,580
a jammed out episode, sort of.

2891
02:33:02,140 --> 02:33:03,820
Hey, this is this week's main feed,

2892
02:33:03,820 --> 02:33:06,060
so we won't be back here on Friday.

2893
02:33:06,060 --> 02:33:07,660
But for three bonus episodes every month,

2894
02:33:07,660 --> 02:33:09,500
check out Podcast the Ride, The Second Gate,

2895
02:33:09,500 --> 02:33:12,220
or get one more bonus episode in our VIP tier club three.

2896
02:33:12,220 --> 02:33:15,100
You'll find all of that at patreon.com slash Podcast the Ride.

2897
02:33:15,100 --> 02:33:18,940
What you will get this week is my birthday shot,

2898
02:33:18,940 --> 02:33:22,300
an indulgent topic picked for me by my birthday.

2899
02:33:23,580 --> 02:33:27,020
Do you think that this is about theme parks?

2900
02:33:27,020 --> 02:33:28,060
Place your bets.

2901
02:33:28,060 --> 02:33:30,300
I know where the smart money is.

2902
02:33:30,300 --> 02:33:31,340
But hey, we did all that.

2903
02:33:31,340 --> 02:33:34,700
We've been on fucking topic lately, have we not?

2904
02:33:34,700 --> 02:33:35,420
We sure have.

2905
02:33:35,420 --> 02:33:37,820
Let's give ourselves big pats on the back for that.

2906
02:33:38,060 --> 02:33:40,460
Big ice cream scoop of off-topic, please.

2907
02:33:41,340 --> 02:33:42,460
I'll take off-topic.

2908
02:33:42,460 --> 02:33:42,780
Just kidding.

2909
02:33:42,780 --> 02:33:44,060
Do you have off-topic here?

2910
02:33:48,460 --> 02:33:53,420
This has been a Forever Dog Production, executive produced by Mike Carlson,

2911
02:33:53,420 --> 02:33:59,180
