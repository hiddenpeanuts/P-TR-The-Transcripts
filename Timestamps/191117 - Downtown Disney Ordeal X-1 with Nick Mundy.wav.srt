1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
One, two, ready.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,000
There was darkness on the street, Ralph Brennan, he had won.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
He summoned the power of his jazz, and the podcast boys were done.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now we're in the underworld, and I can't lie we're scared.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Ghosts of stores are all around, like the ruins of a filter bear.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The downtown Disney ordeal, a shuttered hog and does how must Jason feel?

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The downtown Disney ordeal, what ghastly secrets does the house of blues conceal?

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You know where you are? You're in the underworld, baby.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You're gonna die of excitement learning about all of the stores and restaurants that used to be at downtown Disney.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That's right, welcome to the underworld. I'm Scott Gardner.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Thank God we're still alive but in a very sorry, more financially lucrative state.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm Scott Gardner joined by Mike Carlson and Jason Sheridan.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hello, yes, my name is Mike Carlson. Welcome to one of the scariest places behind the paywall.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I have to say, Scott, you're awfully jacked to be here.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Everything feels very sinister and unnerving.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I know, well, I was scared to go but I think, you know, we've been, I think if you lose,

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
like if you lose a playoff game you come in hotter the next time you play.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And I'm so upset about what happened with Ralph Brennan.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yeah.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I think we need to prove ourselves. I'm glad we have a bigger challenge to face.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Am I happy that it added three more episodes bringing the grand total to 18? Not necessarily.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But I want to, I want to prove that I'm strong and I'm a man and this is all our chance to prove ourselves.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Truly the deepest cut being one less, only one less than the City Walk Saga.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Really just grinding my gears.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Which really burning me up.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And one of those episodes we kind of cheated on or the Sector Keepers, the Sector Keepers led us off the hook for the food court.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So really that, technically that was 18. So we are doing the same amount essentially.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh, I suppose.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What we're landing at. But we're doing some of it here.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And I think, you know, this punishment does make sense because we kept everything that's there currently up above ground.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Now we're in the below place.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The below place.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Where all of the former things are. And there's a lot of those to get through.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So we better, we better start now and thank God he's still with us. He's going to help us get out of the underworld, the Sector Keeper.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Boys, boys.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, don't you sound shipper.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Boys.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
As a ghost that's been to purgatory, it's much scarier behind a paywall.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This is your first time down here, right?

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes, yes. It's so scary. It's a graveyard of closed stores.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah, yeah. We're going to encounter weird, scary stuff behind every turn. It could be truly haunted.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I mean, we're going to talk about, you know, like little girls dress boutiques and movie theaters that have just been left to rot.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's all scary.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You know, I will say a plus because it's so hot down here.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It does feel like a Southern California heat wave, which are miserable.

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It is burned up all your water vapor. So I feel like I'm seeing you crystal clear for the first time in ages.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, we have to get out of here. I'm Jones and man force sobriety.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The jewel, the jewel juice just evaporated.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Evaporated Ralph Brennan, you bitch.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Oh, my God. Your tip, your recently mellow state.

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You're starting to, it's like you're starting to act out.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Like you're starting to become more, you know, like the bad kind of teen.

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah, I'm feeling like a 2019 in an eighth grade algebra class. I need it, man.

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh, man. And not to mention, I just like besides the we're all agitated.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I just get I just get such a creepy feeling from this place.

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I just feel it. It doesn't feel right.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Nothing like it does not have the same comfort and warmth of the rest of the downtown district, Disney district.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And I'm just worried that we're going to run into some unpleasant stuff.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm perhaps the most worried that we're going to run into a bad man.

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh, no. Oh, no.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Bad man. Bad man. Bad man.

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's Nick Mundy. It's the godfather of podcast the ride, Nick Mundy.

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Hey, I was late.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The architect.

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
In a reversal of how things played out last, the sector keeper snuck up on you during the City Watch saga.

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And from outside, you little bitch.

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Oh, no. The bitches are flying.

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Now I heard that the sector keeper became a bad boy.

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
No, listen to guns and roses.

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Just some G and R. You're some G and R. Yeah.

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Sucking down some vape.

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah, I brought the G and R to the table, but he was grooving out to it.

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's for sure. Mr. Mundy has vape.

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Because I look like me doesn't mean I vape.

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So don't profile Mundy on looks. That's not right.

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't. I dip.

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
OK, yes. Would you be he is underage.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You have a choice to matter. Would you want to share the dip?

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Just to you guys want to ease the tension or?

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Eighth grade was the first time I dipped. So did you dip?

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Did you really dip? Yeah. OK.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That is my favorite scene in the movie.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Eighth grade, too, where they're like, hey, you want to dip some?

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Everyone's like, hell, yeah. And they just dip for five minutes.

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Get some shaw. Wait, this is dip will fuck you up.

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like dip.

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Who's dipped here? I'm dipped. Never. No.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Have you dipped? I've tried it.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Mike dipped? All the dark secrets come out in the underworld.

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I tried it once. You tried it once.

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What would your mind? I hope your mom doesn't unbind the paywall.

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
She I think she just said she was listening to Liberty Square,

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
which is behind the paywall.

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, yeah. Cancel the credit card. Get her out of here.

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Add this to the like the new patron tier.

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So first time I dipped was eighth grade at a Steve Miller concert.

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Cool. Are you like 60 years old?

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm concerned your mom's now concerned for both your jaws.

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It was because I think I tried it twice.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I think I tried it twice and they were the pouches.

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Did you do the pouches or did you actually do the jaw?

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You did the jaw. The real thing.

104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Wow. Because it pop. I just put it like tuck it in your lip.

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The pouches I did in class. Really?

106
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
God. But like a lot of people did it in class.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Wow. Really? Yeah.

108
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So how many times do you think you've dipped in your life, including pouches?

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And I've never like fully bought my own pack of dip outs except once.

110
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So you stole dip? No.

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
No. Hmm. You didn't really think there.

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm worried you're hiding something. I bet you've stolen dip.

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Look, is it stealing when a Kroger's throws out bad tobacco in the garbage and you find it?

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Well, now you're speaking my language.

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I love the Kroger brand Kroger brand chipmates cookies.

116
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
See, there you go.

117
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You use dip thrown out by Kroger. You use coffee cake.

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That was the real monster.

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
This one loves coffee cake.

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And one was in eighth grade and one was several years ago.

121
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And hours ago.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You know, something else that came up recently, last month in October, we were talking about the Six Flags Fright Fest with with our friend Anthony Geo.

123
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And he there was a story told of that bitch. Oh, man.

124
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I must be glad he's not here to kick your ass.

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So we were there were there were a lot of eighth graders around.

126
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I felt a lot of like a lot of angsty teens, guys, the sector keeper would like.

127
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And you guys told a story of a teenager going up to a fog machine, taking a big swig of it and then puffing all the fog out.

128
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And I told that to you just as the most notable thing of the record.

129
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And you said, to be fair, that is something that I would have done at that age.

130
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah, I mean, the whole. Yeah, I mean, you've heard my six flags exploits.

131
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh, that's right. We talked to. Yeah, we know. I would call that a victimless crime, too.

132
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We're not even a crime. And that fog was for the public, too.

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No harm, no foul. He's the victim. Yeah.

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Were there any tweens throwing basketballs at people?

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Well, you don't know you weren't there. Yeah, you weren't there.

136
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah. I mean, you talked to Anthony Geo once in a while, but did he tell you about that?

137
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
He came into cricket wireless.

138
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So you have to burn your phone or something for drug deals? Yeah, he does.

139
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
He does like a deal.

140
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Would you take a big rip from a fog machine sector keeper?

141
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Oh, wow. That sounds like a like a mega vape.

142
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yeah, it's kind of like the biggest vape possible.

143
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Depends on the flavor.

144
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Hmm. I think what would that would have been like? Like flavored.

145
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Well, my middle school, high school, like would use a fog machine.

146
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Like that was one of their big purchase for the theater department.

147
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And it smelled like piña colada.

148
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And they would inevitably use too much.

149
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It would fill the auditorium for a few minutes and smell like damp piña colada.

150
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's my extreme. Yeah.

151
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That's not Jimmy Buffett song. It's the aftermath of every Buffett concert.

152
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Damp piña colada.

153
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Well, look, we're not here to talk about eighth grade hijinks.

154
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I think that, wait a minute, we haven't talked about what we're doing.

155
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The presence of Nick Mundy must mean that we're talking about sports stuff.

156
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The ESPN zone. Yeah, that must be why you're here.

157
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's why you're here in hell with us.

158
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm meant to talk about a restaurant banished to hell.

159
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
15 screens banished to hell.

160
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah. You were a fan of this franchise.

161
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The ESPN zone.

162
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah. Cool.

163
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Like I've been there like good 15 times.

164
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh, that's wild. Yeah. Geez.

165
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Well, there was one in New York.

166
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's, yeah, that's what happened. It was right next to my internship.

167
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What was your internship?

168
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It was just...

169
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You were so dipped, you didn't even know.

170
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What was it, dipping then? I wasn't a junior high boy. I was a college man.

171
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
When was the last time you dipped?

172
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Like two or three years ago.

173
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Okay. Really?

174
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You want to dip after this?

175
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Seven-eleven's that far away. I think Sheridan goes.

176
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'll dip. If Jason does it, I'll dip with you and Jason after the show.

177
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We have a long day.

178
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I will dip for the next podcast episode.

179
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It will get you through it, man.

180
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Unless you dip too much and you wake up in the middle of like Abracadabra.

181
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Abracadabra?

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The song Abracadabra?

183
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah. Cause I kind of passed out from the drink.

184
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The performance of the song Abracadabra.

185
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Steve Miller band song Abracadabra.

186
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah. Not Abracadabbar.

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
No.

188
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Is that a real thing?

189
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
That's in Orlando.

190
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
That's a magic themed bar.

191
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Well, look, does it have a bunch of TVs?

192
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Here's the cool thing about ESPN.

193
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And I used to go there in New York because I didn't know any other like good restaurants.

194
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So I just go there every day for lunch.

195
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
New York ESPN zone.

196
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It was safe and it had Astros games on.

197
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That's true.

198
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Right. Did it ever have, I guess it was only stuff that was on ESPN?

199
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
No.

200
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
No, it would. It would be a show stuff that was not on ESPN.

201
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yeah. Because like if you're peeing and you wanted to watch the game, you would go to the urinal that had the game that you wanted to watch on it.

202
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Cause there were TVs in front of it.

203
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yes. Behind glass walls.

204
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Like tiny urinal TVs.

205
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So you tell me why this restaurant doesn't still exist.

206
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Well, I think the food was never quite memorable.

207
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It was trash.

208
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It was trash.

209
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It was sub hard rock. Sub planet.

210
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It was the ultimate insult.

211
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It was sub hard rock. Planet Hollywood. Good.

212
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Wait, Planet Hollywood equal. Okay.

213
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah. Planet Hollywood is worse than Hard Rock.

214
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yes. I would agree with that.

215
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Okay. I would say Hard Rock's not bad.

216
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Hard Rock is sometimes solid, but I have gotten.

217
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You gotta be careful.

218
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I would say.

219
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I think we've all gotten sick from Hard Rock.

220
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah.

221
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I would say like Hard Rock is never good to me.

222
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's just a step above AMC theater food.

223
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah.

224
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh.

225
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
High praise.

226
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
They're all digging around in the dirt.

227
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yeah. AMC is like reheated stuff at the very least.

228
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I mean, everything's reheated in all of these restaurants.

229
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Nothing is made fresh, I assume.

230
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But like at least there's like, it just feels like a pizza came out of a heater at the AMC.

231
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah. So, you know, in 04 there was a big playoff run with the Astros.

232
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So I'd watched a lot of that.

233
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And cause no other bars.

234
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Some reason they had to play the Yankees Red Sox game.

235
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Let me ask is if if Buffalo Wild Wings were to go up against the ESPN zone,

236
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
is Buffalo Wild Wings like two full letter grades better?

237
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Like how much?

238
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Food wise, yes, but it doesn't have TVs over the urinals.

239
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Okay.

240
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Are you sure?

241
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I feel like I've been to Buffalo Wild Wings with a TV over a urinal.

242
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That might be true.

243
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
One TV or not individual TVs per year?

244
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I don't think maybe individual.

245
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Maybe one TV per three urinals.

246
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So you're talking about like a wine bar?

247
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I thought I'd seen individual.

248
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I mean, that's a classy upscale establishment.

249
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It only has one TV.

250
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's like a place for senators.

251
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It was showing up.

252
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I didn't know the queen was a...

253
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Mike only during sad royal family approved establishment.

254
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And it was showing a cricket match over the urinals.

255
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You gotta remove your three layers of pantaloons to use the urinal.

256
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
ESPN zone was the most successful of the short lived Disney regional entertainment.

257
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't know what that is.

258
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It was a company Disney started to have like smaller entertainment.

259
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
They had a Chuck E. Cheese kind of concept called Club Disney.

260
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
They had Disney Quest, which was like VR sort of stuff.

261
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And then ESPN zone at the height of it, there was nine of them opened.

262
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It did last 20 years.

263
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The last one closed last summer in Anaheim.

264
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So that was the last one.

265
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
This was the last man standing.

266
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The end of the whole franchise.

267
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And do we know, did it only close because of the hotel that was going to be there or was it like,

268
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
it was in on its way out anyway?

269
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Well, someone else was operating it by that point.

270
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Disney regional entertainment was closed down a while before Disney Quest,

271
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
overseen by the parks people, ESPN overseen by other restaurant groups.

272
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Chances are it would still be running if it weren't for the hotel.

273
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Maybe.

274
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I feel like it would.

275
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It wasn't a bad place to watch sports if you couldn't find a better place.

276
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Or if you can't get that specific game to your house.

277
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yeah, or like the one that we would go to.

278
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So my parents would go to Vegas a lot.

279
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And then after I turned 21, I would end up going there.

280
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And then sometimes you end up just in New York, New York.

281
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
That was in the New York, New York.

282
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So we end up going to that one for whatever reason, because I think they had three card poker a lot.

283
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That's when three card poker first came out.

284
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
How do you play three card poker?

285
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's just like, I don't know, but the first time I played, I won like $2,500 and left like four hands.

286
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Nice. Have you ever dipped while playing three card poker?

287
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yes. For sure. Right.

288
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Wow. Yeah. Very confidently.

289
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Do they give you a cup? Well, Vegas provided dip cup.

290
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yeah. Okay.

291
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Did you ever own a spittoon?

292
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
No, I didn't do it that much.

293
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Not that he needed a specific place.

294
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You just have a water bottle.

295
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Where would you ever call ESPN Zone to see if they had a game on?

296
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Or would you just be confident in knowing they would have something on that you were wanting to watch?

297
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
In the New York one, I realized that they would have it on.

298
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Okay. So you didn't call ahead?

299
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
No, I didn't have to.

300
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I don't think that's that uncommon though.

301
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
To call ahead?

302
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah. Oh yeah. I don't think so.

303
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But also it's hard to think because like the sports watching landscape mechanism is different now because it's easier to get so many more games.

304
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Right. Because it's easily accessible.

305
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah. More so.

306
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And you had, right before we started recording, you were listening to a game in an earpiece.

307
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah. The playoffs are starting. Like I would have done this tomorrow.

308
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yeah. We just, I was just on Team Tiger Awesome.

309
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
This was the last day I was available to do it.

310
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

311
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You did me a favor and I wasn't going to do you a favor if it was passed today.

312
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

313
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Fall ball.

314
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Things take priority.

315
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:51,000
No, but I was just on the Team Tiger Awesome show and you were all just watching the game during the podcast recording.

316
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Yeah. It was a very bad show.

317
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Well, there was a perfect game happening.

318
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And then we lost it and then it became a no hitter and then lost it.

319
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Were you all tempted to just say, fuck it, let's not do it?

320
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
No, because if he got it, because I would have been that quiet in that like not acknowledging it regardless because of superstition.

321
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Oh yeah. Because you're pretty religious with the sports viewing.

322
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's not like, you know, and we're cracking jokes instead of this is like, no, we're watching the game.

323
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Regular season, sure.

324
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Sure.

325
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Like I would have you guys over.

326
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah.

327
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'd have to stay the fuck away from my house.

328
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Fair.

329
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Yeah. I'm not going to see, I'm not going to talk to you for a while.

330
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Sector keeper can come. Sector keeper can come.

331
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
All right.

332
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Just keep that vaping quiet.

333
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Well, it was like two years ago when the Astros were on the World Series run.

334
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Scott was like, well, maybe I'll stop by.

335
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I was like, no.

336
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What about for the series?

337
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm in a fetal position.

338
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm in the fetal position.

339
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Not like just not wanting to.

340
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's just like the most nerve wracking.

341
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Like, yeah, I was a train wreck after we won because it's just like for a month.

342
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm just like, OK, we're winning.

343
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
This is good.

344
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I went to the me and my wife went to game two and I was sore from stress.

345
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Well, that was a game.

346
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And that was when the Astros were it was Astros versus Dodgers.

347
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah. And that was a game that went on and on and on.

348
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Correct. Yeah.

349
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
How long?

350
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That went to like 11.

351
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And then there was game five that went longer.

352
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I was I was in the Tamo Shanter and it was on and whoever I was with was like,

353
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm worried about Monday.

354
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And then I got a text from Tommy Blacho.

355
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You haven't seen in years.

356
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
He said, I'm worried about Monday.

357
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I was also in a bar and like, when can I go home to get up early tomorrow?

358
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You are watching. You watch the whole thing because you're like, I'm worried about Monday.

359
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yeah. Yeah.

360
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I know the level of agitation when these things happen to you.

361
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Are you in a way is it like a relief if they don't get into the world?

362
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
No, no, no.

363
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
This comes out.

364
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
No, no.

365
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Last year, I was like, you know what?

366
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
We're in house money.

367
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
If we win, we win. We lose. We lose.

368
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Now that's gone. Okay.

369
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Okay.

370
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
This is gone.

371
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Now, are you going to watch these things in public places or is it this is a home event?

372
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You need to be met at the game.

373
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm at home.

374
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Sure.

375
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Now, okay.

376
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Either you're there in person.

377
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah.

378
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Which would only be the case if they were against the Dodgers.

379
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Division series, division series.

380
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The first round of playoffs.

381
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'll watch it with people.

382
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Uh huh.

383
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Would you also have a kid now?

384
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So we'll have to figure out how like my responsibilities of being a father versus like,

385
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Oh, this is your first playoffs with a child.

386
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yeah.

387
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Oh boy.

388
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
This is now I'm Tommy's going to be really worried about the live results of the players.

389
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
So many games today.

390
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
There are so many games.

391
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yeah.

392
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
That's every day.

393
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
There's like 12 games every day.

394
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah.

395
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
What are you looking at?

396
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Just Google.

397
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Just a Google play.

398
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Google sports.

399
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Philly still in consideration.

400
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
No.

401
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
No.

402
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's bottom of the seven.

403
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Consideration.

404
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yeah.

405
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
They're still playing.

406
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's not playoff start.

407
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
They're still playing.

408
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's not a playoff start.

409
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's a regular season.

410
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Oh, we're still finishing the season.

411
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,560
As the listeners are hearing this, we're past world series.

412
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Correct.

413
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,560
Or in it.

414
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,360
No, it just the playoffs start.

415
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,560
No, but when are, when is the world series?

416
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Oh, end of October.

417
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,560
Yeah.

418
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,560
Oh, then it's past.

419
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
So we'll know.

420
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,560
We'll know your fate.

421
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,280
Your fate will be sealed by the time this is released.

422
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
It's on Patreon.

423
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,280
Yay.

424
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,280
So all the stakes are lower.

425
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,440
Uh, not, but not for us because we have to free the, I don't know if you know this, we

426
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,880
have to free the level keeper who is the cousin of the sector keeper.

427
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,880
He's he or she.

428
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,520
How many people died in your family?

429
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,080
Uh, it's like a Kennedy curse.

430
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:30,840
Uh, he's lived, he's lived a hard life.

431
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,960
Uh, so if we don't, you know, convey all the interesting stuff.

432
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,040
So we, we should maybe focus on.

433
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,560
Ideally it's bullshit they closed the Anaheim.

434
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,600
So we think it's because, and we're going to, we'll end up covering all of this stuff

435
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
on the same.

436
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
There were only nine.

437
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,600
I went to half of the ESPN.

438
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Where else did you go?

439
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,600
Four New York.

440
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,600
No, I went to four.

441
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
I went to New York.

442
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
You've been there more than 15 times.

443
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Maybe I went to New York, Vegas, a bunch.

444
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
And they turned the Vegas one into some bullshit.

445
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
Like it's called Tom's urban.

446
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Oh, then they changed it again.

447
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
Cause then like right after the ESPN zone closed, it was like SPN.

448
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,600
They just took the letter.

449
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,600
Yeah.

450
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
Or added a Y.

451
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
It was just.

452
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Yeah.

453
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:14,600
You know, like how a restaurant, like, oh, that was a Hooters and now it's like a Hineys.

454
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,600
That has to be real.

455
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:24,600
I only know that because I have a controlling interest in Hineys.

456
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,600
Jason is the CEO of Hineys.

457
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:33,600
Yeah, it's still an owl, but it's just a big bulbous butt protruding.

458
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,600
Yeah.

459
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,600
Yeah.

460
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
They paid over the owl to turn into like a sparrow.

461
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,600
They did that.

462
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
And they narrow its eyes.

463
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,600
You can tell the wire was bad because like all the, like the TVs had bad tracking.

464
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
Oh my God.

465
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
Yikes.

466
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
So there were electricities poor.

467
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
This is a big step down.

468
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Did you go to the downtown LA one?

469
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
Yes.

470
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
That's really neat.

471
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
Yeah.

472
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,600
Their corporate headquarters were it was like tight.

473
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
Yeah.

474
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Yeah.

475
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
The LA life.

476
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
So we've hung out at LA live before.

477
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
What did you have?

478
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
You spent much time at downtown Disney.

479
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Anaheim.

480
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Have you ever.

481
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
I've been there twice.

482
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Once he was in zone a long time ago to meet up a cousin because I had nowhere else to

483
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
go.

484
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Wait, a cousin feels like the perfect place to like I'm meeting my cousin.

485
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
Yeah.

486
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,600
And I, and I know, you know, I never went to Disneyland.

487
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,600
That's where I last saw my cousin.

488
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Okay.

489
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,600
We know.

490
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,600
Last time you saw your cousin was in hell.

491
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Oh man.

492
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Too far.

493
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,600
We're in hell.

494
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,600
What are you doing?

495
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
I stand corrected.

496
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,600
You guys are the one like, Hey guys, like, so you're in hell.

497
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
Yeah.

498
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
Yeah.

499
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
We met you in hell.

500
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
You were here already.

501
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
This is where the bad man goes.

502
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,600
You're living here.

503
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,600
You just, you're just taking a little, you're well, you're like, you're, you're just

504
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,600
like, you're like decompressing before the playoffs start in hell.

505
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,600
You're taking a, you're going to a less stressful place.

506
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,600
Oh, by the way, you dicks.

507
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:12,600
Um, so I mean, I've told you all this, but tell the listeners and Ms Carlson.

508
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,600
Um, so when I had the baby, we, well, the wife had the baby and I was just there not

509
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,600
talking, actually sports with my doctor throughout the thing.

510
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,600
It was mostly sports talk and then like, oh yeah, so she's fine.

511
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
He's cleaning up.

512
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
Yeah.

513
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:37,960
He did use a baseball analogy to how well the pregnancy delivered.

514
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,200
And only you understood it.

515
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,240
So Laura's like, is that bad?

516
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,240
She got it.

517
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,120
But she wasn't, she was, she was, she got it.

518
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
She got it.

519
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
She was, she was just like, fine.

520
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,120
Let me see my child.

521
00:24:50,120 --> 00:25:01,160
But I, uh, I posted a picture with me and the baby and then I got a bunch of, Hey, cool.

522
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,160
Good stuff.

523
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,160
You'll be a great dad.

524
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:10,040
And then I got one bad man is dot dot dot father dad.

525
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,720
It was five bad man father.

526
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,720
Yeah.

527
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,720
Something.

528
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,720
And I'm just like, no.

529
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:22,000
I've been up for three days and like, did you really get it?

530
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,520
Or maybe you were just like, God damn it.

531
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:34,840
Our podcast that you caused and created essentially the birth of your child.

532
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,840
But it was either good intentions.

533
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:42,200
My brain was so like destroyed from lack of sleep and just everything changed.

534
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,360
I didn't know if it was the funniest thing in the world or I wanted to punch Carlson

535
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,280
and him not the sector, not the second keeper, not in my two codes, just me.

536
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,800
No, you made them do it.

537
00:25:52,800 --> 00:26:00,400
If it was a good comment, smash that like button.

538
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,720
I was wondering if it was like, Oh God, did the sector keeper get a, his own, you made

539
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,760
me think about the sector keeper three days after I had a kid.

540
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,440
I think that was the thing I was like mad about as all people should.

541
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,040
He should be in your heart at all times.

542
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:22,120
I need to be like worried about the goddamn sector keeper, you know, while I'm waiting

543
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:27,840
on my kids hearing test results.

544
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,040
He's a child who you can learn from.

545
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,480
He should be the sector keeper should be friends with your baby.

546
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,480
I was pissed at the hospital.

547
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,160
Didn't have in its own ESPN zone.

548
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,600
And no, no.

549
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,840
So no TVs in the urinals.

550
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,840
No jeez.

551
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:46,240
Did you guys food better in the cafeteria than the ESPN zone or on par?

552
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,400
It was, it was like AMC good.

553
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,640
I think I might just like cafeterias in general.

554
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,600
Cause anytime I've had to eat the hospital cafeteria, um, I've been trying.

555
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
Yeah.

556
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
You would love it there.

557
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,160
Cause they push you around in beds and chairs.

558
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,520
They, they, they clean up your soiled linens.

559
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,560
They, uh, you don't even have to bother eating.

560
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,200
They can just intravenously feed you nutrients.

561
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,200
Like you would love it.

562
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,200
I'm surprised you weren't there.

563
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,520
It's like a bonded and like one of those hats just saying I'm a baby.

564
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
I get it.

565
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,520
I'm baby.

566
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,520
I am baby.

567
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,520
I am baby.

568
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,320
I'm going to go get eggs now.

569
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
Bye.

570
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,200
You can't get IV of tasty cakes.

571
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,720
No, I do have them in like a hospital.

572
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,120
I have them in arms for each though.

573
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:44,080
The more your stomach lining is stressed upon doing this ordeal, you will end up in the

574
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,080
hospital.

575
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,360
That's how much shared in cafeteria food.

576
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,360
I am dying.

577
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,720
It's time for me to shine.

578
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,440
I mean, that's one of the nice things.

579
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,880
The one of the saving grace to being in the underworld.

580
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,000
We don't have to eat in any of these ones.

581
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
They're all gone.

582
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Oh, sure.

583
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You couldn't eat if you wanted to.

584
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah.

585
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
That's a, that's a very good point.

586
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,520
Well, that's maybe a good opportunity to say that some of the things that you can no longer

587
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,520
eat.

588
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:15,160
Uh, I looked at the menu and they wonderfully categorized all the dishes into great sport.

589
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,880
Maybe you can translate what these sports things mean on deck salads.

590
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,880
Okay.

591
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,880
Okay.

592
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,960
That's like, uh, that's like a, you know, the first course.

593
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,960
Sure.

594
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,960
It'd be a first course.

595
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,520
I want to Carlson's fancy, you know, bourgeois bullshit restaurants that don't have, like

596
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,080
they only has one baseball game in the bathroom.

597
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,840
I've eaten with you at a Buffalo Wild Wings on a number of occasions.

598
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,840
I know.

599
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,120
And I wear my fanciest basketball shorts.

600
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,960
And you're trying, you're usually trying to get me to go to a restaurant with a cartoon

601
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,960
crab on it.

602
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,960
Well, that's it.

603
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,640
Cause that's one of my wife's favorite restaurants.

604
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,640
Yeah.

605
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,640
We do.

606
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,640
We should do it after the after the playoffs.

607
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,420
Uh, halftime sandwiches game, game on sandwiches.

608
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,080
Maybe that's like a half sandwich and soup.

609
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,160
It should be half sandwich and soup.

610
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
That's a good idea.

611
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
And I'm sure they didn't do it.

612
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,160
They have soup at hospital Sharon.

613
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,160
That they do.

614
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:14,680
Game, game on entrees, not game on trays, but game on entrees.

615
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,600
And then, uh, at the end you get overtime desserts.

616
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
Yeah.

617
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,600
Okay.

618
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
Those all check out fun stuff.

619
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,280
Do you remember what you would, I mean, order there like a normal, like just a cheeseburger

620
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:28,600
or something or yeah, probably like those restaurants, if you don't get the cheeseburger,

621
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
you're asking for trouble.

622
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
Yeah.

623
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,840
And then what would the beer preference be?

624
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,800
Is it forget what you like?

625
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,960
Oh, you would have six beers.

626
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,080
Now who's six beers at ESPN zone prices.

627
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,360
Jason thinks you're a rich uncle penny bags from the monopoly game.

628
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:52,480
Now it would be one of those giant like Coors lights that you made me drink.

629
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
Oh my God.

630
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,200
I bought you a yard for your birthday this year.

631
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,880
That yard house.

632
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,840
So you would get a yard at ESPN zone.

633
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,840
Yeah.

634
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,840
And then is that six?

635
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
That's the set six beers.

636
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,840
Is it three?

637
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,840
I guess it, I don't know.

638
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,400
Look, it's a lot of beer.

639
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,200
Have you ever been blackout drunk at an ESPN zone and eat at Joe's?

640
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,200
What was it?

641
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,200
Excuse me?

642
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
I didn't eat at Joe's.

643
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
I didn't eat at Joe's.

644
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
And a Bennegan's.

645
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
Do you mean Joe Joe's?

646
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,200
What's he did?

647
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,680
There was eat at Joe's.

648
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,120
I think that's a, it's like Joe's crab shack, but different.

649
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
I know what you, I can.

650
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,120
You were really drunk at that restaurant.

651
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:39,360
They made, so when I hate this, I believe cause man against the food was so salty.

652
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,360
I like Bennegan's, but I'm not proud of this.

653
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,520
It's not like sixth grade where I'm bringing about six grade adventures.

654
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,720
I'm not actually proud of this one.

655
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,320
You know, those margarita things where like they would make like a whole margarita mix

656
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,720
for like four people.

657
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,720
Yeah.

658
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,720
I drank the whole thing.

659
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Okay.

660
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,720
Okay.

661
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,200
I would just eat up the top and drink that.

662
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,200
Jeez.

663
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,200
Jeez.

664
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:08,120
This is when I turned 21 and it was at Kima, which is like a boardwalk area past Houston,

665
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,120
not almost towards Galveston.

666
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,120
Okay.

667
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,480
And then I tried to do like, Hey, I'm going to slide down one of those pole, like the

668
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,680
stairwells, like the high.

669
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:21,520
And I was like, you said to no one, no, I just said out loud.

670
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,840
And then I almost took out like a small family.

671
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,080
You partied for us.

672
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,240
You partied for our sins because you knew we, I will meet some men down the line that

673
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,440
will have never partied party for them.

674
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,440
Yeah.

675
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,800
It doesn't apparently so.

676
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,800
Yeah.

677
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,040
And now I'm like, I went to the baseball game.

678
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,520
I was like, no, I don't want, I'm just going to salt to water.

679
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,520
Man.

680
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,200
I can barely drink now, but uh, seasons that was bad.

681
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,200
Yeah.

682
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,680
So that was, but yeah, no, I would have like three of those ESPN.

683
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,680
Jeez.

684
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,680
The yards.

685
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,680
Yeah.

686
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,680
But I was with my folks.

687
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,680
So it'd be like, and they're from there.

688
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,680
Yeah.

689
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,120
Were they cool with the, the, the heavy drinking era?

690
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:05,680
They were like, they were, they were, I wasn't, I wasn't like doing dumb.

691
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,080
I was just college stuff.

692
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,080
Sure.

693
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080
Yeah.

694
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,320
That's pretty, that's pretty typical stuff.

695
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,920
But for us, when you're dealing with good, good.

696
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,920
Yes.

697
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,360
Not sector keeper is cool, but uh, yeah.

698
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,600
But this, but he's like, he's itching and Jones and right now, because all his, all

699
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:27,440
his jewels dried up because of the hot weather here in this hellish, in this hellscape.

700
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,440
Yeah.

701
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,360
I was looking forward to my Praline vape.

702
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,360
Yeah.

703
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,120
He's had a different flavor every time.

704
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,040
It was, if ESPN zone, uh, existed now, they'd probably have like a, you go to the bathroom,

705
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,480
they would have like a little thing where you can like press a button and get some like

706
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,480
jewel vape.

707
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
They probably would.

708
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,680
Like a concession stand of vape.

709
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,580
Is there like, cause the old cigarette machines, which I never bought cigarettes out of a cigarette

710
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,440
machine, but I kind of miss those.

711
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,800
There was something about the, yeah.

712
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
Like about them.

713
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,800
Like there should pinball.

714
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Yeah.

715
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,280
It was like a world heroes SNK video game system.

716
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,280
Yeah.

717
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,280
It was the fun quarter.

718
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,000
Arcade games and cigarettes.

719
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,800
There should be a jewel version of that.

720
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,520
I feel like with the fun levers to pull out.

721
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,520
Yeah.

722
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,520
Like a game.

723
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,520
It should be like a game where you get nicotine.

724
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,440
I liked, I think as a kid I did, I liked looking at Joe camel and pulling the thing.

725
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,200
Yeah, but now like, now that I'm an old man and I hear about the jewel stuff with the

726
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,920
teenagers, I'm like, they got to do something about that.

727
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,920
Okay.

728
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:35,640
So you wouldn't know bad man, bad man, cramp his lifestyle.

729
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,640
Sure.

730
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,320
I used to, I mean, you're probably right.

731
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,400
I used to buy dip when I was 15 at a convenience store that didn't care.

732
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,360
Kodiak or skull.

733
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,720
It was skull.

734
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,720
It's called skull.

735
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,720
So when I tried, yeah.

736
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,760
I remember playing like little league.

737
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,560
I didn't do red man Sheridan before you threw that in my face.

738
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,360
There was red man chewing tobacco.

739
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,640
Oh, I didn't know what you were talking about.

740
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,360
We would have had to be such deep experts.

741
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,980
My memory is that when I played little league, the kids weren't doing it, but there was,

742
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:16,320
the gas station next to the baseball field sold beef jerky and there was shredded beef

743
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,760
jerky and canister.

744
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,760
I didn't just imagine that.

745
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,200
Big league chew is the biggest gateway dip.

746
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,200
Like, right.

747
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,200
Yeah.

748
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
Yeah.

749
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,560
I was more of a juicy fruit kid.

750
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,960
I'm going to kick my own ass.

751
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,960
I don't even like you.

752
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,400
That was a point of the penalty box.

753
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
We haven't used the penalty box.

754
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,400
Is that a warning?

755
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,400
Is that a warning?

756
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,400
Yellow card.

757
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,200
I'm going to say only this, only the sector keeper can miss you.

758
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,600
Penalty box really pushing your love.

759
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,200
I'm too little to, we're all a little reimbushes.

760
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,840
We've been trying these marathon recordings and they're starting to get to us.

761
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,840
Yeah.

762
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,800
Juicy fruit at the hospital gift shop.

763
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,600
Yeah, they do.

764
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,200
But what was the other dip thing?

765
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,800
Oh, did you, I don't, when you took the-

766
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,800
This episode is mostly about dip.

767
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:08,120
When you took the SATs, did you ever dip during a break or did like-

768
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,120
Whoa, interesting question.

769
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,120
Wow.

770
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,040
You think you were allowed to chew gum during the SATs?

771
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,040
Maybe.

772
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,040
I don't remember rules about that.

773
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040
No, I never took the SATs actually.

774
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,320
Did you take the ACTs?

775
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,320
Yeah.

776
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,320
I heard that was easier.

777
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
I don't know.

778
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,320
Okay.

779
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,320
No, I think I took that seriously.

780
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,320
Yeah.

781
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,960
So sector keeper, do you think you're going to go back to high school or just go for a

782
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,960
GED?

783
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,960
GED?

784
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:34,320
Yeah, I guess that's, I don't really, I mean, that's sort of a replacement for a high school

785
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,560
because you're simultaneously like 16, but also 500.

786
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,680
So I'm not sure like what you need to be, what educational level you need to be at.

787
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,680
He needs a YouTube channel.

788
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,600
Oh, that might be the future.

789
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,600
Yeah.

790
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,440
Cause he just got fired from his job.

791
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,480
So that's a way for you to make some money.

792
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,480
Yeah.

793
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,280
Mr. Monday, I lost my job at cricket wireless.

794
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,280
He's looking for something.

795
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,680
Wait, did they close down a cricket wireless in the downtown Disney?

796
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,440
No, no, amazingly there was not one of those there.

797
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,440
No.

798
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,440
Never even got there.

799
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,160
So is there a sports bar at downtown Disney?

800
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
Yeah.

801
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,680
Where'd you go to watch sports now?

802
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,480
I guess now you'd go to Ballast Point or-

803
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,480
They have a-

804
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,320
That's kind of dumb because like, I mean, I know there's other sports bars, but like,

805
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:26,280
cause there's Anna, there's the angels, there's the ducks, there's monster truck rallies.

806
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:31,520
There's not a sports bar focused one and right by Angel Stadium now there's a massive golden

807
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,520
road brewery.

808
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,520
Oh, that's right.

809
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,520
That was there last night.

810
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,520
Oh yeah.

811
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,520
Congratulations.

812
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,880
The, that because they won, not that you went.

813
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,280
I don't doubt your ability to get down there and back safely.

814
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,320
Well not as well as you guys, but-

815
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,320
We know those roads.

816
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,080
We know the five freeway very well.

817
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:59,360
In the, in galaxy's edge in the, in some bathrooms, they're calling like a fake star wars sports

818
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,520
event on the speakers.

819
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,520
Oh that's right.

820
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,520
Is it pod racing?

821
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,520
Yeah, it's kind of cool.

822
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,520
No, it's not pod racing.

823
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,520
It's not.

824
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,560
There's like sort of a chess, one of them is like a chess match.

825
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,080
Sort of like an intergalactic chess match.

826
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,080
That's a sport.

827
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,080
Space chess.

828
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,280
Mikey, now you're pushing it.

829
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,680
Yeah, penalty box.

830
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,000
I was a varsity level athlete.

831
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,800
I played tennis in high school.

832
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,160
Did you get a letterman jacket?

833
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,160
Yep.

834
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
That's all I'm just talking about.

835
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,160
Your letterman jacket.

836
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,160
Yeah.

837
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,160
It said band and tennis on it.

838
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,160
Cool.

839
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,160
I eat ices the room.

840
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,160
Do you still have it?

841
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,160
Yeah, somewhere.

842
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,160
You should wear it.

843
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,160
Yeah, you should wear it.

844
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,160
You should wear it.

845
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:41,160
An event that will have already happened.

846
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:46,840
Maybe I did.

847
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:51,280
We should talk about some of the things that there are to do besides cigarette machines.

848
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,840
There were a lot of real games.

849
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,840
I was trying to find pictures of these things.

850
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,760
There's something, I saw a big sign for something called RPM Tonight.

851
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:05,880
I saw a claw machine with just an unrelated claw machine with the word sports center slapped

852
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,880
on it.

853
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,000
Just kind of in a corner, not even up top.

854
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,960
What if they had like Scott Van Pelt dolls you could get?

855
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,960
Dan Patrick.

856
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,840
Mommy, I got a Keith Olbermann.

857
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:24,120
Now you can go back and forth with Skip Bayless.

858
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:35,280
Well, if in general this location, the bottom floor is the restaurant, but the top floor

859
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,680
you'd walk in and there's a stairwell and it says sports arena, which is not accurate.

860
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,640
That's not what the building is, but I guess sports arena means the games area.

861
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,920
So you know, also in addition to like a whole game thing, whole game floor.

862
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,920
Yeah.

863
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,920
Oh, wow.

864
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,400
So focused on the focused on your, the real games.

865
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,800
You didn't get to play games of your own.

866
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,920
Well, just had to try to get done with this goddamn dinner with my cousin.

867
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,600
It seems like, uh, yeah.

868
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,800
Were you, were you trying to rush that?

869
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
Oh yeah.

870
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
I was like, yeah, well, let me do the, the, okay.

871
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,800
The ESPN zone.

872
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,800
That's what I'm trying to clarify.

873
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,800
The cousin with the second, does he, do you even like the cousin?

874
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,800
It seems like you get along.

875
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,720
I would kill to have dinner with my cousin.

876
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,720
You love them.

877
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,720
I love her.

878
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,720
You're my her.

879
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,720
We'll find out.

880
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,640
To be announced.

881
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,840
Your beloved cousin TVA.

882
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,080
What, uh, what replaced the ESPN zone?

883
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:35,680
Well, we can, we can, we can talk about that a little bit, uh, and come back to the ESPN

884
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,680
zone.

885
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,680
Sure.

886
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,680
I don't think you're going to be happy.

887
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
Yeah.

888
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,560
You're not, well, it was, they were just going to demolish the building entirely and it was

889
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,520
going to be a new luxury hotel or a real fancy Carlson kind of place.

890
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,520
Yeah.

891
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,520
They did.

892
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,840
They, uh, they just, they didn't get the right zoning from the city.

893
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,840
They lost it.

894
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,840
We've covered it.

895
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,280
They let, you know, they like elections didn't go their way and all this shit.

896
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,560
So the, none of it got built.

897
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:02,880
So this just, uh, was there like a law, like shall we, we shall demolish the ESPN zone

898
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,240
tax incentives, 2012 tax.

899
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,360
They were giving them incentives for a hotel because they were going to close all these

900
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,360
businesses.

901
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,440
They were actually going to lose jobs for the city.

902
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,160
It was, they were going to build a hotel in a different spot.

903
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,840
And then Disney was like, all right, we're going to build it here.

904
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,960
Give us the same tax incentives and then they were like, no, we're not giving you those

905
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,240
tax incentives.

906
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,360
So then they said, uh, no, we're not building anything.

907
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,440
Sounds like typical Disney wheeling and dealing in Anaheim.

908
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,800
Thank God we're behind the paywalls.

909
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,040
They can't hear us complain and we can hopefully get some more free stuff.

910
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:37,320
My mind is just, you know, just adding $5 to his mentions.

911
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,960
It's like all everybody on Twitter and like, what are people saying about me?

912
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,680
Oh, Bob Iger subscribes to us and doughboys.

913
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:50,760
So when he gets jacked, he calmly drinks water.

914
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,760
His reaction to most things.

915
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,760
Jacked up like he gets riled up.

916
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,760
Yeah, he gets riled up.

917
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,480
I did read an interview with Iger where he said that he, one of his favorite shows right

918
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,680
now is Netflix's love, which Mike Mitchell is on.

919
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:04,200
So he is, so yeah, weirdly yes.

920
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,340
Or a podcast maybe.

921
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:10,920
So if Mitch walked into a room and Iger was in the, Iger might go, Hey, Oh my God, Randy,

922
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,280
when are you going to get it together?

923
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,280
We got to figure this out.

924
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,280
Yeah.

925
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,640
Isn't that not, I'm not sure if he even knows that.

926
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,640
We'll tell him.

927
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,400
Is it a college alum?

928
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,040
Mike Mitchell and Bob Iger.

929
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,440
Oh, he's in the container.

930
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,440
Yeah.

931
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,560
All three of you went to the same undergrad.

932
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,000
We have to get the ultimate, if the Korean Union going.

933
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
The ultimate, yeah.

934
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Oh man.

935
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,480
Carl's already figuring out the machinations of how this can work out for him.

936
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,480
Yes.

937
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,080
By it being very amusing.

938
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,080
Yeah.

939
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,080
By it being fun.

940
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,640
By being a party with his three favorite people, it's Jason and Bob Iger.

941
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,560
If I become best friends with Iger when he runs for president, then I can be.

942
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,880
So what did they replace it with?

943
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,040
So the thing was just sitting empty for a while and then they, does anyone have the

944
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,040
full name?

945
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,040
Yeah.

946
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,040
It's somewhere.

947
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,240
You're going to hate it so much.

948
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,280
Hop up Disney exclamation point, a Mickey celebration.

949
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,400
It is what is known as an Instagram museum.

950
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,200
Basically different rooms and statues and what are called, I know, I know.

951
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,040
You should like this.

952
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,880
Museum in quotes because there's really no, besides different rooms and quote unquote

953
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,820
exist, there's no real exhibit.

954
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,400
There's no scholarship involved.

955
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,680
It's just different rooms of like take a picture with a reflective Mickey.

956
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,680
Take a picture.

957
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,680
I'll show you some photos here.

958
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,920
I got one of these guys in this neon room.

959
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,920
Yeah.

960
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,680
This is like Mickey related selfies.

961
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:41,920
It's like the museum of ice cream or there's other places.

962
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,880
So what do you think, Mundy?

963
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,560
What if I were to tell you this cost a roughly $30 to get into?

964
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,560
I'm out.

965
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,560
He's leaving.

966
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,560
He's leaving.

967
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,560
Putting himself in the penalty box.

968
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,560
Putting the mic on.

969
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,560
Drinking tickets.

970
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,560
Diet Coke.

971
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,560
Not at all.

972
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,560
Calmly drinking Diet Coke.

973
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,560
Yeah.

974
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,560
You can see a.

975
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:05,720
I mean the ESPN zone is garbage shit, but like it, that's.

976
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:11,840
What it was, was Disney's place to watch sports and Disney's place to play arcade games.

977
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:19,520
And it was replaced by a place to pay an upcharge to take Instagrams next to the most Instagramed

978
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,040
place on earth.

979
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,320
I like when ESPN zone was like the worst part of America and now this is.

980
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,320
Yeah.

981
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,000
It did change with the generations.

982
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,200
It, I mean it makes you feel any better on the TVs outside.

983
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,160
They usually have a few games still playing.

984
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,160
They forgot to shut off the feed.

985
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,160
The ones falling kingdom.

986
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,440
The feeds are still falling kingdom.

987
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,760
I mean it was bad.

988
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:47,200
I mean like, look, I liked the America where it was like so decadent.

989
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,840
You could watch like wood chopping while peeing.

990
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,840
And now.

991
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,840
Yeah.

992
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,540
But this bullshit is just too far.

993
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,000
You think this like the way you can.

994
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,240
You pay $30 for Instagram pictures.

995
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,960
But your head is in between Minnie and Mickey kissing.

996
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,640
And that's cute.

997
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,640
Like they're kissing you.

998
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,640
Did you do that with half of your dream?

999
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,640
Bad man.

1000
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,640
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

1001
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,640
All bad man.

1002
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,640
It's just a bad value.

1003
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,360
$30 at ESPN zone.

1004
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,280
You could probably get one hamburger and one giant beer.

1005
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,280
Right.

1006
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,920
And go and play a bunch of air hockey.

1007
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,160
And like, and you can Instagram every bit of that.

1008
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,160
Yeah.

1009
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,520
What kind of political party am I mad at that best represents this?

1010
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:37,880
I think it, I, well, we're apparently supposed to hate, all hate Bernie.

1011
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,800
So I think it's Bernie.

1012
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,720
Twitter's telling me that I need to hate Bernie.

1013
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,720
So it's Bernie.

1014
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,720
Let's say Bernie.

1015
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,720
Bernie's doing it.

1016
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,720
Bernie would spend $30.

1017
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,840
This is the future liberals dream of.

1018
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:55,080
The man, the man who bought soup on sale.

1019
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,520
Photograph buying on sale soup.

1020
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,280
Who cuts his own hair.

1021
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,280
They probably have like.

1022
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,280
Pod save America guys.

1023
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,520
They probably have some prime time soup.

1024
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,520
Oh yeah.

1025
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,360
What are their soups called?

1026
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,360
Oh yeah.

1027
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:14,000
50 yard dash of like salt.

1028
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
That's right.

1029
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,240
I honestly, I think overtime desserts, like overtime can be very stressful.

1030
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,920
I don't want to be stressed when I eat dessert.

1031
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,760
I think it should be called like dessert dingers.

1032
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,920
No, it's like a happier dessert.

1033
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,360
Eager dessert, eager dessert fatty.

1034
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,360
We're going to go gamble.

1035
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,360
Oh, in Vegas, maybe.

1036
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,360
Yeah.

1037
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,360
Yeah.

1038
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,360
Yeah.

1039
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,440
They don't want you sticking around anywhere for too long in Vegas.

1040
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,760
That's not like the gaming.

1041
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,760
We're in overtime.

1042
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,760
You got three minutes.

1043
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,760
Yeah.

1044
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:44,120
That sounds familiar.

1045
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,640
You're back rung true.

1046
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,200
Like somebody's put a buzzer on you to get you to stop eating dessert.

1047
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,200
Not that part.

1048
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,200
Not the cruel part.

1049
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,720
Just like a lot of buzzers going on.

1050
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,720
Yeah.

1051
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,720
Oh sure.

1052
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,720
I'm sorry.

1053
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,720
Okay.

1054
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,960
We've had, there's a controversial thing we've always talked about.

1055
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:05,560
I recall going to, so my parents took me and my brother were in high school.

1056
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,120
We went to Disney world.

1057
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,120
Yeah.

1058
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,760
You know, my mom, when I think it was weird, like it might be one last family trip for

1059
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,760
a while.

1060
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,760
She was wrong.

1061
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,360
Cause we were like, well, just hang out with you.

1062
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:23,000
I recall it like there was a hotel and there was like waterway and we got to Disney world

1063
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
through water.

1064
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Yeah.

1065
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
There's a lot of rail.

1066
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Yep.

1067
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Yep.

1068
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Yep.

1069
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I recall it being an ESPN hotel.

1070
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:38,840
Well, so it was like around 97, 98 when the boardwalk hotel had an ESPN restaurant, not

1071
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:44,480
an ESPN zone, but a separate ESPN themed restaurant with their, and the logo was big on it.

1072
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,480
That is not there.

1073
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,920
That is, it's not there anymore.

1074
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:47,920
ESPN club.

1075
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,920
Yeah.

1076
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,920
Club.

1077
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,920
Or is it still there?

1078
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,920
Might still be there.

1079
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,920
It's there.

1080
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,920
I think.

1081
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,200
Hotel being decorated with ornate sports stuff.

1082
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,280
Well, there is all star sports.

1083
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:02,800
I think you're thinking of the all star sports.

1084
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,800
Let me pull that for you.

1085
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,520
That's how I tell where there's big basketballs and bats and bowling pins and stuff.

1086
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,520
I remember.

1087
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,800
Cause we mostly, me, my dad and my brother mostly spent the entire time playing time

1088
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,800
crisis.

1089
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,520
That, that, now that doesn't, because every hotel usually has an arcade.

1090
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,520
Like this.

1091
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,920
Does this look familiar?

1092
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,920
Was it by water?

1093
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:21,920
No.

1094
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,920
So he's, you are thinking of the ESPN club.

1095
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,640
The ESPN club is by water.

1096
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,640
I think it's on the boardwalk.

1097
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,640
The memories together.

1098
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,400
Cause like this is the, here's my sport.

1099
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,320
Here's a Huey and Dewey playing tennis.

1100
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,720
No, no, there was no like Disney stuff.

1101
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,720
Yeah.

1102
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:39,960
This is the, I, you, I'm sure you were thinking of the ESPN club at the boardwalk hotel.

1103
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,240
The boardwalk is a long water.

1104
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,800
So it's a, it's, it is not, you're correct that there is a big ESPN thing, but it is

1105
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,840
not a full hotel.

1106
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,360
It's part of a hotel that is ESPN.

1107
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,600
So this is what it looks like inside.

1108
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,600
Does this look familiar?

1109
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,360
The ESPN club was 20 years ago.

1110
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,360
Okay.

1111
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,080
So it's like this was the outside water.

1112
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,080
I remember the water.

1113
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,080
Yeah.

1114
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,080
Time crisis.

1115
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:07,480
And this is right on the water, but you still seem to be, you're still supposing there was

1116
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,720
a full ESPN hotel.

1117
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,840
Which is not documented on any website.

1118
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,520
That's what I mean.

1119
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,520
I might be wrong.

1120
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,200
I mean, I think this happens a lot on this podcast.

1121
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,720
I mean, it happens to us on this podcast.

1122
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,800
But we had a bunch of ESP.

1123
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,440
I mean, we ate, there was a lot of like, everything was ESPNs.

1124
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,960
Well you might just, you just meant to maybe never left that part of the hotel to see non

1125
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,800
ESPN themed stuff.

1126
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,960
That is a very high possibility.

1127
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:42,040
You may not have noticed the 1930s Atlantic city wings of the hotel.

1128
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,760
Oh, is that what it was?

1129
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,040
That's what the bulk of it is.

1130
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,040
Yeah.

1131
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,560
And it's really weirdly the rest of it doesn't feel like ESPN at all.

1132
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,560
Yeah.

1133
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,360
But this is a nice hotel.

1134
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,360
It's a very nice hotel.

1135
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,360
Yeah.

1136
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,040
It's where I would have been very new around that time.

1137
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,520
Like very new and heavily advertised around that time.

1138
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,960
It look like this.

1139
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:00,960
Yeah.

1140
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:01,960
That feels right.

1141
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:02,960
Yeah.

1142
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,040
The 1930s Atlantic city is your sport.

1143
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,720
Pretty much.

1144
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,720
That is where my family comes from.

1145
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,720
Yeah.

1146
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,720
ESPN hotel.

1147
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,720
It's one side of my family.

1148
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,720
Yeah.

1149
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,120
But it's not the ESPN hotel.

1150
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:20,200
That's a, you know, we're all, we're all about clarifying names and rules and sectors and

1151
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,560
guidelines.

1152
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,360
So while I don't doubt that you've been here.

1153
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,360
Sector keepers.

1154
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:30,880
Sector keeper who cannot jewel in the underworld is enjoying some tasty cake mini donuts.

1155
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,640
I need something.

1156
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,640
To keep you interested.

1157
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,720
We're talking about clarifying names and borders and districts.

1158
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:41,560
Your favorite thing.

1159
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,560
That's all I'm saying.

1160
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,680
And I'm going along with it too this time.

1161
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,600
I was like, all right, it's like, just don't try to ruin the show this time.

1162
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,040
Well, I mean, because this did come up before.

1163
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,160
I was curious where you were going to land this time because this all came up when we

1164
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,040
went out to the yard house today, the spiritual heir to the ESPN zone.

1165
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:02,840
And you were more insistent at the time that it was a fully ESPN hotel and you called your

1166
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,240
mom to check.

1167
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,240
Yeah.

1168
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,420
And then she said, yeah, ESPN hotel.

1169
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,360
And we were like, well, she's just, I think this is remembering it too.

1170
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,360
And you said, are you calling my mom a liar?

1171
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,360
Yeah.

1172
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,360
Are you?

1173
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,360
I am not.

1174
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,360
It's not a miss.

1175
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:20,160
It's a big portion of the hotel is the ESPN club.

1176
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,160
Yes.

1177
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,480
You're absolutely right.

1178
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,480
Water.

1179
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,480
We're getting there.

1180
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,320
Did you check to see if at a time crisis in there?

1181
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,760
From my memory of staying there around that time, I definitely, time crisis was.

1182
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,760
Yes.

1183
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,760
You remember this.

1184
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,360
This is the ESPN wide world of sports.

1185
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,360
Yeah.

1186
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,160
Oh, but that's not a hotel.

1187
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,360
It's a complex and I believe it's closed.

1188
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,360
It is closed.

1189
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,360
So why?

1190
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,360
So that brought a memory.

1191
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,360
What are you looking at guys?

1192
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:53,600
It's a picture of a, it's like the universal studios logo, but it's.

1193
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,720
But sorry, I can't turn all the way around.

1194
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,720
Wide world of sports.

1195
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,720
It's yeah.

1196
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,720
Yeah.

1197
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,720
A big globe.

1198
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,720
Yeah.

1199
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,720
So yeah, they had a whole big sports complex and they had a racetrack and stuff.

1200
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:02,720
Yeah.

1201
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,720
That's, that's.

1202
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,720
But you didn't sleep there.

1203
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,720
Did you sleep there?

1204
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:13,600
Did you like sleep in a, in a, like a lot in a big locker dressing room?

1205
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,880
That's what it felt like the rooms were.

1206
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,200
It was like.

1207
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,120
There's an in room ESPN wide world sports channel.

1208
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,120
Hmm.

1209
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,560
It's somewhere in the middle.

1210
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:29,160
I think you, I think what happened is you went to Disney world only did ESPN related

1211
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,600
things and then left.

1212
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,400
And so your memory of the trip is entirely ESPN.

1213
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,280
Cause we had unkind things to say about Epcot.

1214
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,280
Oh man.

1215
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,280
Oh my God.

1216
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,280
Hang on a minute.

1217
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,280
What do you mean?

1218
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,360
I think my dad said, screw the nerd crap.

1219
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,920
We're playing time crisis.

1220
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,920
What?

1221
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,320
I think you invented that just now to make us feel bad.

1222
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,400
You've met my dad.

1223
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,120
It does sound like something your dad would say.

1224
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,120
Yes.

1225
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:00,280
He would put on some maroon five and not go to the nerd crap to play time crisis.

1226
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,680
Time crisis rules.

1227
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,560
He knows you guys get along great.

1228
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:05,560
Oh yeah.

1229
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,040
You've put all your differences aside and it's nice to see.

1230
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:13,160
And now it's, now it's the sector keepers, minions who criticize your parenting.

1231
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,400
He wasn't crit.

1232
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,120
Well, to be fair, it wasn't criticizing the parenting that would have been.

1233
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,120
Yeah.

1234
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,120
Yes.

1235
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,120
It was just stating the facts.

1236
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,120
Yeah.

1237
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,560
A fact assuming that you're a bad man.

1238
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,560
Bad man.

1239
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:31,680
Which is a title that came up because you, well, because you tried to change what was

1240
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,200
in your sector, but then you bought us all gifts.

1241
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,200
Right.

1242
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,200
Not Sheridan.

1243
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,200
Not Sheridan.

1244
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,200
That's fine.

1245
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,200
He wasn't there though.

1246
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,400
Like my family always say, you don't come, you don't get anything.

1247
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,400
You know?

1248
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,720
It's like they always say, uh, the one that's not true.

1249
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,160
Cause if someone goes on vacation, you usually bring stuff back for a bit.

1250
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,480
But like, if you don't go on the walk, you don't get.

1251
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,400
Wide world of sports is still open.

1252
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,400
Oh.

1253
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:00,200
And they have things like the Ripken experience, which I'm assuming is Cal Ripken.

1254
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,200
You have baseball player.

1255
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,200
I know that.

1256
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:07,840
Uh, they have the junior NBA global championship, Disney labor day, baseball classic, Disney

1257
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,240
cross country classic.

1258
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,320
They still have a lot of different sporting events.

1259
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:15,680
The third league baseball, the Braves used to do spring training.

1260
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:16,680
Yeah.

1261
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:17,680
Spring training.

1262
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,400
And it's also, I believe that one of the first site of the, Oh, what's it called?

1263
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,840
The world baseball classic.

1264
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:28,000
It was, but everyone hated it there because no one liked going to Orlando for baseball.

1265
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Yeah.

1266
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
They moved to the more madness.

1267
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,800
You jocks have it out for Orlando.

1268
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,800
Yeah.

1269
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,280
Look at there's a wide world of sports.

1270
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,280
There's wrestling there.

1271
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,760
Looking at a map, it is adjacent to the all-stars.

1272
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,400
So maybe you spent a lot of time there.

1273
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,200
So maybe it all like sort of blended together.

1274
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,680
You were staying right by a giant football helmet at the all-star resort.

1275
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,760
And then you went over to the wide world of sports and you assumed it was all sort of

1276
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,760
part of one.

1277
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,240
It's like memento where I'm just going to have to like put together like tattoo the

1278
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,560
clues on my show.

1279
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:00,520
He is unpacking the Mandela.

1280
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,440
And then you walked up to a vent and took a big hit from it.

1281
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:09,280
The other thing is if you look at it, of this part of the property, there's water everywhere

1282
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,840
on the Disney World property.

1283
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,840
Like there's little lakes and ponds.

1284
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:17,080
We did do some Disneyland stuff or Disney World stuff because we went to Star Wars and

1285
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,800
I got an A wing.

1286
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,800
You got one?

1287
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,800
OK.

1288
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,800
OK.

1289
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,800
I think you're shot.

1290
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,800
Yeah.

1291
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:24,800
Nice.

1292
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,800
How big?

1293
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,800
Big like a big.

1294
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,800
The size.

1295
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:34,440
Well, sometimes they have like a little tiny, you know, like the stainless steel.

1296
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:38,480
Why would he get a stainless steel A wing?

1297
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,120
I don't know why you wouldn't get a stainless steel A wing.

1298
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,120
Is it like a scale?

1299
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,120
It was like a toy.

1300
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,120
Yeah, it was like a scale.

1301
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,320
Some people get tiny vehicles.

1302
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,320
Why?

1303
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,320
I don't know.

1304
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,320
The action figures aren't tiny.

1305
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,320
You'd have to ask them.

1306
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,320
It's a choking hazard.

1307
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:55,320
That's true.

1308
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,320
I'm not for 18 year old man.

1309
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,320
Although you were.

1310
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,440
Did you think you'd accidentally put it inside your lip like you were dipping it?

1311
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,440
Yes.

1312
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,440
It's a very dumb child.

1313
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,440
You would dip an A wing?

1314
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,440
I was going to pick up my dip.

1315
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,000
I didn't dip a Disney land or world with my parents.

1316
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
What?

1317
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Wow.

1318
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I had a beer with them.

1319
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Oh, you didn't.

1320
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
OK.

1321
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I see.

1322
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I was 16.

1323
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,800
We should take it back to the ESPN zone.

1324
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,040
Well, we were talking about ESPN zone.

1325
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,040
That's not the zone.

1326
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,400
We were talking about Pop-Up CD and Mickey's celebration.

1327
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,400
That's club ESPN.

1328
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,400
That's ESPN club.

1329
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,400
I was just trying to find this.

1330
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,400
Well, that was a precursor.

1331
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,400
Something for dad.

1332
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,160
That was the back door pilot.

1333
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:38,320
But no, but the sexual keeper is told as we have to stay within the confines of the downtown

1334
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,480
Disney district.

1335
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,200
Don't forget, we're in a hell like place right now.

1336
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,120
Yeah, like we're ignoring the boundaries.

1337
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,720
We're underground or in the underworld.

1338
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:53,980
The boundaries are the metal detectors and the Honda Odyssey with the Star Wars Galaxy

1339
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,520
Edge logo on it.

1340
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,880
But we're under all of that.

1341
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:02,320
So we just have to like keep in mind where in the hell escape those boundaries would

1342
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,320
be.

1343
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:07,880
For example, formerly next to or across a walkway from the ESPN zone, there was an AMC

1344
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,280
theater, a large multiplex.

1345
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,280
Is that gonna?

1346
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,920
Yeah, it is currently closed.

1347
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,920
It's another one that they just left.

1348
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,420
They were going to demolish it.

1349
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:21,120
So what is just a bunch of Halloween super stores at pretty much does have that feel.

1350
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:25,640
Well, there's a lot of tables and they've started parking food trucks because they gutted

1351
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,080
some of these places so they couldn't open.

1352
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,080
What's the point?

1353
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,080
Like is this place just suck?

1354
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,040
This area is rough.

1355
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,560
There's a lot of empty spots.

1356
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,640
They were able to reopen a Starbucks and an Earl of Sandwich.

1357
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,080
They were able they were going to fast track.

1358
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:42,080
They should just tear the whole thing down and put more parking up.

1359
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:46,400
They might do something like I don't think they're gonna put parking there either.

1360
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,680
I'm sure they're waiting for the government to give them the sweetest tax break on whatever

1361
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,420
they're going to do there because they have to do something because they gutted the movie

1362
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:54,420
theater.

1363
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,160
They gutted not as bad ESPN.

1364
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,920
They supposedly they gutted Rainforest Cafe.

1365
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,200
Like it's just like there's nothing left inside.

1366
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,400
There's no way they can reinforce Cafe, the enemy of ESPN zone.

1367
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,960
Oh, you didn't get along with the rainforest cafe people.

1368
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:14,560
Well, it's just you'd well, they're both commercially bankrupt, like artistically.

1369
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:18,840
By my engagement ring, I want to rainforest cafe in the Houston Galleria.

1370
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:19,840
Oh, really?

1371
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:26,960
Well, you buy it at the rainforest cafe because they have like it's a big snake with a benefit

1372
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,120
than the main ring is a tiger face.

1373
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:31,120
You're back on the bad side.

1374
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,840
I'm just saying I always like the souvenirs at the rainforest.

1375
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,040
I liked rainforest.

1376
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,400
My family always had a good time.

1377
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,720
I don't know that we had a good meal, but we had a good time.

1378
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,560
Yeah, the foods like ESPN level.

1379
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:45,840
No, I think it's probably worse for the crazy slushy drinks like the crazy smoothie drinks.

1380
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:52,520
No, Jason would accept an engagement ring from the rainforest cafe.

1381
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:56,320
I think you would bully you would bully people coming out of rainforest Cafe.

1382
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:01,280
The gorilla's not real in there.

1383
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,400
Give a shit about the environment or something.

1384
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,320
Probably peed your pants when that fake rainstorm happened.

1385
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:14,080
Yeah, so can you watch while peeing?

1386
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:18,920
The AMC theaters, boy, a lot of history happened there.

1387
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:23,840
Why that's where the grand premiere of one of the finest films of the 21st century took

1388
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:30,120
place Tomorrowland George Clooney himself walked the blue carpet to celebrate the release

1389
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:39,040
of Brad Bird's epic vision and among the other guests, Cindy Crawford, Cindy Crawford's children.

1390
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:43,800
And if you remember a long time ago, I alluded to an appearance from a shark tank cast member

1391
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:50,640
Oh, Laurie Grineer, the one of the biggest stars at the premiere of Tomorrowland.

1392
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:54,640
Laurie has a lot of connections at QVC and Home Shopping Network.

1393
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,640
She sure does.

1394
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,880
That's when she was pitching herself to go to the premiere.

1395
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:04,080
Because anytime someone's a veteran or has like some like ailment, she'll give money

1396
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,920
to that's how you run a business.

1397
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,800
Oh, she's the one if you've got sort of a sad story.

1398
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,920
That's mostly what I watch as well.

1399
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,640
Yeah, the she's the one most likely to fall for.

1400
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,220
Okay, I should help this person.

1401
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,880
And then she's got to like, you know, sell this dumb hose that doesn't work.

1402
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,080
You know, like 50% of those deals go through.

1403
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,080
Is that right?

1404
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,080
That sounds right.

1405
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,080
Makes sense.

1406
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:31,800
I would like to see a real show about what happens after Aaron can attest that in the

1407
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:36,680
second act of most episodes, there's like a and then here's a here's an update on what

1408
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:39,200
happened to one of the shark success story.

1409
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,200
And I get angry.

1410
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,200
I skip it.

1411
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,600
I skip past that part.

1412
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,600
Boring.

1413
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:48,360
I want to see negotiation and I want to see Kevin being mean and Damon not doing anything,

1414
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,880
not bidding or talking or damn it's boring.

1415
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,760
I hate every child on that show.

1416
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,600
Oh, you're sick of the kids.

1417
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,600
Yeah, yeah.

1418
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,600
Yeah.

1419
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,040
Well, this dog treat dogs love it.

1420
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,920
I'll tell you who doesn't have time for the kids.

1421
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:02,920
Mr. Wonderful.

1422
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,960
Yeah, he is not cotton to that.

1423
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,440
I feel like he's there to make money and to make child friends.

1424
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,800
Not like us.

1425
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,560
We love making kid friends.

1426
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,560
Yeah.

1427
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,560
Yeah.

1428
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,560
Dread lightly.

1429
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,560
Yellow cards.

1430
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:17,560
What do you mean?

1431
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:18,560
I love making child friends.

1432
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:29,160
What if you could have a restaurant that was more of a zone and SPN zone?

1433
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:34,760
Tired of going to the bathroom and there being no televisions over the year or only one.

1434
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,760
You can't change the channel.

1435
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:41,680
Not being able to carry your game from your seats all the way to the urinal.

1436
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:50,800
And Mike Carlson standing right in front of it with his champagne flutes.

1437
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,560
If we're talking, I have one more little ESPN zone thing.

1438
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,120
Could I interject real quick?

1439
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:57,480
You were just saying, Sidney Crawford and George Clooney.

1440
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:02,880
I don't want to get off on a whole thing, but I just Googled Randy Gerber, which is

1441
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,440
Sidney Crawford's husband, who has a tequila company with George Clooney, just to make

1442
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,840
sure Randy was there.

1443
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,360
Hey, Sidney, you want to go find some vape?

1444
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:19,400
And I just Googled Randy Gerber Tomorrowland premiere and there he is with the family with

1445
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:25,800
his Casa Migos shirt.

1446
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,080
That's why Randy Gerber was at the Tomorrowland premiere in 2015.

1447
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:30,080
Wait, wait, wait.

1448
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,760
Next checking is watching.

1449
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,000
Not Yummigos, right?

1450
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Not the Yummigos who we encountered in the Wetzel's Pretzels episode.

1451
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,840
Scott, you promised that we wouldn't.

1452
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:43,840
You're right.

1453
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:47,640
We wouldn't A to G it.

1454
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:48,640
What's A to G?

1455
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:52,960
Just where we like just we talk about Sidney Crawford's husband.

1456
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:53,960
This is actually a lot closer.

1457
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,160
This is closer to A to D. I think.

1458
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,160
Yeah, I think so.

1459
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:58,800
Do you know that story about like-

1460
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,640
I gave Monday, I said, you know what, rejects topics.

1461
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,280
Tell us what you need to know.

1462
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,280
Fair enough.

1463
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:10,440
I'm not going to politely sit here while you talk about tequila company politics.

1464
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:15,360
Randy Gerber, Sidney Crawford's husband's company with George Clooney, his best friend.

1465
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:19,520
There's a picture I just took of the two of them on motorcycles on the side of a truck.

1466
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,520
They love it.

1467
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,520
Aren't you glad you were here for that?

1468
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,520
And aren't you glad?

1469
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:23,520
He's putting down the mic.

1470
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,520
God damn it.

1471
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:25,520
You take the mic back.

1472
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,520
There's a story after they sold that like George Clooney invited-

1473
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:29,520
He's got more information.

1474
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,520
George Clooney.

1475
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:31,520
He's putting it down.

1476
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,520
No, this is good.

1477
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,520
He invited.

1478
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,520
He invited.

1479
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:35,520
He's bouncing off the side.

1480
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,520
Don't do that.

1481
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,520
Come back.

1482
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,520
There's like a story about like-

1483
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:43,520
Monday, we have a guest leaving and you were insistent on telling the Costa Migos story.

1484
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,080
It's a good story.

1485
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:49,560
George Clooney got all of his longtime buddies together and they all sat in a dining room

1486
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,760
and there was a briefcase in front of them.

1487
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:52,760
Hurry.

1488
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,520
And in each briefcase there was a million dollars.

1489
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,520
I think he's actually-

1490
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,680
There was a million dollars.

1491
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,320
Like 10 dudes got a million dollars.

1492
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,320
He's running out of dollars.

1493
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,320
That's a crazy story.

1494
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,320
He's keeping the sector keeper with him.

1495
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,320
That's a good story.

1496
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,320
He's leaving after he's done.

1497
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,320
He's leaving after he's done.

1498
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,320
He's leaving.

1499
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,320
Here, sit back down.

1500
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,320
We'll finish it up.

1501
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,320
Sit back down.

1502
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,320
Sit down.

1503
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,320
Sit down.

1504
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,320
Okay.

1505
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:12,560
Tell us one more thing you like about the ESPN zone and then you're free to leave.

1506
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,560
It was great.

1507
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:14,560
All right.

1508
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:19,400
I mean, it was like, you know, mostly ranch-based meals.

1509
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,400
That's good.

1510
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,400
That is a good summation.

1511
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,400
Great.

1512
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,760
Do you have any thoughts on the Walt Disney World Travel Company?

1513
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:31,320
What if I were to tell you their logo looks like Mickey ears but with little wings, like

1514
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,280
if you were looking at a plane head on?

1515
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,440
Did you know Randy Gerber is spelled R-A-N-D-E?

1516
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,440
It's not Y.

1517
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,440
Nick, you survived podcast.

1518
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:42,480
You survived whether or not the others agree.

1519
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,480
I say you survived.

1520
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:48,480
If you open that briefcase in front of you, there is a million dollars that I was hoping

1521
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,480
to set it up a little more.

1522
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,480
Gerber born April 27, 1962, is the son of Jordan Gerber and Ellen.

1523
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,480
Cut his mic.

1524
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,480
Cut his mic.

1525
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:55,480
Wait, wait.

1526
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,480
It felt deep.

1527
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,480
Before he goes.

1528
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,480
Okay.

1529
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,480
Yes, you're right.

1530
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,480
Will you be my little league coach?

1531
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,480
Hell yeah.

1532
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,480
Hell yeah.

1533
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,480
Will you be my little league coach?

1534
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,480
Yes.

1535
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,040
Oh boys, boys, you give me great strength.

1536
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:09,880
You also give my cousin the level keeper great strength.

1537
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:13,840
He just texted me from his prepaid cricket wireless phone.

1538
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:17,680
Who's the goddamn level keeper?

1539
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:18,680
Someone else hiding.

1540
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:19,680
He's his cousin that we have to rescue.

1541
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:20,680
He or she is his cousin.

1542
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:21,680
He or she is his cousin.

1543
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:22,680
He or she is his cousin.

1544
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,680
He or she is his sector keeper's cousin.

1545
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:24,680
Is it Justin Michael?

1546
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:25,680
Cousin.

1547
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:26,680
I'm not at liberty to say it this time.

1548
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:27,680
He's Justin Michael.

1549
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:28,680
He or she very welcome to be.

1550
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:29,680
He or she very welcome to be.

1551
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,680
He or she is his cousin.

1552
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:31,680
He or she is his cousin.

1553
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:32,680
He or she very welcome to be.

1554
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:33,680
Could it be Randy Gerber?

1555
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,680
No, no it can't.

1556
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:35,680
I've been unplugged.

1557
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:36,680
I've been unplugged.

1558
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:44,720
Wait, don't plug it back in until I take a picture.

1559
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,280
Think about what you're going to give.

1560
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,280
Mundy, here, wait.

1561
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,280
Okay, great.

1562
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,560
Let me document this.

1563
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:54,120
Wow, the first unplugging in the history of Podcast The Ride.

1564
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,440
Who would have thought it was Mike and not me?

1565
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,480
Wow, score one, Jason.

1566
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,480
You're over there.

1567
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,480
You're farther away.

1568
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,800
You wouldn't plug on the way out.

1569
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,320
You would be getting wedgies constantly if he was next to you.

1570
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:08,240
Mundy's going to pour his Diet Coke over our equipment and that'll be the end of the

1571
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,240
show.

1572
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,400
You started the show and you can take it away.

1573
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,400
All right.

1574
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,400
Boys, boys.

1575
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:18,360
Let's get back on track.

1576
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:23,040
To add to your inventory to help you along your journey, the level keeper has passed

1577
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:29,240
along an opened container of skull.

1578
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:34,320
It was left behind at the ESPN zone.

1579
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:38,480
By a bad man.

1580
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:43,600
Oh, when you met your cousin, you left all of your chew in the trash.

1581
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,600
I wasn't dipping then.

1582
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,600
I was an adult.

1583
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,800
The sector, well, your memory about all this ESPN zone stuff's hazy.

1584
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:50,800
It's all hotel stuff.

1585
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,800
It was 20 years ago.

1586
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:52,800
So you could, yeah.

1587
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,800
Well, this was a while ago too.

1588
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,800
So.

1589
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,800
Glenn was getting impeached then.

1590
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,840
That's the other thing I remember.

1591
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,200
It was just updates about the impeachment.

1592
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,200
Have you heard this?

1593
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:05,160
Have you heard about this impeachment back in the news?

1594
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,160
That's it.

1595
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,160
It's all.

1596
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,960
That was your Jay Leno impression.

1597
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:10,960
Very good, Jay.

1598
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:11,960
Okay.

1599
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,960
So we have an open container of skull.

1600
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:14,960
Is it?

1601
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:15,960
Yeah.

1602
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:16,960
All right.

1603
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,600
So we can use that against one of the future bosses that we're going to face.

1604
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,600
Isn't that exciting, Nick?

1605
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,600
Nick's leaving Nick Monday.

1606
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,600
You survived.

1607
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:24,280
I guess the ride, the dent in Disney or a deal.

1608
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,640
Let's exit through the gift shop.

1609
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:27,640
Is there anything you'd like to plug?

1610
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:28,640
No.

1611
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:29,640
Yeah.

1612
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,200
You can get out of here faster if you.

1613
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:35,280
No, thank you guys for having me on the show again.

1614
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,280
Please never again.

1615
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,280
All right.

1616
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,280
Fair enough.

1617
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,280
We're on the.

1618
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,280
This is great.

1619
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,280
I'm glad we can do it.

1620
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,360
I'm glad this is when I get to see all three of you.

1621
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,360
Yeah.

1622
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:46,360
And well before playoffs.

1623
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:47,360
Yeah.

1624
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,360
Best of luck to your team.

1625
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:51,560
Do you have anything to tell yourself pre-playoffs because this will come out.

1626
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:54,960
If you could say anything to a pre 2019 playoffs, Nick Monday.

1627
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:55,960
Take care of your kid.

1628
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:56,960
It's just a game.

1629
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,520
That's what I'm like.

1630
01:06:58,520 --> 01:06:59,520
Wow.

1631
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:05,400
You're so different than this six beer drinking school addicts that you used to be.

1632
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:09,840
I always forget kids.

1633
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:13,040
Skull junkie Nick Monday.

1634
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,040
This has been skull.

1635
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,040
I'll be the next one.

1636
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,040
Next time I have a kid.

1637
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:21,400
Like I'll just dip with a, you know, holding a picture of the number two skull junkie father

1638
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,400
again.

1639
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:30,760
The skull father of the year, the cover of skull times magazine.

1640
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:35,160
Dippity do monthly.

1641
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,760
Why vape when he can dip?

1642
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,760
Oh great.

1643
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,200
Now that's what the sector keepers going to start doing.

1644
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,680
So they get vape in the underworld.

1645
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,760
No, me and the sector keeper are cool, right?

1646
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:44,760
Heck yeah, man.

1647
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:45,760
Yeah.

1648
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,240
He's going to hook me up with some jewel pods.

1649
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,880
Skull flavored jewel pods.

1650
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:50,880
Oh yeah.

1651
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:56,040
Hey, instead of not more, not sector keeper, the bad keeper.

1652
01:07:56,040 --> 01:08:04,280
Oh, sometimes it feels good to be the sector keeper, bad keeper.

1653
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,280
Whoa.

1654
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,200
While we're in the underworld, he's going to be the bad keeper.

1655
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,200
Bad.

1656
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,160
You think it's only a universe with bad influence.

1657
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,160
Nick Monday.

1658
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,160
Come on, let's go.

1659
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,160
Let's go buy an F 150.

1660
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,160
Heck yeah.

1661
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,160
Let's roll some coal.

1662
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,480
All right.

1663
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:24,040
They're going to take off and get out of here.

1664
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,760
We're going to keep exploring the underworld.

1665
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,560
So the next couple of days, stay tuned.

1666
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:29,560
Thank you.

1667
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,560
Thank you so much.

1668
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,120
Seriously, just this is all fake bullshit.

1669
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,120
So you'll get through it.

1670
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,120
You'll get through it.

1671
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,120
What do you mean?

1672
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,120
We're in hell.

1673
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,120
Look around.

1674
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,960
Hell where you walked out from a screen door in a hell cave.

1675
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:43,960
I like Carlson's place.

1676
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:46,360
Stop calling it hell.

1677
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,760
Look what I have open on my computer.

1678
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:50,840
All right.

1679
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:54,160
So with him unplugging, stay tuned to podcast the ride the second gate where you'll see

1680
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:57,160
what there'll be two more underworld episodes.

1681
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,160
We'll see you tomorrow.

1684
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:08,720
Here we go again.

1685
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:11,200
Now that one, no complaints for me.

1686
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,200
Yeah, I'm there.

1687
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,200
Hey, all right.

1688
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,200
We'll go to the mirage.

1689
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,920
We'll just go to the mirage handicap table where I like kick ass a blackjack.

1690
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:20,080
So no stores or restaurants or reactions.

1691
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,120
That one table is going to be a salad sandwich afterwards.

1692
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,120
I don't even think he's talking about reviewing.

1693
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,320
I think he just wants to go to Vegas with us.

1694
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,320
Yeah.

1695
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:28,320
So you keep you in.

1696
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,320
Oh, yeah.

1697
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:34,440
Hashtag sector keeper cricket wireless severance.

1698
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:35,440
Yeah.

1699
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,440
All right.

1700
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:40,720
Can you play bad to the bone now on the on your way out the door?

1701
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:41,720
Sector keeper.

1702
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:45,600
I mean, I started it on the you just want him to sing it.

1703
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,680
It's been three endings.

1704
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:48,680
Yeah, we keep.

1705
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:49,680
You're right.

1706
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:50,680
I'm sorry.

1707
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:51,680
No, no, no.

1708
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:52,680
All right.

1709
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:53,680
Here we go on the way out.

1710
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:54,680
All right.

1711
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:55,680
Nick is unplugged.

1712
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:56,680
Goodbye.

1713
01:09:56,680 --> 01:10:05,662
Life period.
