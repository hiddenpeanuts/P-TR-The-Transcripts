1
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,980
I believe Griffin is in SoCal soon for a live George Lucas talk.

2
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:38,760
I'm proposing a Let Griffin Pick the Topic episode, a la the Eva Anderson episode, It's Time to Get Him on Club 3.

3
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,240
That's from C.

4
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:40,980
Al and Kelly.

5
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:46,520
And with that somewhat unsettling awareness of your personal calendar.

6
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,060
Yeah, really?

7
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:47,500
Yeah.

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,200
We now, we're greeted by you here.

9
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,420
That's the power of Club 3 is somebody said, Hey, guess what?

10
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,580
I know where a guy's going to be in a few weeks.

11
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,180
I'm going to force him into a room with you three.

12
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,860
Can I shape space and time?

13
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,100
Can I get him into a room?

14
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,200
I have a griff tab on my iCal.

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,120
Right.

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,320
I can track his wear.

17
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,060
It's going to be a legion on Thursday.

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,600
You've been barring Taylor Swift's jet.

19
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,520
We can all track the tail.

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:13,960
I have.

21
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,000
We've been, yeah, I should make it clear.

22
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:25,100
The Eras Tour and George Lucas talk show doing one show every three months have very similar mechanisms behind them.

23
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,620
Yeah, sure.

24
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,260
So we're sharing a lot of resources.

25
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,280
Uh huh.

26
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,340
Yeah, you're propelling in from Tokyo at a moment's notice.

27
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:33,880
Well, it happened.

28
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,360
You're here.

29
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,620
I was, you know, I also like.

30
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:44,220
And also let's make it clear with the after effects of Joke's side doing six waddo shows in the span of a week.

31
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,420
I apologize in advance for my voice on this episode.

32
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,580
This is what this is what Alan gets is the post.

33
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,280
He knew what he was getting into with the comment.

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,500
Yeah, it is post waddo.

35
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,060
One bit of business, a question that I had.

36
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,560
I introduced you in the last time that you were on, which was the Orlando live shows.

37
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:11,080
I was just hyping up how great it was that you came down specifically to hang out with us and do that.

38
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:19,660
And in the process, I said, it's the kind of thing that makes you want to notch somebody up from being just an accidental PTR legend.

39
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,880
Now, it left me.

40
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:29,280
Some people, some listeners regarded that as the official right turn of the wheel on that sort of thinking out loud.

41
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,120
Yes, as like a mid step.

42
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,260
I didn't intend for it to be or not to be.

43
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
Yeah, I don't know.

44
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,140
Well, that is the question.

45
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,400
That is always the question.

46
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:48,220
I'm wondering now, you know, being that I think a recurring theme of this will be the power that you have here in the club three chair, a power that some people should be taken away from.

47
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,400
We'll see.

48
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:55,180
We'll see if the next poll will result in you being banned from the show in general.

49
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:03,360
But I think it is up to you at this point whether you would like to move beyond accidental PTR legend.

50
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,120
Is there kind of a special nature?

51
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,520
I've always loved the kind of special nature and I've worn that as its own badge of pride.

52
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,240
And it was an interesting question you sort of threw up in the air.

53
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,140
Do we want to?

54
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,180
Is it accidental forever?

55
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,720
Is there a pipeline to be able to rise up to full?

56
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,420
It's unprecedented.

57
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,780
We don't know the rules here.

58
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,900
We've never and you're really the only person facing this specific.

59
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:31,100
But I want to remind you that within that same show, we landed on a new title, which I would say.

60
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,760
Oh, you're right.

61
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,380
I know.

62
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,000
I forgot it was the first chance to and I haven't said I didn't use it.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Exactly.

64
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,880
I think I'll let you say it, but I think this is the main honorific I want now.

65
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,220
It has now superseded.

66
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:40,680
Yes.

67
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,480
Accidental PTR legend in the way where I don't think I think that can stay accidental.

68
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,660
Ah, you know.

69
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,180
OK.

70
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:46,920
Well, wait.

71
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,280
OK.

72
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,680
Let me make sure I'm getting it right.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,360
And and you can rake me over the holes holes if I don't get it right.

74
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,820
So let me reintroduce you and say due to see Alan Kelly here on Club 3, complete or yes.

75
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,440
Griffin Newman.

76
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,280
Yeah, I got it.

77
00:03:59,380 --> 00:03:59,780
OK.

78
00:03:59,900 --> 00:03:59,920
Great.

79
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,200
Great.

80
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:00,420
Great.

81
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:00,720
Wow.

82
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,700
There's the first one.

83
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,000
Yes, that's the first one.

84
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,820
Leader accidental PTR legend.

85
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,900
We told her.

86
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,300
Yeah.

87
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,140
Which could be a CBS show that you star on.

88
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,660
The complete or I'd love to be the complete or seven seasons of the complete or seven.

89
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,220
Seven.

90
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,340
Seven.

91
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:15,860
Yeah.

92
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,940
You know, times these days.

93
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,620
I don't know.

94
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:18,980
Yeah.

95
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,180
The twenty twenty is a different.

96
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,600
The complete or only got seven.

97
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,280
Geez.

98
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,600
It does feel like 30 million.

99
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,720
You can only buy three houses.

100
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,020
Sorry.

101
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,160
That feels like basically the only kind of stable work left in television.

102
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,720
Right.

103
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,060
Yeah.

104
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:38,980
Is if you grab one of those procedurals that airs on CBS, you know, quietly runs for seven years.

105
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,500
Yeah.

106
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:39,840
Yeah.

107
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,720
Do it in a closet.

108
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,540
It's like it's like hiding in plain sight.

109
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,020
No one you know has ever watched an episode.

110
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,640
Right.

111
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,080
Yeah.

112
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
No one will ever.

113
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,140
Your friends don't have to pretend that they saw it or liked it or come up.

114
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,760
It's kind of great.

115
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,180
They'll just be happy to be at your awesome house.

116
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,600
And then when you when when you get the bill for every meal from now on, people are like, did you win the lottery?

117
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,980
And you're like, no, I'm on season seven of the complete.

118
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,160
It's better.

119
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:03,540
Yeah.

120
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,600
Somewhere to be.

121
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,420
Yeah.

122
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,500
So this is submitted to the poll.

123
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,800
You message me.

124
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,240
I told you guys I was going to be in town for this trip.

125
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,320
I thought I was staying on the town low.

126
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,100
I thought no one else could track my movements.

127
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,160
And I said, hey, I want to do an episode with you guys.

128
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,460
There were a couple of things we talked about.

129
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,040
I said, hey, you know, I was there for a lot of the city walk saga.

130
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,440
Should I jump on one of those?

131
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,320
It's around the time you're recording those.

132
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,920
There is a theme park attraction that has been pinned on the board for now, maybe a year and a half.

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,360
Yeah.

134
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,800
Well, I called my shot at one point of you guys made an offhand reference to I don't think anyone cares about this attraction.

135
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,820
Is it a Disney attraction context?

136
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,900
Because I know we get what the attraction is.

137
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,820
I do think it's an attraction people care about.

138
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,880
I care about it.

139
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:59,360
There's this is a whole thing that like I might be remembering the tone more harshly than it was, but I just remember it being brought up casually in a way where I messaged you guys immediately and said, I have a lot of strong feelings on that one.

140
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,300
It was really important to me when I was a child.

141
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:02,840
Yeah.

142
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,360
Much like Ghostbusters.

143
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,860
And and I I would like to have that episode reserved for me.

144
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,360
So you yes, we you you grabbed this one.

145
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,360
There is basically this.

146
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,240
This was what this is what C.

147
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,000
Alan Kelly did.

148
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:27,120
You completely were stolen for Club 3 because we were primed to do a very clean main feed episode where a guest talks about an attraction they love.

149
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,180
Remember those and those kinds of exactly almost.

150
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,400
I've seen the criticism sometimes of Griffin comes on.

151
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,480
He does an episode loosely tied in to promoting some project that no one cares about.

152
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,320
He's tried to find a Jason theme to promoting his new thing.

153
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,520
No one cares about which I would say it is not my fault that almost everything I've worked on is unsuccessful.

154
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,880
That's a lot of us in the podcasting world.

155
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,260
I'll copy paste that to myself.

156
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,480
A lot of people in podcasting.

157
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,820
Most work is irrelevant almost immediately upon release.

158
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,860
But yes, it was like, oh, we're here.

159
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,160
This theme park attraction.

160
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,460
People complain that doesn't happen.

161
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,660
They complain I hijack with these other sideways topics.

162
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,200
It was like we had one ready to go and it's been the fucking Matt Damon of the Jimmy Kimmel live.

163
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:13,780
Yeah.

164
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,360
It just keeps getting bumped for something new that pops up.

165
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,760
And multiple people in this room really like it.

166
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,780
Yeah, we'd love to do this.

167
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,560
Yes.

168
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,180
I think we're all in agreement that we'd love to do it.

169
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,520
It's out of our hands this time.

170
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:31,080
It's going to be a really focused, research heavy, pure attraction episode.

171
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,780
I'm excited for people to guess.

172
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,500
Like what's on the board left?

173
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,660
And I said I'll be in town for George Lucas.

174
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,700
I think it's time to finally do Blank.

175
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,500
It bumped last time mainly because you wanted to do more Frank Marshall Gate and free it to the main.

176
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,700
So it's already been bumped for that.

177
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,200
And now we've got another bump.

178
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,280
And this is a thing that spans continents.

179
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,340
Yeah.

180
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,720
This is not an oddball.

181
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:56,900
That's a clue.

182
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,580
No, it's like it's a major enough attraction that at one point it was operating in three different parks simultaneously.

183
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,220
I believe.

184
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,140
A lot of clues.

185
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,320
At least two.

186
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,920
But I think maybe three.

187
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,860
I looked it up recently.

188
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,280
Under multiple names.

189
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,080
And different versions.

190
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,480
Look, interesting.

191
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,540
No more clues.

192
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,040
We've sort of pinned it.

193
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,720
I'm going to be here.

194
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,740
I guess we finally do that.

195
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,840
And then a day or two later, Griffin, just feel like you should know this was suggested.

196
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,140
And right now it has a healthy lead in the poll.

197
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:27,780
Yeah.

198
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,660
Well, we asked you before.

199
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,420
We asked you permission before even putting it in.

200
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:30,800
Oh, sure.

201
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,000
Because we didn't want to.

202
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:32,560
Yeah, yeah.

203
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,680
We don't want to tie you to that.

204
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,500
So you told me.

205
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,880
Is that the kind of thing Griffin would like?

206
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,900
Like getting to pick whatever nonsense he wants to do?

207
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,880
I said interesting.

208
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,600
And I said, let me just start percolating some.

209
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,080
So then it goes up on the official poll.

210
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,500
It's got a serious head.

211
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:48,940
Yeah.

212
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,420
And then it goes up on the lead in the polls, which I was very flattered by.

213
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,980
And so I'm just like, well, now I really want to like.

214
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,560
So my list was I got up to like 15 options.

215
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,860
But you actually by my account, you sent us a casual 16.

216
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,320
OK, OK.

217
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,700
A slick 16.

218
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,980
I have it here and I want to run down because we're going to you're saying we're going to make the title of this still.

219
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,460
My thought was that up until this point and listeners will know if this was what was decided on the episode right now.

220
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,480
And then the other thing that they're listening to is still just called Griffin Newman does whatever he wants.

221
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,940
So you don't know where we're.

222
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:27,600
And there's a very specific thing we're doing here and a thing that my eyes long overdue on this show.

223
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:33,900
And what this ultimately boiled down to, because I can't put a lot of options, but some of them I went and I the right guess for that.

224
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:39,820
I'd love to hear a PTR episode on that, but I don't know if I'm the guy or maybe I would want to do this episode.

225
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:45,040
But I could probably we could this episode could get off the ground under other circumstances.

226
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,500
I could send a casual text.

227
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,400
I don't know how hard sell you guys on doing X or Y.

228
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:58,360
It's like what is the thing that could only happen right under these and so I'll completely force a little circumstance to this as I least list off some of the ones we didn't do.

229
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:05,060
But what we've landed on is a thing that I've been pushing for three years in a text or text thread longer longer.

230
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,020
I looked up the history of it.

231
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:07,300
Yeah.

232
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,800
Four years and was not pitched as an episode was something to do in the world.

233
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,020
You guys as human beings should do this.

234
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,200
And has always been with a certain amount of resistance.

235
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,420
We'll get to it.

236
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,740
But I went the making it the episode forces it to be taken seriously.

237
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Yeah.

238
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:23,440
Yeah.

239
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,340
You got us in a in a blocked room.

240
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,140
I don't know if it's locked.

241
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,280
It's a closed room.

242
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,160
You got us in a room with a closed door to have to confront this.

243
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,320
I wager to the enjoyment of the listeners.

244
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,280
It didn't feel like this is a self-indulgent thing.

245
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:46,800
I feel like people I want to believe knock on metal that this will be a satisfying episode in a way that kind of proves me right and changes the course of your guys lives.

246
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,660
Oh wow.

247
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,580
So let's act.

248
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,700
You've built it up a lot.

249
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,480
I'm trying to change the course of lives.

250
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,300
Hey here are some of the things you're going to read us the book The Secret.

251
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,820
The final the other two final contenders.

252
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,360
Yeah.

253
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,380
Which I want to just put on the record I think should happen.

254
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,200
Sure.

255
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,940
Jim Henson Records.

256
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:07,840
Yes.

257
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,980
Which released three albums in the 90s two concept albums Muppet Beach Party and Kermit Unpigged.

258
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,640
Yes.

259
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,800
And this this was attempting to me because I asked would that then allow.

260
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,640
I don't remember what's on what does that allow for the discussion of the She Drives Me Crazy music video.

261
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,080
Yes.

262
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,380
With a really random assortment of celebrities.

263
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:25,860
Yes.

264
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,720
Some of whom are on rhythm to the song and others who are grabbed in some studios somewhere.

265
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,800
In the post Henson death weird period where his kids are like what do we do with these characters.

266
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,840
They start a record label release three albums in like 18 months and shut it down.

267
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,140
One is Muppet Beach Party which is like concept narrative all the Muppets go to a beach together.

268
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:50,800
They get into a bunch of fights and those fights manifest in covers of songs like a third of which are Beach Boys covers.

269
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,000
So I'm like well that's particularly appealing.

270
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,980
Yeah I'm listening.

271
00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:05,060
Then there's Kermit Unpigged which is they get lost in a recording studio while trying to record a serious album and bump into a bunch of other musicians and do collab duets.

272
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,020
And it's like I think it's born to be wild with Animal and Sammy Hagar.

273
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,140
There's Ozzy Osbourne and Linda Ronson.

274
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,360
It's like an interesting grouping.

275
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,040
Buffett?

276
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,940
Is Buffett on one of these?

277
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,620
Yes.

278
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:23,840
The whole album is a play on MTV unplugged era but in a very tortured joke that barely reads in the title.

279
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:30,040
And then the third and final album and I'm getting to details here just so people want to hear this episode.

280
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,760
Let the whistle.

281
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,180
I want to sell the idea of what the value is here.

282
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:42,140
The third album was an album that Jim Henson recorded 10 years earlier that had been sitting on a shelf that then became his last postimus release.

283
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:52,900
Even post Muppet Vision 3D which is old brown ears is back which is an incredibly sincere straight faced album of Rolf the dog singing standards.

284
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,760
Like doing Sinatra style crooning of like New York State of Mind.

285
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,500
And it rules.

286
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,140
It really led the way to Seth MacFarlane in a way.

287
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,620
Truly.

288
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,880
Mr.

289
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,880
Cartoon Voiceman doesn't have to be jokey when he sings these standards.

290
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,600
Is it recorded before Brent Spiner records Old Yellow Eyes is back?

291
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,680
I think it was recorded in 86.

292
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,200
Okay.

293
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:15,320
Yeah.

294
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,180
It's a theme month about old eyes.

295
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:19,880
It might be that.

296
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,460
It came out after but was recorded before.

297
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,420
It truly was on a shelf for a decade.

298
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:32,780
The other one that came close, emphasis mine but typed out with such, a detailed history of MacFarlane toys.

299
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,520
Yeah.

300
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,180
Right.

301
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,440
Todd MacFarlane.

302
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:35,860
Yes.

303
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,460
Comic book artist extraordinaire.

304
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:38,940
Yes.

305
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,020
When he eventually leaves Marvel.

306
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,020
Creator of Venom.

307
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,560
Creator of Venom.

308
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,080
Venom and Spawn.

309
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,800
Radical maverick industry disruptor.

310
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,220
Yeah.

311
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,940
Starts Image which shakes up the whole fucking comics industry.

312
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,080
With a bunch of other guys.

313
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,160
Then starts a toy company.

314
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,540
Yes.

315
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,660
In between getting sued for defamation by hockey players.

316
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,380
I mean a bunch.

317
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,760
There's so much wild shit that happens.

318
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:10,100
And my argument here, and I know Todd MacFarlane's the kind of guy where if you hear any combination of Mike, Jason or I bring him up, you check out.

319
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,240
I know the face.

320
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,660
It's a face I saw my father make many times when I was growing up.

321
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,500
And I would try to monologue about the importance of Todd MacFarlane to him.

322
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,720
You go, this is some them stuff.

323
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,540
He's a fascinating character.

324
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,320
This is the thing.

325
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:34,360
I think if we fully broke down Todd MacFarlane and I think the rise and fall and rise again of MacFarlane toys is a good kind of like prism through which to look at him as a general figure.

326
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,740
I would argue he is one of the few good guys.

327
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,940
He is a classic guy in the PTR sense without being like horrible.

328
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,400
Yeah.

329
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,980
Clarifying good guys is kind of a key because sometimes we start to think do guys have to be evil?

330
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,520
No.

331
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,140
And then not always.

332
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,880
I think Todd has some like wild follies, which Jason is alluding to.

333
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:03,260
There are some classic guy moves, but I don't ever look at any step of the Todd MacFarlane story and go like Todd.

334
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,800
He's really blunt and to the point he's often right.

335
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,180
Here's what I'll say to sell it to Scott.

336
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,740
And his mistakes are so bizarre.

337
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,500
He's got a good voice to do an imitation of.

338
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,720
Oh yeah.

339
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,240
I'm like MacFarlane kind of needs to be a character on the show as a person.

340
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:20,580
Yeah.

341
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:20,920
Yeah.

342
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:26,680
Which means we need to sell to you him as a guy away from the stuff he did that you don't care about.

343
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,420
And I think if you understand him as a guy, then that stuff becomes interesting.

344
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,740
Look, I spent 20 years of my life trying to make this case to my father.

345
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,240
I don't know what ever worked, but I think I might be able to win you over.

346
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:45,480
But there was a moment in Orlando when Mike and I were riffing back and forth on like action figure scene drama and I saw you make the face my father made as a child.

347
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,320
Oh wow.

348
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,160
Oh, I didn't know what I was tying into.

349
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,400
This is a challenge I want to see if there's a way to overcome it.

350
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,060
Look, I have no doubt that I have caused this face in others.

351
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:55,920
I guarantee.

352
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,360
Totally.

353
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,600
It's just, you know, you're locked into your things.

354
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,920
That's why I find it appealing.

355
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,160
The challenge of like, I think there's a way to make this make sense to you.

356
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,500
Yeah.

357
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,800
As the type of thing you do find interesting.

358
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,680
I put money on the fact that you guys, if we just, well, what if we decided right now, actually we are going to do that.

359
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,280
I feel like the three of you could improvise that episode with no research.

360
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,660
Correct.

361
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,640
We could do it now.

362
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,640
Probably get it 90 percent correct.

363
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,400
Yeah.

364
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,040
Yeah.

365
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,600
We're not going to.

366
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,020
I'm just saying I have faith in you guys.

367
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,020
That's its own thing.

368
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,640
I'm just going to speed around some of the other ones.

369
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,180
I'm not going to go into the mess in depth.

370
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,720
One of the ones as I typed out was fuck it.

371
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,600
I'm forcing you guys to do mass magician.

372
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,480
Yes.

373
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:40,260
Oh, and by the way, Griffin's presence here did trounce mass magician.

374
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,820
However, mass magician trounced to the others.

375
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,340
It is the runner up for the fourth time, which means it is heading into the fifth poll.

376
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:56,800
And now here's a little I don't know when the next poll is going to be because maybe next month we will be deep into the throes of a certain saga.

377
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,600
I'm not totally.

378
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,800
I don't want to fully commit, but that might be what's that.

379
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,120
Anyway, ideas in the comments either way for what goes up against mass magician next.

380
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,140
But fifth time in the poll, it stayed steady at second place.

381
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:08,680
It did it again.

382
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,780
I voted for mass magician this time.

383
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,180
I voted against myself.

384
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:13,920
That wasn't very good.

385
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,700
Feels like it's genuinely the gentlemanly thing to see most.

386
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,060
Yeah.

387
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:23,520
But I also felt like do I use this slot for that when that is already basically inevitable?

388
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,780
And also, I think it I don't know.

389
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,680
It's we'll see though.

390
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,340
It needs to become the people's champions.

391
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:36,020
It felt almost like if I made this episode that its victory comes with an asterisk on it that I don't like cheating.

392
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,120
You're the Supreme Court installing.

393
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,980
You put your thumb instead of the people's champion George Bush just winning on his own, which we which would have changed the tenor.

394
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,480
I loved him.

395
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

396
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:45,980
He did it.

397
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,460
It's rocky.

398
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,000
Another one.

399
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,140
Zamuda Hall of Fame.

400
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,620
I feel like we've talked about this at some point on the podcast.

401
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,820
Did we say it on the show?

402
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,360
I don't know.

403
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,360
I mean, I don't know.

404
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:59,440
Maybe we've we've all in social hangouts latched onto the concept of the Zamuda.

405
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,360
Yes.

406
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:00,720
Yeah.

407
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:10,840
Zamuda being a hanger on of it's a reference to Bob Zamuda, Andy Kaufman's best friend who's like devoted his life to keeping the legacy.

408
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,020
I was into your 40 of being the professional Andy Kaufman expert.

409
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,400
Yes.

410
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:15,620
Yeah.

411
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,920
Contacted for interviews.

412
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:17,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

413
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,920
But like Mike loves a Zamuda.

414
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,900
Oh, for but if you have for Brian.

415
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,440
Yeah, sure.

416
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,740
We were saying Bob Gale.

417
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,260
Bob Gale's a huge Zamuda.

418
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:34,520
It's it's got to be for it's either for one of your past projects for a very specific phase of your career or you are the guy next to the guy.

419
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,000
Yeah.

420
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,340
So all of the living members of Queen or Zamuda's for Freddie Mercury.

421
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,600
This was what the episode was going to be litigating who counts as a Zamuda and who doesn't.

422
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,640
Is Ackroyd a Zamuda for Belushi or does it cannot as a Zamuda have enough of their own thing going on that they aren't as a Zamuda?

423
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,340
So I think Ackroyd is not a Zamuda for Belushi.

424
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,800
I think he's a Zamuda for Blues Brothers and Ghostbusters.

425
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:55,720
Yeah.

426
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:04,720
I think that's the distinction is he's actually more obsessed with the worlds he created than his dead friend and forcing people to still care about those.

427
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,120
Oh, sure.

428
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,620
And then I'll sort of be like, also my old buddy, John, like he's kind of the afterthought.

429
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,400
Sure.

430
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,160
John Taffer Follies is what I called it.

431
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,920
But another one where I just go, guys, this episode is inevitable.

432
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,420
Yeah.

433
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,400
Do I put my thumb on the scale and force it to happen sooner rather than later?

434
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,760
Sure.

435
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:19,860
Sure.

436
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,120
But also do I want to burn the shot on that?

437
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,360
I think it's the characters.

438
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,640
Yeah, you've been talking about this for a while.

439
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:32,200
The movie by Hard Rock, part creator John Binkowski.

440
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,380
It's so fucking bad.

441
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,620
I watched it on Peacock because you guys describing it without having watched it made it sound so weird to me.

442
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,120
Available on Peacock.

443
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,240
Still available on Peacock.

444
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:41,660
Still available.

445
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,140
But I'm just like, I've already spent the time watching it.

446
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,760
At some point, something productive needs to come out of that.

447
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,160
Sure.

448
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,760
Themed IP slot machines.

449
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,760
I was like, that's too general.

450
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,760
Anyone could do that.

451
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,660
Ken Forsey, come dream with me tonight.

452
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:59,980
A nine hour documentary on the maker of Teddy Ruxpin that I texted to you guys as if I was passing along the VHS of the ring.

453
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,720
This has cursed me.

454
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,160
I now can't sleep at night.

455
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,920
I couldn't believe you put this that this went beyond texts to something that you maybe wanted to talk about.

456
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:15,320
This as you explained it, like what just like an unwatchable crack, endless documentary about Teddy Ruxpin.

457
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,160
Not about Ted Ruxpin, about the man who created Teddy Ruxpin.

458
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,520
I think it truly takes four hours before Teddy Ruxpin is introduced in the narrative.

459
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,540
I'm not exaggerating.

460
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,340
It is nine hours long.

461
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,540
It is self-funded by the two biggest Teddy Ruxpin fans on the internet.

462
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,760
It is deeply bizarre.

463
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,200
I recommend people watching it if you are also deranged and depressed.

464
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,040
But ultimately, I was like, there's not an episode there other than me just being like, why did I watch this?

465
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,060
I believe one part of it was texted to me with like, here it is.

466
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,260
Don't watch it.

467
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,220
Yes.

468
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,700
That's a good starting point.

469
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,040
Yeah, that's a good starting point.

470
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,860
Jason, for perspective, I don't think you should start watching this.

471
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,760
Yeah, sure.

472
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,160
The 2003 Fox dating show Mr.

473
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,040
Personality, which we didn't spend a lot of time on that.

474
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,780
I didn't remember that one.

475
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,440
I couldn't find a torrent of it anywhere.

476
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,380
So I was like, it might be impossible to watch.

477
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,180
But this was given the prime post-American idol slot in one of their biggest seasons.

478
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,460
It was a dating show hosted by Monica Lewinsky.

479
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,640
Oh, it's that one.

480
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:21,160
The premise was it's the bachelor, but she's in a mansion with all these eligible guys.

481
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,400
But this show asks you to judge them purely based on personality.

482
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,060
So two key pieces of information are withheld.

483
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,900
She does not know any of her suitors careers.

484
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,220
She doesn't know how successful they are, how much money they make.

485
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,160
All of that context stripped away.

486
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:43,680
Secondly, she doesn't know how attracted to them she is or isn't because all of them wear masks.

487
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,940
That look like fucking man in the iron mask.

488
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,420
Like horrible, monstrous.

489
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,700
Like the things they put on burn victims to hold their flesh in place at the hospital.

490
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,400
Is this not referenced on the curse?

491
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,920
I don't know if anyone has watched The Curse.

492
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah, there's a show that is about burn victims.

493
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,080
I think 30 Rock maybe references it as well.

494
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,320
I was obsessed with it when it was on, but it's very hard to find any trace of it.

495
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,840
It is a thing that is not theme parky, but has weird curse theme parky energy.

496
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:19,500
If we can light up Masked Magician and that can in turn light up a bunch of, especially Fox reality crap.

497
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:27,100
Because I've dropped my love of David Foster, part of which came from a show called Princes of Malibu, which is a precursor to The Hills.

498
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:33,180
It's his Osborns that is so fascinating and difficult to get through.

499
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:40,080
Times Square Toys R Us, which was seriously considered a really good defunct land video on that.

500
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:52,000
I don't know if I have anything to add beyond what Perjurer has already encapsulated in that video.

501
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,880
Now here are the last two.

502
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:59,520
The Frank trilogy of Kevin Spacey videos, but I was like that's an Eva Wallner episode.

503
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,780
We were discussing, we were like, is it making Frank Marshall a third?

504
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,580
We were like, which Frank is this?

505
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,940
Is it Let Me Be Frank or is it Frank Marshall?

506
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,260
I thought you meant like Congo or Acnophobia.

507
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,480
Oh, we did talk about that.

508
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,380
Are we talking about Frank Marshall's films?

509
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,260
I didn't explain this to you.

510
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,940
I just wrote the Frank trilogy.

511
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,680
It left us.

512
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,760
We had a discussion about it.

513
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,640
You didn't ask me.

514
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,460
No, no, no.

515
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:26,600
So my intent was the three Let Me Be Frank, Kill Them With Kindness and Tucker With Frank.

516
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,900
Have there only been three?

517
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,960
That's what confused me.

518
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,960
He took a year off.

519
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,820
He did.

520
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,440
But wasn't there a third?

521
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,560
Kill Them With Kindness is the park bench one.

522
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,980
Let Me Be Frank is of course the original with him and the apron.

523
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,940
But wasn't there a second?

524
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,240
No, I'm not sure.

525
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,900
I think it is only three.

526
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,640
Because for a while it felt like unresolved.

527
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,160
We're never going to get the third one.

528
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:46,540
Yeah.

529
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,080
Yeah.

530
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,520
And then these last two, Bill Cosby's picture pages, it's a children's show I was obsessed with.

531
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,720
It is obviously very difficult to talk about now.

532
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,140
Yeah.

533
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,520
Yeah.

534
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:04,800
There is a character on it named and I'm going to say this because I don't think there is any way to actually do an episode about this.

535
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,420
I gave it some because I did watch, I looked up this character.

536
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,220
I want to encourage Clifford to watch the video as well.

537
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:15,020
To understand what the appeal is for me and then just go off in your own thoughts.

538
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,980
Talk to your friends about it.

539
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:29,500
There is a character who is introduced on this weird educational Bill Cosby's 70s lesson show where he literally works like through an activity book with a musical pen to teach you how things work.

540
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,420
You'd send away for the stuff.

541
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:31,940
Yes.

542
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,840
Direct address to camera.

543
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,740
You get a workbook and a pen and he's like, connect the dots.

544
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,120
You wear a raincoat when it's raining.

545
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,360
That's the kind of lessons he teaches.

546
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:47,920
There is a character who appears in two sketches who was on this VHS that I got used from Blockbuster when I was a child and watched eight billion times.

547
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:56,380
Who I still think is as influential on my sense of humor and my perception of comedy as anything ever named No Head Norman.

548
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:02,200
And I just wanted to introduce him to the PTR universe as a sort of Marvel McFay.

549
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,940
Is there a way to get the rights to No Head Norman?

550
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,180
Get it away from the Cosby Clutch.

551
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:07,720
Yeah.

552
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:07,880
Yeah.

553
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,180
Sure.

554
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,180
At one point I reframed it and I was like, can it just be a No Head Norman episode?

555
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,900
But it's too difficult to talk around.

556
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,940
He's a startling figure.

557
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:25,740
Visually, when you were describing, I was picturing like, if you've ever seen David Lynch's animations or like a Don Hertzfeld, I thought it was like a stripped down cartoon.

558
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:34,500
Jason, I was running by options to Ben Hosley, producer Ben from Blank Check, and was like, before I send the list to the guys, can I run through some of them for you?

559
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,960
Ben consulted on this?

560
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:36,400
He did.

561
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,740
He was like, which ones do you think have more juice than others?

562
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,920
And he was like, you can't do a Bill Cosby episode.

563
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,960
And I was like, let me just show you No Head Norman.

564
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,380
And a day later, he's like, I actually have been kind of haunted by this.

565
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,300
And he described it as lynchian.

566
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:56,860
I think it is simultaneously very funny and very upsetting in a way that doesn't have to do with the Cosby of it.

567
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,860
He's a very bizarre character with a very bizarre look.

568
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,280
He needs to be revived in some way.

569
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,400
Freed of Cosby.

570
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,080
You also had one on here that scribbled out.

571
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,580
Thank you.

572
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,140
Yeah.

573
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:07,640
Oh, wait, wait.

574
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,000
And right before you get to that, there are four.

575
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,740
I had a feeling there are four spacey videos.

576
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,980
Let me be Frank.

577
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,320
KTWK kill them with kindness.

578
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,240
The bench one is one.

579
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,000
The bench one.

580
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,660
Yeah, the bench one isn't killing with kindness.

581
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,820
It's one hundred Christmas.

582
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,540
Thank you.

583
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,720
And then there was last year.

584
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,980
This year's being Frank, which the less said about the better.

585
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,320
Yes.

586
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,080
No, I think that's kind of the best one.

587
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,800
It's the Tracy Zooms in of the series.

588
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,240
They are.

589
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,180
It's an extremely.

590
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,300
Yeah, there's a lot of crossover between those series, I'd say.

591
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,800
So there is one and we're about to get to the reveal of what this is.

592
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,220
And I think people are going to stand up out of their chairs, applaud, go.

593
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,180
This is the right choice.

594
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,980
What the episode is ultimately landed on.

595
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:55,680
But there was one thing that in the time between when you activated me and said, maybe start coming up with some ideas and submitting the list,

596
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,360
I discovered the existence of a thing I did not know about.

597
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,480
I had not seen.

598
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,440
Otherwise, I was pulling from like, what are things I care about?

599
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:09,460
I have a history with this showed up on my radar because I was doing.

600
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:15,500
I think most people listen to show probably share a sort of trait with the four of us,

601
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:23,200
which is stuff you saw when you were a very specific age that kind of stuck in your craw that you've been weirdly fixated on.

602
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,400
You never forget.

603
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,000
And as an adult, you're like, what was that?

604
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,340
Yeah.

605
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:36,020
And not just let me rewatch this as a grown up, but I want to understand how this came into being and what the cultural response was outside of me just being exposed to it as a child.

606
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:36,340
Yeah.

607
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:36,700
Yeah.

608
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:43,520
So I was digging into let me just get the I want to be able to read this correctly.

609
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,820
It's very exciting to get this unredacted.

610
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,520
And I'm excited.

611
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:52,300
So there was I think it was called the Hanna Barbera Superstar 10, which was in the 80s.

612
00:27:52,300 --> 00:28:08,040
A bunch of animation studios started trying to do competitors to Wonderful World of Disney and basically doing 45 minute animated specials that could be backdoor pilots for new series.

613
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,360
And some of them did spin off into their own things.

614
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,060
And some of them just became weird.

615
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:20,160
But I would see on Cartoon Network, early Cartoon Network before they had original shows like Scooby Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf and the Ghoul School,

616
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:28,320
which were like these are longer than Scooby Doo episodes, but they're not quite the Scooby Doo direct to video movies, but they have kind of contained narratives.

617
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,340
And they were like trying out like what's the new era of Yogi Bear?

618
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:31,880
What's all this?

619
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,700
So I was like digging into all of these.

620
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:44,140
And then on that Wikipedia entry, it mentioned the rival was the ABC Saturday Superstar movie, which was this is not based around one animation house.

621
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:50,740
This is sort of just like a fucking garbage plate of different animation studios creating backdoor pilots.

622
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,160
And some of them were Hanna Barbera ones as well.

623
00:28:53,460 --> 00:29:01,340
But so there's like the Brady Kids on Mysterious Island, the animated continuation of Brady Bunch, where they end up in like a Jules Verne land.

624
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,900
There's Yogi's Ark Lark, which is Yogi Bear flying a big fucking Noah's Ark.

625
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,220
Flying into space.

626
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,100
Nanny and the Professor.

627
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:26,980
Like most of these are like new versions of old sitcoms or like new adaptations of like a retelling of Robin Hood with animals a year before Disney's Animal Robin Hood.

628
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:35,320
A Lassie cartoon, a Gidget revival, the Banana Splits and Hocus Pocus Park, which is very theme park adjacent, I think is actually a very good film.

629
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,420
But things like this, right?

630
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:47,240
Interestingly, one called Daffy Duck and Porky Meet the Groovy Ghoulies, which is the only time Warner Brothers let anyone else animate the Looney Tunes because they didn't give a shit.

631
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:55,900
When the characters were on ice and they let Filmation, the company that did the He-Man cartoon, do a weird third rate Looney Tunes.

632
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,740
But I land on this one.

633
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,320
I go, this is a weird title.

634
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,620
The Man Who Hated Laughter, AKA Popeye the Man Who Hated Laughter.

635
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:11,300
When I just see the man who hated laughter, I go, all these other things seem to be riffing off of something I know.

636
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,540
What is this?

637
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,220
Popeye meets the man who hated laughter.

638
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,500
I'm just going to read what the Wikipedia says.

639
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,280
Okay, for plot.

640
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,460
Professor Morbid Grimsby.

641
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,420
This is how it starts.

642
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:32,000
Is an evil genius who has won the prestigious quote, meanie award six years in a row to guarantee a seventh.

643
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,760
He plots to eliminate all laughter in the world.

644
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,140
To guarantee a seventh.

645
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,800
The stakes of this are a seventh meanie award.

646
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,160
So he's the man who hates laughter.

647
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,060
He's the man who hates laughter.

648
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,060
How is he going to eliminate humor?

649
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,940
I'm just, guys, brace yourself.

650
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,400
Okay.

651
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,260
This special is from 1972.

652
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,620
So is it a Nixon allegory?

653
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,640
He says, I need to eliminate the stars of the funny pages.

654
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:09,580
Man Who Hated Laughter is a King Features Syndicate crossover movie.

655
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:14,540
In which this villain is like, I need to kill all the King Features Syndicate characters.

656
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,300
He is the Thanos of King Features Syndicate.

657
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,720
And he goes, here's the pitch.

658
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,680
His henchman in this is Brutus, aka Bluto from the Popeye.

659
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,600
And he goes, you know Popeye.

660
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,460
Here's what we do.

661
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,900
Hire that fucking idiot Popeye to captain a ship.

662
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:37,220
Convince all the King Features Syndicate characters that they've won a free cruise.

663
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,580
And then we fucking just, we cast them out to sea.

664
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,400
We drown them.

665
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,840
We strand them on an island.

666
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,920
Whatever it is, get rid of them.

667
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:50,900
This is a special that contains the cast of Barney Google and Snuffy Smith, Blondie,

668
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,720
Beetle Bailey, Bringing Up Father, Flash Gordon, Henry, High and Lowis, the Cats and Jammer Kids,

669
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:02,440
Little Iodyne, the Little King, Mandrake the Magician, the Phantom, Popeye, Prince Valiant,

670
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:07,920
it says in parentheses, Cameo, Quincy, Steve Canyon, Tiger, and Tim Tyler's Luck.

671
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,240
I went, well fuck.

672
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,340
I made the discovery of a lifetime.

673
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,400
There's no way this isn't the episode.

674
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,660
Is it on YouTube?

675
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,860
Oh my God, it's there.

676
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,640
We can watch it.

677
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,440
Let me put it on.

678
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,100
Five minutes in, I was like, this is the most interminably boring thing I've ever seen.

679
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:22,740
Okay.

680
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,060
Hang on.

681
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,460
The thing that has Henry and Little Iodyne.

682
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,220
Henry.

683
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,380
Come on, Henry.

684
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,160
With all the stuff we know about Henry, you're telling me that's not interesting?

685
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,180
And Quincy on top of it?

686
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,280
It would be very funny if Mandrake the Magician defeated the Masked Magician.

687
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:47,700
The Russian nesting doll structure of this thing, like a modern Wes Anderson movie, is

688
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:54,020
that all the serious pulp heroes like Mandrake and Flash Gordon and the Phantom are in their

689
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:58,820
serious superhero headquarters watching a broadcast about a crime that's about to happen.

690
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:06,360
Then they watch the man-hated laughter plot to hijack and strand all the funny characters.

691
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,620
Was this dumped on cable at some point?

692
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,840
It must have been.

693
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,980
I have seen this.

694
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,780
I had no memory of this existing.

695
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:17,500
And all the other things in this silo, I definitely watched.

696
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:22,740
Early Cartoon Network Disney Channel, it was like they just would buy these things and

697
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,360
play bullshit at odd hours.

698
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:29,440
I could see that in some, like, there's a Brigsby Bear scenario where somehow it's the

699
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,500
only tape in your house, Jason.

700
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,440
And it answers a lot of questions.

701
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:40,500
Well, this or like the, what is the cartoon where they fly the Spruce Goose?

702
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,000
Is that one of them?

703
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,240
That's, I think, Yogi's lost.

704
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,080
That's the Ark one?

705
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,220
Is that the Ark one?

706
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,200
But they fly the Howard Hughes' plane?

707
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,060
But the joke is it's all animals on it.

708
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,000
So like the Spruce Goose.

709
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,960
It's Noah's Ark mashed up with Howard Hughes?

710
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,880
No, no, no, no, it's here, I found it.

711
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,500
It's a different thing.

712
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,760
Yogi Bear and the magical flight of the Spruce Goose.

713
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,680
Hey, what do you, why is there one about the real Howard Hughes plane?

714
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,560
But they started doing it.

715
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,360
After his death?

716
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,360
Yes, long after his death.

717
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,640
At this point, Hanna Barbera is doing all these mashup shows.

718
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,680
That's the Superstars 10, by the way, is what you're describing.

719
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,820
Like Scooby's Laugh Olympics or like Yogi's Ark Lark where it's like we just mush all

720
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,960
the characters together.

721
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,480
And, you know, you guys are just constantly joking about like King Feature Syndicate.

722
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,100
Yes.

723
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,160
And the lack of any sort of cohesion across the characters they own.

724
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,920
To find out there's been this thing for 50 years has just been out there.

725
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,340
That's all of them put together.

726
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,240
That was their try.

727
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:39,940
That was their try.

728
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,700
Yeah, try.

729
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,020
I'd say it's borderline unwatchable.

730
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,160
We just did an episode where we talked about what if there was great movie ride the movie.

731
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:52,180
I think we are obsessed with these like just like big, as you said, garbage pile mashups

732
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:57,440
and this has been out there for the arbitrary, boring comic name that we picked.

733
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,420
And look, this is, I think, building a bridge to the actual topic we're going to talk about

734
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:02,720
today.

735
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,100
But you realize it was the benefit of like people always talked about how lazy Hanna

736
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,760
Barbera was.

737
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,600
It was all the same, the same art style, the same joke style.

738
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:10,980
Yeah.

739
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,220
These characters are also similar.

740
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,240
When they started mushing these characters together, you were like, yeah, they were all

741
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,460
like, let them all coexist.

742
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,400
Yeah.

743
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,780
You watch this thing and you're like the design languages of the characters do not mash at

744
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,160
all.

745
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,360
Their senses of humor don't mash.

746
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,980
It feels like you're listening to like metal machine music.

747
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:33,520
You're like, there's like, there's a tension.

748
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:37,880
I think part of it being unwatchable is just like, I can't process.

749
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,160
You can't put these characters in the same frame and have them all do their routines

750
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,440
in a way where they're just kind of yelling at each other.

751
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:49,380
This also, the notion that you, if you want to end all laughter in the world, you got

752
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,120
to get rid of Barney Google.

753
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,240
The funniest characters imaginable.

754
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,100
Steve Canyon.

755
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,960
We have to kill the funnies.

756
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,160
Specifically a certain variety of funny.

757
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:06,980
The reason I think I've seen it is I remember like Mandrake and Flash Gordon.

758
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:07,740
Watching it?

759
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:08,600
Yeah.

760
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,620
I remember them all just standing in one frame.

761
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:11,940
Yes.

762
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,600
And as a kid I was excited.

763
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,460
I was like, that's how the characters from the funny pages, but they don't really do

764
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:17,900
anything.

765
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:22,280
The heroic ones never interact with the funny ones and they just cut back to them every

766
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,800
once in a while and they're like, Popeye does seem to have gotten himself into a pickle

767
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,200
here.

768
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,200
And then they cut back into the screen and you see what they're watching.

769
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:29,500
Very limited.

770
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,920
Are they watching TV?

771
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,660
They're like, lots of the watcher.

772
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,420
Are they famous in the, is it like they're coming from the comic strips?

773
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,000
Cause those characters in their worlds aren't necessarily funny.

774
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,760
They're not like standup comedians.

775
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,360
No, it's like.

776
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,520
We're seeing their real lives.

777
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,780
It's a messy logic.

778
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:50,880
I think all these characters are famous because they're in the funnies, but they're not Roger

779
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,700
Rabbit style.

780
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,680
Oh, these are the performers who play the parts in the funnies.

781
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:01,040
It's like the lives, you know, that they have in their own strips are real and canon, but

782
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,120
also they're all known to us by being funny stars.

783
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:09,040
It's very, I mean, you know, Mickey had stuff like this, Bugs Bunny had stuff like this.

784
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,980
None of what we've seen isn't true.

785
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,960
It's just also their movie stars.

786
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:14,340
Yes.

787
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:18,140
And it makes you appreciate cartoon all sorts of the rescue, which does find a way to harmonize

788
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,800
these characters beautifully.

789
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,640
That's true.

790
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,460
They don't, they don't mismatch.

791
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,600
More dynamic.

792
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,140
Yeah.

793
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:24,780
Certainly.

794
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:29,180
I mean, this, this was very limited, like Johnny Quest.

795
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:29,820
Yes.

796
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,340
It's really limited.

797
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:37,360
And then like the, the meanie guy is done in like UPA 60s limited animation style.

798
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:41,780
Like it's, it's, it's got a bad sense, but look, that's an animation project that didn't

799
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,320
work.

800
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,600
Yes.

801
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:44,700
Yes.

802
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,000
Perhaps the wrong pitch, the wrong idea.

803
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,440
It wasn't beat it out properly.

804
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,200
Right.

805
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,040
There was a need to be filled space, but it didn't come from anything organic.

806
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:59,420
They didn't focus up, assemble a room and really say, let's not leave here until we

807
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,520
got gold in our hands.

808
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:01,540
Yes.

809
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:08,060
And with that, Griffin, would you like to weave us through what the actual thing we're

810
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,260
doing?

811
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:12,620
I don't know if you have the first text pulled up, but about four years ago, I say to you

812
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:20,360
I really think you should develop an animated series around your personas to which the response

813
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:25,100
was, I don't think anyone wants to watch a cartoon show about adult men who host a theme

814
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:25,720
park podcast.

815
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,800
I mean, that's not what I'm pitching.

816
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,360
Yeah.

817
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,360
That's not what I'm pitching.

818
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,060
It was activated by a couple things.

819
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,500
Uh, a animal and a Woodsy.

820
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,120
Is that the person who's done a lot of your fan art?

821
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,700
Am I getting the name mixed up?

822
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,280
But I feel like the times where you've done like Jamba reek or a honk, honk has the fright.

823
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:42,720
Yeah.

824
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,140
Oh, yes.

825
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:48,100
And people have done fan art of you guys in the style of the hitchhiking ghosts or the

826
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:48,760
country bears.

827
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,100
Jeremy Allison has done great stuff.

828
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:51,360
Yes.

829
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:57,000
Or even when it's like just a funny thing like Jason's research for it now done as a sort

830
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,180
of a little prep or certainly the like Jason's kitchen follies.

831
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:01,620
Right?

832
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,260
Yes.

833
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:07,120
Every time I see a piece of art like that, I'm just like, you guys fucking translate

834
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,420
so well to cartoons.

835
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:14,720
In every sense, I just listen to the show as a fan first who has become a friend, but

836
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,280
I'm like putting on my like my listener hat.

837
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:17,740
Right?

838
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,100
Yeah.

839
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:24,880
I'm like, you guys have such solid games and you have like distinct personas that mesh

840
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,300
and clash in interesting ways.

841
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,460
There are the overlaps.

842
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,100
There are the sources of tensions.

843
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,620
You have the commonalities and the Frank Marshalls.

844
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:32,920
Right?

845
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:37,880
The commonality that brought us together, but all of the differences that have kept tensions

846
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,680
hopefully interesting to listen to.

847
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,300
When I look at anyone do like a little cartoon fan art of you guys, I'm like, you got three

848
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,340
distinct visual looks.

849
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,860
There's a nice kind of like one of each.

850
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,260
Well, the height wise, you know.

851
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,280
It's chipmunk style.

852
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,880
Whenever I've like met up with you guys in real life, it's and I'm walking, I'm approaching

853
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,760
from a distance.

854
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:02,960
There's something so nice where before I can even make out the details, I'm like, that's

855
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,900
the PTR trio.

856
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,520
Well, this is like one, two, three.

857
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,800
I can see whatever order you're standing in.

858
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,620
And I'm like, this is when people talk about like animation having great silhouettes.

859
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,040
You'd recognize these characters.

860
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:14,600
Yeah.

861
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,140
Silhouettes.

862
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,740
Silhouettes, I'm not sure.

863
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:21,780
But the three of us that you've that you could squint and see us when walking up in the Disneyland

864
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,580
hub or whatever.

865
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:26,180
Now, every time I brought this up and I bring it up intermittently over the last four years,

866
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,840
you're like, what's the pitch?

867
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:32,780
We're not saying no, but I don't feel like you've explained what you think this is.

868
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,040
And I'm like, my my answer is always it could be anything.

869
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,620
I leave that up to you guys, which is why I figured today let's put a structure around

870
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,680
this and actually try to figure it out.

871
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,960
I think we possibly come out of here with a million dollar pitch.

872
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:47,680
Wow.

873
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,120
So this idea.

874
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,060
I've never been asking for EP credit.

875
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:51,680
I've never been.

876
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,260
I'm just like, I want to see this happen.

877
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:54,980
Right.

878
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:55,440
Yeah.

879
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,640
Now, over time, you've been like, explain like, what is this?

880
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,020
And I'm like, you watch all those Hanabra Bear cartoons.

881
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:05,500
Most of them were riffing on the persona of some public figure.

882
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:05,980
Yes.

883
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,300
Where you're like Huckleberry Hound is just like Ben Crosby ripoff.

884
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:09,920
Uh huh.

885
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,160
Yes.

886
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,760
Quite often a ripoff of an existing person.

887
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,520
Flintstones or Honeymooners.

888
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:18,180
Those were all sort of like pop culture figures of the 10 to 20 years prior that they just

889
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:24,060
like sort of mapped another species or time period on top of.

890
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,940
And we're like, it's different because he's a bear now.

891
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,100
Which is, you know what?

892
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,180
This is a guy.

893
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,680
I'm in this world of pitching and helping animated shows.

894
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,920
This is kind of my bread and butter outside of the show.

895
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:42,100
And the something that does come up sometimes is like, can you take the character dynamic

896
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:47,820
and drop it somewhere else and it still makes sense, which is always a thing that fucking

897
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,020
trips me up and fucks me up because I'm like, but I thought of this.

898
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:51,560
I don't know.

899
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,520
But I guess it is true in this classic cartoon sense.

900
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,460
Can you take that?

901
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,000
Can you put this dynamic in the Stone Age?

902
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,040
Can you put it in space?

903
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,820
And I never wanted to like lead the charge because I've been like, Scott, you've you've

904
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,460
existed in this world.

905
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,460
You've sold animated shows before.

906
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,240
Got friends in this world.

907
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,720
Listeners in this world.

908
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:07,980
True.

909
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,060
There are people where it's like.

910
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,740
People have voluntarily done art.

911
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,060
Correct.

912
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,420
Of cartoon style.

913
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,640
I'm like, the proof of concept stuff is out there.

914
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:14,900
Yeah.

915
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,220
And my reel, the cornerstone of my take is like, you got the dynamic.

916
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,580
And that's the thing that most people struggle to find.

917
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,040
You got the character types.

918
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:23,980
You have the dynamics.

919
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,720
You have the basic look.

920
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,680
And yes, like like saying, let's drop the Brady Bunch on mysterious island.

921
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,800
And everyone goes, I got it.

922
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,400
I understand.

923
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,660
You place those characters there.

924
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:36,000
My thing has always been I leave it to you guys.

925
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,180
Are you in the army?

926
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,720
Are you little dogs?

927
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,280
Are you in the future?

928
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,060
I don't care.

929
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:41,500
I don't.

930
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,340
That's not the point.

931
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,800
Just start with you three.

932
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:45,180
Yeah.

933
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:51,800
Everything you've gotten, you've honed through this podcast and put those archetypes onto

934
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,200
something else.

935
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:59,580
Over time, as it's sort of narrowed and I'll like send a link to like this podcast just

936
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,940
sold an animated series and you'll be like, that sounds bad.

937
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,020
We don't want to do that.

938
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,660
You've never outlined what the pitch is.

939
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:05,920
Yeah.

940
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:09,600
You were and you were clear even the first when you brought this up cold in an email

941
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:09,920
lot.

942
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,720
November 2019 is the first time that this came up.

943
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,200
It was just to me at this time.

944
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:18,540
And you did say like, I don't want it to be one of those things where they just take the

945
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,740
audio of a podcast and anime.

946
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,480
The Ricky Gervais show.

947
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:21,800
Yes.

948
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,800
And we're not pitching a podcast, a cartoon show about podcasting.

949
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:26,940
No.

950
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,980
And in my mind, not even pitching a cartoon show about grown men who love theme parks.

951
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:32,780
Wow.

952
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,520
I'm like, that's not the important part.

953
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:34,960
You take theme parks out of it.

954
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,020
Well, we'll see.

955
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,080
This is what's on the table.

956
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:42,540
Now over time, as I've tried to like, what's the cleaner way to get you guys on board with

957
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:42,740
this?

958
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:48,300
I've started to say, what if we really think of this as an untitled Jason Sheridan animation

959
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:48,900
project?

960
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,500
Uh-huh.

961
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:54,340
So this maybe, maybe, but you're just to announce what it is.

962
00:43:54,540 --> 00:44:01,380
A, it is let's come up with what the PTR animated show is and B, within that, if it is Jason

963
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,500
focused, that would not be surprising.

964
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,520
It would probably make a lot of sense.

965
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,400
But it's one of the first things we're putting on the table.

966
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,460
Is it a Jason vehicle that you guys are in the supporting cast of or is it based on

967
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:10,840
the trio?

968
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,420
Are we looking at Yogi Bear?

969
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,000
He's a bad example because he's got Boo Boo.

970
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,640
Are we looking at Huckleberry Hound?

971
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,820
Are we looking at, Hey, it's the Hare Bear Bunch?

972
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:22,520
Is it based on the trifecta or are you guys in the universe?

973
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:26,120
You guys, I mean, look, there have to be Scott and Mike types in it.

974
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:26,660
Sure.

975
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:29,200
But I also, I don't feel a lot of ego about that.

976
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,980
If I can, if I, if I'm supporting, that's fine.

977
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,000
I think, look, we know who the star is.

978
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:34,980
Let's be clear about this.

979
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,500
We're on the same page.

980
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,120
We know that.

981
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,280
And I'm ready to be dazzled.

982
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,020
So part of the pitch now of this as the episode topic.

983
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,340
Now that's established.

984
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:48,320
Is, and Jason, you're allowed to bat the ball back and forth with us.

985
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:48,660
Sure.

986
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:53,920
But to some degree we're treating this like we have been called in to pitch Mr.

987
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,440
T on the

988
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:55,740
Mr.

989
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:56,700
T cartoon show.

990
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,780
We've heard there's desire there.

991
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,560
We've heard Mr.

992
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,060
T is open to this area.

993
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,440
This could be a good like part of the brand portfolio.

994
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:03,840
Right.

995
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:07,880
And it's sort of like, look, you're licensing out your persona and you would do the voice.

996
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:11,900
We want us to see what you're comfortable with in this space, how we build on this.

997
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:12,380
Right.

998
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:16,040
So I think there are a lot of big questions to be asked and I think we just want to work

999
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:16,220
through.

1000
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,500
I think this is a safe space.

1001
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:18,860
No bad ideas.

1002
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:25,360
But some of the things I had thrown out in the past, the most theme park idea I ever

1003
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:33,620
had was based around the trio of you three, you are scared adult security guards at a

1004
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:39,120
small local theme park who try to rein in the unruly teens who cause mischief.

1005
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,820
Who get the job, perhaps, because like us, they want to be.

1006
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,900
We've always thought like, oh, we love theme parks.

1007
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,920
Being at them all the time would be fun.

1008
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:47,300
Right.

1009
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,440
And what if the only jobs available were that?

1010
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:56,780
And in a kind of unruly Six Flags situation, we would be viewed as authority figure.

1011
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,080
We're three generations beyond the starting point of Six Flags.

1012
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:07,520
And it's sort of it's owning more the central comedic premise of the podcast, not the dynamic,

1013
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:12,800
which I think we can very much spin off into its own thing, but of like the contrast between

1014
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,460
you guys being theme park guys and how most people think of theme park people.

1015
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:16,920
Yeah.

1016
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,320
Yeah.

1017
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:17,760
Right.

1018
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:23,080
Like maintaining the neuroses, maintaining the sort of like distrust of a lot of the

1019
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,240
things around it.

1020
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:24,520
Yeah.

1021
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,100
Oh, I see.

1022
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:29,280
It's like you guys are three ranger Smiths, but you're the heroes of the show.

1023
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:36,520
And the comedy comes from like being so overwhelmed by the rides, by the kids, by all of that

1024
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:36,860
sort of.

1025
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:42,840
This is the probably the closest idea that, you know, when you're talking about like pitching

1026
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:47,460
be, well, we have this other successful quote unquote thing that is to do with this.

1027
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,320
So you translated this would be the closest one to that.

1028
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:55,980
Now, would we be considered successful enough for that to transfer?

1029
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:56,840
This is.

1030
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,780
Well, I think you look, we got to throw that out.

1031
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:05,740
I guess we just have to, you know, I feel like there's probably been a lot of podcast

1032
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,160
byproducts that were sold via bakery and burmato.

1033
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,400
Hold on.

1034
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,600
I'm sorry to shock you.

1035
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,820
I think this might, if people just start touting stuff.

1036
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,900
So I think, and this is a safe space, it's club three and they include the listeners

1037
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:20,160
in there.

1038
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:26,860
So we got to come out of this room and this paywall guns a blaze in and say smash hit

1039
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:30,240
podcast genre defining breakout.

1040
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:35,140
But also having the clear angle on like what is the way to translate this?

1041
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:35,540
Right.

1042
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,860
Because there's been a lot of floating ideas.

1043
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:42,920
And I do think there's a question of, is it better to do something that builds off of

1044
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:48,840
what the podcast has proven in a textual level, like setting it into theme park, but not making

1045
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:54,000
you guys theme park podcasters, putting you in a funny position within theme park ecosystem.

1046
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:54,520
Sure.

1047
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:02,400
Or is it like, I would relate it to like Ed Solomon and I forget his partner who he wrote

1048
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,740
the Bill and Ted movies with where Bill and Ted were characters they did in their college

1049
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,620
improv troupe.

1050
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,340
Oh, I didn't know that.

1051
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:12,500
And then started writing sketches for and loved and they would perform them.

1052
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,720
And then at some point they were like, we should write a Bill and Ted movie.

1053
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,120
But they did that not with having a sort of like Pee Wee Herman esque platform of people

1054
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,020
demanding that.

1055
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,360
Right.

1056
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,840
They were just like, we like these characters so much.

1057
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:29,560
What's the funniest movie we could write for them and then we'll cast actual younger actors

1058
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,580
to play them.

1059
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:30,800
Yeah.

1060
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,300
And there's, I think it's a key reason why Bill and Ted works is like these guys have

1061
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:41,340
spent a hundred hours talking to each other as Bill and Ted by the moment they sit down

1062
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:42,080
to write that script.

1063
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,640
They know the character so well.

1064
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,020
Sure.

1065
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,500
And I think similarly we could map you guys into a bunch of different places.

1066
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:51,540
It doesn't need to be sold on someone sitting there and going, well, the numbers of the

1067
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:54,740
podcast Rogan's doing X times as much as you guys.

1068
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,260
You're trying to sell this based on the success of the podcast.

1069
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,480
He's doing 1.

1070
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:58,840
5 times.

1071
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,120
But we're about, yeah, yeah, we're right at least barely.

1072
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,680
We're right at his heels.

1073
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:06,000
I'm not saying it's like it's an albatross around your neck, but you don't know.

1074
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,240
There's, there's perhaps a cleanness to just making it its own thing.

1075
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:14,160
And someone looking at this pitch and going, God, these fucking comedic games are so well

1076
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:14,380
honed.

1077
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,760
These personas are so precise.

1078
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,720
And I feel similarly whenever any Jason lore comes up.

1079
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,160
Yeah.

1080
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,260
Well, the listenership explodes, right?

1081
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:27,420
Right with this sort of like, oh my God, new Jason backstory unlocked.

1082
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:28,700
Yeah, I got to draw it.

1083
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:29,440
I got to dig into it.

1084
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,240
We got to ask questions.

1085
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:30,620
Uh huh.

1086
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,580
Usually calamities.

1087
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:31,840
Yeah.

1088
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,260
What happens in an episode, you could fuck five minutes on the clock.

1089
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,780
We have to move on to the subject at hand, but we need to ask you 10 follow up questions.

1090
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:43,160
Mike, of course, talks about I've never forgotten anything I've ever learned about Jason, which

1091
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,660
I think a lot of people have that relationship to you, Jason.

1092
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,140
Yes.

1093
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:50,620
I think you've found this category of my dear friend, Pat May, who's a friend of mine from

1094
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:51,340
the linear comedy scene.

1095
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,860
I follow into this too, where I'm like, you are incredibly skilled, comedic performers

1096
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:56,600
and actors.

1097
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,880
Anything you intentionally do comedically, I think is incredibly funny.

1098
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:05,160
And also everything else on top of that is incidentally funny.

1099
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:05,900
Oh, thank you.

1100
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,640
It all just builds, right?

1101
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,160
Sure.

1102
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,000
So I'm just like, there's so much there.

1103
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:15,080
And in the same way that you've always been Mike, when you and I have back channel text

1104
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:18,760
conversations about like, what do you think the minimum order quality is if we want to

1105
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,460
make action figures based on our podcast?

1106
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,600
You always say we'd start out with a trial run of Jason.

1107
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,940
Jason's the most toy addict.

1108
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:25,760
Of course.

1109
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,480
You could sell a solo Jason figure.

1110
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:27,840
Toy addict.

1111
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:31,340
That's the word for what a cool toy, like something with make a cool toy.

1112
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,780
He's got the most variations.

1113
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,560
He's got the most like.

1114
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,960
Yeah, because obviously we talked about black and white Jason.

1115
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:37,980
Jason with the mayor sash.

1116
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,260
Little sailor Jason.

1117
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,600
Little sailor Jason.

1118
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:41,040
Yes.

1119
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,320
Jason, Jason cutting a big roast beef.

1120
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,440
There's this kind of thing.

1121
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:50,460
I will like relay things that come up in our hangouts or text thread to Sims, my blank

1122
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,240
check co-host.

1123
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,520
And I'm like, and then Jason said, if he always goes, do the voice.

1124
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,460
And I go, I can't do the voice.

1125
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,520
And he goes, Jason's voice is just so funny.

1126
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,780
It's so much funnier imagining him saying everything.

1127
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,700
I'm like, well, this fucking animation.

1128
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:04,620
Oh, wow.

1129
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,280
So that's been fueling you.

1130
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,580
You've used to sending things to the outside and they say, well.

1131
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:10,200
The silhouettes are there.

1132
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,460
The dynamics are there.

1133
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:12,840
The lore is there.

1134
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:17,160
But also I'm just like, Jason does feel like the character that just fucking is going to

1135
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,100
pop in this medium.

1136
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:22,000
Or even if the thing's a three hander, he's probably going to be the breakout.

1137
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:22,560
You know?

1138
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,280
So we just want to set up.

1139
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,260
We know like this is our ace in the hole.

1140
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:26,580
Yes.

1141
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,580
Which is why we really need to pitch it to you.

1142
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:29,240
Right.

1143
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:30,040
Uh huh.

1144
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:30,340
Yeah.

1145
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,660
I mean, look, this is something I have often on thought.

1146
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:38,320
Now, does it sometimes I've thought of things that I just think it would be fun to see Jason

1147
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:43,840
versus is it a perfect like translation of his personality or what everyone likes about

1148
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:44,160
him?

1149
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,520
I have mentioned, I think on the show that I had, I've had an idea for many years called

1150
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,620
the little Liddle stinker.

1151
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:51,620
Yeah.

1152
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:58,100
And I, in my mind, Jason plays this character Liddle stinker, who is a very much like a

1153
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,760
little rascals type character.

1154
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:00,960
Spilled the D's are we saying?

1155
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,020
L I D D L E.

1156
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:03,220
Yeah.

1157
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,660
But then he also plays, it's a dual role.

1158
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:11,800
He plays wealthy boy, his arch nemesis across the tracks, who is a rich kid, spoiled rich

1159
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,220
kid.

1160
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,240
So there's like, there's these ideas.

1161
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:16,960
There's Jason.

1162
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:17,480
When we.

1163
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:20,160
That's not in that case, you're like, you're not naming the character, Jason.

1164
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,000
You're not saying he's from Philadelphia.

1165
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:26,040
It doesn't have to be like grounded in all the hard details of your life, Jason.

1166
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:26,360
Right.

1167
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:30,000
But we're taking like, what is the comedic juice here that we can apply?

1168
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,160
I see that in both.

1169
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:31,600
Yeah.

1170
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:31,860
Yeah.

1171
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:35,860
And this is, this is, I think, like we don't have to settle on this, but let's talk through

1172
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,220
some of the big questions.

1173
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:37,520
Yeah.

1174
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,820
That at some point we're going to have to land on one side of.

1175
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:40,620
Yeah.

1176
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,200
Do we think the show is better if Jason is an adult or a child?

1177
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:48,000
This has occurred to me and kind of pre brainstorming.

1178
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,180
Posing hands on both sides.

1179
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,100
I don't know.

1180
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:57,860
I mean, I like, I kept coming into things that are like, where you're in the like 12

1181
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,140
to 14 kind of range.

1182
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,100
I don't know.

1183
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:08,860
Or like perennial child or, or is it like, I think there could be kind of a magical beavis

1184
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:11,620
and butt head nature to it where you're not really sure.

1185
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,420
That's my answer is, I don't know.

1186
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:15,980
Well, and yeah, you know what?

1187
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:17,520
Define it as undefined.

1188
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,040
I agree.

1189
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,600
I think that, I think that's a good call.

1190
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,600
Now here's, here's a lateral question.

1191
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,500
Once again, we don't need to settle right here in the spot, but just start noodling

1192
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,060
around this.

1193
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:28,120
Is the Jason character human?

1194
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:35,440
Do we like the idea of transposing him onto some other type of being or do we think we

1195
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:40,740
want this sort of eternal kind of sluggo type?

1196
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:41,620
Yeah.

1197
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,120
Cause animals, obviously their lifespan is different.

1198
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:51,340
So it takes away the mystery of the age, but it's, I'm like, when, when I think about,

1199
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,180
I guess this is more of the three of us.

1200
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,420
I think of the Cadillac cats from Heathcliff.

1201
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:59,700
And once again, I'm not saying this isn't a three-hander.

1202
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:03,420
No, I'm not saying, I'm just saying that this is sort of the universe I'm picturing.

1203
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:09,340
So if Jason's like a fancy cat with a scarf, I like that.

1204
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:10,940
And that's good to me.

1205
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,280
That makes me smile.

1206
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,260
I like that too.

1207
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:14,120
If Jason is riff-raff.

1208
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,340
Jason's got a big smile on his face.

1209
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:16,280
Yeah, I like that too.

1210
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:16,800
Yeah, yeah.

1211
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,100
I think we can see right through to the cat.

1212
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,860
This is what I'm talking about with the fan art stuff where it's like, you guys map onto

1213
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:22,640
Bearswell.

1214
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,620
You map onto these other things.

1215
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:25,620
It always reads.

1216
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:28,200
No, I think Critters is, you know, I'm of two minds.

1217
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:28,380
Critters is great too.

1218
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:38,380
I will say separately, I wrote down Little Stinker as a phrase and I looked it up.

1219
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:44,080
There's never been a really committed to character named Little Stinker is a skunk.

1220
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:44,900
Wild.

1221
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:45,700
Whoa.

1222
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,280
How has this never happened?

1223
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,080
That's an idea.

1224
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,860
That could have been one of the first cartoons ever made.

1225
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,940
So there's a chance to grab that potential.

1226
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,340
But I also don't mean to dictate that you've got to be a skunk.

1227
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,940
It's key that these things are not mutually exclusive, right?

1228
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:06,160
Like we can have this sort of like eternal youth Jason Little Stinker type we're talking about also be an animal.

1229
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,220
But other ones you're like, this is a world where everyone's an animal.

1230
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,720
They just happen to be animals because it's more visually dynamic.

1231
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,300
And it's never really referred to.

1232
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,300
You're not like cracking into the logic.

1233
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:31,740
So Jason could be a little cat who is defined by trying to grab fish skeletons out of trash cans.

1234
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,040
Or it could be a cat who lives in an apartment.

1235
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,960
Much like how he would catch pond eels when he was a child.

1236
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,380
He just said, oh, you never used to catch pond eels when you were a kid.

1237
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,860
And we were just all like, what?

1238
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,700
This is, let's just pin this right here.

1239
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:51,860
I think this is an inarguable cornerstone of whatever the show is.

1240
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:52,640
Pond eels?

1241
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,040
Is pond eels.

1242
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:57,640
Jason casually mentioning things that he thinks are universal experiences.

1243
00:55:58,920 --> 00:55:58,940
Yeah.

1244
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:01,780
That has to be a key running dynamic.

1245
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,260
Like, you all know this thing.

1246
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:08,320
But the way the dynamic works, the full cascade of it is Jason brings up things.

1247
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:09,920
Mike and I both go, what?

1248
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,300
Yes.

1249
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,580
Listeners go, what the hell do you mean?

1250
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,500
Mike and Scott don't know that fucking thing.

1251
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:15,820
Fucking morons.

1252
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,240
I did pond eels every day.

1253
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,300
That is the way.

1254
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,360
That's really the full.

1255
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:24,140
Very niche micro regional thing.

1256
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:24,560
Yeah.

1257
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:34,020
And the sort of thing where like, when I learned about Chicago, like tavern cut style thin crust pizza, I didn't jump down Mike's throat.

1258
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:44,560
Because it's less unusual than like, oh scrap, it's like meat by, it's like a loaf and you cut slices and then you got to crisp it up and fry.

1259
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,160
But some of us like pork roll.

1260
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,180
And everyone's like, what is going on?

1261
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,260
This is right, Jason.

1262
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,400
And some of, I think in our defense, some of the thing is the what isn't necessarily that we don't believe you.

1263
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:55,740
No.

1264
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,500
The what is like, yeah, tavern cut pizza.

1265
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:02,820
Pond eels, the word.

1266
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,780
I think so often it's we're just so like caught off guard by what the specific is.

1267
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,320
And let's see, it's funny when Jason says them.

1268
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:12,860
Like it's that fucking voice that's dying out for full fluid animation.

1269
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:13,200
Yeah.

1270
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:13,420
Sure.

1271
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:19,060
And I think part of it, like there's a way you can play it where it's almost like the Bort joke, right?

1272
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:21,820
Calling out like it's so absurd to put this Bort.

1273
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:25,680
Why would anyone make Bort immediately followed by Bort is the most common name.

1274
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,940
It's going to keep on getting brought up for the rest of the episode.

1275
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:30,620
You guys are proven wrong for calling out the weirdness.

1276
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:31,480
Yeah.

1277
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,520
The joke that comes up, the weirdness is normal.

1278
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:39,540
Well, this is, I feel like I'm thinking of characters who have the like, maybe like Betty White and Golden Girls.

1279
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:43,220
Or like somebody who's got like the old the stories from back where they were from.

1280
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:49,820
And so the full dynamic is that we, Mike and I question it and then we are proven to be fools.

1281
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:50,180
Right.

1282
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,680
For I think a lot of it being like, right, is this hyper regional?

1283
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:58,680
Is this like a weird family tradition you had that you think is universal but wasn't?

1284
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:00,940
Yeah.

1285
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:01,380
Right.

1286
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,340
Some of the dynamics here.

1287
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:07,340
I think a lot of it too is very often like you just saying tavern style pizza.

1288
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:09,920
You very rarely use shorthand.

1289
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,920
You will suddenly use full proper titles for the things you're introducing as if they're commonplace.

1290
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,600
Tavern cut.

1291
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:21,440
I'm just trying to get it in one concise thing.

1292
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:28,840
And my brain does that and goes like, well, this will be the most shortest, most normal way to say it.

1293
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:37,300
There's the, when you talk about the improv rehearsal where everyone brought food and you went to 7-Eleven and got the shack.

1294
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,100
Well, it was like a potluck.

1295
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,420
Three cans for eight people.

1296
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,600
What was the dessert you said you got?

1297
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:46,120
Well, it was, it's nasty to think about now.

1298
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:49,540
It was red velvet Swiss cake roll lobe.

1299
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,420
This is the thing.

1300
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:51,060
That it's six words.

1301
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,160
Both of you disagree.

1302
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:52,420
Yes.

1303
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,700
Both of you show the size.

1304
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:54,300
Yes.

1305
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:55,040
Yeah.

1306
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,060
Jason double.

1307
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:56,560
No way.

1308
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:57,700
Mike is showing.

1309
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:59,180
He was sliceable.

1310
00:58:59,660 --> 00:58:59,980
No.

1311
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:00,580
Don't.

1312
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:03,080
Well, I mean Snickers bar is sliceable.

1313
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:07,320
I just think the six word proper title for the dessert.

1314
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:08,800
That he tracks it all.

1315
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:09,040
Yes.

1316
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,560
You do always have the full phrase.

1317
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,300
This is what, so, so this is, this happened when we were on an improv team together.

1318
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,760
We all bonded very hard.

1319
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,680
It was a certain time in our lives and it meant a lot to us.

1320
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:25,640
And Jason at the time sort of, I think became almost the like figurehead of the team.

1321
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,120
Like we mythologized him for many different reasons.

1322
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,140
He's very funny.

1323
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:35,860
But I think he always had, even when he was 23 years old, had a folksy quality to him.

1324
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:41,920
That would combine with sort of stuff you maybe never heard pond deals or whatever would just be funny.

1325
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:46,600
Obviously he's a funny guy in general, but he also has a very matter of fact kind of way.

1326
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:57,240
This was an idea that was thrown out in the text thread at some point was, is there a cartoon show where the rest of the show, the rest of the world is sort of modern animation style.

1327
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,460
And Jason's character is like a Fleischer studio.

1328
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:02,220
1920s rubber bows.

1329
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,440
Constantly bouncing.

1330
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:04,020
Right.

1331
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,160
Where he is like the kid out of time.

1332
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:06,980
Yeah.

1333
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,840
I was wondering if time needed to play into this.

1334
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,240
And then this was a side pitch.

1335
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:20,000
There was a side pitch that was also, is the show that Jason builds a time machine so that he can go to his favorite time periods that he wishes he had lived through.

1336
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:26,380
And when he goes there, the other people are weirded out by like, I don't understand your reference point of this.

1337
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:28,740
You know more about this time period.

1338
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:31,260
I utilize it more than we do.

1339
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,640
I think there's something too.

1340
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:43,840
I don't want to just like take an Austin Powers premise, but something that I find always fascinating is Jason's strong awareness of the 1920s and the 2020s.

1341
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:44,100
Yes.

1342
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:53,340
That another thing is that you are the only one of the three of us who knows kind of like the current like very online stuff.

1343
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:57,020
The amount of phrases I genuinely learned from listening to this podcast.

1344
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:57,480
Yeah.

1345
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,800
Where I'm like, thank God Jason gave me the tip off.

1346
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,600
And I knew about Rizzed Up three weeks before it became something everyone knew.

1347
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:04,100
Yeah, I know.

1348
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:04,940
I never knew Rizz.

1349
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:10,980
But I think that is something that happens to Austin Powers where he is a man out of time, but then he starts embracing the current things.

1350
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:11,260
Yeah.

1351
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:15,860
So there's something to that, you're right, that he is, the animation style is old.

1352
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:16,260
Yes.

1353
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:25,260
He reflects that, but he's also like, he's a fish out of water in some ways, yes, but also is more in on the 2020s than everybody else around him.

1354
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:37,640
This could be his internal main game in a show that is like about a trio, or this could be the larger framing of the show.

1355
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:46,640
But I also think like you could, there are two ways to look at it of like, is it funny to place Jason in one setting and go like, is it Jason in space?

1356
01:01:47,300 --> 01:02:01,000
What unlocks if you just go the whole show is Jason in space or in the future, or there's certain comedy possibilities versus is it, and I feel like this kind of show doesn't happen as much anymore, but maybe this is an opportunity to bring it back.

1357
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:05,880
You're sort of like every episode the character has a new job.

1358
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:07,020
Oh yeah.

1359
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:07,540
He's in a different profession.

1360
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:08,640
He's wearing a different hat.

1361
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:09,620
He's in a different place.

1362
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:13,480
You don't got to explain it, but suddenly this episode, Jason's in the Old West.

1363
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:17,820
This episode, Jason is working at a restaurant.

1364
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:25,880
Like Mickey Mouse or Bugs Bunny having different like Bugs Bunny's burrow is suddenly in the middle of Yankee Stadium.

1365
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,280
Right, and it could be all three of you.

1366
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:32,420
I mean like Ren and Stimpy would often do that where it's like some episodes have the default of their roommates.

1367
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:35,200
And other episodes, it's like now they're in space.

1368
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,420
Now they're fire dogs.

1369
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:37,180
Now they're this.

1370
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:41,140
And the episodes don't usually start out with like, God, I got to find another job.

1371
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:41,980
Let me open up the class.

1372
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,060
It's just like start out with the character in the fun place.

1373
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:45,560
Yeah.

1374
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:57,720
Start out in the fun place and then you examine the real life trauma that every TV show we need the trauma examination.

1375
01:02:58,460 --> 01:02:58,960
Let's make it clear.

1376
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,600
We're talking hour long dramedy.

1377
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:01,340
Yeah.

1378
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,100
Or half hour comedy.

1379
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:07,440
Well, can I throw it real quick before we commit hard to road?

1380
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,640
I just want to put this out here.

1381
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,440
Felix the catcher today also, which feels very like the matter.

1382
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:12,960
Yeah, it was purposeful.

1383
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,060
Oh, new mythology.

1384
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,020
Because there were many there.

1385
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,560
He's had many different nicknames.

1386
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,900
This is a little nervous when you brought this up.

1387
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:29,700
He should be nervous because I like to identify.

1388
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:30,580
I was explaining.

1389
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:33,360
He's taken things out of his persona in the last few years.

1390
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:38,640
Some of this comes from like one improv practice.

1391
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:39,520
Many improv practices.

1392
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:44,100
We were like putting on put on the spot to come up with nicknames.

1393
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:45,900
But there is that.

1394
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:46,560
There's that.

1395
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,880
There's Jason's use of side piece for many years.

1396
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:57,240
I'm trying to awaken a sleeping beast if you haven't noticed on this show, if everyone hasn't noticed.

1397
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:57,640
What?

1398
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,080
Yeah, I'm curious about this.

1399
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:03,220
Jason used to be a little, let's say blue, more blue.

1400
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,820
Ah, sure.

1401
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,280
Never problematic, never said anything.

1402
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:15,880
But he would use coarser language and there would be subject matter that was a little bit more sometimes sexual or sometimes horny.

1403
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,860
And of course, this is a big cornerstone conversation of is this show for children or adults?

1404
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:20,260
Exactly.

1405
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:21,940
That's what I'm headed with this.

1406
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:27,400
It could sort of be a Ren and Stimpy and that is the vibe of the old fashion.

1407
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:27,600
It could be a tweener.

1408
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,660
It could be straight up fucking adult swim, nasty random shit.

1409
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:33,840
So fucked up.

1410
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,280
Or you could put this on fucking Nick Jr.

1411
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:38,500
Like there's any range here.

1412
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:44,240
So let me just throw three different nicknames he had on the team.

1413
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:46,860
One was PJ Grunts.

1414
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,920
I forgot about PJ Grunts.

1415
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,480
Which is a real strip club, I believe somewhere.

1416
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,000
One of his nicknames we came up with was the corouser.

1417
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:03,580
And then the third is a nickname that Marissa Jason and I when we would do three person improv would use.

1418
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:14,040
And it's just leisure suit Jason, which I may have mentioned on the show before, which of course is the little character leisure suit Larry from the terrible dirty video game that no one likes.

1419
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,800
A very blue click and point CD-ROM game.

1420
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:19,300
Yes.

1421
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:19,860
Yes.

1422
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:20,580
And it was.

1423
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:20,800
Yeah.

1424
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:21,200
I've never.

1425
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:23,020
I've actually just watched a YouTube video of it.

1426
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:23,820
I've never played it.

1427
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:35,300
Now the corouser was funny because 2010, 2011, I was just stepping out of the plate and striking out at every, every dating a romantic.

1428
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:40,080
And I was just like, sounds like a good runner.

1429
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,260
So that's on the table.

1430
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:48,320
Because I think obviously, you know, when you get a little older, you obviously you don't.

1431
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:51,100
Look, I certainly was more blue as well.

1432
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:58,020
We did improv a lot and my sister would come to see the improv shows and she goes, you're like always the one that says something dirty on stage.

1433
01:05:58,060 --> 01:05:59,040
And I'm like, I don't know.

1434
01:05:59,520 --> 01:05:59,920
Yeah.

1435
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:00,840
That was the thing.

1436
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,580
That was the times we lived in.

1437
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:04,700
A very different time.

1438
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,180
In the sleaze era.

1439
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:13,600
OK, well, whatever it is, BJ Grunts needs to say that.

1440
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:16,400
That is another term I've learned about the 2010s.

1441
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:19,120
People call the 2010s the sleaze era?

1442
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:23,720
Like Brooklyn, you know, aesthetic and music, you know.

1443
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:24,500
Yeah, I know what you're saying.

1444
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:25,640
Coming out of that era.

1445
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:26,640
Wait, the 2010s were that?

1446
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:28,160
70s?

1447
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:35,080
We were in the sleaze era when we were doing long form improv.

1448
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:40,080
I just want to let you know it wasn't actually as aggressive.

1449
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:42,420
TV on the radio album.

1450
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:44,920
Oh my God, that group game we just did.

1451
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:46,300
Oh, that was so dirty.

1452
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,540
The sleaziest blackout.

1453
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,960
I got an idea for a new sleazy opening.

1454
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,780
Oh, and that cool Fleet Foxes song.

1455
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:05,440
We're like Scott, you have the most experience in getting an animation show off the ground, writing for animation.

1456
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,540
You're here with the laptop cracked open.

1457
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:08,780
You're diligently taking notes.

1458
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,100
Yeah, I'm trying to shape it.

1459
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,480
I'm like Mike.

1460
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:19,660
I imagine you probably know the name of the guy, the dude who read the Mirage Ninja Turtles comics and was like, I should fucking license this shit like crazy.

1461
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:20,800
Oh, I forget that guys.

1462
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:21,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1463
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:22,960
Let me go to Fred Wolf.

1464
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,240
You're the sort of overseer.

1465
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:25,560
Yeah.

1466
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:32,800
And I think because of your history with Jason, but also your commitment to the archiving of the lore of Jason.

1467
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,840
Oh, you're the keeper of the holocaust.

1468
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:38,100
You're almost like the Pablo Hildago, the Steve Sand Suite.

1469
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,080
The Jason lore.

1470
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:42,800
We were rushing to the same fucking reference point.

1471
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:48,780
By the way, Steve, I've played trading cards, Star Wars trading cards with him on the Star Wars convention show floor one time.

1472
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:50,860
I mean, but like that kind of like.

1473
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:51,360
That's who I am.

1474
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:53,480
Keeper of the lore, keeper of the secrets.

1475
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:54,000
Yes.

1476
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:58,520
You throw a pitch, you go with Jason, do this because no, but you know what he would do that's kind of similar.

1477
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,240
I'm in the Jason story group.

1478
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:03,680
You're the head of the Jason story group.

1479
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:04,060
I know.

1480
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:04,500
What's his name?

1481
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:06,180
Pablo Hildago.

1482
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:07,780
Yeah, I'm that of Jason.

1483
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,340
Maybe we should just explore the notion of what.

1484
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,000
I have a little pad in there too as well.

1485
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:21,000
PJ Grunts, you're correct, seems to be a strip club in Oxnard, California.

1486
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:22,040
They may have changed the title.

1487
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:29,340
I think maybe now it's PJ's entertainment, which implies that they have freed up PJ Grunts to be used elsewhere.

1488
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:36,900
I mean, that's firmly in the adult area, but can we explore PJ Grunts a little bit?

1489
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:38,680
Who can certainly be a carouser?

1490
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:48,160
Yeah, I mean, Fritz the Cat and sort of that era animation also interests me when you're thinking about plugging Jason's persona in.

1491
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,780
Imagining like an R.

1492
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:52,040
Crumb, Ralph Bakshi style Jason.

1493
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:52,880
Exactly.

1494
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:54,560
That's interesting too.

1495
01:08:54,860 --> 01:09:09,940
Can the the 20s, 30s man out of time be running a modern strip club and like the modern Jason have a progressive, non-shaming view?

1496
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,660
That's completely ethical.

1497
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:19,880
Unionized, we're just a few miles away from the only, I believe Unionized strip club in Los Angeles.

1498
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:22,700
Maybe the country, it's in North Hollywood.

1499
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,800
Now see, this is what I like the way he just talked about it right now.

1500
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:28,480
It's funny to imagine within an animated strip club setting.

1501
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:32,180
I think part of it is not just the old timiness, but the genteel quality.

1502
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:33,280
Right?

1503
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:36,160
Even in the the seediest of environments.

1504
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:38,940
There's a class to Jason.

1505
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:44,500
John from the Carousel of Progress is probably the greatest influence on Jason's personality, I would think.

1506
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,500
Just that kind of just like, oh, hello there.

1507
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:50,140
Have you told Jason the joke I made?

1508
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:52,720
I don't know.

1509
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:55,840
This is kind of everybody I think, while down in Florida.

1510
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:05,860
We did Carousel of Progress in maybe the second or third room and I turned to Scott and Mike and I went, is this Jason's inside out?

1511
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:14,660
That all the characters in Carousel of Progress are different facets that added together.

1512
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:20,720
Because then once that was said, then we're watching every scene and like, oh my god, the sun is kind of Jason.

1513
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:22,060
John is kind of Jason.

1514
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:23,560
Orville is kind of Jason.

1515
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:24,900
The dog is kind of Jason.

1516
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:26,040
They're all sort of like…

1517
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:31,720
And similarly this mapping game of like, you get different comedic juice depending on what decade they're in.

1518
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:35,340
You can transpose into different places, but the dynamics are so strong.

1519
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,280
That's what we're talking about.

1520
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,360
It keeps like clomping him from…

1521
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,580
You talk about like the Carouser.

1522
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:47,000
Like some of these things where you're like, maybe this is one episode, maybe this is a thing that comes and goes.

1523
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:52,060
I definitely feel like Cub Reporter has to be some part of it.

1524
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,660
I don't think it needs to be his main occupation.

1525
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,280
I don't think it needs to be a Jason on the Beach show.

1526
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:02,200
But maybe in this Bugs Bunny way where you're like, sometimes some episodes are he's on the case.

1527
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,840
Good way to get him from place to place.

1528
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:07,180
Can I close out PJ Grunts a little bit and say…

1529
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:11,140
Scott's just doing the actual writer's room-y.

1530
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:13,020
Yeah, I guess a good way to get him from place to place.

1531
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,780
Not aggravated, just like realistic.

1532
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:19,620
Oh, my PJ Grunts idea.

1533
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:24,120
I think like why a 20s, 30s person, I don't know if it's time travel,

1534
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:27,940
I don't know if it's fell in a well and came out in the 20s.

1535
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:30,160
Or just a man with a different vibe.

1536
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:31,020
Like it could just be…

1537
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:32,380
Oh, sure.

1538
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:33,920
Just like a Fisherman Man.

1539
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,600
But I was going to say, if PJ Grunts, whether or not it's a literal 20s, 30s person,

1540
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:44,560
something else that you bring up Jason a lot is like, being in show, the business of show and razzle dazzle.

1541
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:50,760
And I think maybe you're drawn to work at a strip club because that's the modern vaudeville.

1542
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,500
It's the only thing that's left.

1543
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:57,800
People come out, they do an act, and then you're the Kermit of the Muppet Show of a strip club.

1544
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:01,920
What if in 2024, Jason is trying to…

1545
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:06,020
he's opened up a new strip club, but it's much more like Footlight Parade.

1546
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,920
He's bringing back the razzle dazzle to that industry.

1547
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,820
He doesn't like that filth across the street.

1548
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:14,760
They take things off.

1549
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:15,780
No, he wants like a taste.

1550
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:18,080
You can see a tasteful amount of leg and that's it.

1551
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:23,920
And if we end up at full bush, then it's been earned.

1552
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,640
Then you've gotten a show before him.

1553
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:26,760
So here's the question.

1554
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:30,840
We can circle back to what makes Jason a man at a time.

1555
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:34,060
Is it a given in this universe or is there some magical buy-in?

1556
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:37,540
And again, as we're pitching it to you, feel free to…

1557
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:49,480
I'm just realizing how much I watched and enjoyed Carousel of Progress as a very young child.

1558
01:12:50,140 --> 01:13:00,220
And went on a trip in the fall of 1991 with my family and my grandparents.

1559
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:11,340
And a number of years ago, as we started working on this, I had heard the master track of Now Is the Best Time of Your Life.

1560
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,260
And I was talking to my dad about that.

1561
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:16,760
He was like, oh yeah, that was the one when your grandparents went down with us.

1562
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,560
They were humming that all week.

1563
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:23,900
And as you're saying, the Carousel of Progress is just different parts of my brain.

1564
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:27,500
I'm like, yes, this is unlocking something.

1565
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:33,360
I always really loved my grandparents and also Nick at Night.

1566
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:41,180
I would usually be more interested in their stories or television than what was going on at school.

1567
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:48,280
I just want to put a pin in the idea that it doesn't have to be like a time travel or fish out of water.

1568
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:53,560
Because just the idea that you just vocalized that you really loved your grandparents and Nick at Night.

1569
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:57,180
And that makes me understand the locking into the old timey.

1570
01:13:57,180 --> 01:14:03,240
So somebody who just as a child wanting to retain something about your grandparents.

1571
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:04,520
It's a very sweet idea.

1572
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:05,140
I'm watching it.

1573
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:08,120
I'm watching with my son fall in love with my parents.

1574
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:15,120
And so that could just be a good rationale, I think, for the out of time nature.

1575
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:21,440
The thing that unlocked the inside out thing was in the various stages of Carousel of Progress.

1576
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:30,080
When John is communicating to his family members in the other rooms and he keeps saying things like, all right, dear, whatever you say.

1577
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:34,920
And we were like, have we heard Jason say this to James 20 times on this trip?

1578
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,380
And not in a reductive way.

1579
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:41,080
There's this very like, well, I just want you to be happy.

1580
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:52,140
Whatever floats your boat, sweetie attitude that is just funny to imagine mapped onto any dynamic or like exchange you have with other people.

1581
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:59,400
Now, I think even just talking about like, does he take over a rundown strip club and turn it into a Ziegfeld Follies type thing?

1582
01:14:59,940 --> 01:15:01,500
The hottest show in town.

1583
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:06,200
Is that the format of the show that allows him to literally change hats every week?

1584
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:14,920
Is like, Jason gets a new job at a new place or enters a new environment and that environment exists in the normal, cynical way we know it today.

1585
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:19,160
Oh, yeah, where it had some spark in the 50s and 60s or whatever.

1586
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:21,280
And now it's just a road, it's whatever.

1587
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:21,580
Right.

1588
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:28,460
And Jason tries to like roll everything back to the old timey kind of classic cartoon version of it.

1589
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:40,720
Where I feel like you talking about loving those Nick at Night shows, a lot of the same like old timey references that I feel like I share with you that are wedged in my brain or because I watch so much fucking Looney Tunes.

1590
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:41,220
Yes.

1591
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:46,360
Where like Bugs Bunny is making offhand references to like the social norms of the 40s.

1592
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:48,560
And I'd say to my mom like, what is this?

1593
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:49,740
What is he?

1594
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:50,380
What?

1595
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:54,640
And they're like, well, men used to want to wear hats in the company of ladies and this and that.

1596
01:15:54,640 --> 01:16:01,520
There's something funny about making you this very classical cartoon type existing in kind of a cynical world.

1597
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
And then you make everything the way it used to be back when it was glitz and glamour.

1598
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:08,200
You know, old time, none of this blogging.

1599
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:09,500
You're an old time cub reporter.

1600
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:10,980
You have the number in your hat.

1601
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:15,060
He saves journalism by bringing back the cub reporter spirit.

1602
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:29,330
And the image of that too, not like the because I was like the other night I got like an eww out of Jane because I was like, wow, isn't Lauren Bacall really beautiful in these clips from Killargo?

1603
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:35,740
I was like, because we were someone someone people posted clips online.

1604
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:38,180
She does this silly little dance at one point.

1605
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:44,520
And and she she was like, oh, yeah, well, you know, the lighting was, you know, really good.

1606
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,680
You different back then in the film.

1607
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:49,220
And and I was like, yeah, and they would spread Vaseline on the camera.

1608
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:50,440
And then I ruined the moment.

1609
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:50,760
Come on.

1610
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:55,240
I go and like and Humphrey Bogart was on his second failed marriage at that point.

1611
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:59,160
And he was a drunk and she's like, oh, I don't want to think about that.

1612
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:07,620
Maybe part of it, maybe the arc of each episode not to make it like two wrote a formula is you like come into a place that's sort of depressed and lost the magic.

1613
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:09,820
You transform it to the old way.

1614
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:13,660
And then at some point you identify, oh, this is why we evolved as a culture.

1615
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:16,840
And you get a point where you're sort of in a middle zone.

1616
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,600
We can't totally swing things back to the fifties.

1617
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:21,380
There are some dark sides of the right.

1618
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:30,480
It's like if Santa do if there was another 30 or 40 minutes on the do where they're like, this might be too expensive to do.

1619
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:32,440
We're not bringing in enough money.

1620
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:34,200
We have to close this after after night.

1621
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:39,520
You identify somehow the key fault of the way they used to do things.

1622
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:40,640
Why did it change?

1623
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:51,060
You know, but you go on a full journey and then you go off to your next job or you go off to the army or whatever it is like the bitten licorice pizza where they open a waterbed warehouse.

1624
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:51,960
They're like, what do you mean?

1625
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,280
There's a gas crisis.

1626
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:53,680
Right.

1627
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,640
What does that have to do with waterbeds?

1628
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:56,300
And you idiot.

1629
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:57,020
Right.

1630
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:02,700
And it's like, well, time to reset status quo for next episode starts with you marching in through a new door.

1631
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:04,660
So is he kind of a he's kind of a Mr.

1632
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:08,840
Smith, I guess, kind of like coming in with a cart full of optimism.

1633
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:09,860
I think so.

1634
01:18:09,860 --> 01:18:22,920
And I think like animation good medium for this, because also, as you're saying, you like visually transform the environment, you know, when you come in, your influence changes the color of shit.

1635
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,060
That's very flattering.

1636
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:25,780
Thank you.

1637
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:26,620
I'm talking about the show.

1638
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:27,260
I'm talking about the show.

1639
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:27,700
Not real.

1640
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:38,120
I know we're devoting an entire episode to saying that you have the star quality that will make all of us rich.

1641
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:43,180
No, but yeah, he comes in, hands out top hats and sparkly canes.

1642
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:48,020
The first improv scene I ever saw him do was with two other people, with Jake Riegel and Tony Charlene.

1643
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:54,300
And the first thing you said, you popped on stage, you picked up, did some space work and you said, oh, you dropped your top hat.

1644
01:18:56,980 --> 01:19:01,620
I mean, first thing, and you were 22, 23 years old.

1645
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:02,720
Yeah, 22.

1646
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,760
Just entering an environment trying to put a little old fashioned class back into the equation, you know?

1647
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:13,240
I, the only plus up, and it's not a plus, tell me if you think it's a plus up.

1648
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:14,080
I don't say it's a plus up.

1649
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:20,380
But the only thing I would say is that Jason goes in, tries to make everything nice and old timey and he just destroys everything.

1650
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:21,720
And then he's on to the next thing.

1651
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:24,980
That would be my only.

1652
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:28,360
Lyle Landley, like a benevolent Lyle Landley type.

1653
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:36,060
I think it's sort of like it works until the moment that the fatal clause acknowledged and then it's like, I've got to get out of Dodge before they catch me.

1654
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:39,860
Yeah, what I think it should be, because look, he's a little bit of a huckster too.

1655
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:44,420
And let's say he's a music man fan and that's influenced him as well.

1656
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:45,960
And he's kind of a little stinker.

1657
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,700
And he's kind of a little stinker.

1658
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:52,740
So I think, yeah, like he it's almost like think of it, what John Taffer does to bars.

1659
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:58,240
He fixes it up for TV and then you check the Yelp reviews a few months later and the place has just gone to shit.

1660
01:19:58,260 --> 01:19:59,060
It's even worse.

1661
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:02,680
He saddled them with some sort of like food that they cannot make consistently.

1662
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,880
It's too, the ingredients are too expensive.

1663
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,020
But it popped on camera.

1664
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:08,960
As far as you knew, a big crowd came on opening nights.

1665
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:11,820
The wood chip smoker gun died after a week.

1666
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:22,300
I mean, that's a cleaner way to frame it.

1667
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:25,280
He's sort of a known expert who's being hired to revive these things.

1668
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:32,560
Or I think is there something a little bit more mythical of him being like a Harold Hill where it's like this mystery man rolls into town.

1669
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,700
And just like just wants to fix.

1670
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:35,380
Excuse me.

1671
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,760
I couldn't help but notice you had a help wanted sign.

1672
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:38,520
Yeah.

1673
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:42,880
I've talked a little about my fondness for the Canadian show, The Littlest Hobo.

1674
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:53,360
A dog comes to town, fixes all of the problems that are currently happening in a little family unit or workplace or whatever, and then keeps on moving on.

1675
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:55,740
I've always wanted to do something in that format.

1676
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:59,940
It could just be like there's no real agenda other than like the kindness of your heart.

1677
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:03,980
You want to like give to give things some razzle dazzle.

1678
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:09,500
And then you keep moving on and don't see the actual fallout of the razzle dazzle.

1679
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,340
The climax of every episode is the whole thing falling apart.

1680
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:16,000
But you're like, well, Mr.

1681
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:20,040
Mike, but doing my way out of town, walking off the girder, smiling.

1682
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:22,220
OK, now I don't want to just rip off Mr.

1683
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,080
Magoo, but Mr.

1684
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:26,100
Magoo has been summoned in relation to you before.

1685
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,700
Why does Mr.

1686
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,600
Magoo show up anywhere that he shows up?

1687
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,080
Is he just kind of like going about his day?

1688
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:38,120
He's always trying to do a thing, but because he can't see, he ends up in the wrong environment, not knowing.

1689
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:41,900
So there's kind of a goofy aspect of just goofy tries stuff.

1690
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:42,640
Is it like Mr.

1691
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:43,980
Magoo just wants to do this?

1692
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:45,340
No, Mr.

1693
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,440
Magoo, it's like, time for a dentist appointment.

1694
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:54,080
And then he like walks onto the freeway and the bit is that he thinks they're like cleaning his teeth.

1695
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:56,040
There wasn't too much to that show, was there?

1696
01:21:56,040 --> 01:22:00,320
It's always just like he's like, here I am to return my library book.

1697
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:05,380
And then he's in like Kosovo in act of warfare and somehow dodges the bullets.

1698
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:06,960
Like that's always the Magoo bit.

1699
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:11,080
Because usually he ends up on the high beams of scaffolding at a construction site.

1700
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:13,200
That's almost every episode is on the high beam.

1701
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,020
I think that was such a boom time back then.

1702
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:19,480
There was so much being built that there were always girders being lifted.

1703
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:27,120
Like his goal in any short is just like do a mundane task or like a routine errand or whatever.

1704
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:30,100
And then he doesn't understand what's happening around him.

1705
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:30,760
He's a Mr.

1706
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:31,500
Bean, but Mr.

1707
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,340
Bean is aware of like all the, you know, whatever, all the toilet paper's flying off the thing.

1708
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:41,240
So he's got to like, Magoo is somebody who'd never like a baby's day out after that.

1709
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:41,700
It is baby's day out.

1710
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,820
Where like, he's a hero who doesn't realize.

1711
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:45,640
I don't think that's, I don't think Jason's that passive of a thing.

1712
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:46,180
No, no, that's what I'm saying.

1713
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:48,780
I think it's closer to goofy because goofy is like trying stuff.

1714
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:49,320
Yeah.

1715
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:49,700
Yeah.

1716
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:49,900
Yeah.

1717
01:22:49,940 --> 01:23:00,280
And you don't have to carry over the like, you don't need the continuity, the growing narrative of, wait, so this is happening after Goofy has failed at five different sports.

1718
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,320
You're like each time it's just like fucking clean slate.

1719
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:06,820
Yeah, we don't need, I think we all agree we do not need continuity.

1720
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:07,420
No.

1721
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:09,420
I think we all probably sort of agree on that.

1722
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:10,060
I think, yeah.

1723
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:12,000
Look, this comes up in real pitches too.

1724
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:15,620
Like now, now everything, now everywhere actually watch shows to reset.

1725
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:17,220
You have to come in and pick these places.

1726
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:18,780
Like, no, no, no, you could start anywhere.

1727
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:19,960
You could start with episode eight.

1728
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:22,200
You could start an episode four, even though nobody does that.

1729
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,180
And where you, this is as little as possible to know.

1730
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:32,200
This might be a classic like two 11 minute segments in a half hour show.

1731
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:33,060
Yeah.

1732
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:35,860
Or even it's resetting within the block.

1733
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:44,480
Which also, you know, if we want Jason to not be saddled with Mike and I, Mike and I can be the friends.

1734
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:46,240
We'll happily take the back spot.

1735
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:50,080
We'll come up with something else to do with our 11.

1736
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:51,940
I'll throw this out, right?

1737
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,040
Though that's interesting.

1738
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:54,580
You're saying you'd be.

1739
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:56,120
You'd be the Cadillac cats.

1740
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,820
You'd be the US acres to the Garfield and Friends.

1741
01:23:58,840 --> 01:23:59,360
That's all good.

1742
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,940
That's a good spot.

1743
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:01,600
That's a good spot.

1744
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:02,160
Let's be clear.

1745
01:24:02,180 --> 01:24:02,860
It's a good spot.

1746
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,360
Well, you know, it's like the 1250 spot.

1747
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,240
You can be a little weirder.

1748
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:07,200
Yeah, that's true.

1749
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:10,020
It's the backup story.

1750
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:17,580
Do you remember on the the Pink Panther cartoon show?

1751
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:20,960
Not that the theatrical shorts, although I guess this was maybe part of it as well.

1752
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:28,480
There's a character named the man who was like a little egg with arms and legs and a fucking push broom mustache.

1753
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:35,580
And he was always just a guy just doing his job before the Pink Panther mucks everything up.

1754
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:38,380
And every episode, it's like now he's painting a house.

1755
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:40,460
Now he's like a surgeon.

1756
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:41,480
Now he's whatever.

1757
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:44,900
You know, it was sort of like the archetype of this guy.

1758
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,580
There is a universe in which Jason is the little hobo character that carries over.

1759
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:56,220
But like there are the archetypes of the Mike and Scott who exist in any place he enters.

1760
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:56,760
I see.

1761
01:24:56,940 --> 01:25:00,680
You know, and perhaps is Jack Benny style sketches.

1762
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:03,900
And they're always Frank Nelson was in every store he ever went into.

1763
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:04,640
Oh, OK.

1764
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,580
And like similar to like sometimes Elmer Fudd was a hunter.

1765
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:11,080
And sometimes Elmer Fudd was like weirdly occupying some other job.

1766
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,000
Yeah, you know, sure.

1767
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,740
Where it's like there's a design language for you guys and your voices.

1768
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:19,160
But every time it's ostensibly a new character.

1769
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:20,040
OK.

1770
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:23,120
But that when you need an authority, you need the authority figure.

1771
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:23,840
Right.

1772
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:24,480
Yeah.

1773
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:24,860
Yeah.

1774
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:27,000
Yeah, I could see that.

1775
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:32,300
Yeah, because like, yeah, one one of us is the boss every time.

1776
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:37,940
One of us is like the owner of the competing establishment across the street.

1777
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:43,060
You could be the coworkers who he has to like rally and, you know, transform.

1778
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:43,580
Yeah.

1779
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:44,440
Yeah.

1780
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:44,480
Yeah.

1781
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:48,940
You could think of you could it could be even a set voice cast that is always just recast.

1782
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:49,180
Right.

1783
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:50,200
With different roles.

1784
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:54,200
At this point, we're talking about the Commedia dell'arte archetypes, you know.

1785
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:54,760
Yes.

1786
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:55,740
Of course.

1787
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:57,160
Thank God you said it finally.

1788
01:25:57,580 --> 01:25:57,640
Yes.

1789
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:03,820
Because I do think the three way dynamics have to be in there to some extent.

1790
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:07,100
I'm not even saying it needs to be explicitly like every episode,

1791
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:11,180
there is a guy who gets too many notifications on his phone and is checking for deals.

1792
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:11,580
Yeah.

1793
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:13,900
But some of that energy needs to be in there.

1794
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:14,540
Yeah.

1795
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,460
Can I throw out and we can circle back to what we've been talking about.

1796
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:24,580
But I in my my little stinker notion, I was thinking about and I took myself out of this.

1797
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:27,980
I think there is some like the critter idea.

1798
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:28,460
Yeah.

1799
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:31,200
And that could be the both of you.

1800
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:34,340
If little stinker is a skunk, if it is just a skunk.

1801
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:35,080
And I'm not sure.

1802
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:37,580
I don't know if you're I don't know what critter you see yourself as.

1803
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:40,720
A raccoon or something that's like that's burrowing through.

1804
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:48,980
What I'm getting at is some situation because like I think you guys the way to get you two together is that you do often share a common goal,

1805
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:52,540
which is which is the getting of treats.

1806
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:52,940
Yeah.

1807
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:54,980
But you go about it in different ways.

1808
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:56,600
You deal with it in different ways.

1809
01:26:56,860 --> 01:26:59,720
Mike's way involves more neuroses, involves.

1810
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:03,800
People are going to see that I waste the boba at the everyone will be looking at me.

1811
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:06,520
Jason is kind of is pretty direct and simple.

1812
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:08,580
It's just like I wanted it and I got it.

1813
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:08,880
Yes.

1814
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:12,720
Straight to the windowsill where the by school.

1815
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:19,100
It's kind of like wait, what is the characters where I mean, oh, well, this is Roger Rabbit and Baby Herman.

1816
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:19,480
Oh, sure.

1817
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:27,100
Where Roger all the stress happens to Roger and Baby Herman is unaware that there was any stress in the attaining.

1818
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:27,520
Right.

1819
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:31,200
I think if we're viewing this as a three person, the angle you're talking about,

1820
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:35,000
are you the Roger and are they two different types of Baby Herman?

1821
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:39,120
Well, that's yes, that's the dynamic of it's three of us.

1822
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:39,340
Right.

1823
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:44,500
Because that is what I settled into being the dynamic of the show, which I never thought would be the dynamic of the show.

1824
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:44,880
Yes.

1825
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:48,700
Is that it feels like Scott Scott is the one who's just like, what are these two up to?

1826
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:55,600
But the beauty of the dynamic is you have much like any good pitch, you have to compare it to a lot of successful shows of the past.

1827
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:05,420
Did you think about the story pitch for Raiders before you started the episode today, the famous story where Lucas and Spielberg and Kazdin are sitting down and brainstorming what Indiana Jones would be?

1828
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:11,780
Yes, that comes out of Spielberg being like, I want to make an Indiana Jones movie so badly and they won't hire me.

1829
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:16,740
And Lucas being like, here's a lateral thing in the same way that he wants to make Flash Gordon.

1830
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:17,040
Indiana Jones.

1831
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:17,320
Yeah.

1832
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:18,860
Oh, wait.

1833
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:19,640
That's what I'm saying.

1834
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:23,720
Indiana Jones comes out of Spielberg wants to make James Bond.

1835
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:25,460
Oh, you said Indiana Jones.

1836
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:25,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

1837
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:26,440
I said it twice.

1838
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:29,840
Spielberg wanted to make James Bond and they kept rejecting him.

1839
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:30,120
Right.

1840
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:39,800
And then Lucas was like, here's like an idea for a character I have that also allows him to like globetrot, go on adventures, meet different beautiful women.

1841
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:40,480
Yeah.

1842
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,480
But it doesn't just feel like a ripoff.

1843
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:42,840
Right.

1844
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:45,520
You're taking some of the elements you love of it.

1845
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,120
Right.

1846
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:55,920
And I do think there's something to the other kind of dynamic I was going to relate it to the sort of like, well, Scott, just the humorless like school marm in that situation.

1847
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:56,960
No, he's not.

1848
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:58,220
Because you're you're right.

1849
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:00,180
It is surprising that's become the dynamic.

1850
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:08,420
But the key magic to the dynamic is it's sort of the the arrested development thing where you're like, Michael's like, I'm the straight man.

1851
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:09,460
All these people are crazy.

1852
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:11,180
He's as crazy as everyone else.

1853
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:11,620
Sure.

1854
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:14,220
You know, you're as silly in your own way.

1855
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:14,740
Yes.

1856
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:15,160
Yeah.

1857
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:15,340
Yeah.

1858
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:18,840
You fall into this default of being like, boys, can we please keep things on?

1859
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:24,900
Jason and I just happened to have the Marvel superheroes.

1860
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:26,240
We have deals.

1861
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:30,520
There are these funny things that you don't have any context or appreciation for.

1862
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:34,660
So obviously, clearly there's once I get into it, there is the densest language.

1863
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:41,540
We've not only ever been in a talk about CVS and target deals, there's been possibly hours of talk about.

1864
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:41,960
Yes.

1865
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:43,700
And all off stuff you've never even heard.

1866
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,600
It's just between Jason and I on text or something.

1867
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:46,100
That's a lot.

1868
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:47,160
And that's my role.

1869
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:49,880
I do try to like I try to be kind of like a referee.

1870
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:55,740
I feel like I try to throw a flag on the field for anyone who's listening and goes, wait a minute, you're just going to say that word and keep moving.

1871
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:59,160
You're just, you know, like whatever Circle Star Special.

1872
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:00,660
And I'm like, wait, wait a minute.

1873
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:01,740
Back up.

1874
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,920
What is Super Circle Star Special?

1875
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:06,800
And then and then it's explained as if obviously.

1876
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:07,300
Yeah.

1877
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:07,760
Yeah.

1878
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:07,980
Yeah.

1879
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:08,220
Yeah.

1880
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:14,580
Some of it's probably just natural shorthand of working together for so long.

1881
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:17,920
I'm just like, Mike probably knows about the city target experiment.

1882
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,540
Also, we were sometimes.

1883
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:20,200
Yes.

1884
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:24,800
Going back to the city target is a defunct term, by the way.

1885
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:29,760
Jason and I actually were using it past when the Target Corporation has actually decided they don't want to use it.

1886
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:30,680
I figured that out.

1887
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:34,360
That was the one that happened where I said, what the hell is city target?

1888
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:38,040
People said commenters said, like, use context clues.

1889
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:39,100
It's a target in the city.

1890
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:40,620
I'm like, I fucking know that.

1891
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:41,480
I'm not an idiot.

1892
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:45,100
What I'm saying is, why are you saying city targets so much?

1893
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:46,760
I've never seen one of those in my life.

1894
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:50,760
And then I look it up and city target has been retired for eight years.

1895
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:52,600
But I'm the crazy one.

1896
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:53,480
Well, it's been retired.

1897
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:54,300
This is what I think.

1898
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:56,680
This is what I have to be with.

1899
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:58,180
Griffin, I got to be here.

1900
01:30:58,460 --> 01:30:59,340
Not like here.

1901
01:31:00,180 --> 01:31:00,180
Exactly.

1902
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:00,460
Yeah.

1903
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:00,680
Yeah.

1904
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:01,600
That's what animation.

1905
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:03,740
Let's all let's amp it up a little bit.

1906
01:31:03,740 --> 01:31:04,260
Wait a minute.

1907
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:05,460
Yeah, I got to be up there.

1908
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:06,320
I got to back up from the mic.

1909
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:12,240
This was purchased using a 20 percent off CVS coupon, which is what I've been getting lately and not the three or four or five dollars.

1910
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:15,700
So wait, wait, wait, wait, but your pad of paper in your pen.

1911
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:19,760
So what 20 percent off that is what I'd have to check.

1912
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:25,720
It was total because first of all, I bought one of these pens that is four different ink colors because I was obsessed with them when I was a kid.

1913
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:28,080
I haven't had one of these in a while.

1914
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:32,740
So I treated myself red, blue, green and black all in the same pen.

1915
01:31:33,140 --> 01:31:34,960
All of this was like five twenty.

1916
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:36,400
And I think it's because mostly because of the pen.

1917
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:37,760
I believe the pad was a dollar fifty.

1918
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,300
So 20 percent off got you.

1919
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:40,580
So I was like a dollar.

1920
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:41,700
It was a dollar or so.

1921
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:44,580
We've been focusing on Jason because there's a lot of momentum there.

1922
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:45,100
Right.

1923
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:46,760
There's a lot of shit.

1924
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:47,280
Look, we could.

1925
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,500
But there's a silent killer in the room.

1926
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:56,900
Well, I'm just saying once you reintroduce one of you guys back into the equation relative to Jason, you start unlocking these other things.

1927
01:31:56,940 --> 01:31:58,100
There are other parts of it.

1928
01:31:58,100 --> 01:31:59,980
And the side channels of the triangle.

1929
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:03,540
Like, I don't think it's always you being exasperated, the two of them.

1930
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:06,780
No, because there's also Scott and I also not knowing that Jason's talking about.

1931
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:07,120
Right.

1932
01:32:07,260 --> 01:32:11,120
And you guys connecting on music, you know, or disagreeing on it.

1933
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:13,040
Like, there's like all the angles of it.

1934
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:13,640
It is nuanced.

1935
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:20,540
And even just Mike so excitedly being like, I want to explain everything about this pen to you and the victory of getting this pen.

1936
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,800
I'm like, if this isn't on the show.

1937
01:32:23,860 --> 01:32:26,320
Some people bring out the best in other people.

1938
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:28,080
I bring out the eccentricity.

1939
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:30,860
You're the muse.

1940
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:33,900
You're like, I embrace those weird little thoughts.

1941
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:35,940
You are like, this is my muse.

1942
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:44,040
And that's I would say that that tone I just illustrated not here, but up here is only I think that's new to the show.

1943
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:46,920
Are you telling me this outside of the show?

1944
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:47,720
Yes.

1945
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:49,960
I don't do it as a parent.

1946
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:51,760
Don't do that to your child.

1947
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:53,220
They will get scared.

1948
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:56,200
So I'm supposed to just believe.

1949
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:58,000
Hang on a minute here.

1950
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:04,960
I mean, I think we're starting to analyze like some of the values of making sure there is a trifecta going on here.

1951
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:05,380
Sure.

1952
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:12,280
Can I can I throw out this is what I this this some of the trifecta might play into this.

1953
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:18,700
And I don't you know, I think we're throwing out that we're not gravitating towards the theme parks are a part of it.

1954
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:25,360
But I do flash to like City Walk hijinks and hijinks in the efforts to get treats and stuff.

1955
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:29,880
So if that's why I was going to like all agree like unquestionable cornerstone.

1956
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:30,400
Yeah.

1957
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:31,120
Of the project.

1958
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:31,840
No, no question.

1959
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:33,140
Three candy makers.

1960
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,800
Could be all the running of a candy factory.

1961
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:38,180
Oh, yeah.

1962
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:39,000
Well, put a pin in that.

1963
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:42,620
But that's why I was flashing to like it could be a City Walk type environment.

1964
01:33:42,620 --> 01:33:47,720
And it could just be like it could be like a Burbank Empire Center to be the kind of place that's in every town.

1965
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,920
Just like a big shopping center like we're fascinated by.

1966
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,900
Imagine like it's it's yogi and boo boo.

1967
01:33:56,180 --> 01:34:02,880
But in more of a of a mall environment or just somewhere where there are a lot of treats to be acquired.

1968
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:07,860
And the two of you have your different ways of going about it.

1969
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:15,500
I feel like Mike's is maybe more like Jason is like one one track mind.

1970
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:17,700
I want that big lolly.

1971
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:23,480
I'm getting that big lolly and you'll do whatever it may be like a certain degree of like Scooby Doo when he smells it.

1972
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:25,160
He floats in the air towards.

1973
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:26,340
Oh, yeah.

1974
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:26,360
Yeah.

1975
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:29,080
This is a greater than any of us can understand.

1976
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:30,740
I don't want to reinvent the wheel here.

1977
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:31,980
Let's just do that.

1978
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:33,460
I think that can happen.

1979
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:34,080
We can take that.

1980
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:37,100
I think the thing is, hey, look, Canna Barbera took everything they ever did.

1981
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:40,320
We are goddamn taking the smell of treats.

1982
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:44,640
Being its own means of transportation.

1983
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:45,360
Yes.

1984
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:45,780
Yeah.

1985
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:45,880
Yeah.

1986
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:47,240
It's been a long time.

1987
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:48,920
Let's do it again.

1988
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:53,260
But that's where like, you know, I think Jason will steal.

1989
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:53,900
He'll pilfer.

1990
01:34:53,940 --> 01:34:55,840
He'll go through the dumpster.

1991
01:34:55,840 --> 01:35:06,680
He'll I have one in my head of like that he would like pose as like a pose as a cuter kind of animal or like like transform into a cat real quick.

1992
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:07,220
Meow.

1993
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:11,480
So you could go home and like charm a lady who's probably got tons of treats.

1994
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:13,540
But then she's like, too.

1995
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:15,540
There's too many cats back there.

1996
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:19,300
Are they're all like trying to have sex with you and you're like, I can't do it.

1997
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:24,220
You get into high jinxed via you would do whatever it takes to procure treats.

1998
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:27,180
Mike wants to do it on the up and up the right way.

1999
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:29,960
It's imagine like that you are a raccoon.

2000
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:31,240
He loves the structure.

2001
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:31,880
Yes.

2002
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:32,200
Yeah.

2003
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:33,300
He loves the process.

2004
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:42,780
He's a raccoon who still downloads the app to get deals so that like I can rest at ease knowing I didn't pay full price for the two giant boxes of good and plenty.

2005
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,580
But that I but I did get a good deal on it.

2006
01:35:45,580 --> 01:35:48,800
I have two things that are going to be waiting for me when I get home that are both.

2007
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,320
I got a bike for one hundred dollars from ideal vibes.

2008
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:56,460
I think usually two eighty four hundred dollars bike for one hundred dollars.

2009
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:58,100
I'll bike or yours.

2010
01:35:58,460 --> 01:35:59,260
It's going to be mine.

2011
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:01,700
I hope you got a bike that costs a lot of dollars.

2012
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,320
I hope it's good.

2013
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:05,500
I feel like a bike that costs a lot.

2014
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:06,420
I don't know.

2015
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:07,120
I did it quickly.

2016
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:08,300
I got a deal.

2017
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:10,000
I think you want to pay a little more.

2018
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,880
I got to get rid of this dead weight.

2019
01:36:12,180 --> 01:36:12,940
Number two.

2020
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:13,260
Yeah.

2021
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:17,980
Super seven had a glitch on their turtle wave, whatever eight or something, whatever the wave that a wing nut in it.

2022
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:23,180
And there was a glitch and you got like 30 or 40 percent off who preordered it like a year and a half ago on their site.

2023
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:24,060
And I did.

2024
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:25,320
It's coming today.

2025
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:26,440
They're discounted.

2026
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:27,220
I'm so excited.

2027
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:28,620
I have to pay full price for them.

2028
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:29,080
This is right.

2029
01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:29,820
You want to create.

2030
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:31,540
This is interesting now.

2031
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:34,720
This this new sort of like area of thought you've gotten into.

2032
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:35,700
That's the microphone we want.

2033
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:36,440
Let's be clear.

2034
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:43,020
I spent about four days going back and forth beating myself up of like, all right, I'm going to do it.

2035
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:44,700
I'm going to buy AirPods.

2036
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:49,380
And I was torturing myself like this is an indulgence.

2037
01:36:49,540 --> 01:36:50,700
This is how I operate.

2038
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:55,840
As much as I follow the same deal sites and my feed me will feed the beast.

2039
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:58,700
An element is that I go back and forth way too much.

2040
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:00,520
I don't jump in the way that Mike does.

2041
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:00,740
Yeah.

2042
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:02,140
I spend money too easily.

2043
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:03,560
And Jason is very cheap.

2044
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:05,300
I'm maybe right in the middle.

2045
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:06,400
Jason's tight.

2046
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:18,980
And then after a month, a few weeks of like having lost the left AirPod and never finding it, I was like, I'm giving up buying a replacement.

2047
01:37:19,620 --> 01:37:20,560
Here's the thing.

2048
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:21,540
Which sucks.

2049
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:23,120
Which is an eighty dollars.

2050
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:24,700
You will never get back.

2051
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:25,260
No, you're fucked.

2052
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:27,460
But I'll probably find the original one.

2053
01:37:27,780 --> 01:37:28,440
The second you bought it.

2054
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:30,540
I guess that's a lot.

2055
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:32,400
Well, it's like one you're saying.

2056
01:37:32,620 --> 01:37:33,320
Yeah, for one.

2057
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:34,000
OK, yeah.

2058
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:38,700
So it's like 60 something plus tax and shipping.

2059
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:45,000
Oh, when they told you and I went with you to the Apple store and they told you you had to get a new iPhone and you had to pay full price.

2060
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,080
I never saw a more stressed out man.

2061
01:37:47,140 --> 01:37:48,340
I've said it on the show before.

2062
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,600
You cracked your neck and away.

2063
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:51,660
I did get it down.

2064
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:52,760
What do you mean?

2065
01:37:53,540 --> 01:38:00,320
It ended up being like three hundred because they just gave me a replacement for the older model.

2066
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,520
You didn't like barter with them.

2067
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:02,240
No, I did.

2068
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:05,540
But I didn't have to buy like the newest one.

2069
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:06,240
Yes, yes, yes.

2070
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:10,440
OK, so here's here's what what's now like sort of sparking for me.

2071
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:11,100
OK, go ahead.

2072
01:38:11,620 --> 01:38:16,500
Because we're getting something here, which is key to the dynamic and the energy of the show, which does not have to be theme parks.

2073
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:27,760
But it's the subsession with like this weird love hate with like crash, crash commercialism products, places, experiences, systems.

2074
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:28,400
Right.

2075
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:28,880
Yes.

2076
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:29,660
Love theme park.

2077
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:30,060
Hate it.

2078
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:31,680
Hate on the biggest level.

2079
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,680
Fuck these executives and their bad.

2080
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:35,600
Like, oh, but the things that they make.

2081
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:36,280
Yeah.

2082
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:38,040
Is there something to like?

2083
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:40,340
And I don't know if it's three stray cats.

2084
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:43,840
I don't know if it's three different types of woodland stray cats.

2085
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:46,140
I'm out.

2086
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:47,280
I'm storming.

2087
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:48,640
I'm out of this fucking meeting.

2088
01:38:48,700 --> 01:38:50,140
Which of us is Slim Jim Phantom?

2089
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:52,620
I don't know if it's three squirrel nut zippers.

2090
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:53,700
OK, all right.

2091
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:54,140
I'm listening.

2092
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:56,200
Is it a raccoon?

2093
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:56,920
I don't know.

2094
01:38:57,260 --> 01:38:57,820
Three real big.

2095
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,580
Yes, real animation.

2096
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:00,600
We want it to be animals.

2097
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:05,360
It's like maybe it's a raccoon and a skunk and a fucking turtle or whatever.

2098
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:05,880
Right.

2099
01:39:06,020 --> 01:39:12,200
But it's like their woodland area has now been bulldozed by a sort of Glendale Galleria.

2100
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:12,640
Yeah.

2101
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:15,640
Open sort of city walkable mall kind of concept.

2102
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:16,040
Yes.

2103
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:20,800
And rather than being furious that their lands destroy, you're like fascinated by it.

2104
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:24,480
And you have a little bit of the Yogi Bear dynamic where he's like, this is my park.

2105
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:28,180
They've turned it into like a natural, you know, reserve.

2106
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:28,640
Yeah.

2107
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:31,760
All these humans come with their picnic baskets and I want the fucking picnic baskets.

2108
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:35,920
Are you like outside the perimeter during working hours?

2109
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,680
You wait for them to close and then you're like, now we get to check out the new chocolate factory.

2110
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:46,640
Or I would I mean, my only fix for that would be that we have varying degrees of I think Mike would be let's wait.

2111
01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:49,420
Let's wait until eight o'clock and then there'll be nobody there and nobody will look at us.

2112
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:53,480
But the other we have Jason's like, anytime, let's go now.

2113
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:54,160
Now would be good.

2114
01:39:54,180 --> 01:39:59,480
Part of it is maybe like you're sort of owning the turnover at malls like this.

2115
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:02,480
So every episode can be like a new thing just opened.

2116
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:03,760
We haven't gone to this yet.

2117
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:04,340
Sure.

2118
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:06,120
You want to experience all these things.

2119
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:10,900
Now talking about like Alvin the Chipmunks invoked earlier.

2120
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:11,660
Yes.

2121
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:17,580
I think that's a key line of like whatever part of you is like, well, hey, now, wait a second.

2122
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:24,700
You want it to be Simon and not Dave Seville.

2123
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:26,500
Do you know what I'm saying?

2124
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:30,020
Like within it's not you're trying to get me to be in the triad.

2125
01:40:30,220 --> 01:40:31,220
No, no, absolutely.

2126
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:31,720
Yeah.

2127
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:32,140
Yeah.

2128
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:33,800
Because I was in my version of this.

2129
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:35,140
I don't know if I'm a Ranger Smith.

2130
01:40:35,140 --> 01:40:36,340
I'm willing to be a Ranger Smith.

2131
01:40:36,540 --> 01:40:37,660
That's what serves the story.

2132
01:40:37,780 --> 01:40:39,600
You're trying to get me into the into the group.

2133
01:40:39,620 --> 01:40:42,300
Simon is the checks and balances within the group.

2134
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:44,700
But he's not like we shouldn't do this.

2135
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:46,220
Oh, yeah, you're right.

2136
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,060
I am on board with everything.

2137
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:50,780
I just want to make sure that we're doing things right.

2138
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:52,540
We've explained things to the listener.

2139
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:53,780
Wait a second.

2140
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,660
Yeah, yeah, because it is like, wait a minute.

2141
01:40:55,740 --> 01:40:57,680
Let's just discuss it before it happens.

2142
01:40:57,860 --> 01:41:00,840
Alvin and Theodore have similar games, but distinct personalities.

2143
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:05,520
But they're usually unified and Simon's like adjusting his glasses and going like, well, wait a second.

2144
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:06,080
Sure.

2145
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:10,760
Are you saying versus Dave Seville coming in and being like Alvin busting the fun?

2146
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:12,180
I'm not against the whole thing.

2147
01:41:12,180 --> 01:41:12,560
You're not.

2148
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:13,200
Uh huh.

2149
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:20,120
And this is not where the juice is that sometimes it's like the part you agree with is the surprising part.

2150
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:23,480
What's the difference then between Alvin and Theodore?

2151
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:28,220
Alvin is like the gung-ho like leader fearless.

2152
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:28,920
Right.

2153
01:41:29,260 --> 01:41:31,820
And Theodore is like he'll get his head stuck somewhere.

2154
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,620
Theodore is kind of like the innocent.

2155
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:34,680
Yeah.

2156
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:36,340
Alvin's like a schemer.

2157
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:36,880
Yeah.

2158
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:39,520
And Theodore's maybe like, I don't know.

2159
01:41:39,660 --> 01:41:41,980
What's the id ego super ego breakdown?

2160
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:42,400
Yeah.

2161
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,620
I don't think we can go along these lines exactly.

2162
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:46,240
It's one to one.

2163
01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:49,720
I like Jason is innocent plus schemer.

2164
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:50,040
Yes.

2165
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:54,740
And I like and I like Mike Mike for cartoon purposes, I think has to be a worry ward.

2166
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:55,920
Yeah, sure.

2167
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:57,080
I agree with that.

2168
01:41:57,260 --> 01:42:02,200
You're I mean, you're in on the schemes too, because you're all just trying to get in to Pinkberry.

2169
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:04,980
You know, whatever it is.

2170
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:14,500
What about like a Tokyo Dome City scenario where Tokyo Dome City is outside mall, but there are some rides as well.

2171
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:14,800
Yeah.

2172
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:19,800
And there are chain restaurants like to me, that's the perfect like version of all of our.

2173
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:21,480
Fascinated by the human world.

2174
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:21,920
Yeah.

2175
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:22,100
Yeah.

2176
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:27,540
And that kind of way and needing to find a way to get access to these things without getting shooed out of the store.

2177
01:42:27,540 --> 01:42:28,040
Yeah.

2178
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:38,680
Does it run into interacting with humans like is the idea is it just going to be the three of us on it like Toy Story style adventures where we sort of have to be together?

2179
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:39,340
Yeah.

2180
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:40,640
Or yeah.

2181
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:41,600
So that's what you're thinking.

2182
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:55,180
It's more like closed a little bit because there's like the funny part of like, as you said, like if Mike is a raccoon and the raccoon is really concerned with making sure he gets points for all of his purchases.

2183
01:42:56,700 --> 01:42:57,180
Yes.

2184
01:42:57,680 --> 01:42:57,920
Hold on.

2185
01:42:57,960 --> 01:42:58,880
Let me load up the app.

2186
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,280
The apps a little glitchy.

2187
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:02,480
I need to scan my barcode.

2188
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:02,960
Yeah.

2189
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:03,700
Yeah.

2190
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:04,260
Yeah.

2191
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:08,860
The app Wendy's app was not working last night when I was driving through.

2192
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:10,900
But don't worry.

2193
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:15,340
I added the deals to the QR code and had them scan it and it still worked.

2194
01:43:15,620 --> 01:43:16,000
This is a key.

2195
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:16,620
I could have mobile order.

2196
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:18,300
I'm going to pin this as a key dynamic point.

2197
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:18,680
Yeah.

2198
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:22,080
Mike explaining the thing and then preemptively saying, but don't worry.

2199
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:24,400
I still got the deal.

2200
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:25,500
I didn't lose.

2201
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:26,540
I got it.

2202
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:28,280
Jason also knows Jason.

2203
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:35,800
The skunk also knows about the app stuff, but I'm the one who would then go, can we just focus on getting the Wendy's?

2204
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:36,080
Yes.

2205
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:36,640
You're right.

2206
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:36,820
Right.

2207
01:43:37,140 --> 01:43:37,140
Right.

2208
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:48,000
I was really like losing my mind the other night trying to get Taco Bell app to work because we were like a few miles away and it's like a get to the Apple pay part and it just times out.

2209
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:48,480
But you're right.

2210
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:49,120
Key distinction.

2211
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:50,280
You want the Wendy's.

2212
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:51,120
Yes.

2213
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:53,620
You're not saying like guys, let's not go in the Wendy's.

2214
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:55,940
But why are we complicating the Wendy's is what he's saying.

2215
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:56,280
Right.

2216
01:43:56,380 --> 01:43:57,340
It seems like too much.

2217
01:43:57,540 --> 01:44:00,980
It's too much work to get Wendy's a couple dollars off.

2218
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:03,380
That you're doing.

2219
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:06,620
I'm more than willing to just steal it off of somebody's plate.

2220
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:07,020
Yeah.

2221
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:07,220
Yeah.

2222
01:44:07,220 --> 01:44:13,280
That's why I think I like the Toy Story element you're submitting of like you're in fear of getting caught.

2223
01:44:14,020 --> 01:44:14,500
Right.

2224
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:15,580
To some degree.

2225
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:21,100
But part of the like tension comes from what's the best way to do the thing.

2226
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:31,200
I just yeah, I just feel like it might be a little limiting because we can't talk to humans and you kind of unless there's other I guess other animals in the gang or whatever.

2227
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:38,660
I mean, there is I think there's a lot of things where the animals don't there is there is that animal human boundary, but there's still a lot going on.

2228
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:42,420
We could certainly talk to that's what Yogi Bear rules are.

2229
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:42,620
Sure.

2230
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:43,140
They talk.

2231
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:43,420
Yeah.

2232
01:44:43,540 --> 01:44:43,880
Yeah.

2233
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:44,420
Yeah.

2234
01:44:44,420 --> 01:44:44,740
That's fine.

2235
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:56,300
Let's just make it that I think maybe I think we need we discussed Jason's charm and the like and then that like just that likeable breezy nature.

2236
01:44:56,300 --> 01:45:00,880
I want him to be be able to have to charm a lady.

2237
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:02,340
I'm looking for.

2238
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:02,700
Yes.

2239
01:45:02,700 --> 01:45:03,580
That's what I'm saying.

2240
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:16,720
You know what a fun kind of have your cake and eat it too thing is if it's set in a world in which the animals and humans can talk to each other, but the animals are second class citizens in a way where you're like, hey, no animals allowed in the store.

2241
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:21,220
Like that's part of the scheming is you can relate to them directly.

2242
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:21,800
Yeah.

2243
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:24,780
But still there's like a bit of a barrier.

2244
01:45:24,780 --> 01:45:25,560
How about this?

2245
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:26,860
How about this in society?

2246
01:45:26,860 --> 01:45:28,260
Because it makes it a little heavy.

2247
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:31,220
I'm not saying we can't tackle heavy issues on this show.

2248
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:38,340
But what if Jason's folksy show where we're tackling the issues of the day?

2249
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:48,200
What if we're sort of just teenage animal humanoid animals where it's sort of like the shopkeeper shopkeepers a little suspicious.

2250
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:48,840
Sure.

2251
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:52,160
But then you're saying like basically a full Zootopia world.

2252
01:45:52,300 --> 01:45:53,100
Everyone's an animal?

2253
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:54,120
No, not necessarily.

2254
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:54,560
OK.

2255
01:45:55,760 --> 01:46:00,940
We're given side eye the way teenagers would be at a mall because they might hang out for too long.

2256
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:05,780
They might at worst they might try to steal stuff or they'll like get a bunch of people here and cause trouble.

2257
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:12,120
But in fact what you're trying to constantly impart onto everyone you come across is that you are good boys.

2258
01:46:12,580 --> 01:46:12,980
Yeah.

2259
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:13,560
Yes.

2260
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:15,240
You would never want to get in trouble.

2261
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:20,900
In the very first email about this, you did say it's a shame that the title good boys is taken.

2262
01:46:21,180 --> 01:46:21,300
Right.

2263
01:46:21,300 --> 01:46:25,680
And this is the benefit of this pitch happening four years later is maybe it's back in play.

2264
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:26,600
Yeah, that's true.

2265
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:27,420
It's a good point.

2266
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,540
Is that maybe enough time has passed.

2267
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:29,880
Yeah.

2268
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:34,840
And like animation takes a little while because maybe there are other than animals or other teens.

2269
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:39,140
Maybe they're just human human teens that are bad as well.

2270
01:46:39,140 --> 01:46:41,480
And we're like, no, we're we're good.

2271
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:42,980
We're what we're going to say.

2272
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:46,400
Oh, I was going to say you just, you know, smooth things over.

2273
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:53,020
You send a cookie bouquet to the good boys team and you just write a note that just says no hard feeling.

2274
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:59,520
And then they smile and they're like, well, can't be mad at them.

2275
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:02,940
Well, a cookie bouquet is I'm writing it down.

2276
01:47:02,940 --> 01:47:16,900
I mean, another perfect example of Jason's joke was apologize to the makers of good boys using their other project, which is casually throws in cookie bouquet.

2277
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:19,800
The thing show of hands I've never heard of.

2278
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:27,240
And I got I assumed no hard feelings just coming up because that was a movie, but I didn't know it was the same make in classic tradition.

2279
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:28,900
Jason brought up a thing that I didn't know.

2280
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:29,720
I didn't know it was a maker.

2281
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:30,880
Yeah, I didn't know it was the same people.

2282
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:33,040
No, you got to know your creative teens.

2283
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:36,700
Fellas, this town, you know, we might want to attach these guys.

2284
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:38,540
I like yes, I like no art.

2285
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:39,340
Yeah.

2286
01:47:39,700 --> 01:47:40,100
Yeah.

2287
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:40,400
Yeah.

2288
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:41,340
But yes, you're right.

2289
01:47:41,380 --> 01:47:42,740
And then we got caught on some other thing.

2290
01:47:42,820 --> 01:47:51,280
I mean, cookie bouquet is absolutely like he has to Jason has to like charm an old like a granny type lady with a cookie bouquet.

2291
01:47:51,280 --> 01:48:02,360
I think part of what I like about the animal, the wild animal idea in a universe where you can communicate with humans, but which like I'm not because I invoke Zootopia.

2292
01:48:02,380 --> 01:48:05,300
Of course, the most trenchant racial allegory.

2293
01:48:06,060 --> 01:48:07,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2294
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:10,100
The ultimate movie about bigotry of the.

2295
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:14,240
All the all the answers are there anything facing our society.

2296
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:27,240
I don't think it has to be like that, but I think a lot about like Snoopy cartoons where there was this element of like selectively Snoopy is allowed to behave like a human being and just do his things.

2297
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:30,200
And then sometimes they slam the door on him and go like no dogs allowed.

2298
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:31,220
Yeah.

2299
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:33,320
We'll let you do this up until a point.

2300
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:34,920
You know, yeah.

2301
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:40,400
Where there's sort of like an uneasy alliance of just like, well, you can't have wild animals loose in a restaurant.

2302
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,280
I hope you guys don't take offense.

2303
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:53,340
And I also like this element because I like that pressure against you guys because it gets down to the like you're at a theme park, the place where people cut loose, try to have fun.

2304
01:48:54,020 --> 01:49:01,580
And for whatever varying like strategies you guys have on tackling things, all three of you will basically default to I don't break the rules.

2305
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:02,720
Yes.

2306
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:03,720
Yeah, right.

2307
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:05,920
There's a there is a proper way to do this.

2308
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:09,520
You might change viewpoints on what the proper way is.

2309
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:10,440
Right.

2310
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:12,660
Do I like would I have a smartphone?

2311
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:14,200
Would I have stolen a smart phone?

2312
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:15,800
I think you gotta have a stolen smartphone.

2313
01:49:16,140 --> 01:49:18,960
It would be stolen though because they don't give animals smartphones.

2314
01:49:19,180 --> 01:49:25,560
One of us either either Jason or I stole it and you weren't pro stealing, but you are pro deals.

2315
01:49:25,660 --> 01:49:30,480
So since I didn't do the stealing of the phone, but I'm not above using the stolen phone.

2316
01:49:30,660 --> 01:49:31,040
Right.

2317
01:49:31,220 --> 01:49:34,780
And I think you talk a lot about the plan you somehow found yourself on.

2318
01:49:34,780 --> 01:49:44,160
You realized if you also had this other product and you're paying for that, even though you don't use the second device, it actually brings down the cost per month.

2319
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:44,580
Sure.

2320
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:47,180
I think is always to complicate the plan.

2321
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:47,680
Yes.

2322
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:52,000
We have an A to B and Mike is like, but think about if it's a point one.

2323
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:52,360
Yeah.

2324
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:55,880
Then a point two and then an eight point B will work.

2325
01:49:56,820 --> 01:50:01,050
And also working out a big thing would be I waste two hours of working out.

2326
01:50:01,740 --> 01:50:01,900
Yes.

2327
01:50:02,060 --> 01:50:04,660
The whole plan that might not be good.

2328
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:05,300
Absolutely.

2329
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:06,200
I waste time.

2330
01:50:06,460 --> 01:50:06,560
Yeah.

2331
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:08,360
Which is a thing I do in real life.

2332
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:22,660
Question I mean, when sometimes when you get what you want, you're like begrudgingly eating, like you're begrudgingly enjoying, like you seem exhausted at the work it took to get that.

2333
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:26,560
Certainly when we're talking fast passes, I am exhausted from doing that.

2334
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:26,760
Yeah.

2335
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:27,780
Yes, that is true.

2336
01:50:27,820 --> 01:50:29,660
It does make the day worse for me.

2337
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:42,100
Watching you work through that in real time, it was like the moment we'd like be on the frozen ride or whatever and you'd be like, God, I mean, you guys gotta give me some credit that worked out really well.

2338
01:50:42,380 --> 01:50:43,680
I kind of nailed that.

2339
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:44,100
Yeah.

2340
01:50:44,180 --> 01:50:49,860
And then meanwhile, in the ride on real time, you're like frantically setting up the next fast pass.

2341
01:50:49,940 --> 01:50:50,180
Yeah.

2342
01:50:50,180 --> 01:50:50,380
Yeah.

2343
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:51,140
Yeah.

2344
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:54,120
That is it's I don't know.

2345
01:50:54,260 --> 01:50:56,140
You don't even get to enjoy the spoils of your riches.

2346
01:50:56,180 --> 01:50:57,860
Yeah, I enjoyed fro.

2347
01:50:57,980 --> 01:50:59,960
It was more the living with the land.

2348
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:00,780
Living with the land is the big one.

2349
01:51:00,780 --> 01:51:01,180
I was on my phone.

2350
01:51:01,220 --> 01:51:01,580
Yes.

2351
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:03,960
But yes, there's an anxiety to it.

2352
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:04,880
But again, I've said this before.

2353
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,380
My brain wants the anxiety.

2354
01:51:06,420 --> 01:51:07,280
I don't know what that is.

2355
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:09,020
I don't know what it's trying to fill up.

2356
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:12,700
What that like a psychologist would tell me is wrong with me.

2357
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:17,680
So that is yes, it's wanting to give myself stress.

2358
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:18,200
Yes.

2359
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:19,540
It's wanting anxiety.

2360
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:20,420
Uh huh.

2361
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:21,820
But a lot of that too is like.

2362
01:51:21,820 --> 01:51:25,580
I've never felt less stress in my life than when I was able to take some of the living

2363
01:51:25,580 --> 01:51:28,120
with the land opinion and put and bounce it back.

2364
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:31,540
Oh, and I said that I thought they could shoot this spruce up part of it.

2365
01:51:31,620 --> 01:51:31,700
Yeah.

2366
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:32,820
Oh, getting truly.

2367
01:51:33,140 --> 01:51:37,560
It's like every time you add to it and take it off me, I feel like I got a massage.

2368
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:38,900
Let's make it clear.

2369
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:43,800
Our plan going into that live show was that I was going to back you up that I think living

2370
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:44,920
with the land is bad.

2371
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:46,000
Wow.

2372
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:47,800
And then that narrative took over.

2373
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:49,540
You know these are recording, right?

2374
01:51:49,740 --> 01:51:49,940
I know.

2375
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,980
You know our audience is hearing this, right Griffin?

2376
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:53,380
Because I felt almost bad.

2377
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:54,620
Like did I abandon Scott?

2378
01:51:54,660 --> 01:51:57,700
I was saying I will stand with you brother and agree.

2379
01:51:57,700 --> 01:52:01,260
But then the narrative of Mike wasn't even paying attention.

2380
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:02,240
He was checking.

2381
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:03,140
Yeah.

2382
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:05,180
He reluctantly admits it could use some sprucing up.

2383
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:05,740
There's like.

2384
01:52:05,980 --> 01:52:11,460
There's a lot of like Griffin commenters who are like laying in wait, waiting, wait, not

2385
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:14,520
touching a keyboard and they're all type type type right now.

2386
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:19,000
I mean, here's my very controversial opinion that I like soft floated to you guys.

2387
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:22,520
I think they should rethink that ride with Wally.

2388
01:52:23,180 --> 01:52:26,540
I think they should get Sigourney Weaver to do the voiceover.

2389
01:52:27,020 --> 01:52:33,520
The script can be exactly the same because that like Axiom ship voice is very educational.

2390
01:52:33,660 --> 01:52:34,220
Yeah.

2391
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:38,600
But a performer with I don't know, a little more juice, right?

2392
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:42,720
Like someone who's really going to sell those lines because in the current narrator of and

2393
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:47,800
I was just like, man, Spaceship Earth gets a lot out of the fact that Judy Dench is the

2394
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:49,800
one saying the stuff, right?

2395
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:51,000
That there's a gravitas there.

2396
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:51,680
I'd say so.

2397
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:53,000
So bring in Sigourney Weaver.

2398
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:55,480
She plays it straight, but you got the gravitas.

2399
01:52:55,720 --> 01:53:01,100
And then in some of those areas that feel a little untended, a little worn down, you

2400
01:53:01,100 --> 01:53:02,280
just put in a little Wally.

2401
01:53:02,980 --> 01:53:03,380
Here he is.

2402
01:53:03,380 --> 01:53:03,840
What does he do?

2403
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:06,780
His whole thing is to try to regrow shit on land.

2404
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:07,460
Sure.

2405
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:09,340
So you aren't taking it away.

2406
01:53:09,420 --> 01:53:10,900
You're not taking anything away.

2407
01:53:10,940 --> 01:53:11,140
No.

2408
01:53:11,140 --> 01:53:16,400
And neither am I, by the way, but never have I had an idea about living with the land that

2409
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:17,380
takes anything away.

2410
01:53:17,580 --> 01:53:19,320
A watering can on his head.

2411
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:24,100
You just have a few like animatronic or even static Wallis that are like doing sort of

2412
01:53:24,100 --> 01:53:24,880
little funny scenes.

2413
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:27,340
As much as little Osmos on Autopia.

2414
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:29,040
Right.

2415
01:53:29,060 --> 01:53:31,700
And I was like, we were in that hallway that's very dusty.

2416
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:33,620
And I was like, yeah, the dusty hallway.

2417
01:53:34,260 --> 01:53:37,420
People are really, people are really need the dusty hallway to be there.

2418
01:53:37,420 --> 01:53:41,680
And I'm like, now imagine if you just put a little animatronic Mo in there.

2419
01:53:41,680 --> 01:53:42,460
I'll clean it up.

2420
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:43,600
You don't even clean it up.

2421
01:53:43,740 --> 01:53:46,880
But he's worried about how dirty this ride is.

2422
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:49,560
And they don't even take away the dust.

2423
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:50,840
And now it's sort of like additive.

2424
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:51,660
Everything's additive.

2425
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:52,580
Now it's a feature, not a bug.

2426
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:54,940
This is, now you said you would stand with me.

2427
01:53:54,940 --> 01:53:56,600
So I feel like I have to stand with you on this.

2428
01:53:56,660 --> 01:53:58,760
But I'm also, I'm scared at this point.

2429
01:53:59,020 --> 01:53:59,800
I will.

2430
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:00,480
I will.

2431
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:06,940
I'm suggesting putting IP onto a beloved perfect ride with zero problems.

2432
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:08,080
The room is spinning.

2433
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:09,600
The room is spinning, Griffin.

2434
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:10,160
I don't know.

2435
01:54:10,380 --> 01:54:13,820
It's, it's in line with everything that ride is trying to communicate.

2436
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:15,560
Like this is how we need to.

2437
01:54:15,700 --> 01:54:20,260
The idea that the greenhouse grows from, this is what came from the one little plant at the end of Wall.

2438
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:20,620
Yes.

2439
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:21,640
That's kind of neat.

2440
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:24,820
I don't think Jason's even, Jason's the biggest living with a land defender.

2441
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:25,900
You weren't upset about that.

2442
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:26,480
No, I'm not.

2443
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:31,340
I think that because I forgot about the one little plant at the end.

2444
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:32,540
It's right there.

2445
01:54:32,660 --> 01:54:33,520
I think it's.

2446
01:54:33,540 --> 01:54:34,800
And they're back on earth.

2447
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:39,700
Like that's they've flown back to earth and planted the boot.

2448
01:54:39,820 --> 01:54:40,800
I'm going to put you on the spot.

2449
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:42,060
Don't feel like you have to do this.

2450
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:42,980
No pressure to do this.

2451
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:45,260
But being how much heat is around this ride.

2452
01:54:45,260 --> 01:54:45,620
Sure.

2453
01:54:45,660 --> 01:54:49,660
Are you willing to say I'm Jason Sheridan and I endorse this idea?

2454
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:51,160
Oh, yeah, I will say it.

2455
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:51,660
Say the sentence.

2456
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:55,300
I am Jason Sheridan and I endorse this idea.

2457
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:56,840
I couldn't even get it out.

2458
01:54:57,060 --> 01:54:58,000
But I endorse it.

2459
01:54:58,200 --> 01:54:58,600
You heard it.

2460
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:03,740
I also think like the idea I'm pitching keeps living with the land around for

2461
01:55:03,740 --> 01:55:06,580
another 20 years, like it almost guarantees it.

2462
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:06,960
Right.

2463
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:07,200
Yeah.

2464
01:55:07,580 --> 01:55:11,820
Without radically transforming it, you're not doing fucking journey into a man.

2465
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:13,620
Imagination and like butchering.

2466
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:15,640
I'm just like, you add a couple little things.

2467
01:55:16,220 --> 01:55:17,980
Who's going to complain about Sigourney Weaver?

2468
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:20,140
How about you don't even take away Bean Boy at the end?

2469
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:20,580
None of that.

2470
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:21,700
It's all there.

2471
01:55:21,940 --> 01:55:22,120
Yeah.

2472
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:22,720
Or tomato.

2473
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:23,660
No, you keep all that.

2474
01:55:23,700 --> 01:55:27,820
And Wally's like staring up at the screen going like, wow, like that's all I'm

2475
01:55:27,820 --> 01:55:28,320
suggesting.

2476
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:29,960
I love Bean Boy.

2477
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:36,900
He's basically interacting in real time with the ride as it exists and you preserve it.

2478
01:55:37,720 --> 01:55:38,700
That's a good idea.

2479
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:42,040
What about just draining the track and using it for storage?

2480
01:55:43,660 --> 01:55:46,380
Well, now he's really taking the feet off of us.

2481
01:55:46,820 --> 01:55:48,860
I'm Scott Garter and I have nothing to do with that idea.

2482
01:55:49,340 --> 01:55:50,900
I don't need this right now.

2483
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:52,660
I do not stand with you, brother.

2484
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:53,520
I just wanted to sit.

2485
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:55,460
I wanted to sit there, but you can't go on it.

2486
01:55:55,460 --> 01:55:57,340
Let's get back to this.

2487
01:55:57,400 --> 01:56:00,220
I feel like there's something in this notion.

2488
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:02,540
I'm glad we covered some of that, though.

2489
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:03,820
A lot of business.

2490
01:56:03,900 --> 01:56:05,460
We're not even done with the business, by the way.

2491
01:56:06,140 --> 01:56:10,560
But is there I don't I mean, I think there's something in here.

2492
01:56:11,080 --> 01:56:16,980
Animals, animals after treats, animals, if you're treats all united in this goal, but very different ways of going about it.

2493
01:56:17,080 --> 01:56:18,700
And then who are we against?

2494
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,820
Are we against like guys essentially?

2495
01:56:20,820 --> 01:56:30,020
Like is it like uptight store of people who don't realize that like if we were a little looser, it could be a little more it could be fun to have animals around this place.

2496
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:34,400
That's interesting because that way you're like the intermediary figures, right?

2497
01:56:34,460 --> 01:56:38,100
The humans, the employees of the individual shop, they're not your enemies.

2498
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:39,640
They're not saying shoo shoo.

2499
01:56:39,900 --> 01:56:43,240
They're almost saying, look, guys, I honestly I wish I could let you in.

2500
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:45,800
But this guy who's my boss.

2501
01:56:46,820 --> 01:56:57,500
And then it's a message about like capitalism and corporate because we always as with an organization like Disney or something, I think we like the people on the ground.

2502
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:57,900
Yes.

2503
01:56:57,900 --> 01:57:00,140
And then the bad stuff comes from decision makers.

2504
01:57:00,140 --> 01:57:00,440
Right.

2505
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:03,820
So there has to be some, you know, it's like, you know, the Mr.

2506
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:05,040
Westfield or whatever.

2507
01:57:05,200 --> 01:57:08,900
And maybe there's like the guy who's in charge of the entire thing.

2508
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:11,520
But also there like there could be many guys.

2509
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:12,060
Yeah.

2510
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:17,580
And then you have like this is my chain and we're opening up a new location here, you know, at the Schomburg Mall.

2511
01:57:18,940 --> 01:57:20,860
And this just began to be set at the Schomburg Mall.

2512
01:57:21,140 --> 01:57:21,180
Yes.

2513
01:57:21,180 --> 01:57:22,520
It doesn't do us any benefit.

2514
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:33,100
If we got the participation of if we if we could go go in with the IP of something as as you know, hot in the marketplace as the as the Woodfield Mall.

2515
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:36,340
It also West or Westfield or Mills could back us.

2516
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:44,080
It could be like an American dream style, absurd mega mall where it's like you guys will never reach the end of it.

2517
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:46,780
You know, yeah, it's not even new businesses opening up.

2518
01:57:46,780 --> 01:57:52,380
It's just like the time it takes to get from one end to the other is as many episodes as you run.

2519
01:57:52,900 --> 01:57:53,260
Yes.

2520
01:57:53,440 --> 01:58:00,700
Yeah, I like the idea of a giant expanding mall that can also be like we've fallen on our times.

2521
01:58:00,700 --> 01:58:13,660
Half of these storefronts are the Instagram photo opportunities and, you know, vintage arcades that look like the old arcades, you know, just desperation filler.

2522
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:18,300
Look, an animated show set in a dead mall is definitely an interesting idea.

2523
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:22,860
I don't know if anyone here has a full deck on that that they tried to pitch already.

2524
01:58:22,860 --> 01:58:27,720
And I don't know if any listeners have any connections at a stream or production company.

2525
01:58:28,180 --> 01:58:32,680
Anyway, you know, just just a thought exercise like it was missing one puzzle.

2526
01:58:32,740 --> 01:58:35,340
No need to DM on that three rascally.

2527
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:36,800
That is true.

2528
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:37,560
Yeah.

2529
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:41,920
You know, I didn't have the well, maybe I just need to take what I just plug all this in.

2530
01:58:42,060 --> 01:58:42,940
And I like it.

2531
01:58:43,060 --> 01:58:52,780
The thing I like about it being a sort of newer American dream style mega folly is you can basically almost go sci fi with like anything could exist in this mall.

2532
01:58:53,300 --> 01:58:53,580
Yes.

2533
01:58:53,700 --> 01:58:55,860
This mall can contain an entire theme park.

2534
01:58:55,860 --> 01:58:59,740
Yeah, because there's an indoor ski slope that can contain the doctor's office.

2535
01:58:59,740 --> 01:59:00,940
And like, yes.

2536
01:59:01,140 --> 01:59:01,360
Oh, yeah.

2537
01:59:01,420 --> 01:59:03,180
There's suddenly an urgent care.

2538
01:59:03,260 --> 01:59:03,440
Right.

2539
01:59:03,460 --> 01:59:03,780
The one.

2540
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:04,780
That's a very real.

2541
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:12,480
I mean, I feel like I forget if this was in my idea or not, but I feel like we're not that far from like a cemetery being in a mall.

2542
01:59:12,900 --> 01:59:13,540
What else?

2543
01:59:13,540 --> 01:59:14,700
We got a ton of space.

2544
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,280
And look, those are expensive.

2545
01:59:16,360 --> 01:59:16,620
Right.

2546
01:59:16,740 --> 01:59:20,980
As long as you're OK with, you know, dead bodies being in a dead seers.

2547
01:59:20,980 --> 01:59:21,860
It's own ecosystem.

2548
01:59:21,860 --> 01:59:23,020
And then it's no longer.

2549
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:27,720
Oh, you guys are wilderness animals who are trying to sneak in to the shops of this outdoor mall.

2550
01:59:27,860 --> 01:59:28,080
Yeah.

2551
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:30,260
It's like you like live in the shadows.

2552
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:30,920
Mm hmm.

2553
01:59:31,060 --> 01:59:31,460
Right.

2554
01:59:32,020 --> 01:59:43,200
I also think there's kind of a nice like, you know, like the the animals being fascinated by the that's always like some of them are like American dream, especially I think was probably like, you know, it's wetlands.

2555
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:44,520
We can't we're going to destroy it.

2556
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:45,740
And where does the wildlife go?

2557
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:47,420
I like saying with the wildlife.

2558
01:59:47,540 --> 01:59:48,040
We prefer.

2559
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:48,780
They like it.

2560
01:59:48,780 --> 01:59:49,880
Yeah, they want to go.

2561
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:51,360
They want to be part of this place.

2562
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:53,840
They're chasing off the urban explorer.

2563
01:59:53,940 --> 01:59:54,260
Yes.

2564
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:55,240
Backpack type.

2565
01:59:55,540 --> 01:59:58,240
You know, and the tension of we really want to be good boys.

2566
01:59:58,240 --> 02:00:00,100
We really want to play by the rules.

2567
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:01,340
But they got this.

2568
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:03,960
They got these fucking hangups about us being animals.

2569
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:06,960
We're still trying to do it the most upright way possible.

2570
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:08,940
I think it's an allegory for teenagers.

2571
02:00:09,580 --> 02:00:17,240
And as I assume we were all teenagers who were good teenagers, probably were greeted by the scorn that go that come.

2572
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:20,340
A rowdy teenage boys are going to cause trouble.

2573
02:00:20,460 --> 02:00:20,640
And you can.

2574
02:00:20,740 --> 02:00:21,120
No, no, no, no.

2575
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:21,900
I'm one of the good ones.

2576
02:00:21,940 --> 02:00:22,660
They're going to get there.

2577
02:00:22,700 --> 02:00:23,900
They're not here to see the move.

2578
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:27,400
They're not here going to sit and watch Firehouse Dog.

2579
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:31,080
They're here to they're here to have intercourse.

2580
02:00:31,340 --> 02:00:36,640
I say because one time I saw I was one of the only people seeing Firehouse Dog and there were people having sex in the back row.

2581
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:38,700
The only time I know I've been in the room with people.

2582
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:46,360
But yes, no, I'm the person never I would never sully a movie theater with sexual.

2583
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:47,260
I think you're right.

2584
02:00:47,300 --> 02:00:54,860
That that's like that's what the analog is for the animal status is like you're lumping us in with these other wild creatures.

2585
02:00:55,340 --> 02:00:57,880
Yeah, we actually want to play by your rules.

2586
02:00:58,140 --> 02:01:00,180
Is it called like good creatures?

2587
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:01,440
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

2588
02:01:01,460 --> 02:01:02,080
Is it good?

2589
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:04,720
Good is in there somewhere called the good boys.

2590
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:10,000
And the good boys, you know, they get it fights it if the good boys are not human.

2591
02:01:10,220 --> 02:01:20,380
I mean, boy, I think it's a poster and it says the good boys and the three boys are a skunk, a turtle and a raccoon with this super compelling design.

2592
02:01:21,180 --> 02:01:23,900
I don't bump on it and go like, well, which one are they?

2593
02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:24,620
Yeah.

2594
02:01:24,940 --> 02:01:25,220
Yeah.

2595
02:01:25,260 --> 02:01:26,320
Do they have clothes?

2596
02:01:27,940 --> 02:01:32,660
I mean, my guess is you do and we don't.

2597
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:39,540
OK, I think it's part of living in the mall is that like you're showing off your new graphic tees every week.

2598
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:48,060
Oh, and you know, I also maybe I'm just I just don't wear any clothes or I just wear I stole one item of clothing with it.

2599
02:01:48,060 --> 02:01:49,560
But Jason's the current one.

2600
02:01:49,700 --> 02:01:52,480
So Jason is keeping up with the hottest trends.

2601
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:56,740
Yes, I'm wearing I'm wearing this airbrush shirt that says Riz on it.

2602
02:01:56,740 --> 02:02:00,540
Yeah, it was specially made for you by the airbrush booth.

2603
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:02,460
I'm just trying to get a good boy.

2604
02:02:02,680 --> 02:02:05,600
There's something so evocative about good boy as a term.

2605
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:07,700
And I can't think of like good critters.

2606
02:02:07,700 --> 02:02:12,800
It's not just the extra syllables, but it doesn't convey the same thing of like these are good critters.

2607
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:14,760
It's like, no, this is like a moral stance.

2608
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:16,480
We identify as good boys.

2609
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:18,360
Oh, you know.

2610
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:20,140
Yeah, I'm not sure.

2611
02:02:20,540 --> 02:02:22,540
I don't I'm just trying.

2612
02:02:22,640 --> 02:02:25,400
Is there was there a one syllable way to animalize it?

2613
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:28,600
Yeah, I'm trying to think.

2614
02:02:29,100 --> 02:02:29,960
Yeah, creature.

2615
02:02:31,620 --> 02:02:32,540
Good furries.

2616
02:02:33,140 --> 02:02:34,140
Yeah, that's probably it.

2617
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:37,120
Yeah, it's a good boy to dogs.

2618
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:39,080
You know, no one's bumping on that.

2619
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:40,460
We need to be dogs.

2620
02:02:40,660 --> 02:02:41,240
One need to be.

2621
02:02:41,260 --> 02:02:43,060
Was there already a movie called Good Boys?

2622
02:02:43,140 --> 02:02:43,860
That a Henson?

2623
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:44,400
Correct.

2624
02:02:44,500 --> 02:02:44,820
Wow.

2625
02:02:45,160 --> 02:02:45,740
There you go.

2626
02:02:46,020 --> 02:02:46,080
Uh huh.

2627
02:02:46,260 --> 02:02:48,760
It's dogs are actually aliens and they can talk.

2628
02:02:49,060 --> 02:02:49,900
Is that what it is?

2629
02:02:49,900 --> 02:02:54,580
I believe in Matthew Broderick's The Voice of the Dog, who's like, wow, we actually come from Planet Bark.

2630
02:02:55,420 --> 02:02:57,480
Why have I stayed away from I have watched it.

2631
02:02:57,600 --> 02:02:58,020
How long?

2632
02:02:58,200 --> 02:02:58,480
How long?

2633
02:02:58,960 --> 02:02:59,560
Twenty years ago.

2634
02:02:59,640 --> 02:03:00,480
How old is it?

2635
02:03:00,860 --> 02:03:04,580
Yeah, I think it was like early like oh, three or four.

2636
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:09,620
And what was the Will Ferrell Kevin Hart strays strays?

2637
02:03:09,900 --> 02:03:10,100
Yes.

2638
02:03:10,660 --> 02:03:11,600
Good strays.

2639
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:12,840
No, probably not.

2640
02:03:13,060 --> 02:03:17,220
No, good pets isn't right because that's good pups.

2641
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:18,960
Huh?

2642
02:03:19,240 --> 02:03:20,320
Good pups ain't bad.

2643
02:03:20,580 --> 02:03:24,260
I mean, that ties us into being dogs, but I think we could be different types of dogs.

2644
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:25,980
Yeah, the dogs is funny.

2645
02:03:26,280 --> 02:03:26,320
Yeah.

2646
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:27,060
Good pals.

2647
02:03:28,300 --> 02:03:33,320
Good boys just feels like it immediately belies a state of mind.

2648
02:03:34,500 --> 02:03:35,320
Do you know what I'm saying?

2649
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:36,620
Yeah, that's like Margot Robbie.

2650
02:03:36,620 --> 02:03:42,320
I think all the listeners, everybody felt like you're like in a car pass and a joint around and like, whoa.

2651
02:03:42,620 --> 02:03:44,420
I feel like.

2652
02:03:44,580 --> 02:03:46,240
I think Good Boys.

2653
02:03:46,240 --> 02:03:48,140
It's like more of a place.

2654
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:49,660
It's a phrase.

2655
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:53,480
Yeah.

2656
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:58,460
So if we're dogs, like I'm trying to think you could like escape a cage.

2657
02:03:59,260 --> 02:03:59,660
Yeah.

2658
02:03:59,660 --> 02:04:00,700
Every night, I guess.

2659
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:02,040
But then you are missing.

2660
02:04:02,540 --> 02:04:03,380
We're in a pet store in the mall.

2661
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:04,860
We go out and wander around.

2662
02:04:05,140 --> 02:04:05,220
Yeah.

2663
02:04:05,460 --> 02:04:11,540
You're missing a little bit of the this mall replaced the wilderness.

2664
02:04:11,680 --> 02:04:12,000
Yeah.

2665
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:14,440
And these animals have chosen it instead.

2666
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:14,960
Yeah.

2667
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:16,160
They want to be here.

2668
02:04:16,180 --> 02:04:17,260
They prefer it.

2669
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:17,800
Yeah.

2670
02:04:17,900 --> 02:04:18,260
Yeah.

2671
02:04:18,260 --> 02:04:19,260
Mm hmm.

2672
02:04:19,940 --> 02:04:22,700
Well, I don't want to make the name drive it.

2673
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:27,300
I mean, if we generally think we're in the now, what is turtle right?

2674
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:28,820
We think turtles right.

2675
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:29,900
You tell me.

2676
02:04:30,300 --> 02:04:31,280
I don't know that there's an animal.

2677
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:33,080
We feel worried to skunk and raccoon.

2678
02:04:33,100 --> 02:04:34,240
Do those feel like they're working?

2679
02:04:34,420 --> 02:04:34,620
Yeah.

2680
02:04:34,620 --> 02:04:36,180
I want everybody to have input into this.

2681
02:04:36,240 --> 02:04:37,440
Jason, do you want to be a skunk?

2682
02:04:37,660 --> 02:04:38,020
Sure.

2683
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:39,160
OK, kid.

2684
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:41,440
They're misunderstood creatures.

2685
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:44,940
There are a lot of pieces that have been thrown out with scum.

2686
02:04:44,940 --> 02:04:45,660
It is scum.

2687
02:04:45,660 --> 02:04:47,460
Some limbs from previous ideas.

2688
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:48,820
Good stinkers.

2689
02:04:49,300 --> 02:04:50,740
Good stinker.

2690
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:51,140
It could be.

2691
02:04:51,320 --> 02:04:52,860
I mean, it could be three dogs.

2692
02:04:52,860 --> 02:04:53,440
Mm hmm.

2693
02:04:55,340 --> 02:04:56,220
Good grunts.

2694
02:04:56,460 --> 02:04:57,720
A skunk with a pocket square.

2695
02:04:59,380 --> 02:05:00,320
Here's the other thing.

2696
02:05:00,420 --> 02:05:06,220
Our idea also still allows Jason to come into the businesses and be like, I got an idea

2697
02:05:06,220 --> 02:05:07,340
for how to prove.

2698
02:05:07,880 --> 02:05:09,340
You need some of that old timey magic.

2699
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:10,020
You know?

2700
02:05:10,020 --> 02:05:10,560
Yeah.

2701
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:12,920
Just put it on a trench coat and a top hat.

2702
02:05:13,300 --> 02:05:13,740
Hello.

2703
02:05:14,300 --> 02:05:20,840
His grand skunks brought a 1930s energy that he tries to carry on.

2704
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:25,280
And I think there can be a strip club in the small.

2705
02:05:25,600 --> 02:05:26,160
Absolutely.

2706
02:05:26,580 --> 02:05:29,520
If American Dream's not already doing it, they should be.

2707
02:05:36,820 --> 02:05:38,660
I guess you've got various types of lizards.

2708
02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:44,740
Can Mike be like a, because you're tall, can you be like a big, like a stork or a, what

2709
02:05:44,740 --> 02:05:45,020
are they?

2710
02:05:45,060 --> 02:05:45,400
What are they?

2711
02:05:45,800 --> 02:05:47,020
Like a big crane.

2712
02:05:47,620 --> 02:05:48,100
Like a heron?

2713
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:48,580
Yeah.

2714
02:05:48,580 --> 02:05:49,420
Oh yeah, a heron and crane.

2715
02:05:49,680 --> 02:05:53,700
Maybe I could, maybe I'd take raccoon and you become a heron.

2716
02:05:55,020 --> 02:05:55,240
Okay.

2717
02:05:55,680 --> 02:05:56,440
A mighty heron.

2718
02:05:56,440 --> 02:05:57,240
A heron's big.

2719
02:05:57,480 --> 02:05:58,180
A mighty heron.

2720
02:05:58,400 --> 02:05:59,640
Is Michael a flamingo?

2721
02:05:59,740 --> 02:06:01,180
Is that, are you a flamingo?

2722
02:06:01,180 --> 02:06:01,880
A flamingo is fine.

2723
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:05,040
I don't know which flamingos are getting displaced from.

2724
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:07,280
Flamingos feel kind of.

2725
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:08,220
If it's a Florida mull.

2726
02:06:08,220 --> 02:06:09,280
Yeah, that's true.

2727
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:09,560
Okay.

2728
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:10,700
Well, I mean, I think that helps.

2729
02:06:10,740 --> 02:06:11,760
Oh, well that's interesting.

2730
02:06:11,960 --> 02:06:15,300
Well, then you guys can talk about how much you love the humidity and I'm the one who

2731
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:15,620
doesn't.

2732
02:06:15,620 --> 02:06:16,040
That's right.

2733
02:06:16,240 --> 02:06:16,520
We do love.

2734
02:06:16,520 --> 02:06:17,400
You guys are crazy.

2735
02:06:17,700 --> 02:06:18,020
Yeah.

2736
02:06:18,180 --> 02:06:19,160
That's how it'll go.

2737
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:24,860
And if it's in, and if we set it in Florida, then I think it gives Jason power, the power

2738
02:06:24,860 --> 02:06:25,960
that you have when you go to Florida.

2739
02:06:25,980 --> 02:06:26,540
Oh, right, right, right.

2740
02:06:28,340 --> 02:06:35,360
I did think there's one like, the potential hangup in this, which is there was, there

2741
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:40,300
was one episode where we, a while back where we discussed, I was like, I think we need

2742
02:06:40,300 --> 02:06:45,540
to open up our voiceover abilities and start trying new different voices on this show.

2743
02:06:45,900 --> 02:06:50,360
And Jason insisted that he couldn't do it unless he got a lot of training from you.

2744
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:52,740
I mean, I don't know if we discussed this together.

2745
02:06:53,200 --> 02:06:55,180
No, I just heard it on the episode.

2746
02:06:55,820 --> 02:06:58,500
So I was trying to pay you a compliment.

2747
02:06:58,660 --> 02:06:59,900
I appreciated it.

2748
02:07:03,060 --> 02:07:07,140
Would you be willing to, in addition to, I say you get EP fees on this.

2749
02:07:07,180 --> 02:07:11,080
Would you be willing to also accept voiceover coach money from Jason?

2750
02:07:11,160 --> 02:07:13,400
Yeah, I would not refuse that money.

2751
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:19,500
I mean, I feel like I said this, I texted this to you at the time, but I was like, I

2752
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:21,780
don't, I certainly don't think I'm like Mel blank.

2753
02:07:21,900 --> 02:07:29,040
I'm like, there are like three sort of ranges I feel like I have a natural facility with

2754
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:34,420
I can go like further in this direction, pull this further back from what my speaking voice

2755
02:07:34,420 --> 02:07:34,780
is.

2756
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:41,260
Is one of them the manager of a Marshalls who wants a skunk, a heron and a raccoon to

2757
02:07:41,260 --> 02:07:42,700
get the hell out of the Marshalls?

2758
02:07:43,380 --> 02:07:46,280
Let's also say herons pretty popular right now.

2759
02:07:46,280 --> 02:07:47,640
Blowing up the box office.

2760
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:51,260
Oh yeah, I know a lot of a lot of critical cred to herons currently.

2761
02:07:51,460 --> 02:07:54,160
Lends an air of legitimacy to the show.

2762
02:07:54,340 --> 02:07:56,120
The good boys and the heron.

2763
02:07:56,140 --> 02:07:56,780
There we go.

2764
02:07:56,780 --> 02:08:01,360
But I feel like similar to like what we're talking about here, when I get like a VA audition,

2765
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:07,620
I'm like, what's the thing I can like accentuate or scale back from what I think my natural

2766
02:08:07,620 --> 02:08:13,660
vocal qualities are in the same way that you identified the shift in register of the way

2767
02:08:13,660 --> 02:08:15,720
to be like, well, hey, now wait a second.

2768
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:16,080
Yeah.

2769
02:08:17,360 --> 02:08:18,160
Here's the thing.

2770
02:08:18,240 --> 02:08:22,740
Can you teach Jason just how to say, come up and see me sometime in the right way?

2771
02:08:22,860 --> 02:08:24,320
Oh, I thought he did that pretty well.

2772
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:26,440
Yeah, I think he did, but I think there's room for improvement.

2773
02:08:26,680 --> 02:08:28,620
I don't want to be so critical here, but.

2774
02:08:28,740 --> 02:08:31,000
You know, constructive criticism is very helpful.

2775
02:08:31,140 --> 02:08:31,600
Thank you, Mike.

2776
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:32,080
Exactly, yeah.

2777
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:37,760
So can you give him sort of some famous lines and explain, tell him how to say those in

2778
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:37,880
the right way?

2779
02:08:37,880 --> 02:08:38,680
Well, let's be honest.

2780
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:41,440
The one I think that needs the most work is Stitch.

2781
02:08:42,380 --> 02:08:43,200
I would agree.

2782
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:43,920
Yeah.

2783
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,900
Do we have any, I feel like you've done voices similar to that.

2784
02:08:48,020 --> 02:08:50,920
Here, let's start with a blank slate of your current Stitch.

2785
02:08:51,340 --> 02:08:52,920
Can you give us a?

2786
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:54,480
Oh, how nice.

2787
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,060
Now, what are we missing?

2788
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:01,040
Where do we get it into the actual Stitch?

2789
02:09:01,140 --> 02:09:03,020
OK, so let's say like what if.

2790
02:09:04,140 --> 02:09:11,900
What if this is sort of like the Jason animal character, whatever animal he ends up being

2791
02:09:11,900 --> 02:09:14,900
in sort of like goblin mode, right?

2792
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:16,800
When he's got his access to his snacks.

2793
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:18,340
Sickle mode.

2794
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:18,860
Yeah.

2795
02:09:18,860 --> 02:09:19,280
Sickle mode.

2796
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:20,240
Do you know what I'm saying?

2797
02:09:20,240 --> 02:09:23,520
I would say it's a slang term from six years ago.

2798
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:26,980
Six years ago before the court case.

2799
02:09:27,200 --> 02:09:27,840
You're taking.

2800
02:09:28,120 --> 02:09:29,760
Before the pre-trampling.

2801
02:09:30,140 --> 02:09:30,960
Wait, this is another thing.

2802
02:09:31,060 --> 02:09:32,480
You just did one I don't know about.

2803
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:33,400
What do you mean trampoline?

2804
02:09:33,400 --> 02:09:35,140
Travis Scott concert incident.

2805
02:09:35,160 --> 02:09:35,180
Yeah.

2806
02:09:37,900 --> 02:09:39,680
Oh, that has something to do with sickle mode?

2807
02:09:39,820 --> 02:09:41,160
Travis Scott's sickle mode.

2808
02:09:41,320 --> 02:09:43,380
Said to go sickle mode and then people died?

2809
02:09:43,620 --> 02:09:44,660
Well, I mean, it's the song.

2810
02:09:45,100 --> 02:09:46,540
He redefined what sickle mode was.

2811
02:09:46,700 --> 02:09:48,440
It's apparently going to the great beyond.

2812
02:09:49,480 --> 02:09:51,580
I'm afraid he's gone sickle mode.

2813
02:09:51,780 --> 02:09:56,860
I always think about with voiceover stuff like Hank Azaria has talked very openly about

2814
02:09:56,860 --> 02:10:01,660
all of his Simpsons characters are a bad impression of a different movie star.

2815
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:05,420
And he's like, Mo for me is like early Pacino.

2816
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:05,740
Yeah.

2817
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:11,140
And I can't quite hit early Pacino, but my version of that starts to be its own character.

2818
02:10:11,220 --> 02:10:13,760
And like Wiggum is.

2819
02:10:14,440 --> 02:10:15,000
Edward G.

2820
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:15,440
Robinson.

2821
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:21,540
You know, like a lot of those, I feel like similarly, it's like, well, let's not focus

2822
02:10:21,540 --> 02:10:24,300
on is Jason trying and failing to hit Stitch.

2823
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:29,580
It's like, what are the unique qualities of what is coming out of you when you're trying

2824
02:10:29,580 --> 02:10:31,780
to do Stitch and what do we intensify there?

2825
02:10:32,020 --> 02:10:36,920
So I'm like, if you take like what your Stitch is right now, pull it even further away from

2826
02:10:36,920 --> 02:10:43,060
any need to match the classic Stitch voice and then sort of like add on to it the idea

2827
02:10:43,060 --> 02:10:45,340
of like tummy full of sugar and caffeine.

2828
02:10:46,420 --> 02:10:46,740
Okay.

2829
02:10:46,780 --> 02:10:47,500
I love this.

2830
02:10:47,580 --> 02:10:50,460
That this is a mode that he goes into in success.

2831
02:10:51,180 --> 02:10:51,460
Going feral.

2832
02:10:51,680 --> 02:10:51,880
Yes.

2833
02:10:52,500 --> 02:10:56,900
Another thing we used to say about Jason is that he'd start getting wild and we said he

2834
02:10:56,900 --> 02:10:58,500
was going feral like Wolverine.

2835
02:10:58,900 --> 02:10:59,140
Oh yeah.

2836
02:10:59,340 --> 02:11:00,000
So I think you took it.

2837
02:11:00,080 --> 02:11:01,480
Feral boys, a potential.

2838
02:11:01,640 --> 02:11:02,140
That's true.

2839
02:11:02,220 --> 02:11:06,500
I think it partly came out one time when we would hang out in your old, un-air conditioned

2840
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:08,340
apartment in the middle of summer.

2841
02:11:08,360 --> 02:11:09,100
Sweat box, yes.

2842
02:11:09,120 --> 02:11:10,180
A sweat box.

2843
02:11:10,180 --> 02:11:13,380
And I would just start to like lose it a little.

2844
02:11:13,420 --> 02:11:17,880
Like I've just been downing ice water, but it's like not working.

2845
02:11:18,060 --> 02:11:20,700
Ice water is a very old person thing to say.

2846
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:21,740
Water with ice.

2847
02:11:21,780 --> 02:11:25,920
Cold water, but it's so hot inside.

2848
02:11:26,580 --> 02:11:27,860
Like I don't know.

2849
02:11:27,860 --> 02:11:29,160
It's a little crowded in the mall today.

2850
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:29,920
Should we?

2851
02:11:30,160 --> 02:11:31,620
Should we get caught?

2852
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:32,900
They got ice water.

2853
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:34,400
Tall glass of ice water.

2854
02:11:34,560 --> 02:11:38,620
You know what's another Jasonism I just remembered that has really stuck with me for a long time?

2855
02:11:38,620 --> 02:11:42,740
Was it the Starlight Coke that you were trying to get?

2856
02:11:42,740 --> 02:11:43,420
Oh yeah, yeah.

2857
02:11:43,560 --> 02:11:43,900
Scott to drink.

2858
02:11:44,160 --> 02:11:44,420
Scott into.

2859
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:50,320
And Jason mentioned, I poured myself a glass right now over ice in a highball glass.

2860
02:11:52,040 --> 02:11:55,100
It's a tall, more skinny glass than a punch glass.

2861
02:11:55,460 --> 02:12:00,220
Most people, and this is a thing I love about you Jason, most people would just say, you

2862
02:12:00,220 --> 02:12:00,560
know what?

2863
02:12:00,660 --> 02:12:01,680
I drink it at home.

2864
02:12:02,160 --> 02:12:03,800
And Jason paints a full picture.

2865
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:04,240
Yeah.

2866
02:12:04,240 --> 02:12:04,700
That's right.

2867
02:12:04,700 --> 02:12:04,960
Right?

2868
02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:06,280
I'm a storyteller.

2869
02:12:06,280 --> 02:12:07,500
Yes, a storyteller.

2870
02:12:07,600 --> 02:12:08,520
A weaver of words.

2871
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:12,000
How is it just going from the can, it's over a highball glass on the rocks.

2872
02:12:12,700 --> 02:12:13,040
Sure.

2873
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:14,680
On the rocks.

2874
02:12:15,560 --> 02:12:16,380
His Coke Starlight.

2875
02:12:16,740 --> 02:12:23,340
So he's a little stinker skunk who drinks Coke Starlight over ice from a highball glass.

2876
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:25,340
I guess I could be a bear.

2877
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:27,940
We talked about us being a bear.

2878
02:12:28,040 --> 02:12:30,640
I feel pretty committed to Heron frankly, but.

2879
02:12:30,740 --> 02:12:32,800
The bird feels a little.

2880
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:33,440
It feels right.

2881
02:12:34,080 --> 02:12:36,420
And a bird constantly on a smartphone.

2882
02:12:36,660 --> 02:12:39,160
It's not just height, you have like the lankiness.

2883
02:12:39,460 --> 02:12:39,880
That's true.

2884
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:41,640
That's true.

2885
02:12:41,660 --> 02:12:43,240
A bird on a smartphone is funny.

2886
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:46,200
You're saying it and I'm imagining it.

2887
02:12:46,660 --> 02:12:49,620
The bird who's constantly chicken on his feathers.

2888
02:12:49,940 --> 02:12:54,400
Are the animals real scale or are they sort of a little cheated do you think?

2889
02:12:54,520 --> 02:12:55,520
They could be a little bit bigger.

2890
02:12:55,680 --> 02:13:01,500
So in case the skunk is talking to a human woman, it's not like it's a tiny, you know

2891
02:13:01,500 --> 02:13:01,900
what I'm saying?

2892
02:13:01,900 --> 02:13:08,580
Let's say to use a classic cartoon sort of scale, let's say maybe they're all five apples

2893
02:13:08,580 --> 02:13:10,960
tall, six apples tall.

2894
02:13:12,080 --> 02:13:13,200
That means short though.

2895
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:15,920
Extremely small Heron.

2896
02:13:15,960 --> 02:13:25,280
I think you basically say like everyone is at least half a human sized.

2897
02:13:25,900 --> 02:13:28,900
I think you could grow the animals and shrink the humans.

2898
02:13:29,040 --> 02:13:30,000
Yeah, possibly.

2899
02:13:30,020 --> 02:13:30,860
So it kind of meets.

2900
02:13:30,860 --> 02:13:36,660
Wouldn't it look weird if Jason takes a human woman as a wife or a girlfriend?

2901
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:37,220
Right.

2902
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:41,920
But you also want to maintain the height size differences between the three of you.

2903
02:13:42,060 --> 02:13:42,720
Of course.

2904
02:13:42,920 --> 02:13:43,480
Yes, that's true.

2905
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:48,620
Which like being a bird allows you to be a little leggy while also not being six foot

2906
02:13:48,620 --> 02:13:50,820
five, which like a bear you get too tall.

2907
02:13:51,020 --> 02:13:51,920
Because like I want.

2908
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:54,720
You pulled up the cats here.

2909
02:13:55,140 --> 02:13:56,100
That's riff raff.

2910
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:56,740
Yeah, yeah.

2911
02:13:57,340 --> 02:13:58,720
Cleo is his girlfriend.

2912
02:13:58,760 --> 02:14:02,460
She's a cat as well, but she is much more like a human woman.

2913
02:14:02,660 --> 02:14:04,840
She's a human woman's body essentially.

2914
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:06,280
And riff raff is a cute little cat.

2915
02:14:06,280 --> 02:14:08,140
We know what Cleo looks like.

2916
02:14:09,220 --> 02:14:11,180
Listeners need no explanation.

2917
02:14:11,540 --> 02:14:12,340
Yeah, so.

2918
02:14:15,980 --> 02:14:17,100
Childhood paramours.

2919
02:14:19,720 --> 02:14:25,880
I cannot get the word because I just always am afraid of saying the band name paramour.

2920
02:14:25,880 --> 02:14:27,920
But that's the word, Jason.

2921
02:14:28,340 --> 02:14:29,220
That's the word.

2922
02:14:29,320 --> 02:14:30,360
That is the word.

2923
02:14:30,820 --> 02:14:32,480
But it's not spelled right.

2924
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:34,420
It's not spelled correctly, is it?

2925
02:14:34,440 --> 02:14:35,400
No, it's paramour.

2926
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:35,960
It's the same word.

2927
02:14:36,040 --> 02:14:36,960
That's the word.

2928
02:14:37,300 --> 02:14:39,880
I thought the word ended in O-U-R.

2929
02:14:40,180 --> 02:14:42,100
I think it might, but I think you still say it.

2930
02:14:42,100 --> 02:14:43,260
The name is spelled differently, but that's just a little kind of clever twist.

2931
02:14:43,260 --> 02:14:46,240
I think they spelled it different for whatever reason.

2932
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:47,840
It's like the Beatles.

2933
02:14:48,240 --> 02:14:49,740
So say it the same way.

2934
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:51,260
Let's hear the Google pronunciation.

2935
02:14:51,540 --> 02:14:52,520
Let's check it out.

2936
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:53,320
Paramour.

2937
02:14:53,540 --> 02:14:54,000
Paramour.

2938
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,860
Oh, no, it's the exact same spelling.

2939
02:14:56,020 --> 02:14:57,320
No, it can be spelled.

2940
02:14:57,620 --> 02:14:57,860
Oh, OK.

2941
02:14:58,040 --> 02:14:58,440
Here, I see.

2942
02:14:59,060 --> 02:15:02,200
So the paramour came from avoiding.

2943
02:15:03,040 --> 02:15:05,260
You didn't want to say paramour.

2944
02:15:08,720 --> 02:15:12,180
I thought after the first time it was just like we all laughed.

2945
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:16,020
And then when I brought up the second time, it was like now we all say paramour.

2946
02:15:16,120 --> 02:15:18,140
I will be honest, I've been confused about where it's been.

2947
02:15:18,200 --> 02:15:21,220
If you were commenting on the first time, but now I know it's one.

2948
02:15:21,260 --> 02:15:21,780
I get it.

2949
02:15:21,780 --> 02:15:23,400
OK, you were avoiding paramour.

2950
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:24,720
I get it now, too.

2951
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:27,180
When a paramour is exactly where you should have been.

2952
02:15:27,700 --> 02:15:30,820
And see, this is the type of gold you can't invent out of a whole block.

2953
02:15:32,580 --> 02:15:37,460
This is the sort of, you know, in Shark Tank terms, it's the proprietary element.

2954
02:15:38,360 --> 02:15:38,700
Yes.

2955
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:41,040
No one else has access to this, the raw feed.

2956
02:15:43,780 --> 02:15:47,680
I think we maybe landed on a successful notion, but I brought a prop that might illustrate

2957
02:15:47,680 --> 02:15:48,980
just one other way that we could go.

2958
02:15:49,120 --> 02:15:51,260
And I don't have other ideas for us here, but this is a prop.

2959
02:15:51,260 --> 02:15:55,540
This is something that Jason gave to me and I don't want to.

2960
02:15:55,720 --> 02:15:56,160
I don't know.

2961
02:15:56,220 --> 02:15:57,580
I think it'll just spur something.

2962
02:15:58,140 --> 02:15:58,820
It's Mr.

2963
02:15:59,200 --> 02:15:59,680
Taffy.

2964
02:16:01,020 --> 02:16:01,320
Mr.

2965
02:16:01,560 --> 02:16:03,760
Taffy is this is a Jersey Shore thing.

2966
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:05,660
It is a Jersey Shore thing.

2967
02:16:06,160 --> 02:16:11,760
It's a little Taffy with a bow tie and blue and blue arm bands and boots.

2968
02:16:12,360 --> 02:16:18,420
Some of the Discord listeners were very nice and sent me a Mr.

2969
02:16:18,640 --> 02:16:20,920
Shriver's gift basket that had a Mr.

2970
02:16:21,060 --> 02:16:21,240
Taffy.

2971
02:16:21,260 --> 02:16:22,160
Oh, geez.

2972
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:22,600
Oh, wow.

2973
02:16:22,640 --> 02:16:23,580
So you have a new one.

2974
02:16:23,580 --> 02:16:24,440
OK, great.

2975
02:16:25,260 --> 02:16:29,540
So which I, of course, brought those back for your children and my adult girlfriend.

2976
02:16:29,880 --> 02:16:31,800
So now they were a too happy asshole.

2977
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:33,780
Not a cat.

2978
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:34,340
Not a cat.

2979
02:16:37,500 --> 02:16:43,420
Taffy successfully did become a beloved toy of my son, maybe second only

2980
02:16:43,420 --> 02:16:46,460
to another favorite toy of his 20 Kingos.

2981
02:16:46,640 --> 02:16:50,780
Have we ever actually explained the Kingo thing on Mike Foley?

2982
02:16:50,780 --> 02:16:51,580
Didn't we?

2983
02:16:51,820 --> 02:16:52,460
I think we did.

2984
02:16:52,780 --> 02:16:54,460
Well, you gave me some on Mike.

2985
02:16:54,460 --> 02:16:55,880
I gave you a couple on Mike.

2986
02:16:55,940 --> 02:17:04,400
But then many, many, many of different that all came in different, usually like one at a time.

2987
02:17:08,860 --> 02:17:09,480
I ordered them all.

2988
02:17:10,040 --> 02:17:14,580
I think it was 20 in total from GameStop Deep Clearance.

2989
02:17:14,860 --> 02:17:16,720
And it was a couple different form factors.

2990
02:17:16,860 --> 02:17:19,360
It was keychain, Funko Pop, Marvel Legends.

2991
02:17:20,580 --> 02:17:25,060
Yeah, three shapes, which I mean, that's that's like kind of amazing for a kid to like see

2992
02:17:25,060 --> 02:17:27,120
the same character in many different forms.

2993
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:30,100
He understands the idea of like artistic interpretation now.

2994
02:17:30,320 --> 02:17:31,200
Like what story can be told?

2995
02:17:31,620 --> 02:17:34,440
Griffin, I just sent you there's non-mints on entertainment Earth Kingos.

2996
02:17:34,640 --> 02:17:35,460
They're five dollars.

2997
02:17:35,700 --> 02:17:39,660
What you don't know is for the last two years, any time Mike finds a site with low price

2998
02:17:39,660 --> 02:17:41,680
Kingos, he's like, I'm just saying.

2999
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:43,520
I'm like, the Kingo thing's done.

3000
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:45,260
I can't send more Kingos.

3001
02:17:45,260 --> 02:17:46,360
That was a time.

3002
02:17:46,720 --> 02:17:53,200
Wow, Bono, U2, Zootv, Bono and the Octon Baby car is thirteen dollars marked down from 2249.

3003
02:17:53,360 --> 02:17:54,160
As a Funko Pop?

3004
02:17:54,340 --> 02:17:54,840
Yes.

3005
02:17:55,340 --> 02:17:58,160
Can we get back to the cartoon pitching already?

3006
02:17:59,100 --> 02:17:59,960
I do think.

3007
02:17:59,960 --> 02:18:01,080
That's so stupid.

3008
02:18:01,800 --> 02:18:03,220
That's the dumbest shit.

3009
02:18:03,560 --> 02:18:06,380
You said ooh and thirteen dollars for that.

3010
02:18:06,680 --> 02:18:08,740
Bono driving a stupid little car.

3011
02:18:08,940 --> 02:18:10,380
Why does the car look like that?

3012
02:18:10,400 --> 02:18:13,680
Because that's what the car looks like from the era of.

3013
02:18:13,680 --> 02:18:15,340
Some stickers on it.

3014
02:18:15,420 --> 02:18:16,760
I'll do respect.

3015
02:18:16,780 --> 02:18:20,620
You know I'm usually aligned with you on matters of collectibles.

3016
02:18:21,180 --> 02:18:23,480
That sucks so hard.

3017
02:18:24,060 --> 02:18:25,380
You just showed us.

3018
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:27,400
Staring blankly at it.

3019
02:18:27,640 --> 02:18:29,320
Take away the Funko Pop.

3020
02:18:30,580 --> 02:18:32,020
The car is dumb.

3021
02:18:32,180 --> 02:18:35,760
I think if it's just the car, you go, well, that's the iconic car from Zootv.

3022
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:36,720
Of course, of course.

3023
02:18:36,860 --> 02:18:37,720
The famous Zoot.

3024
02:18:37,740 --> 02:18:40,000
We did an entire episode of McFisto and all that.

3025
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:41,400
The car never came up.

3026
02:18:41,400 --> 02:18:42,680
I don't remember the car.

3027
02:18:42,680 --> 02:18:43,560
I'm just adding new.

3028
02:18:44,020 --> 02:18:44,840
The car is at the sphere though.

3029
02:18:44,900 --> 02:18:45,520
We did talk about this.

3030
02:18:45,600 --> 02:18:48,780
DJ is DJing in the sphere at the car before the show.

3031
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:52,520
I've seen that the sphere DJ is in a little car.

3032
02:18:52,600 --> 02:18:53,900
That's the car.

3033
02:18:54,720 --> 02:18:55,780
The Zootv car.

3034
02:18:55,940 --> 02:18:57,460
Which was on the original tour.

3035
02:18:57,700 --> 02:18:59,000
So it's a little bit of a reference.

3036
02:18:59,580 --> 02:19:01,500
The key part of Mike's game is the.

3037
02:19:01,520 --> 02:19:01,840
What do you mean?

3038
02:19:01,880 --> 02:19:03,800
How do you guys not know what I'm talking about?

3039
02:19:04,260 --> 02:19:10,200
Do you think Prolithe Spider-Man, the name of the man who climbed the sphere causing.

3040
02:19:10,320 --> 02:19:11,080
Is that his name?

3041
02:19:11,080 --> 02:19:12,580
He claimed to be pro.

3042
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:15,620
Yes, he was the pro life Spider-Man.

3043
02:19:15,680 --> 02:19:19,020
Somebody would get someone climbed to the top of the sphere.

3044
02:19:19,140 --> 02:19:20,100
I did know that.

3045
02:19:20,220 --> 02:19:21,580
But then pro life Spider-Man.

3046
02:19:22,040 --> 02:19:27,580
He was doing it for a cause and he caused a hundred thousand dollars in damage by doing

3047
02:19:27,580 --> 02:19:27,920
that.

3048
02:19:27,960 --> 02:19:28,660
Did he really?

3049
02:19:28,740 --> 02:19:29,200
Yeah.

3050
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:31,040
I think the sphere can afford it.

3051
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:34,540
So his.

3052
02:19:34,540 --> 02:19:37,420
I was wondering, do you think he knows about the car?

3053
02:19:38,860 --> 02:19:40,260
Probably not, right?

3054
02:19:40,260 --> 02:19:41,580
Yeah, I don't know.

3055
02:19:41,780 --> 02:19:42,560
Maybe the man.

3056
02:19:42,700 --> 02:19:45,060
It was it was it an anti-abortion stand.

3057
02:19:45,080 --> 02:19:46,880
The command climbed the sphere.

3058
02:19:46,980 --> 02:19:47,900
It was an abortion.

3059
02:19:48,260 --> 02:19:49,410
Trying to raise money.

3060
02:19:50,360 --> 02:19:50,720
Raise money?

3061
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:53,300
In the middle of Super Bowl week.

3062
02:19:53,980 --> 02:19:55,100
All eyes on Vegas.

3063
02:19:55,560 --> 02:19:56,780
You know.

3064
02:19:56,900 --> 02:19:57,680
All eyes.

3065
02:19:57,860 --> 02:19:58,380
All eyes.

3066
02:19:58,720 --> 02:20:00,200
That nation looks toward Vegas.

3067
02:20:00,220 --> 02:20:02,000
And I think everybody saw it.

3068
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:02,480
Got it.

3069
02:20:02,740 --> 02:20:04,220
Oh, pro life Spider-Man.

3070
02:20:04,320 --> 02:20:10,240
In no way is the little man's message lost on it in a gigantic.

3071
02:20:10,860 --> 02:20:15,700
On a screen that is showing gigantic ads all day every day.

3072
02:20:16,540 --> 02:20:21,260
Anyway, look, that was all a sidetrack to say, you know, Jason could be a we could talk

3073
02:20:21,260 --> 02:20:22,840
to the Shriver's people and Jason could be Mr.

3074
02:20:22,920 --> 02:20:23,080
Taffy.

3075
02:20:28,940 --> 02:20:31,260
the show and has the demo reel.

3076
02:20:31,620 --> 02:20:32,000
Yes.

3077
02:20:32,280 --> 02:20:34,100
You know, that's the real cash in.

3078
02:20:34,380 --> 02:20:35,660
I do think Miss looking Mr.

3079
02:20:35,820 --> 02:20:39,100
Taffy does make me think you guys need to be partially dressed.

3080
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:40,380
OK, yeah.

3081
02:20:40,660 --> 02:20:43,560
And maybe it's like Mike's wearing a graphic tee with no pants.

3082
02:20:44,080 --> 02:20:46,700
Maybe Jason has a bow tie and a bowler hat, you know.

3083
02:20:46,780 --> 02:20:48,820
And I'm just and I'm just Vizor and no other clothes.

3084
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:50,500
But the classic animal, you have some.

3085
02:20:50,620 --> 02:20:51,340
Maybe Hawaiian shirt.

3086
02:20:51,480 --> 02:20:52,220
Maybe Hawaiian shirt.

3087
02:20:52,260 --> 02:20:55,660
Vizor and Hawaiian shirt or Vizor and shorts or like something.

3088
02:20:55,740 --> 02:20:58,220
But I like that no one has a complete outfit.

3089
02:20:58,400 --> 02:21:03,040
What if we're rats and we call the show Mall Rats?

3090
02:21:07,420 --> 02:21:09,120
I might be able to work out a deal.

3091
02:21:10,120 --> 02:21:12,120
That's why we need is a man on the inside.

3092
02:21:12,460 --> 02:21:13,360
That's why I suggested.

3093
02:21:14,800 --> 02:21:17,440
Are we do we feel like we're we're whined?

3094
02:21:17,740 --> 02:21:18,520
It's not bad.

3095
02:21:18,640 --> 02:21:19,760
Morris is not bad.

3096
02:21:19,880 --> 02:21:20,840
It's not bad.

3097
02:21:20,920 --> 02:21:22,960
It's not what his name on actually make any.

3098
02:21:22,960 --> 02:21:25,860
And it does feel like in the 70s, it's what they would have done.

3099
02:21:25,980 --> 02:21:27,680
How do we make Mall Rats the animated series?

3100
02:21:27,700 --> 02:21:28,920
They literally are rats.

3101
02:21:28,920 --> 02:21:29,400
Yeah, yeah.

3102
02:21:29,400 --> 02:21:29,860
Actually, rats.

3103
02:21:30,320 --> 02:21:30,740
Yeah.

3104
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:32,000
Fuck, that's it.

3105
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:32,660
That might be it.

3106
02:21:32,660 --> 02:21:32,960
All right.

3107
02:21:32,960 --> 02:21:33,620
OK, OK.

3108
02:21:33,700 --> 02:21:34,680
Well, hey, we got it.

3109
02:21:35,320 --> 02:21:38,100
I officially take little I'll take Little Stinker back.

3110
02:21:38,660 --> 02:21:40,880
That's a project and I'd like that to be live action.

3111
02:21:40,980 --> 02:21:41,400
Actually.

3112
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:42,880
All rights have reverted.

3113
02:21:43,260 --> 02:21:44,020
Great to you.

3114
02:21:44,100 --> 02:21:44,560
Yeah, yeah.

3115
02:21:44,780 --> 02:21:44,980
Action.

3116
02:21:45,480 --> 02:21:50,300
And we're going to wait like I want Jason to be in his 50s when we shoot it for real.

3117
02:21:50,700 --> 02:21:52,660
And he's going to be playing a child.

3118
02:21:52,920 --> 02:21:53,340
Wow.

3119
02:21:53,580 --> 02:21:54,780
Like a Clifford.

3120
02:21:54,940 --> 02:21:56,080
Sort of more of a Clifford.

3121
02:21:56,220 --> 02:21:56,640
Yeah.

3122
02:21:56,640 --> 02:22:00,560
Well, like a Clifford, but even older, playing even older.

3123
02:22:02,960 --> 02:22:04,620
Something America loves.

3124
02:22:04,620 --> 02:22:06,460
I bought back the rights to Little Stinker.

3125
02:22:06,780 --> 02:22:12,300
A little more like Mickey Rooney on Eagle Heart, a little more sinister energy just vibrating

3126
02:22:12,300 --> 02:22:12,840
off.

3127
02:22:13,140 --> 02:22:15,240
You play every character on Little Stinker.

3128
02:22:15,340 --> 02:22:16,740
I know we're trying to wind down.

3129
02:22:17,260 --> 02:22:18,580
But what if we wind it up?

3130
02:22:19,220 --> 02:22:22,480
Well, when we were doing.

3131
02:22:22,660 --> 02:22:24,960
I'll go get some tea and come back.

3132
02:22:25,360 --> 02:22:28,900
I need a caffeine boost, but Jason genuinely.

3133
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:29,940
Jason crushed a Red Bull.

3134
02:22:29,940 --> 02:22:30,860
He's ready to go.

3135
02:22:31,080 --> 02:22:31,720
Yeah, really.

3136
02:22:32,120 --> 02:22:36,240
But yes, we did our Curious Case of Benjamin Button episode on Blank Check.

3137
02:22:36,380 --> 02:22:41,680
And that's a movie that had like a 20 year development process as this like Paramount

3138
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:44,960
owned the rights to this short story and no one could crack it and all these key teams.

3139
02:22:45,280 --> 02:22:45,840
Just real quick.

3140
02:22:45,940 --> 02:22:47,320
Are you sure that's not Paramount?

3141
02:22:47,900 --> 02:22:48,420
Paramount?

3142
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:52,200
I know it's spelled differently in the band.

3143
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:59,100
But see, and that one, I actually it's like I knew Paramount from very like a suspiciously

3144
02:22:59,100 --> 02:23:01,700
young like why does that child know about Paramount?

3145
02:23:01,700 --> 02:23:03,660
Dolphin Western Company.

3146
02:23:05,260 --> 02:23:09,620
They own those movies, but not Hanna Barbera.

3147
02:23:10,500 --> 02:23:12,480
That was a licensing deal, grandma.

3148
02:23:14,260 --> 02:23:20,460
We had this big aha moment that one of the versions of Benjamin Button that came close

3149
02:23:20,460 --> 02:23:29,080
to actually happening was, I believe, late 80s, Frank Oz, Martin Short, Benjamin Button.

3150
02:23:29,100 --> 02:23:30,100
Oh, I heard that.

3151
02:23:31,080 --> 02:23:31,640
Oh, yeah.

3152
02:23:32,140 --> 02:23:35,840
And that's really kind of actively happening and then falls apart.

3153
02:23:36,180 --> 02:23:42,200
And I kind of now have to believe that Clifford is like Martin Short's breakup project of

3154
02:23:42,200 --> 02:23:46,960
like I was getting into the idea of like playing a little boy in the wrong clothes.

3155
02:23:52,600 --> 02:23:52,880
Right.

3156
02:23:53,140 --> 02:23:54,520
And it's like the cheaper version.

3157
02:23:54,520 --> 02:23:56,500
There's no supernatural buy in.

3158
02:23:56,760 --> 02:23:59,300
You're just like the James didn't get James Bond version.

3159
02:23:59,300 --> 02:23:59,940
Yes.

3160
02:24:00,360 --> 02:24:00,860
Of Indiana Jones.

3161
02:24:04,180 --> 02:24:05,800
I'm a child in an adult's body.

3162
02:24:06,020 --> 02:24:12,160
It is an interesting movie to think about having a 20 year development process.

3163
02:24:12,580 --> 02:24:19,340
And I'm very curious about like what the if they ever get the Confederacy of Dunces made

3164
02:24:19,340 --> 02:24:22,540
because that's been like so many pairings.

3165
02:24:22,560 --> 02:24:25,540
Also, the Benjamin Button story is like really fucking short.

3166
02:24:25,680 --> 02:24:26,340
It's just an idea.

3167
02:24:26,340 --> 02:24:29,240
It's evocative and people are like, there's got to be a movie here.

3168
02:24:29,380 --> 02:24:29,600
Right.

3169
02:24:29,680 --> 02:24:30,120
It's not.

3170
02:24:30,320 --> 02:24:32,380
There's an impenetrable novel or something.

3171
02:24:32,560 --> 02:24:40,920
And what you end up with is horny old man Benjamin Button, horny old man Brad Pitt.

3172
02:24:40,980 --> 02:24:43,880
If you ask me one of the greatest characters in cinema history.

3173
02:24:44,380 --> 02:24:46,200
It's seven, but I look a lot older.

3174
02:24:48,740 --> 02:24:52,280
Do you feel satisfied with this thought exercise?

3175
02:24:52,300 --> 02:24:53,180
I think huge right.

3176
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:55,060
We kind of landed on something.

3177
02:24:55,060 --> 02:24:55,700
Yeah.

3178
02:24:55,780 --> 02:25:01,480
I feel like I learned things about the dynamic and ourselves and how we come off.

3179
02:25:01,880 --> 02:25:02,960
And yeah, what's that?

3180
02:25:03,240 --> 02:25:04,860
It was kind of secretly.

3181
02:25:04,860 --> 02:25:08,340
I thought one of the reasons this was the idea.

3182
02:25:08,340 --> 02:25:12,880
I thought there was a nice kind of like opportunity to analyze the dynamic.

3183
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:18,140
Not a way of dissecting the frog, but really learning to appreciate what is the pieces

3184
02:25:18,140 --> 02:25:18,560
of the frog.

3185
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:21,520
We went off mic for a second, a little bathroom break.

3186
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:22,120
Oh, yeah.

3187
02:25:22,160 --> 02:25:22,600
Yeah.

3188
02:25:22,600 --> 02:25:26,120
And there became a very real conversation about like, you know what?

3189
02:25:26,200 --> 02:25:29,180
The podcast wouldn't be the same if it was just any two of us.

3190
02:25:32,520 --> 02:25:33,240
I did appreciate it.

3191
02:25:33,260 --> 02:25:34,580
I feel like you did like.

3192
02:25:34,580 --> 02:25:39,620
Like maybe there's a little therapy session, little idea generation.

3193
02:25:40,220 --> 02:25:45,240
I do sense you maybe from afar because you'll check in, you'll chime in with thoughts on

3194
02:25:45,240 --> 02:25:48,960
episodes and then all the way up to something like Frank Marshall wanting to like open it

3195
02:25:48,960 --> 02:25:49,560
up more.

3196
02:25:49,960 --> 02:25:51,180
It does feel like you were like.

3197
02:25:51,180 --> 02:25:52,780
There's a good conversation happening here.

3198
02:25:52,780 --> 02:25:53,840
Let's stay in this.

3199
02:25:53,880 --> 02:25:54,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3200
02:25:54,460 --> 02:25:54,760
Yes.

3201
02:25:54,760 --> 02:26:00,040
You want like you want to get in here, conduct traffic flow and see what happens, which I

3202
02:26:00,040 --> 02:26:01,420
find I'm always I'm game for.

3203
02:26:01,700 --> 02:26:02,660
I find that interesting.

3204
02:26:02,820 --> 02:26:06,780
And during the bathroom break, I saw the bathroom was out of toilet paper and I was like, I

3205
02:26:06,780 --> 02:26:08,580
bet I know where the supplies are kept.

3206
02:26:08,620 --> 02:26:10,020
I can solve this problem.

3207
02:26:10,060 --> 02:26:11,100
I can fix it.

3208
02:26:11,100 --> 02:26:11,660
That's an episode.

3209
02:26:11,660 --> 02:26:16,320
And I ran to the closet and I ripped open the Costco packaged toilet paper, put a few

3210
02:26:16,320 --> 02:26:17,240
rolls in the bathroom.

3211
02:26:17,340 --> 02:26:17,980
What kind of plot?

3212
02:26:18,100 --> 02:26:18,720
What was it?

3213
02:26:18,720 --> 02:26:21,160
It was just a standard bath tissues.

3214
02:26:21,160 --> 02:26:22,820
What are you normally buying?

3215
02:26:23,560 --> 02:26:25,980
I'm usually buying whatever's on sale.

3216
02:26:26,100 --> 02:26:27,760
OK, so you don't have like you're not.

3217
02:26:27,860 --> 02:26:29,240
I don't really have a preference on that.

3218
02:26:29,260 --> 02:26:32,120
You don't have a brand where you have a certain toilet paper as a kid.

3219
02:26:32,420 --> 02:26:33,220
Like is it a family choice?

3220
02:26:33,220 --> 02:26:36,560
I feel like we had a lot of blue and pink toilet paper growing up.

3221
02:26:36,800 --> 02:26:38,500
Do you remember the era of colored toilet paper?

3222
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:40,720
I do remember the era of colored toilet paper.

3223
02:26:40,820 --> 02:26:41,380
To match the bathroom decor.

3224
02:26:42,040 --> 02:26:42,840
That was the most.

3225
02:26:42,860 --> 02:26:43,280
You don't see that as much.

3226
02:26:43,280 --> 02:26:46,600
Can you reproduce the way you have to hold on to the way you said bathroom because it

3227
02:26:46,600 --> 02:26:47,040
wasn't bathroom.

3228
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:47,800
It was bathroom.

3229
02:26:48,640 --> 02:26:49,120
Bathroom.

3230
02:26:49,800 --> 02:26:51,000
I don't think anyone has that luscious.

3231
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,420
Well you got to put a little mustard on it.

3232
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:57,920
No one can do an impression of Jason.

3233
02:26:58,300 --> 02:27:02,260
No, no you can get like the vibe but I've never been able to do like a really good impression.

3234
02:27:02,280 --> 02:27:03,160
It's representative.

3235
02:27:03,380 --> 02:27:04,600
It never sounds correct.

3236
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:05,080
Yeah.

3237
02:27:05,400 --> 02:27:06,260
No, not accurate.

3238
02:27:06,460 --> 02:27:10,460
I've heard both of you guys relay like Jason said a really funny thing the other day and

3239
02:27:10,460 --> 02:27:12,360
you just do a different type of voice.

3240
02:27:12,360 --> 02:27:13,360
Yeah, I can't.

3241
02:27:13,480 --> 02:27:14,520
You're giving me enough that I can imagine it.

3242
02:27:14,520 --> 02:27:15,120
I see what you're doing.

3243
02:27:15,360 --> 02:27:16,520
There's an energy but it's not.

3244
02:27:16,520 --> 02:27:20,540
But there's no fucking sound alike who's going to take this part away from you.

3245
02:27:20,540 --> 02:27:21,560
I love it.

3246
02:27:21,560 --> 02:27:22,580
I love it.

3247
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:23,240
Maybe I should.

3248
02:27:23,460 --> 02:27:25,140
I guess I've never really sat down and done.

3249
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:29,160
Not that that's how I do impressions but stuff usually just comes easily or it doesn't.

3250
02:27:29,300 --> 02:27:32,160
But not that I'm good at impressions I'm just saying but gruff comes fairly easily is all

3251
02:27:32,160 --> 02:27:32,440
I'm saying.

3252
02:27:33,440 --> 02:27:36,200
But Jason's more of like the, you never heard about that huh?

3253
02:27:36,280 --> 02:27:37,320
Like it's just a folksy.

3254
02:27:37,420 --> 02:27:37,860
I got to do this.

3255
02:27:38,220 --> 02:27:40,660
But you know what you're doing right now it captures a quality but it's not.

3256
02:27:40,660 --> 02:27:41,600
Yeah, it's not what it is.

3257
02:27:41,940 --> 02:27:46,120
Because I remember before we started doing the show you would sometimes do an impression

3258
02:27:46,120 --> 02:27:50,180
of Jason and you would sometimes do an impression of Jeff Garland and they were the same.

3259
02:27:50,520 --> 02:27:50,880
Really?

3260
02:27:51,320 --> 02:27:52,000
Yes, absolutely.

3261
02:27:52,220 --> 02:27:56,080
And once I got to know Jason better because I feel like I knew Jason from stories a little

3262
02:27:56,080 --> 02:27:57,780
more first even though we'd run into each other.

3263
02:27:57,900 --> 02:28:00,840
But then I hear some stories and then I met him and I'm like there's not any we aren't

3264
02:28:00,840 --> 02:28:01,880
even in the ballpark.

3265
02:28:05,900 --> 02:28:06,760
Swing out of me.

3266
02:28:08,060 --> 02:28:08,820
I don't remember.

3267
02:28:08,820 --> 02:28:09,920
I don't think I've ever brought that up.

3268
02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:13,400
Did I have much more energy back then and I just got too excited when talking about it

3269
02:28:13,400 --> 02:28:15,500
because I feel like these days that wouldn't be the case.

3270
02:28:15,500 --> 02:28:16,880
I wouldn't have the same voice.

3271
02:28:17,240 --> 02:28:18,360
But maybe back then.

3272
02:28:18,360 --> 02:28:19,220
At least at the time.

3273
02:28:19,320 --> 02:28:20,100
Yeah, I think you hadn't.

3274
02:28:20,160 --> 02:28:21,540
But that happens to me too.

3275
02:28:21,640 --> 02:28:25,420
I'll like fold like I you only have like three impression avenues.

3276
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:27,020
Yeah, sure.

3277
02:28:27,280 --> 02:28:28,280
One falls into the other.

3278
02:28:28,340 --> 02:28:34,480
Mike did just text me the link to Eternals Kingo Funko Pop not mint.

3279
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:36,980
Specifically the boxes are not mint.

3280
02:28:37,400 --> 02:28:40,020
For a while you were sending me videos of your son playing with the Kingos.

3281
02:28:40,560 --> 02:28:44,980
And the one that was the best was he had a garbage truck.

3282
02:28:46,500 --> 02:28:48,300
And it was picking up Kingos.

3283
02:28:48,620 --> 02:28:52,320
He had little plastic garbage cans filled with Kingos and the truck is picking them

3284
02:28:52,320 --> 02:28:56,580
up and dumping them into the back and then the camera panned across to the front seat

3285
02:28:56,580 --> 02:28:59,980
and the garbage truck is being driven by a different Kingo.

3286
02:29:01,780 --> 02:29:04,220
It's like a society where everyone's a Kingo.

3287
02:29:04,240 --> 02:29:07,620
Lately it's been a dump truck and it's just he puts all the Kingos.

3288
02:29:07,620 --> 02:29:10,220
It's like one of the most bulk items we have in the house.

3289
02:29:10,220 --> 02:29:14,140
So it's filled the role of like, OK, I think kids do just want a bunch of things that could

3290
02:29:14,140 --> 02:29:14,740
be Lego blocks.

3291
02:29:14,760 --> 02:29:15,940
In this case, it's Kingos.

3292
02:29:16,020 --> 02:29:20,400
He'll take all the Kingos, put them in a trash truck and then just dump them out into a pile

3293
02:29:20,860 --> 02:29:22,900
and put them back in, which I don't know.

3294
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:28,140
That's literally what would have happened to the Kingos if you hadn't given them as

3295
02:29:28,140 --> 02:29:28,240
a gift.

3296
02:29:28,780 --> 02:29:31,920
He's also he's going to grow up like Jason saying to friends like, you remember when

3297
02:29:31,920 --> 02:29:33,660
you were growing up and playing with your Kingos?

3298
02:29:33,660 --> 02:29:36,500
Yeah, I'll have this very specific.

3299
02:29:36,540 --> 02:29:38,780
And then future me, a version of his dad going, what?

3300
02:29:38,820 --> 02:29:39,620
What was that?

3301
02:29:39,860 --> 02:29:42,020
No, I didn't have a Kingo growing up.

3302
02:29:42,980 --> 02:29:44,720
This is loop that I've created.

3303
02:29:45,720 --> 02:29:48,220
We didn't all grow up with 20 Kingos at the home.

3304
02:29:49,180 --> 02:29:52,820
Well, if you feel satisfied with this thought exercise, I think this was you.

3305
02:29:53,300 --> 02:29:55,440
Yeah, you know, and I think it shined a light on some things.

3306
02:29:55,580 --> 02:29:56,660
I really enjoyed it.

3307
02:29:56,760 --> 02:30:01,740
And just before we wind it down, because I want you to this is your this is your shot

3308
02:30:01,740 --> 02:30:03,600
in the Club 3 throne.

3309
02:30:04,160 --> 02:30:05,420
And I want, well, a couple of things.

3310
02:30:05,820 --> 02:30:09,480
I want you to be able to wield your power however you want to.

3311
02:30:09,480 --> 02:30:10,200
Whatever you want to.

3312
02:30:10,300 --> 02:30:11,940
I wanted to wield it responsibly.

3313
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:17,460
I want to do something that I felt like would be a celebration, a gift to the community.

3314
02:30:18,200 --> 02:30:20,620
Yeah, a gift, perhaps to the art of animation.

3315
02:30:21,340 --> 02:30:22,220
Well, yeah, sure.

3316
02:30:22,220 --> 02:30:22,580
That's true.

3317
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:25,540
But I'm there's another gift that I'm heading for.

3318
02:30:25,780 --> 02:30:27,340
And it's also you know, it's kind of a look.

3319
02:30:27,460 --> 02:30:29,400
This is a big, long episode that we did here.

3320
02:30:29,540 --> 02:30:30,620
We're happy you're in town.

3321
02:30:30,620 --> 02:30:32,780
That's when you know, that's when you want to you want to throw down.

3322
02:30:32,900 --> 02:30:34,720
You want to bust out the good stuff.

3323
02:30:35,400 --> 02:30:38,900
Griffin, take a look at that that bag at your feet right there.

3324
02:30:39,420 --> 02:30:40,820
What do you what do you see in that bag?

3325
02:30:40,920 --> 02:30:41,940
I hear the clink.

3326
02:30:41,960 --> 02:30:43,540
The clink of the bag.

3327
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:44,400
Is it in fact?

3328
02:30:44,400 --> 02:30:44,980
Read the label.

3329
02:30:45,300 --> 02:30:49,420
Can it be Taffers Brown Butter Bourbon?

3330
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:50,120
Wow.

3331
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:54,620
This is a bottle of Taffers Brown Butter Bourbon.

3332
02:30:54,760 --> 02:30:57,940
John Taffers Whiskey, which is only available in two states.

3333
02:30:58,040 --> 02:30:59,660
One of those is Nevada.

3334
02:30:59,660 --> 02:31:02,820
We were all in Nevada over the summer.

3335
02:31:02,820 --> 02:31:06,980
And I took a minute to go to find a location where this was available.

3336
02:31:07,500 --> 02:31:11,440
And then some I think I let you know this, Griffin, as a just like here's

3337
02:31:11,440 --> 02:31:13,240
a little thing that I'm going to spring at some point.

3338
02:31:13,240 --> 02:31:16,900
And you said, can you save it for when I'm around?

3339
02:31:17,600 --> 02:31:23,960
And some of that being that I believe you have a special club three

3340
02:31:23,960 --> 02:31:25,840
guest pronouncements to make.

3341
02:31:27,100 --> 02:31:29,100
I have a special club three guest pronouncements to make.

3342
02:31:29,100 --> 02:31:31,020
Now I'm trying to remember what we teed up here.

3343
02:31:31,480 --> 02:31:34,840
The well, the look, you know, that that bottle.

3344
02:31:35,060 --> 02:31:35,280
Yes.

3345
02:31:35,460 --> 02:31:37,060
That's here for a specific reason.

3346
02:31:37,300 --> 02:31:39,200
Taffers happening on main feed.

3347
02:31:39,360 --> 02:31:40,000
Is that what you're saying?

3348
02:31:40,240 --> 02:31:41,060
That's what I'm saying.

3349
02:31:41,100 --> 02:31:41,760
That's what I'm saying.

3350
02:31:42,040 --> 02:31:43,040
Well, what did he just say?

3351
02:31:43,220 --> 02:31:43,520
Hang on.

3352
02:31:43,520 --> 02:31:44,580
Can you repeat that again?

3353
02:31:44,940 --> 02:31:48,820
The last vestiges of my power granted to me by Club Three votes,

3354
02:31:48,980 --> 02:31:54,060
I am passing into law that Taffer one.

3355
02:31:54,060 --> 02:31:57,680
Will be a main feed episode.

3356
02:31:58,260 --> 02:31:58,820
Wow.

3357
02:31:58,820 --> 02:32:00,280
Coming in 2024.

3358
02:32:00,560 --> 02:32:05,600
Bar rescue and John Taffer, which kicked around several club three polls

3359
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:08,120
will not be limited to club three.

3360
02:32:08,400 --> 02:32:09,500
Taffer one.

3361
02:32:09,640 --> 02:32:11,240
Main first episode.

3362
02:32:12,220 --> 02:32:15,160
I mean, look, I guys, I'm sure you don't want to do this.

3363
02:32:15,220 --> 02:32:16,280
I don't want to do it.

3364
02:32:16,520 --> 02:32:17,440
But he's got power.

3365
02:32:17,660 --> 02:32:18,660
He's Griffin has the power.

3366
02:32:18,660 --> 02:32:19,980
I'm mad with power.

3367
02:32:20,980 --> 02:32:22,720
And Taffer one has in fact been.

3368
02:32:23,360 --> 02:32:23,880
Wow.

3369
02:32:24,580 --> 02:32:24,900
All right.

3370
02:32:25,060 --> 02:32:29,720
Well, so Taffer one not coming to the club three elites.

3371
02:32:29,720 --> 02:32:31,660
That will be for all to enjoy.

3372
02:32:31,660 --> 02:32:33,500
This is a public service.

3373
02:32:33,940 --> 02:32:34,680
Taffer one.

3374
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:35,240
Wow.

3375
02:32:35,360 --> 02:32:35,720
Wow.

3376
02:32:35,880 --> 02:32:38,920
Well, let's celebrate by opening up this bottle.

3377
02:32:39,180 --> 02:32:42,340
Although this this little thing has been planned for a little while.

3378
02:32:42,640 --> 02:32:45,360
Do you notice anything else on just turn it around to the other side?

3379
02:32:45,420 --> 02:32:47,340
Do you notice anything up above the label?

3380
02:32:47,840 --> 02:32:48,640
Above the label?

3381
02:32:48,740 --> 02:32:49,480
No, no, no, not there.

3382
02:32:49,520 --> 02:32:50,840
Just like on the like.

3383
02:32:50,840 --> 02:32:52,360
What I'm saying is

3384
02:32:53,020 --> 02:32:55,560
there's something like dripping down from it.

3385
02:32:55,560 --> 02:32:57,280
But on the other side, look at the other side.

3386
02:32:57,620 --> 02:32:58,480
Here's what happened.

3387
02:32:59,420 --> 02:33:01,740
When listeners who were at the groove blender

3388
02:33:01,740 --> 02:33:05,600
who came to our Vegas show, they know that it was extremely hot.

3389
02:33:05,840 --> 02:33:06,640
Could not have been more hot.

3390
02:33:07,160 --> 02:33:11,000
I forgot to take the bottle out of the car for one night

3391
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,060
for probably not even 12 hours.

3392
02:33:13,620 --> 02:33:16,980
And it stayed in the car, not in a covered parking garage.

3393
02:33:16,980 --> 02:33:22,280
And that was enough to make like some little mild explosion

3394
02:33:22,280 --> 02:33:23,360
happen in the bottle.

3395
02:33:24,040 --> 02:33:25,700
Now something is dripping out the top.

3396
02:33:26,100 --> 02:33:30,360
So it's probably in question whether we should actually drink this bottle

3397
02:33:30,360 --> 02:33:31,640
of Defferts Brown Butter.

3398
02:33:32,060 --> 02:33:32,060
Interesting.

3399
02:33:32,500 --> 02:33:33,460
You think we do it anyway?

3400
02:33:33,580 --> 02:33:34,020
I do.

3401
02:33:34,320 --> 02:33:36,620
It's also I was confused when you were trying to tell me

3402
02:33:36,620 --> 02:33:40,740
where to look, because the label design is like covered with splotches.

3403
02:33:40,780 --> 02:33:42,760
Oh, it's already a splats and drips.

3404
02:33:42,780 --> 02:33:46,100
It basically consciously is replicating the look of a print error.

3405
02:33:46,640 --> 02:33:48,580
Some of it is above the text.

3406
02:33:48,720 --> 02:33:53,080
Yeah, apparently it also has notes of vanilla and toffee.

3407
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:53,960
Yeah, that's what it is.

3408
02:33:54,060 --> 02:33:55,560
That's what that brown butter is about.

3409
02:33:55,560 --> 02:34:00,440
A full fruity body to bring to life true liquid decadence.

3410
02:34:03,140 --> 02:34:04,180
Liquid decadence!

3411
02:34:04,720 --> 02:34:08,180
Your bar is failing because it doesn't provide liquid decadence.

3412
02:34:08,400 --> 02:34:11,740
I'll say this was another like side text pitch

3413
02:34:11,740 --> 02:34:15,740
Scott and I had at one point, which was not tell you two

3414
02:34:15,740 --> 02:34:17,760
that I was going to be in town.

3415
02:34:18,600 --> 02:34:20,840
Scott tells me when a recording is happening,

3416
02:34:21,220 --> 02:34:25,180
you have a fake subject like the Minotaur's returning episode.

3417
02:34:25,180 --> 02:34:26,540
It's been happening a bunch lately.

3418
02:34:26,880 --> 02:34:29,400
You do the first five minutes of setup and then I just storm

3419
02:34:29,400 --> 02:34:32,720
into the studio with the ball and go, I'm shutting this down!

3420
02:34:35,080 --> 02:34:37,320
Wait, fuck, I didn't realize that was part of that.

3421
02:34:37,340 --> 02:34:38,260
I wish we'd done that.

3422
02:34:38,280 --> 02:34:40,780
We've chosen this is the better move to pass it into law.

3423
02:34:40,980 --> 02:34:45,300
Well, the main reason to not do that was I thought they deserved a chance to do.

3424
02:34:45,300 --> 02:34:46,200
That was the real reason.

3425
02:34:46,200 --> 02:34:46,860
The Taffer research.

3426
02:34:46,880 --> 02:34:48,940
Everyone should be able to do their own Taffer research.

3427
02:34:48,940 --> 02:34:49,720
To the main feed listeners.

3428
02:34:49,840 --> 02:34:51,240
OK, should I try opening this?

3429
02:34:51,340 --> 02:34:52,180
If you want.

3430
02:34:52,520 --> 02:34:56,180
I, you know, here's I was I had this whole plan and then Aaron said,

3431
02:34:56,320 --> 02:34:59,660
wait, you're just going to give them the bottle, even though it kind of exploded,

3432
02:34:59,920 --> 02:35:03,140
which then led to both of us going, you are going to give them the bottle.

3433
02:35:03,560 --> 02:35:06,220
It's like it was in a hot car in Las Vegas.

3434
02:35:06,620 --> 02:35:08,760
You are going to feed that to your guest.

3435
02:35:09,360 --> 02:35:10,960
Shut this podcast down.

3436
02:35:11,600 --> 02:35:11,980
Car.

3437
02:35:12,560 --> 02:35:16,500
I don't quite know the mechanics.

3438
02:35:17,300 --> 02:35:18,680
How's something with leak?

3439
02:35:18,940 --> 02:35:20,860
I don't because it appears to be leaking.

3440
02:35:20,920 --> 02:35:21,760
What are you talking about?

3441
02:35:21,800 --> 02:35:22,500
It is sealed.

3442
02:35:22,660 --> 02:35:23,600
It isn't unopened.

3443
02:35:23,780 --> 02:35:26,160
I wear leaking from it from the top.

3444
02:35:26,500 --> 02:35:29,860
And there's like you can sort of see there's like residue up towards the label.

3445
02:35:29,860 --> 02:35:32,520
Was it like on its side and like it absorbed?

3446
02:35:32,800 --> 02:35:33,560
I have no idea.

3447
02:35:33,560 --> 02:35:37,560
I think it was some amount of this sort of like plastic safety label

3448
02:35:37,560 --> 02:35:41,040
or this rubber stopper stopper.

3449
02:35:41,120 --> 02:35:43,180
Like rubber melted outside.

3450
02:35:43,820 --> 02:35:43,820
Yeah.

3451
02:35:43,880 --> 02:35:46,900
Do we think that a less decadent drink wouldn't have had an effect?

3452
02:35:47,300 --> 02:35:48,140
Well, I think that's absolutely true.

3453
02:35:48,180 --> 02:35:51,920
What I'm thinking for certain is if you left this in a car for a day,

3454
02:35:52,360 --> 02:35:54,620
that butter sounded more brown than ever.

3455
02:35:56,260 --> 02:35:57,780
Well, we'll find out.

3456
02:35:57,940 --> 02:36:01,020
And maybe I shouldn't be so quick to say, oh, boy,

3457
02:36:01,740 --> 02:36:04,840
that was a live reaction to the smell around a swig.

3458
02:36:04,880 --> 02:36:05,480
Oh, I don't know.

3459
02:36:05,540 --> 02:36:06,860
Well, maybe it's not swigs.

3460
02:36:06,860 --> 02:36:08,780
Yeah, we'll wait till off air.

3461
02:36:08,820 --> 02:36:09,960
Nobody wants to hear drinking anyway.

3462
02:36:10,120 --> 02:36:12,900
But so I'm going to do one on Mike as you're wrapping up,

3463
02:36:12,980 --> 02:36:14,200
just so we get a live reaction.

3464
02:36:14,240 --> 02:36:15,700
I think the listeners deserve this.

3465
02:36:15,700 --> 02:36:16,280
OK, OK.

3466
02:36:16,280 --> 02:36:16,780
Oh, yeah.

3467
02:36:16,880 --> 02:36:18,900
You've been all over the place recently.

3468
02:36:19,140 --> 02:36:20,380
Do we got a cup or anything?

3469
02:36:20,540 --> 02:36:21,380
Is there anything in here?

3470
02:36:21,480 --> 02:36:22,860
Oh, wait, let's just use your tea cup.

3471
02:36:23,540 --> 02:36:23,980
Oh, yeah.

3472
02:36:23,980 --> 02:36:24,200
Wait.

3473
02:36:24,340 --> 02:36:24,540
OK.

3474
02:36:24,840 --> 02:36:24,840
OK.

3475
02:36:24,860 --> 02:36:28,660
Well, then let me I'll I'll just say maybe this won't be accurate

3476
02:36:28,660 --> 02:36:30,960
if we drink this this bubbly brown.

3477
02:36:31,200 --> 02:36:35,560
But as far as I know, Griffin Newman, you survived Club Three.

3478
02:36:35,560 --> 02:36:37,300
Griffin Newman does whatever he wants.

3479
02:36:37,480 --> 02:36:39,360
Thank you for taking us through

3480
02:36:40,060 --> 02:36:43,080
an examination of an animated series and ourselves.

3481
02:36:44,320 --> 02:36:46,360
Let's I don't know, extra the gift shopping you unplug.

3482
02:36:47,280 --> 02:36:51,200
No, I look, I want to I want to thank all Club Three subscribers

3483
02:36:51,200 --> 02:36:52,800
for imbuing me with this power.

3484
02:36:52,820 --> 02:36:54,320
I tried to wield it responsibly.

3485
02:36:54,380 --> 02:36:56,420
I think we went on a fun journey today.

3486
02:36:57,820 --> 02:36:59,040
Blank Check is my podcast.

3487
02:36:59,220 --> 02:37:03,000
We're doing John McTiernan right now who's got a wild career.

3488
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,500
He is the first person we've ever covered.

3489
02:37:05,740 --> 02:37:10,300
My joke, I've been repeating who went to both movie jail and federal prison.

3490
02:37:11,460 --> 02:37:13,020
That can't be right.

3491
02:37:13,460 --> 02:37:13,900
I.

3492
02:37:14,980 --> 02:37:15,360
Hmm.

3493
02:37:16,320 --> 02:37:17,960
The first person we've covered at the very.

3494
02:37:18,100 --> 02:37:18,660
Oh, yeah.

3495
02:37:18,880 --> 02:37:19,160
Yes.

3496
02:37:19,360 --> 02:37:20,280
And our own chronology.

3497
02:37:20,480 --> 02:37:24,020
You haven't done a Tim Allen miniseries.

3498
02:37:24,060 --> 02:37:24,780
Haven't done that.

3499
02:37:24,840 --> 02:37:26,060
He did direct one film.

3500
02:37:26,360 --> 02:37:26,660
Did he?

3501
02:37:26,760 --> 02:37:29,340
Yeah, we did Santa Claus trilogy on Patreon.

3502
02:37:29,560 --> 02:37:30,600
Oh, so you have done the Santa Claus.

3503
02:37:30,600 --> 02:37:31,220
We have.

3504
02:37:31,320 --> 02:37:32,500
And the Toy Story movies.

3505
02:37:32,500 --> 02:37:33,720
He directed one film.

3506
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:34,840
I'm forgetting the name of it.

3507
02:37:35,480 --> 02:37:40,820
There's the guy who the director of Bottle Shock in the CBGB's movie,

3508
02:37:40,820 --> 02:37:44,180
who was also responsible for that production where the woman got hit by the train.

3509
02:37:44,420 --> 02:37:47,600
Oh, because they were filming on live train tracks without a permit.

3510
02:37:47,600 --> 02:37:49,140
Oh, from a few years ago.

3511
02:37:49,180 --> 02:37:49,560
Yeah.

3512
02:37:49,760 --> 02:37:52,440
That guy served time in federal prison.

3513
02:37:52,600 --> 02:37:53,880
Anyway, that's not what this is about.

3514
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,780
John McTiernan made good movies before he went to jail

3515
02:37:56,780 --> 02:38:01,900
and he went to jail for a victimless white collar espionage crimes.

3516
02:38:01,900 --> 02:38:02,580
Basically.

3517
02:38:02,580 --> 02:38:03,060
Oh, yeah.

3518
02:38:03,060 --> 02:38:06,120
I've always been confused, but I look forward to hearing you.

3519
02:38:06,120 --> 02:38:08,440
I would say not really harm anyone.

3520
02:38:08,620 --> 02:38:09,060
OK.

3521
02:38:10,120 --> 02:38:12,040
Masters of the Universe Revolution.

3522
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:13,040
Mm hmm.

3523
02:38:13,900 --> 02:38:17,940
Now on Netflix, five episodes of showrun by the great Kevin Smith,

3524
02:38:18,860 --> 02:38:21,420
soon to be licensing out the name sugar.

3525
02:38:21,600 --> 02:38:21,900
Yeah, right.

3526
02:38:22,020 --> 02:38:22,820
That's what we're going to get.

3527
02:38:23,560 --> 02:38:28,440
And I will say, I think I've told Mike and Scott about this, not to call a shot.

3528
02:38:28,440 --> 02:38:31,640
There is a Kevin Smith related surprise

3529
02:38:31,640 --> 02:38:37,080
for this podcast that I have had in the works for over a year.

3530
02:38:37,240 --> 02:38:37,660
What?

3531
02:38:37,940 --> 02:38:42,760
And circumstance and timing has failed to make it happen.

3532
02:38:43,620 --> 02:38:47,200
On the right timetable to be able to do it in studio for any of the times

3533
02:38:47,200 --> 02:38:47,800
we've recorded.

3534
02:38:47,820 --> 02:38:49,000
Did you tell me about that?

3535
02:38:49,140 --> 02:38:49,600
I think I did.

3536
02:38:49,680 --> 02:38:50,700
I can remind you matter now.

3537
02:38:50,720 --> 02:38:51,980
But there is there.

3538
02:38:52,220 --> 02:38:52,580
There is.

3539
02:38:52,760 --> 02:38:54,320
Or maybe I give you vague shapes of it.

3540
02:38:54,320 --> 02:38:55,280
I don't know if you even remember.

3541
02:38:55,400 --> 02:38:55,820
I know this.

3542
02:38:56,120 --> 02:38:56,940
Yeah, I know.

3543
02:38:56,940 --> 02:38:58,420
It will happen, though.

3544
02:38:58,420 --> 02:38:58,740
OK.

3545
02:38:58,740 --> 02:39:01,580
Calling a shot much like Taffer one on main feed.

3546
02:39:02,160 --> 02:39:04,740
Well, here we'll take this shot while I while I wind it down.

3547
02:39:05,220 --> 02:39:07,920
You survived podcast, the ride club three.

3548
02:39:08,140 --> 02:39:08,800
Thanks for subscribing.

3549
02:39:08,940 --> 02:39:10,420
Your bravery saved the podcast.

3550
02:39:10,580 --> 02:39:11,720
Well done, freedom fighters.

3551
02:39:12,140 --> 02:39:14,840
Pitch topics for the next poll, whenever that may be.

3552
02:39:14,940 --> 02:39:15,540
Mass magician.

3553
02:39:15,780 --> 02:39:16,600
Good luck to you.

3554
02:39:16,820 --> 02:39:20,200
And let's go to Griffin for his browned butter reaction.

3555
02:39:20,640 --> 02:39:21,120
Browned.

3556
02:39:21,300 --> 02:39:22,520
How browned are you?

3557
02:39:22,660 --> 02:39:25,980
It is it is like one of the sweetest things I've ever tasted.

3558
02:39:27,480 --> 02:39:29,460
Jason, my mother are coming up.

3559
02:39:29,540 --> 02:39:29,820
I am.

3560
02:39:29,820 --> 02:39:30,560
I'm curious.

3561
02:39:30,840 --> 02:39:31,520
I have to follow.

3562
02:39:31,560 --> 02:39:32,380
I'm not kidding.

3563
02:39:32,440 --> 02:39:33,760
I can like taste the butter.

3564
02:39:33,860 --> 02:39:34,620
It's not like.

3565
02:39:36,220 --> 02:39:36,840
It doesn't.

3566
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:37,660
It's not what I want.

3567
02:39:37,860 --> 02:39:39,360
I would taste like cinnamon butter.

3568
02:39:39,420 --> 02:39:41,400
Why is it only carried in two states?

3569
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:43,300
It's a good question.

3570
02:39:43,640 --> 02:39:45,220
Why is that going nationwide?

3571
02:39:45,860 --> 02:39:47,520
Are people going mad for butter?

3572
02:39:48,260 --> 02:39:51,600
Why haven't the taverns tavern open up everywhere?

3573
02:39:51,760 --> 02:39:55,080
My prediction is two out of the three hosts of this podcast

3574
02:39:55,080 --> 02:39:56,460
will enjoy the taste of it.

3575
02:39:56,520 --> 02:39:57,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3576
02:39:57,320 --> 02:40:00,100
And the third one will be absolutely repulsed.

3577
02:40:00,760 --> 02:40:03,340
Well, that would be very in keeping with our characters.

3578
02:40:03,700 --> 02:40:03,760
Yes.

3579
02:40:04,520 --> 02:40:04,520
Yes.

3580
02:40:05,360 --> 02:40:05,600
Goodbye.
