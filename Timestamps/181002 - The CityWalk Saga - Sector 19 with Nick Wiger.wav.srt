1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Forever...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Dog!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
When your town has let you down

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
When your porch has fallen short

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
When you're too worn out to run

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And need some ribs or a Cinnabon

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You need a place, a place for rock

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A place for roll, a place where Oakland Raiders merch is sold

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
A sublime hot topic and billabong

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A place where you can purchase a candy thong

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So let's go take a walk

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's all go to City Walk

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Tonight, tonight

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The Saga Finale

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We're there!

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We're gonna get through all 19 sectors

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Now available on our T-Public store

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
A t-shirt, I survived the City Walk Saga

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Go to our T-Public

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The award you have is to buy a shirt from us

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Is to buy a shirt on sale, like all T-Public shirts

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
New design launched, on sale for a few days

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Also, I believe, classic I survived podcast array too

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh yes, that also, a new shirt

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
On the show in general, hey we have a T-Public store

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's the big overall news

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And some of you have already bought shirts

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And we've seen them and we're so happy you're getting them

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But a new line, the survived line

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But I want to institute a strict moral code here

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
An honor system, you may only buy the shirt

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You may only get the reward of giving us money

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If you actually did listen to all 19

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Imagine the shame somebody would have to feel if they wore that shirt as a lie

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yeah, this is like if you were to go to Disney and the gift shop

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You were not allowed in it unless you truly went on the ride

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Which I honestly kind of think it should be enforced that way

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Well there is merchandise that only annual pass holders can buy

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So think about it like that

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
A little bit, I'm just saying you gotta go with the experience though

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You can't get any, you know

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We would like if people would tweet at us

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Screenshots that show listened to and the dates

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That would be good

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Show the timecode and that you made it all the way through

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And then you may purchase merchandise from us

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And also tweet at us pictures of you enjoying anything you've gotten from us

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Again you can click the link in the description of this episode to go to the T-Public store

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay good, that question

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yes, it's in the metadata

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The description, depending on your podcatcher

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
There's a link in there, you can click that

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And we appreciate it

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And then we have a little tantalizing tease without saying too much

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I think here's the big way that the City Walk Saga has affected us, the podcast, the Ride Boys

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Is that we now have a taste for doing far more content than should be legal in this country

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We are, we're just thirsting to ramble about more topics deeper than Theme Park World

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And that is why we are proud to announce here today in the grand finale that at the end of this month

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We will be cutting the ribbon on Podcast the Ride, the Second Gate

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Ground is being broken as we speak

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This right now is the groundbreaking ceremony

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's a whole new world of bullshit to explore

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So we're talking about Patreon exclusive content

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's correct

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Just in case people don't know what Second Gate means

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Because there's probably people that may not know

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
They're not insiders like we are with the Theme Park terminology

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's an industry term, that's what happens when a park opens

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
A second park next year

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah, so they call it a second gate

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And the gate is where you...

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is, it's like California Adventure to Disneyland, but we got to it way quicker

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And it is going to be way better out of the gate

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This isn't like cheapo original California Adventure

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is a top tier e-ticket experience

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And all you need to do is purchase a Patreon park hopper pass

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And then you may enter a fantastic world

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
With hundreds of new digital acres of discussion

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Of rides and hotels and treats and all of the things

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
A lot of the things we've been talking about, specific characters

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
There are robots that literally have no backstory that we would like to talk about for an hour and a half

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We have a lot of fun stuff to talk about

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
There are alien robots that we're obsessed with and we'd like to talk about

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That's all we'll say

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
There's a lot of fun coming, we won't explain everything yet

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But this is the groundbreaking ceremony

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We're all inserting pantomime shovels into your floor, Mike

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And will be a fun way to kick off our one year anniversary too

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yeah, we're heading to the one year anniversary

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
There's a lot of stuff going on

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But let's get to the thing that is happening right now

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Our guest is here

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You know him as the guy who all podcasters rip off their business model from

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Ladies and gentlemen from Doughboys

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Returning to the show, Nick Weiger is here

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Hey man

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Guys, thrilled to be back

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm so excited about Podcast The Ride getting its own Surfers Cove

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Which as we know is the water park that's next to Legoland

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Of course, all the surfers

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah, so I mean, I think we're all waiting for it to happen

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It finally is here

104
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I was actually honestly I'm like a little deflated

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Because I was going to come on here and I was going to castigate you guys

106
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
For releasing 19 bonus episodes for free

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And not figuring out that this was something that you could monetize

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Especially with the enthusiast fan base that you have

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But I'm glad that you're doing this because this is like

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
In addition to because you guys put a lot of work into the show

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's a very good show, it's a very entertaining podcast

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
One of my favorite podcasts

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Thank you

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And you know, but you haven't really

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Have you made any money off of this?

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You've been losing money on this, right?

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah, absolutely

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You've been losing money

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah, yeah

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah, we made a little from the t-shirts

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The first round of t-shirts

122
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Don't tell them that

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We made nothing

124
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
We need your help

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The economics of podcasting are tricky

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Because even the ads that you run are like

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You know, you're sharing that with a network

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And there isn't necessarily great money for those

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So like, you know, some sort of paywalled content is the

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Is really the only way some people can make money off of it

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And I'm glad you guys are doing it because you should do it

132
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Because it's a good show

133
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And I'm sure you have listeners who will be excited to support you

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So I'm very excited for this, this is great

135
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Thanks so much

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I really appreciate that

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm having on day one

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Oh, boy

139
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh, geez

140
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, we had also talked about and thought about

141
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Do we put some of this behind a paywall?

142
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And do we put this episode behind the paywall?

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Just one episode

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It would have been really cruel

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Right

146
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But yeah, we I don't know

147
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We wanted to be nice and generous

148
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Before we get real rigid

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And put up big old barbed wire fences

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Like the ones you don't even see on the outside of Disneyland

151
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But you're there

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If they're there, if you try to jump a wall

153
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
There's hardcore security

154
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
We're going from like humble artists

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Just happy to do something for free

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
To like we're about to merchandise the hell out of this

157
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I want, if we could

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And somebody tell me if this is possible

159
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
If we could have a Jason Plush doll

160
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Oh, my God

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Within a year

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So if somebody knows of a way to do this

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Where we're not going to lose a million dollars

164
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And the scale on this would be one to one

165
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
All right

166
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's going to be one of those episodes

167
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Wow, this is just going to be like the other 18 sectors

168
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I think now that you say one to one

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's just it's called a real doll, I believe

170
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So that's possible

171
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's a high that's a high priced item

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You can feed hot dog dinners

173
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
With an opening in the mouth

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Nick, you have a relationship with the real doll manufacturers

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Wait a minute

176
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You have a full dining room tables worth

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You dine with every evening

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah, I dress them up

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
We have dinner parties

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's a blast

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
We'll have Jason to your collection soon

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
In a Dunce's cap in the corner

183
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Hey

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What?

185
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That edition is hurtful

186
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The Dunce cap

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The Dunce cap is where it went too far

188
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
We've all got to have a code

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
We've all got to have a line

190
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Back off, Carlson

191
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I said there was going to be an expensive doll

192
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
People would have sex with

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That was you

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Four speed hot dogs too

195
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But the Dunce cap

196
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, that's because Jason is

197
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I think his spirit is from a time when Dunce caps actually were applied

198
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
He remembered how hurtful those were in the 40s

199
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
No greater shame

200
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah, we've lost track of

201
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Sure

202
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You know what?

203
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm so sorry for the Dunce cap remark

204
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Okay, thank you very much

205
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That said, podcasts are right

206
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Dunce caps will be available on T public

207
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Oh, yeah, yeah

208
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
We'll get sell them all day long

209
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's fine

210
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Okay, so Nick, thanks for being here

211
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I feel like for

212
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I imagine over the many years of Doughboys now

213
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You have like

214
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
There's a high concentration of chain restaurants up at CityWogs

215
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You must have been up there many a time for the show

216
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
We've probably overlapped and covered a lot of stuff that you've covered

217
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
For the show

218
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Specific CityWalk visits we've made for I think four chains

219
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Margaritaville

220
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Johnny Rockets

221
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Tony Romas

222
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's the only Tony Romas I think left in SoCal

223
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And the other one we did up there is

224
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Bubba Gum Shrimp Company, yes, yeah

225
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And you know, it is

226
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah, not just for chains

227
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But specifically those chains that tend to be concentrated in touristy areas

228
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Places like Bubba Gump and Margaritaville

229
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Like that CityWalk is the place to find them in LA

230
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Either there or Hollywood Boulevard

231
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The Hollywood Boulevard area is so horrible

232
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I mean, like the city

233
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Like if you guys are doing like 19 Hollywood Boulevard episodes

234
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We'd want to kill yourselves

235
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's such a dingy unfun area

236
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Versus CityWalk is at least something approximating a fun spot

237
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah, and it's possible to have fun there

238
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
We had fun there because

239
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
We should say before we

240
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Explain every step of this thing that we all

241
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The four of us

242
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Literally did walk through every parking garage

243
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
We didn't like go stand in every space or anything

244
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
We might have skipped levels

245
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But we did want to get a general gist of what all these places are

246
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And that was fun

247
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I thought we were all pretty exhausted by the end of it

248
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah, I had my full backpack which I have with me today

249
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Because I was carrying around with all my work stuff

250
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That was an added layer of challenge for me

251
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But I did find it

252
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I did have a blast

253
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It was a real hoot

254
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And that wasn't the only thing we did we should say

255
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That we did other things on the

256
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
That we did other things on this trip that made it more conventionally fun

257
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But even walking through the parking garages was fun

258
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I like that

259
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah, and you get some odd

260
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Some genuinely cool views of stuff

261
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Right

262
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
There's a lot of weird talking points

263
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But I might say that walking through the parking garages is more enjoyable than having to park in the parking garages

264
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
100%

265
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Which not all of us did

266
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Which all of us actively avoid to do

267
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yes

268
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
In all of our visits up there

269
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Oh, wait a minute

270
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But wait, are we talking about the parking garages today?

271
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I don't think we know

272
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
We haven't gotten the official actual assignment

273
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But how are we going to be sure?

274
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Boys, boys

275
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
He's here

276
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
He's in the room

277
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yes, yes, I'm here and I have more strength than ever, boys

278
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The Sector Keeper

279
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You look great

280
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's like one of those milk commercials where you start small and have grown and grown

281
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Exactly

282
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And you're a big strapping lad now

283
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Oh, thank you, thank you, yes

284
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm so excited for Sector 19, boys

285
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You've alluded to it

286
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Sector 19 is parking garages

287
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah

288
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
We have it officially

289
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Thank you

290
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Charles Atlas, hero of the beach

291
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yes

292
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Around everyone

293
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He started small and he became the hero of the beach

294
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I couldn't have put it better

295
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Charles Atlas

296
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Charles Atlas

297
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
We're all making Charles Atlas

298
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
We're all making the 60s comic book hero Charles Atlas

299
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That guy that you worshiped when you were a young man

300
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah, I would nail away

301
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So bullies would stop kicking sand at me

302
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Sheridan, put down that periodical with a picture of Charles Atlas on the cover

303
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Go sit on the corner with a dunce cap on your head

304
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
No

305
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We did put him in a penalty box

306
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yeah, he did get a dunce cap

307
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
He's asking for it

308
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Sector Giver, we're in Sector 19

309
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Were you ever worried that we weren't going to make it?

310
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Were you fearful during this journey?

311
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
There were times where I wasn't sure

312
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It seems like you were getting distracted by treats at times

313
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Oh, no, that was all pertinent and tight conversation

314
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yes, of course

315
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And at other times I thought maybe I enjoyed purgatory

316
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I wasn't sure what heaven would be like

317
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
There was a time where I met a little boy named Colton Burpo

318
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Wow

319
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
He went to heaven once

320
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah

321
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And he made a movie about it

322
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Heaven is real

323
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Heaven is real, boy

324
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And I wasn't sure and it scared me

325
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But now I'm getting excited

326
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm getting excited because Sector 19 is the final sector

327
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It'll be the final Sector Stone and my soul will be complete

328
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And ideally, well, I don't know what's on the other side

329
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But hopefully it's good

330
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah, hopefully

331
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
We're minutes away

332
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
We're only, I can assume, two and a half hours away

333
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Based on how we do these things

334
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But with every minute that we get through this thing

335
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Maybe you probably don't even want to rush things along with your coughs

336
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You're probably a little scared of what's coming at the end of the episode

337
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I've never really mentioned this

338
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But for every Earth minute you spend in the show

339
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It is a hundred years for me

340
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Wow

341
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh no

342
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You're trapped in a weird time paradox

343
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Yeah, it's difficult

344
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
But I do understand that this sector is very tenuous and very detailed

345
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
There's lots to talk about

346
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And it's a sequel to one, I don't know if you've talked to any other

347
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Like anyone who keeps sectors over at Downtown Disney

348
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
If you've heard about when we did this before

349
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
But we did an episode about the Mickey and Friends parking garage

350
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That was excruciatingly detailed

351
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And I can't imagine being any vaguer than that time

352
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Right

353
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
No, yes, just keep in mind a hundred years for every minute, that's all

354
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So every minute that I'm just going on and on and on

355
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And not getting to the point

356
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Those minutes, you're in hell for hundreds of years

357
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Like this one right now, this is an eternity for you

358
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah

359
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You wouldn't believe what I've seen in the past 30 seconds

360
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh my gosh

361
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Sectorkeeper, during this time, are you like

362
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Does it like, you feel like a hundred years worth of

363
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I haven't eaten a meal, I haven't had a drink of water

364
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I haven't had an hour of sleep, I haven't used the restroom

365
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
All of those, all of those

366
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
God, that sounds miserable

367
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Everything heals slower too

368
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Right

369
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So if I were to pull my hamstring, it would take a hundred years to heal

370
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And you're working your job, checking people into purgatory during this time too?

371
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm still working on missions at purgatory

372
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Oh God, well I want to say that as soon as you're free

373
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I have a gift and I will tell you what it is

374
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's a DVD of the movie Gladiator

375
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And it's just because he hasn't been

376
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
He's not supposed to pop culture before his time

377
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
After his time, excuse me

378
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Gladiator?

379
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Gladiator, yes, so there's a DVD of that I have for you

380
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And that's just something to look forward to at the end, is what I'm saying

381
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So this might feel like forever, but

382
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Considered one of the best films of the period that you've missed from 95

383
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Starring Nitro?

384
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
No, not starring an American Gladiator

385
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
A man named Russell Crowe, he was mostly working in Australia when you would have been alive

386
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And then he became a big star in America

387
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Some people think this is a bit of an art house movie, but I think it's a real crowd pleaser

388
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Thank you, thank you

389
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You know, I actually, Sector Keeper, and I didn't tell you guys this

390
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But I actually have a gift for you as well

391
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's a CD of the debut album of Russell Crowe's band 30 Odd Foot of Grunt

392
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So if you just want to catch up on the best music of the era

393
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That you're not familiar with, you have that as well

394
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Boys, you bring me strength, you really bring me strength

395
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Thank you, thank you

396
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You're welcome, yeah

397
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Well, we gotta get you listening to this album and watching this film and watching all the Crowe fest

398
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So let's get down to it, we're talking about the parking garages today

399
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I feel like a subtext of our Mickey and Friends parking garage episode

400
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Is that the Disney garage is so efficient and relatively pleasant for being as sprawling and teeming as it is

401
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And it's just stressful to park there, especially with a family, no matter what

402
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
But they keep it pretty pleasant as opposed to Universal

403
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yes

404
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Which is a big fucking mess

405
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
100%

406
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's just chaos when you go to Universal, you don't know where you're going to be parking

407
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It feels frantic from the moment you get off the freeway

408
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And you're approaching those parking structures, there's cones just arbitrarily blocking your way in different directions

409
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You don't know where you're supposed to go

410
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I feel like until the moment I'm turning into the garage, I don't know

411
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I feel like I'm turning down the wrong way down a one-way street

412
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's so stressful

413
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And then you're assigned to one of five different structures

414
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Although in my experience I've only ever been pushed into one of three structures

415
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The other ones are kind of enigmas to me

416
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But the structures are...wait, no, it's six, right?

417
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's actually six, as we discovered

418
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
There are four structures

419
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And then two surface lots

420
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Oh, okay, alright, but they are still separate parking...what's the word to use?

421
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Zones

422
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Parking sectors, thank you

423
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
We have six mini-sectors within sector 19

424
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So we'll label these 19A, 19B, 19C

425
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Thank you

426
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And then the spaces are...it's like they're smaller spaces

427
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
They're not easy to park in

428
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It always feels like when I'm parking at Universal, it feels like I'm parking at a mall during Christmas

429
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's so busy and everyone's so crazy

430
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And you just are turning and you feel like you're going to plow right into a stroller that just appeared out of nowhere

431
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And it's gotten to the point that when I go to Universal now, I take the train or I take a lift

432
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I try to avoid driving to it because it's such a pain in the ass

433
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And hey, that also lets me get a little more crunk, you know what I'm saying?

434
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Oh yeah, you know what I'm saying

435
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yeah, in fact, this time, we've parked up there a lot recently because we've been up there so much

436
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
This time, I think the only one of us that actually parked up there was you, Mike

437
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You're correct

438
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Because you were running a little late

439
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I was running a little late and I wanted to try something out

440
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Okay

441
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah, I don't know if it's the time to reveal or...

442
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Should we maybe talk about more regular parking experience?

443
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Yes, I agree, I agree

444
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Before we... which I guess we'll just talk in order

445
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Well, how about this? The broader parking situation

446
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I am looking at a chart that explains how the parking works

447
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Okay

448
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And it is divided into several categories

449
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It shows you the general parking, preferred parking, front gate parking, valet parking

450
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And $5 movie parking

451
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And then it shows you what those cost before 6pm and after 6pm

452
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And there's various little notes within all that of how those prices differ from Sunday to Thursday

453
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And if you're in the City Loft Club valet parking zone

454
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Or if you have validation from a full service restaurant

455
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Or if you've valeted for under two hours or over two hours

456
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And here's what I have to say

457
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
This is way too much

458
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And Universal Studios, I think particularly, caters to tourists from out of town

459
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yes

460
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Who do not speak the language of English

461
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And imagine if you just know the most basic English words

462
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And then you are confronted with a super complicated parking diagram

463
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Right

464
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
With vastly different quantities and prices

465
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Like, truly, like day-changingly, you're already spending a lot of money at a theme park

466
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And then if you go one minute over one thing, that can be $30 more, it's true madness

467
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
How could this chart be this complicated?

468
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Yeah, it's too much

469
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And also too, and I don't know if you were touching on that in the validation

470
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Did you mention the movie theater?

471
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
No, we haven't

472
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Well, that's a whole thing

473
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
A little bit in the episode

474
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Or did we? I don't know

475
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
But that is, they do, the movie theater will validate

476
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But the way the movie theater validates is you give them your parking receipt

477
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And they give you cash

478
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Well, that is how they have been doing it up till the last month

479
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Wow, they've changed that policy?

480
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Yes, and that might play into what I'm talking about with the hack

481
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Oh my goodness

482
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Oh, you used their own flaws against them

483
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I feel like, now I've teased it too much, I guess I gotta say

484
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yeah, you gotta do it

485
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
With all of this, let me say a couple prices

486
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Sure, go for it

487
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
If you're just going to, if you're going to a regular day at Universal Studios, you're paying $25

488
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Which is more than Disneyland

489
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Yes

490
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
$5 more than Disneyland, crazy

491
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Disneyland is 20 all day if you go to that Mickey and Friends garage, but at least it's consistent

492
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And I'd say Disneyland is better than Universal

493
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Of course

494
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Well, yeah, I'm kidding

495
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Oh, the theme park you mean?

496
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Oh, I was just meant the parking garage

497
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I thought you meant the garage, too

498
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
$35 is preferred parking, which takes a couple of minutes out of your wad

499
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's a little less of a wad to get there

500
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Front gate, I'm not sure where that drops you off

501
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
$50, valet if you're over there for over two hours is $45

502
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,000
These are heavy, priced at $45 for a two-hour, minute-long meal

503
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
This is all the stuff that you're seeking to avoid

504
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's why I've spent a lot of time, because I'm from here

505
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I've spent a lot of time finding the places to park down the hill, walking up the hill

506
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yes

507
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Just figuring out what's the shortest lift route to where I can get off more financially, Scott Free

508
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
There's so much to avoid, and that's why, Mike, I'm curious what you figured out to avoid

509
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Well, I'll start by saying I think this works, because you're not supposed to park in the metro lot

510
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
No

511
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And they're monitoring that now more than they used to

512
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
How, though?

513
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
In 2003, you were set

514
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Well, I don't know, maybe they aren't

515
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
There's more cameras, signs are scarier

516
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You just gotta pay

517
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Where is the metro lot?

518
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's right down on Lancashire

519
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
First of all, this is not the hack

520
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm just giving you another idea for a hack

521
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
But I used to do that, and now I don't feel as comfortable, because they put up a lot more signage

522
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
They have more signage, but you pay $3

523
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Oh, it's just three

524
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
So it's $3 for the day

525
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
This is a good first hack, it's not your main hack

526
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I have not tested this out, so don't maybe do this if you're worried

527
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
But go pay, pretend you're walking over to the escalator, and then just keep going

528
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
There's no way they can start arbitrarily towing cars that they think

529
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
As long as you paid

530
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So that is a good way to do it

531
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Someone would have to be watching you carefully

532
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I would say maybe if you're going with a family, and you're clearly going to the theme park

533
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
You're wearing minion gear or whatever

534
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Then you're going to be someone that they'll target

535
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Like, okay, I know this person is pulling a scam

536
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But if you're just a couple of adults

537
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Just going to like, you might be riding the metro

538
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Leave your thing one and thing two shirts at home though

539
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Don't telegraph that

540
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Or change into them up at City Wall

541
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
That's fine, put them in a bag

542
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Keep them underneath a hoodie and not underneath a Harry Potter cloak

543
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Or if you can, take the red line

544
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Because it leaves you at the bottom of the hill

545
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I've done this a couple times, walked from Ventura up the hill

546
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
The sector keeper and I walked up, just parked on Ventura

547
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I guided you

548
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Yes, he had two sets of footprints

549
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
We talked before in a previous Sector, Sector Keeper

550
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
About how when Mike has waking nightmares

551
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Caused by blackout curtains

552
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
That's you calling to him

553
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You've been summoning him for years

554
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
As he has these horrifying dreams

555
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
That's right, yes, yes

556
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Yeah, we just figured it out

557
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
We just figured it out

558
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Why are you doing that?

559
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
That's very mean, I think

560
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Oh, I thought you liked it, my bad

561
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
You thought he liked it?

562
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
No, I was like, my sleep would be disturbed

563
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Oh, well, you know, it's like a sleepover

564
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
First person that falls asleep

565
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's like a sleepover inside me?

566
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Yeah, it gets razzed

567
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Sleep in it?

568
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But it sounds like you've been giving him a taste of your hell when you do it

569
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Yeah, well in hell no one sleeps, only sleep paralysis

570
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Oh, my gosh

571
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Well, that adds up

572
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I have another question

573
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
We've started to feel your presence looking back throughout our lives

574
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And wondered if we had encountered you in some way

575
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Let me just ask

576
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
If you remember the day, and I bet that you do

577
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
When you perished in the Dancing Fountains

578
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Yes

579
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Was it because you got in an especially long Jodie Moroney's line

580
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And the last person in the line was a short brown haired child

581
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Wearing a Future Lakers Club t-shirt

582
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And that was that the thing that made you go

583
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Oh, how about I do the Dancing Fountains instead?

584
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Oh, yes, it's all coming back to me, yes

585
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I think I might be responsible for your death

586
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Oh, my God

587
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
What?

588
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
It was me, and I didn't mean it, I just wanted a hot dog

589
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You, you, you caused my death?

590
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I mean, it could have been anyone, I didn't, it just occurred to me

591
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Lakers Club Boy, in your friends with Sparkies?

592
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I don't know Sparky, I really don't, I swear

593
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
He took my place

594
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I am not in alliance with that awful man

595
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I know I'm in alliance with Nick Mundy now

596
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
But there's other people, otherwise I'm not to blame for anything

597
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Bad man, bad man

598
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Bad man, Mundy, bad man

599
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I don't think I'm a bad man

600
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
This episode has not been released yet, I don't know what went down with Mundy

601
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm very excited to learn

602
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
He tried to rearrange the order of the sectors

603
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
We all learned a lesson about friendship from it anyway

604
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I just, if I was in any way responsible

605
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
But you would have, look, visiting the Dancing Fountain should have been a fun thing for you

606
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
No, it was fun, and I can't hold you responsible, I hold Sparky responsible

607
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
He took my place in heaven

608
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
He's the one, he's the bad man, he's the bad boy

609
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
You're not bad boys, you're good boys

610
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Thank you

611
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
We are good boys

612
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I think you're really backtracking here, it sounded like he was directly responsible for your death

613
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
And now you're just like, I think you're saying this to make a film out of it

614
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Mike, tell us about that part

615
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
We gotta get to the hack, we gotta get to the hack, Liger

616
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Who cares about the person responsible for it

617
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I took in mind one minute, a hundred years

618
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yeah, that's true

619
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
You can get over a lot in a hundred years

620
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Don't dig deeper in your memory and realize that this hypothetical boy cut in front of you and pushed you out of the way

621
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
No, no

622
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Because that didn't happen

623
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
But I do remember that my parents went to put their names in a Bubba Gump

624
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I was lured towards the fountains

625
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Alright, so you were also waiting for the... your parents... it's your parents' fault

626
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
They killed you, dude

627
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Yeah, yeah, it's their fault

628
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Also, I had a staph infection, give me some fucking antibiotics

629
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Whoa!

630
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Wow

631
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Whoa, he's learning out of Kurt

632
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
He's learning, he's truly becoming a real boy

633
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
You've given me strength, also I gotta hold a new medal

634
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
In gaining my consciousness

635
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Oh, you know about like Limp Bizkit and stuff?

636
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Yeah, it's awesome

637
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Oh yeah, isn't that dope?

638
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It is cool, yeah

639
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Do you like West Borland and stuff, his makeup?

640
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Oh, West is cool, his eyes, his eyes are cool

641
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Yeah, that's hell yeah they are

642
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
He's like a devil

643
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Homework sucks

644
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Hey, oh boy, you're in a lot of attitude as the years come back to you

645
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So, the hack

646
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Alright, this is very important

647
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
So first of all

648
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I think I know what you're gonna say

649
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Probably, because it's sort of similar to a different hack that I've mentioned on the show before

650
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And I honestly am a little worried about saying this because we'll lose this hack, I think

651
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
If someone listens to this, somebody will figure out a workaround

652
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Jason is literally spinning a Mickey fidget spinner

653
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Is that what that is?

654
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Yeah, it's been a long day

655
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I've been doing this occasionally

656
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And you're so stressed out about the hack disappearing

657
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I'm so excited, it is very calming

658
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So anyway, I'm excited to hear about the hack

659
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
That's such a modern thing, I expect you to be playing with like a cup and ball or something

660
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Yeah, it lights up and everything

661
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Some jacks

662
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It lights up, not like toys from the 1930s

663
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm surprised you even know how to use that technology

664
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
If you are listening and you hear a slight whirring sound

665
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And you'd like to complain to us about it, write us on Twitter or on iTunes

666
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Or keep it to yourself

667
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
The hack, Mike, the hack

668
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Boys, boys, the hack

669
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
While you're talking, Jason's just gonna push a little hoop around with a stick

670
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Like every episode

671
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Got a maple in here?

672
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
He's one of the little rascals, let's be honest

673
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Okay, hack time

674
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Here we go

675
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Again, I'm scared, I don't want to lose this hack

676
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
But I think we have to say it

677
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
So here's what you do

678
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Now they've taken the movie theater discount

679
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Which is knocking it down to $5

680
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
But you should just be handed out in a dirty piece of cash

681
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Now it is...

682
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Which is insane, by the way

683
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
You walk up and they give you cash

684
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
They just hand you $15 in cash

685
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Because you paid $20, $25

686
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
If you paid $25, they'll give you a $20

687
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You just have a 22-year-old handing you a $20 bill at the end of your movie

688
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It's like you're doing a drug deal

689
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
A lobby of the Universal Cinema

690
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Which is crazy to think about how many 20s they have to have on hand

691
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Because if you see, what, 500 people see a movie at a weekend

692
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
So you gotta have...

693
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Somebody do the math

694
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Oh, way more, way more than that

695
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
$10,000 in 20s?

696
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
There's a fucking heist to be done

697
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Oh, wait a minute

698
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Maybe that's why they changed the system

699
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Yeah, because now that I think about it

700
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
They still have this cash system in place

701
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Because it doesn't work if you book it through a fandango

702
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
It doesn't work if you book it through several other movie sites

703
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Oh, got it

704
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
You have to book it through the AMC website

705
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I wonder if there was some way to find out where the vault was

706
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
If there was some sort of omniscient being that knew all of the secret places of the city

707
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Boys

708
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I guess we'll have to talk to you off air about this one

709
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Or behind the paywall

710
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Patreon episode one is how to rob CityWalk of $10,000

711
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
You pay us five, but you'll get a guaranteed $10,000 down the line

712
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Pretty good deal

713
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Yeah, that's really good

714
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
All right, hack time

715
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Now it feels like we shouldn't even get to the hack, right?

716
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
No, just...

717
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Come on

718
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
All right, here's what you do

719
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
We're going in the parking garage

720
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I thought of this last second

721
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
So this made me feel really great

722
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Because I was doing this on the fly

723
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I was like, you know what I can do?

724
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I bought a movie ticket for an hour from now or whatever

725
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
For the house, that Jack Black movie that Eli Roth directed

726
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
The house with the clock in the walls

727
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
The house with the clock in the walls or whatever

728
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And I was like, I know that they now have a digital way to get the rebate or whatever

729
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
So I bought the ticket

730
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Got an email that said, here's your parking code

731
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Have them scan it at the thing or whatever at the booth

732
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And right before...

733
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Let's add this to the Mission Impossible score, by the way

734
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Or the Ocean's Eleven movie

735
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And right before I got to the booth

736
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I canceled the movie ticket and got a refund

737
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Wow

738
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So I showed it and I was like, I wonder if this is going to work

739
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Because if it doesn't, then I can actually just do the same thing again in a second

740
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Or be like, oh, I just got whatever

741
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I'll have to do the manual thing and go get cash or something

742
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Right

743
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I showed it to him

744
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
It was a tense 25 seconds

745
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And now again, I'm a good boy, so I was sweating pretty hard here

746
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Right

747
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
He scanned it, he goes, alright, here you go

748
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And $5 was the price

749
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Now the only extra thing I had to pay was there's a service fee that's now refundable

750
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So it's like $1.50

751
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Okay

752
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:59,000
So $6.75 or $0.50 parking hack with my movie theater canceling trick

753
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Wow

754
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
So you waited to cancel until like right before you were exit

755
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Right before I exit

756
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
That being said, I think you can cancel after you've done it too probably

757
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Yeah, that's the next try

758
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So again, this is, don't tell, guys, if you're listening, don't tell anyone

759
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Because I would like to use this in the future

760
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Did you buy, sorry, for the movie

761
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
It was a movie that was going to be starting after you knew you were going to leave

762
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Like you timed it out that way

763
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
No, I just, it was in an hour

764
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
An hour from when you parked or an hour from when you left?

765
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It was like, like I said, we parked at 6.30, it was 7.30 movie

766
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So this was a movie that you didn't, like you didn't, but wouldn't it have started?

767
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
How did you know, like when the, I guess I'm confused about when the transaction took place

768
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I bought a ticket at 6.30 on my phone for a 7.30 movie

769
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
We went into the parking garage at 6.35

770
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
You're paying as you enter the parking garage, not as you're exiting

771
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
That's the trick now that they've changed and now their system is susceptible to my trickery

772
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yes

773
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
What if they start now like geo-tagging it somehow

774
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
They might

775
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
They prevent you from buying one within 100

776
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
This is the danger of me saying this on this show

777
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
First of all, what they should do is like how they, when the government finds hackers

778
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And they're like threatened to lock them up, instead of locking me up, they should hire me

779
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Yeah

780
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
That's what they should do

781
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
To help them make the parking more expensive?

782
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Yes, I will find ways to clamp down on the holes in their system and add more tiers of parking

783
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
If there's an extra 30 minutes, it's another $25 in valet

784
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Let's figure out ways to get more money out of people

785
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm willing to join the team

786
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I am willing to hire me is what I'm saying

787
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
You deserve the Frank Abagnale Jr. treatment at the end of Catch Me If You Can

788
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Yes

789
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
You get rewarded after your life of crime with a plumb job at the FBI

790
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
That is exactly what I'm asking for

791
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So there's the hack

792
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
That's a great hack

793
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
That's amazing

794
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Amazing hot off the presses news

795
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I had a hack, past tense

796
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
But I think I spoiled the hack for everyone

797
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And it's not a hack that anybody else would have had

798
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
But here's what happened

799
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I largely stayed on the schedule as a universal tour guide

800
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
In order to get free parking

801
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
In order to still be able to use the employee parking

802
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Which you park in the Frankenstein lot, by the way

803
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And the...

804
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
So I would do a shift there

805
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Even though I had a full-time other job

806
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I would do a shift there once a month

807
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Partially to keep the parking situation

808
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And to get a slight amount of money in return

809
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
But then they took me off the schedule

810
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
There were enough people they didn't need me

811
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I was fired from that job via a letter

812
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
A form letter that went to six other people

813
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
So then I didn't have it anymore

814
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
But I still had my ID

815
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
So here's what I did

816
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I scanned it in

817
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I believe whenever the year needed to change

818
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
In Photoshop, I changed the expiration date

819
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Now, I probably could have taken this a step further

820
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
And laminated my false badge

821
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
But it was always inside a plastic lanyard thing

822
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So I just put the paper one

823
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
With another little punch card for a sandwich shop

824
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Behind it in order to increase the thickness

825
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And so I would go through

826
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
You can name the sandwich shop

827
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
What's that?

828
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
You can name the sandwich shop

829
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I don't think I know the specific one

830
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
It could have been a Jersey Mike's

831
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I don't recall

832
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
But any sandwich shop will do

833
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I thought you were being coy with it

834
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I apologize

835
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
No, no, no

836
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Any sandwich shop card can help with this scam

837
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
To get free parking at Universal Studios

838
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
So I would just

839
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Those people are not paying a lot of attention in the booth

840
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I'd flash that thing real fast

841
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Oh yeah, I go through

842
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
One day after successfully doing this

843
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Six or seven times

844
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
The guy started

845
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
He half-wayed me through

846
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
And then said, wait a minute

847
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Oh no, a nightmare

848
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yeah

849
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Stop me

850
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Heart-beating

851
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Good boy

852
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Trying to keep it calm

853
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
It's like I was pulled over drunk driving

854
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Though that certainly has never happened

855
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
This is the worst driving thing that's happened to me

856
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
This was like a hundred years for you

857
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Wait, this waiting period

858
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Busted by security

859
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It was a purgatory

860
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And so the guy eyes it

861
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Opens the zipper

862
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Takes out the false ID with nothing on the back

863
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And then just looks at me and goes

864
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I'm gonna keep this

865
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
You turn around

866
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And he watched me turn around

867
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And go out the main gate of Universal Studios

868
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Wow

869
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
You fucking cad

870
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Yes, this was something

871
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I think I'm a more good boy today than I was then

872
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I was really pushing it

873
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I was young

874
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I was dumb

875
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I wasn't afraid of risks

876
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So, but here's what ended up happening

877
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Was that

878
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
The

879
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I was worried I was gonna be put on some list

880
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And I wouldn't be able to go back up the city walk again

881
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
But instead

882
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
The badge was handed to somebody in the front office

883
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
It was thrown down on somebody's desk

884
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And it was, and they said

885
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Hey, put this thing on file

886
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
We gotta watch out

887
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
This guy, Scott Gardner, who used to work here

888
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
He's now, he's using a false badge to try to get free parking

889
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
So I don't know

890
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Just like keep an eye on him

891
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Put him on some list

892
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Whatever you gotta do

893
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
The person whose desk that landed on was a friend of mine

894
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Wow

895
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Who immediately texted me and explained

896
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
What happened?

897
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I just got a paper ID on my desk

898
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
That's so crazy

899
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
So she was able to just crumple it up

900
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Make sure it was like nothing ever happened

901
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Oh my gosh

902
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So you and I both, you're screwed

903
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Like this is very revealing in terms of

904
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Maybe we have to

905
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
We better cover all the other Universal rides soon

906
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Because we might end up on some

907
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And Jack was here

908
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
He revealed a lot of the secrets

909
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Oh yeah, Jack was real bad

910
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Sneaking into Universal

911
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Right

912
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Without paying

913
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Wait a minute

914
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Can I reveal mine?

915
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Yeah

916
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Yeah, oh my god

917
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
So this one I feel like is kind of known though

918
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And I haven't tried it in a few years

919
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
But when I interned on the back lot

920
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
You know, I had a generic Universal kind of badge

921
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And I would want to go up there

922
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
They told us like, oh, go to the Frankenstein lot

923
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Go park in the Frankenstein garage

924
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And usually just flash the badge

925
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And they wave you through

926
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Right

927
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I was also like later told by someone

928
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
After I had to give that badge back

929
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Like, oh, just go park in Frankenstein

930
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Tell them you're there for a shoot

931
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Or like you're going to the town office

932
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Just tell them that

933
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
They don't give shit

934
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
That's it

935
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
That was it

936
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And you haven't tried it in a while

937
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I haven't tried it in a while

938
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
But you did it

939
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I think I tried it like once or twice

940
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Seemed to work

941
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
It worked

942
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I've heard other people say it works

943
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
But I don't know

944
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
They may have changed that now

945
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Because Extra wasn't shooting their extra shoots up there

946
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And now there's a lot more production going up there now

947
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Say you're there for Street Smarts

948
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
That's the new one

949
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Street Smarts

950
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Yeah, I'm just going to Street Smarts

951
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
They'll let you guys do it

952
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
That's great

953
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You just keep abreast of what the production is

954
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
That's going on in that Universal lot

955
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
That's a great idea

956
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Look up the name of the host of Street Smarts

957
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I don't know it offhand

958
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
But look it up

959
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Say you're his assistant

960
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
You got to get up to the

961
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
You're late for the Street Smarts shoot

962
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I'm here for a Snapchat thing

963
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
They're shooting it on Snapchat

964
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Street Smarts bonus content

965
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Verticals

966
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I'm a slam ball player

967
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I thought Jason's dark universal confession was going to be

968
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
That he stole a bunch of butterscotch from Popcornopolis

969
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Like unprocessed butterscotch

970
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Cook it at home

971
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Put it in the microwave

972
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Before they mix it in the corns

973
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Just the industrial blocks of butterscotch

974
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
It makes sense because you have a fresh glass of butterscotch every morning

975
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Buttermilk

976
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
No, buttermilk

977
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
That's not true

978
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I took a sip of buttermilk once

979
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And it's disgusting

980
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
It's mostly used for baking

981
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It's very strange

982
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I had a joke about your eating years ago

983
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
That you regularly ate curds in way

984
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Oh, my toughness

985
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Yeah

986
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
God bless

987
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
The next heist that we do

988
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Once we figure out the movie theater heist

989
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Then we figure out the butterscotch heist

990
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
That's really the key to this

991
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Doing all 19 sectors is we know the ground so well

992
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
That's true, yeah

993
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Maybe this is the birth of us becoming bad boys

994
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Maybe that's the little punch list

995
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Bad boys

996
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Sometimes it feels good to be bad

997
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Whoa, wait a minute

998
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Sector keeper himself

999
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
The influence of corn

1000
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Yeah, so have you been bad in purgatory?

1001
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Because you're always a good boy

1002
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I'm a good boy, no

1003
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
But maybe you guys are rubbing off on me

1004
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Oh, okay

1005
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Our coolness is making you cool and bad

1006
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Yeah, I feel like I'm running with the cool crowd

1007
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
The way you describe adulthood rules

1008
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Did you know that chocolate-covered starfish is buttholes?

1009
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Hey, whoa, Jason

1010
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Whoa, hey

1011
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I'm still a kid

1012
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Okay

1013
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
But you were listening to that?

1014
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Never mind

1015
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Have you gotten to that Al Olimpiscate album?

1016
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Yeah

1017
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Oh, you have?

1018
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Yeah, I started

1019
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Have you broken any stuff since then?

1020
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Yeah, all the time

1021
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Oh, damn

1022
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Oh, boy

1023
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Wow, there's going to be no purgatory by the time you're left

1024
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Yeah, well, I just feel like I'm so close

1025
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
You guys are doing so well and you're giving me strength

1026
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Oh, yeah, but I guess we'll really give you all the strength

1027
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
if we start talking about each individual parking garage

1028
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Yeah

1029
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Here we go

1030
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Get ready, listeners

1031
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
That's what's happening

1032
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Unless there's more hacks to go through

1033
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Not right now, at least

1034
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Nope

1035
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
All right, let's go in the order that we walked through them with

1036
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Yes

1037
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
So we started in Curious George

1038
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Right

1039
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
You know what?

1040
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'll hold off my thought on the theming

1041
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I will say generally, because there's one thing I want to zero in on

1042
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
a few garages from now

1043
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
But in general, the theming is chaos

1044
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
It's completely incoherent

1045
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
There's nothing running through it

1046
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
It's kind of like, you know, you've got the Toy Story lots over at Disneyland

1047
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
and it's kind of, you know, you get that, okay, these are all Toy Story characters

1048
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
They've zeroed in on something specific

1049
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Mickey and Friends, they're all Mickey characters

1050
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
They're like the canonical main Mickey characters

1051
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Here it's just sort of like it's all over the place

1052
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
There's stuff for kids, there's stuff for adults

1053
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
There's like classic movie monsters

1054
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
There's modern franchises

1055
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,000
It's just like Universal's library of franchises

1056
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
It's just all over the place

1057
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And some are characters

1058
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Some are characters

1059
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Like you see in Curious George, but some are a whole film

1060
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Some are a whole film

1061
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
It's very confusing

1062
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
But Curious George, you know, I will say that I like the signage

1063
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
The signs look nice

1064
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
And it's a five level parking structure

1065
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
At least that's what my notes say

1066
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
The view, so actually parking at Curious George is not pleasant

1067
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
This is one of the three structures that I parked at before

1068
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
You know, none of them I think are

1069
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
None of them are appreciably better or worse than the others

1070
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
At least that's my take

1071
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
That's my layman's take

1072
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
You guys are experts, you may have a better, a more nuanced view of the lots

1073
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
as we can comparison to each other

1074
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
But they're all like kind of like unpleasant to park in

1075
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
But the, you know, I guess we're going to

1076
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
What we did is we went to the top levels of each of these structures

1077
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And the top level of Curious George has pretty good views of downtown Burbank

1078
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Good views and good views of universal backstates

1079
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Yes, that is actually nice

1080
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,000
We were looking over the big like holding area where I discovered Botanicus

1081
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Back in the day

1082
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
The rotting Botanicus

1083
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And we saw some stuff back there that is maybe a spoiler

1084
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Or it was just something temporary that they are storing

1085
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
It's half a dinosaur next to a bunch of port-a-bodies

1086
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Right

1087
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And we wondered out loud if that's a dinosaur being added to the Jurassic World's re-theme of the Jurassic Park ride

1088
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
However, I think if that was a complex animatronic, they wouldn't just leave that sitting around

1089
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
But Botanicus was just sitting around

1090
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Botanicus is out and obviously he was not being installed into the ride, but still, you know

1091
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
So yeah, or it could just be like less mobile robots, you know, maybe they're adding a couple other things

1092
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Who knows? It was big though

1093
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
And probably just for a photo op, but who knows

1094
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
It looked like it might have, what is it?

1095
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
It's the I-Rex, is that what it is?

1096
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Oh, the Indominus Rex

1097
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
The newer Indominus Rex

1098
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
It looked a little different than Indominus Rex though

1099
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Was it the one in the new one?

1100
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Is there another new one?

1101
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
They engineer a hyper killer one

1102
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
That's worse than the I-Rex?

1103
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
That's worse than the I-Rex

1104
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Because the I-Rex was bad

1105
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:48,000
They can aim like a sonar gun at a target and shoot it and the dinosaur can track the sonar at that target

1106
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Oh, okay. I don't know if that was this one

1107
00:46:51,000 --> 00:47:03,000
But so if you go to the top of Curious George, you maybe get some universal spoilers along with getting an actually amazing view of Burbank and Toluca Lake and a lot of the San Fernando Valley

1108
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I will say this, I took a lot of photos while we were up there

1109
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Some of the prettiest, nicest photos I've ever taken on my phone camera

1110
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
It was kind of around sunset, I was getting some cool lens flares

1111
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And somebody gave us the tip, and I don't know if we take this because we're good boys, but in this episode maybe we're turning a little

1112
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Maybe we're becoming bad boys

1113
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:32,000
But somebody on Twitter or somewhere told us that's a good spot to maybe roll up your car, roll down your window, get a little high

1114
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Wow

1115
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Would you guys ever?

1116
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
No

1117
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Do we dare?

1118
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I think it was a listener said like get a little stone and watch the sunset from Frankenstein, I think Frankenstein gives a different angle

1119
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
But the top of Frankenstein is the theme park

1120
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
So you wouldn't be able to go to the top of it

1121
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,000
But yeah, beautiful views of the sunset up here and the San Fernando Valley and the mountains

1122
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:06,000
This is a good tip I would say, if you're coming to LA for the first time, taking out a towners, go to the top of this garage or the one next to it that we'll talk about

1123
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Great views, great photo spots

1124
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:15,000
And similarly, if you want a good picture by the Hollywood sign, look up the Hollywood Reservoir and the Hollywood Dog Park

1125
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
That's really where you want to go to find parking, get photos

1126
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Just a nice little tip because you don't want to go up the streets that a lot of people live on

1127
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Bother neighbors and stuff

1128
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:31,000
It's also too, and I think people can perhaps infer this from our tour of these garages

1129
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:38,000
But you can, unlike some theme parks, you can very easily just walk into each of these garages if you so desire

1130
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
You can just go ahead and go on a walking tour through them if you want to get to the roof and check out those views

1131
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Which we did

1132
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Send us those pics if you do it, walk in our footsteps, do the legendary walk

1133
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Like Christ's walk up the hill with the cross

1134
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
This is now the second best walk to do a tour of

1135
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Speaking about the parking, so the actual process of parking, I feel like the

1136
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Actually pulling up to the gates is fine

1137
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
It's not like once you're in the structure, I don't feel like I'm

1138
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
It's too chaotic in terms of figuring out which gate to go to to pay

1139
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:22,000
But I think once I'm actually inside the lot, there's less direction than I would like

1140
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I like at a theme park when they're just waving you into a specific space and you're being guided down a different

1141
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
You almost don't have to think about where you're going to park

1142
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Here I think there's a little bit too much discretion left to the driver

1143
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Which creates bottlenecks and also creates additional stress

1144
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
And also I feel like too, the ceilings for these levels I think are a little low

1145
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
It feels a little cramped

1146
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I also feel like I'm pulling in and there's an employee there who suddenly starts gesturing in a way of like

1147
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
No, no, no, that way, that way, suddenly it's really hurried and you're doing something wrong

1148
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
But why? I don't know what the problem is here

1149
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
One person calls in sick, the whole thing could fall apart

1150
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Because they seem to have half the amount of people flagging and waving people in than Disney does

1151
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Because Disney literally, as you're saying, walks you through it, it makes it dummy proof

1152
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Here we went in, this is one of the many parking stories we have

1153
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
A couple months ago, Lindsay and I, she has an electric vehicle

1154
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
And they put a little thing on the front of your car that says EV and then they point you to where you go

1155
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
At a certain point, there was no employee anywhere to tell us where to go

1156
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:33,000
There were three choices, we chose one, it took us out of the parking garage and into the Curious George parking garage

1157
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Which does not have electric vehicle parking

1158
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
So we were like, what the hell?

1159
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Like we were trying to figure out where we were going

1160
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
We went out of the ET parking garage into Curious George

1161
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Then had to exit Curious George, exit all the way

1162
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
And then go back into the ET and go like, hey we just paid, where are we going?

1163
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,000
And they're like, oh, go and then they pointed us and we finally figured out what to do

1164
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
But that shouldn't happen

1165
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
You should be flagging, you should be really hardcore on every car

1166
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Because it's a big confusing place

1167
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Conversely, when we were up there walking through

1168
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,000
The most universal employees I've ever seen because it was the second weekend of Horror Nights

1169
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
So they had cones everywhere, there's people everywhere, there's tons of people

1170
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
What was that for?

1171
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Horror Nights

1172
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Oh yeah, it's scary to us too

1173
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
When you're a full grown bad boy, you're going to be into that

1174
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Yeah, you're going to think that's cool

1175
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Okay, I just always think, what if one guy takes it too far and really gets in your face

1176
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
It feels like there's not a lot of oversight, I don't know

1177
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
What if all the seasonal hires who are not usually around

1178
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Were just there for that month and they would essentially hire anyone

1179
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
What if one of them brought a knife into their job for the day

1180
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Or they put the chainsaw they have that doesn't have the blade on it

1181
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
What if he snuck the blade in somehow?

1182
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
He swallowed the blade in a little bag

1183
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Oh, because he knows he's a sicko

1184
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Not that, because he gets to go through a metal detector

1185
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
So maybe he put a lined bag with the blade inside his stomach

1186
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
And then he shit it out and put the blade on to

1187
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
That's true, could be a ceramic blade doesn't set off a metal detector

1188
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Could be a ceramic, you could probably 3D print a blade now

1189
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
And you could take a plate from any universal restaurant, shatter it, use the piece

1190
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Shove it into the throat of some Halloween Horror Nights ghost

1191
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,000
You're making me not want to go as I've continued to not go for many years

1192
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I said we should go this year, Jason of course said no

1193
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
And I said it would be funny, but we'll talk about it

1194
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
We'll talk about it, and we've got some stuff coming up for this

1195
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
The most spookiest month of the year

1196
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Maybe Sector Keeper you can go when you're free and you're real

1197
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Do they let fourth graders go or is that too young?

1198
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I think you can go, right?

1199
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
I think you can go, I think they advise against it

1200
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
If you're with your cool uncles

1201
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Then you could go with

1202
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Yeah I should mention, you're my guardians

1203
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Oh, wait, that's the deal?

1204
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Like once you're free we take care of you?

1205
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
At the moment, yeah, I mean I'll do my best, but

1206
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Oh, because he doesn't know where his dad is, or where his family is

1207
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
The host of podcasts, the writer, your legal guardians?

1208
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Yes, and then when they can't do it, you can, right?

1209
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I mean yeah, I guess so

1210
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
The most read, the last guest out the door in the Sallena Saga series

1211
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Would have to take care of

1212
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
If that's okay

1213
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I'm okay with the wider part, certainly as for us

1214
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I mean is this some binding document that if from the afterlife

1215
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Like it's kind of above our heads so we have to do it

1216
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Or is this just like you're where you just want us to be your uncles?

1217
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Is there a difference in your hearts between the two?

1218
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Great question, legal responsibility helps make the case

1219
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Why don't we just see what happens when we get all 19 stones together?

1220
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Who knows, maybe you transform and you're the age you're supposed to be

1221
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Oh, that's interesting

1222
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
You won't need a guardian

1223
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
We're not, I don't know

1224
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
But he'll be like big and he won't know how to live on his own

1225
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Right, right

1226
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
You saw big, that was in your time

1227
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Yeah, yeah, I loved it

1228
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Well you might end up living a big life, we'll see

1229
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
It also sounds like Weger will watch me, right?

1230
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I mean, if we've established like a line of succession

1231
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I think the odds are pretty low that all three of these guys are going to be

1232
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
A separate malady

1233
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Yeah, they're all gonna be incapacitated and I'm gonna have to take control

1234
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
So I guess I'm okay with that

1235
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Okay, cool, alright, let's keep going

1236
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Boy, be careful, yeah, I get caught on a technicality

1237
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Well, let's go to a more pleasant, less scary character than these Halloween Horror Nights murderers that we've been discussing

1238
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Let's talk about our old pal ET

1239
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Yes, so we took a land bridge from Curious George over to ET

1240
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Which was, we were very, we were actually like a little, you know, speaking to you guys being good boys

1241
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:11,000
We were like a little worried because there was a universal employee at the end of this ramp that connects the two structures

1242
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And we were a little worried that this guy was going to give us some guff walking over there instead of driving on this, through this roadway

1243
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
But we just went for it

1244
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Can the listeners guess who was the most worried about this?

1245
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Who was the most hesitant?

1246
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I'm trying to even remember who was it

1247
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Who do you think?

1248
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Jason?

1249
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
It was me

1250
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
It was you, sir

1251
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Yeah, I felt like you were very hesitant to step foot even onto the-

1252
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I was hesitant because it was a pathway but it was kind of like a blocked off path

1253
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Let's say this though, we shouldn't have been walking there

1254
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Right

1255
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Probably not

1256
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Because if a-

1257
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
If it's open to pedestrians and there was a little-

1258
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
There was a little walkway but the walkways had things jutting out in front of them

1259
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
So there was no clear sidewalk to walk

1260
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Yes

1261
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
So I think in the official universal rule book that was against the rules

1262
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
And I think that that's for sure

1263
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
What is the line for if not for pedestrians to walk in?

1264
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I thought it was just a shoulder

1265
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I thought it was just like a little bit of-

1266
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Fair

1267
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Semperi shoulder

1268
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
A freeway doesn't have a sidewalk

1269
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Yeah

1270
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,000
They don't want- there's no practical reason to have people walking from parking garage to parking garage I don't think

1271
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Yeah

1272
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
I mean that's-

1273
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:29,000
To get to their vehicle in the dense web of many confusing parking garages

1274
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,000
If your car breaks down on the tiny bridge between ET and Curious George

1275
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Then you need a place to go out there and wait for the tow truck to come

1276
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
So you go over and-

1277
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
That's very true

1278
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
That's just shit on the little sidewalk there

1279
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I was initially nervous and then I gambled like this guy probably doesn't give a shit

1280
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Or like-

1281
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Your gamble was correct

1282
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Yeah or this guy was distracted by the incoming-

1283
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
He had a job to do

1284
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
There was a lot of cars coming in

1285
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Right

1286
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
And that's what he had to do because yeah Horror Nights was like an hour from starting

1287
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:05,000
We survived the pedestrian- not the pedestrian we survived the auto bridge, the first obstacle of our journey

1288
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
We made it

1289
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Yeah

1290
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:13,000
We made it into the ET structure and went up to the top and went to the furthest space that you could possibly park from the theme park

1291
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Yes

1292
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Which the number was 7W

1293
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Yeah so this is a 7 level structure

1294
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:27,000
If you're in ET 7W you are the furthest from the- which if you think about that the furthest corner of Universal Studios is probably the Transformers ride all the way

1295
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
It's like miles away, it's a literal miles long walk

1296
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I- when we were up there because there was that level was huge and completely vacant

1297
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
The exposed roof level and I was just thinking like man how fun would it be to ride some bikes up here?

1298
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Sure

1299
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Just like this giant open space to just ride around, that'd be a hoot

1300
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
They might let you, there's bike racks in these lots now

1301
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I bet if you brought a bike there and you went to the top level and you were just riding around while it was unoccupied you could do it for a while without anyone bothering you

1302
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Yeah I would be a little stressed out doing it

1303
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Yeah definitely

1304
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I mean I'd be stressed out doing it too because I mean I would- it might be fun to try

1305
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Sure

1306
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
A little stressed out doing our little- we did a little photo shoot up there, we took some pictures

1307
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
That's true

1308
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
You were stressed out about that?

1309
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,000
You know what I was more stressed out, Nick and I talked about this when we were up there

1310
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,000
This stressed me out more, they had blue light phones like every few spots

1311
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Yeah

1312
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:30,000
If you have been on a college campus you might know the blue light phones of like pick this up if there's an emergency

1313
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Right

1314
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
And they built those into the new garage

1315
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
That stressed you out?

1316
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Yeah

1317
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:43,000
So it indicated that there was not extreme security and that maybe like a Segway car, a Paul Blart might take a long time to get up to that level to help you

1318
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Well I think Jurassic Parking is so close to CityWalk, I don't think there's a lot of that there

1319
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
All of it is close to CityWalk

1320
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Yeah but this is like the farthest away from like if you needed security or something

1321
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Yes

1322
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
So I think it was a call box essentially

1323
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Yeah and you know maybe it's for auto trouble but I don't know and maybe it's something that was put- installed in the years before you know widespread cell phone ownership

1324
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
But it did make me think like oh this is a high crime zone

1325
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Please

1326
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Well and I don't want to dwell on this but there was a murder in a CityWalk parking garage

1327
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Wow

1328
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
And it's really bad, it's not a funny murder

1329
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Oh my god

1330
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:26,000
It's an awful murder and it does indicate that there's enough uncovered ground up there that something bad could happen

1331
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Sure

1332
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
And now one of you make a joke

1333
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Yeah

1334
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
What in your mind would constitute a funny murder?

1335
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Clown dying?

1336
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Well I guess it would

1337
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Yeah sure, I don't know somebody, I guess somebody falling off the structure wouldn't be funny

1338
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
No yeah

1339
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,000
But if he you know if he landed flat and a marching band walked over him like they could gun then yeah

1340
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Oh if one person falls in an open manhole, oh no that's tragedy

1341
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Yes

1342
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:01,000
As he takes a flick of his fidget spinner and looks wistfully into the distance to think about years gone by

1343
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
A million people die, no yes comedy one person falls in it

1344
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I was more reacting to what you did after the thought

1345
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:12,000
You know what I realized on the back of the little petals of this fidget spinner there are drawings of fidget spinners

1346
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
That's cool

1347
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Yeah

1348
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
That's awesome

1349
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Post pics of that for the audience

1350
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I think this is the quote, I think it's a version of this, it's comedy is one person falling into an open manhole and dying

1351
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Tragedy is when I stub my toe

1352
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:36,000
It's like the idea that something that happens to me is tragic no matter how small and something is comedic if it happens to someone else even if it's like horrific

1353
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Right that's it

1354
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,000
You know since we're talking manholes to get us to a lighter point

1355
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I'm probably jumping around I think this was in the Frankenstein lot but I'm not totally sure where but in one of the universal parking garages in the 90s

1356
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:57,000
There was an event that was only open for two weekends where you could go down a manhole and who would you meet but your pals the teenage mutant

1357
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Oh my god

1358
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Yeah you love them

1359
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I would have lost my mind

1360
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:10,000
They're still around they're still kicking ass there's a promo for this I'll put it on the Twitter but yeah seeing kids like sneak down they turned the top level of a parking garage

1361
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
That's so cool

1362
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Into a sewer

1363
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Oh my god

1364
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Legitimately cool there were TV ads for it that were fully produced even though it was only open for two weekends apparently but a friend of mine David Love went and in addition to that you could get like crazy turtle kinds of pizza

1365
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
You could get pizza with gummy worms on it and stuff like that

1366
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
That's so awesome

1367
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Oh heck yeah

1368
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Yeah that's your kind of food

1369
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:37,000
And I just somebody was just telling me about this because I got to do it when they were a kid and you would get a free figure

1370
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Yeah

1371
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
You would get a free and it looked like it was original

1372
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
This is insane

1373
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:52,000
It was original line figures it was all the original like you know just the turtle splinter shredder April you would get a free one and he said like you would just go back in line and get like you could go every day

1374
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
This sounds like something that your liar friend would say at school

1375
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Yes

1376
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
You know except that it's true

1377
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Yeah

1378
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:10,000
You know like your liar friend would always be like oh they're working on Super Mario 4 and it will be out like next month and you'll be like what are you talking about

1379
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I have a Ninja Turtle version of Liar Kid he goes I saw that I don't know what he called trailer the preview for the Ninja Turtle movie he goes there's a in the movie Leonardo takes his sword and slices Crane in half

1380
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
And I was like what?

1381
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Whoa

1382
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Oh my god

1383
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
It's much more grizzly than anything in a turtle movie

1384
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
But I thought that that was going to be in the movie when I saw the movie

1385
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
It's not true

1386
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
You didn't see it? It was out

1387
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Yeah I know I think about it I saw it

1388
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
That seems like you're lying now

1389
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
That seems like you didn't see it

1390
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
It's okay you didn't see it

1391
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
It's okay to say it

1392
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Yeah I just I don't know I just wanted to fit in

1393
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Hey Sector Keeper good news there's like three or four more Ninja Turtle movies you can see and like a dozen different cartoons with different animations

1394
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
There's so much content

1395
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Cool

1396
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Yeah

1397
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:14,000
They should make cause like now in this era of you know they've got we're building Harry Potter land we're building Star Wars land in this era they should build a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle sewer that you could go into and hang out in and you could just sort of like

1398
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:23,000
They've got a pizza joint down there they've got turtles walk around characters they've got kind of like their sort of lab laid out I mean that would be fucking amazing

1399
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Yeah dads and sons and daughters and moms would all enjoy it

1400
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Yes all the types

1401
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
All the types would enjoy it

1402
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:41,000
All the quadrants right cause Ninja Turtles has reached a point where people who grew up watching it now have kids yeah well they should 100% do this that actually described it sounded amazing

1403
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:49,000
This is one of the great properties that is untapped in theme park world and only was for two weekends apparently and there was a live show in Disney World but that wasn't much

1404
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Yeah but they would have to settle on one style of turtle unless it's a historical thing and they try to do all the styles of turtle

1405
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Well I mean you know they've got a color scheme they've at least decided upon that

1406
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Make them the theme park exclusive turtles a different design there's already 10 different designs let's make the 11th be the theme park exclusive turtles

1407
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And give them a little dick like you're Leonardo

1408
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Yeah post a picture of that little dick

1409
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
We will post a photo of Leonardo's little dick with a set of cupids right over your shoulder

1410
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Yeah I love it's cool

1411
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Yeah somebody said a turtle's sex organ is in his tail so that is Leonardo's dick

1412
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Oh the toy

1413
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
We're all staring at a turtle dick

1414
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Whoa Weiger Weiger easy you're gonna okay alright you're gonna break the toy

1415
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Make us put you in the penalty box again

1416
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
So yeah turtles

1417
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
He climbed over me to get it

1418
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I just want a closer look

1419
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:56,000
So the ET garage this is new though you mentioned like oh did they put the emergency phones out there

1420
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
This was built in conjunction with like oh we need more parking for the Harry Potter

1421
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
This is two or three years old

1422
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Wow this is that recent

1423
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Yeah

1424
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Okay

1425
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
That's why they have the electric vehicle charging in the bay in the lowest level

1426
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
And then cool tunnel the ET tunnel

1427
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
The ET tunnel is fucking awesome

1428
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Yeah it's this blue lit up hallway looks like something from a music video

1429
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Right

1430
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
And ET's there and the moon is there and the bikes are there

1431
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,000
It looks great and honestly it's like one of the best photo ops I think in CityWalk

1432
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Like it's just such a cool like that's worth the trip over to that ET parking garage if you like just cool shit to look at

1433
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I am surprised though hearing that this is a recent build

1434
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Why call it ET which is not the most irrelevant of properties in this day and age

1435
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Especially if it's built for Harry Potter demand

1436
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Like why not a Harry Potter

1437
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
You know I wonder because there are no Harry Potter lots

1438
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I wonder if because there's no levels either right that ever have Harry Potter

1439
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,000
I wonder if that's in the JK Rowling agreement that like Harry isn't a fucking parking garage character

1440
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Right

1441
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
He lives in Hogsmeade or whatever in Hogwarts castle

1442
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:12,000
I wonder because it seems like that they have such a specific like hold on that to not use it in certain ways

1443
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Like Harry can't just be hanging

1444
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Like for instance if Harry was around when that Trump photo was taken with The Apprentice

1445
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Harry would have been barred from appearing with Trump

1446
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,000
There's this crazy photo where Trump is like clearly in the middle of you're fired

1447
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
And he's with Curious George and Frankenstein

1448
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
And Shrek is there

1449
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Bizarre tableau

1450
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:37,000
They're all dressed like Trump except for the mummy who doesn't have Trump pants

1451
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
He has his regular mummy legs

1452
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Right

1453
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Otherwise and since they're all suited characters they're all looking in different directions

1454
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
So Shrek doesn't know where the camera is nor does Frankenstein

1455
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
It's great

1456
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,000
And if that had been the furthest Trump had ascended in power

1457
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I would love Trump

1458
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
He's friends with Shrek

1459
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Of course

1460
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
A friend of Shrek is a friend of mine

1461
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Do we have more about ET or do we keep marching?

1462
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
ET is the best parking garage

1463
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Yes that is

1464
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
High ceilings even though we got lost in it

1465
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
They just really the problem with it is the cleanest they need more employees directing

1466
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
But like when you go down to electric vehicle charging it's very spacious

1467
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I mean the ceiling is high it's fairly nice

1468
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
You go right to the escalator there's a little bridge and then you're over there

1469
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:30,000
If all the parking garages were like that I think you've got it's a whole different ballgame

1470
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Absolutely

1471
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Half the size of Mickey and Friends for those keeping track of fans

1472
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Interesting

1473
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Wow

1474
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
That's a pretty mighty parking garage and still only half the size pretty crazy

1475
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Let's keep marching to Jurassic Parking

1476
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Which we tried to walk into and we got up to the end of some stairs that led nowhere

1477
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Even though there was a big sign that said Jurassic Parking

1478
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,000
I think everyone likes that it is Jurassic Parking

1479
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
That's fun and you see people Instagram that or tweet that

1480
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I just wanted to mention real quick because you were talking about walking up those stairs

1481
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:09,000
One of the things we walked by climbing those stairs were some bad kids sitting on the stairs vaping

1482
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
And that's just like an element that you have to compete with at CityWalk

1483
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Because there's some roughnecks about it

1484
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
And I kind of like

1485
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:23,000
It is the kind of thing where I'm so much more of a Disney guy that that element of CityWalk

1486
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
When I'm around like oh I might just stumble upon some deviant youth

1487
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I'm just like I'd rather not deal with that

1488
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
I'd rather be around some wholesome families having a good time

1489
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Yeah say that for the walk over like I did

1490
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
When you're down at the metro stop

1491
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,000
But yeah Jurassic, the pun

1492
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Okay I like the pun in isolation

1493
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,000
But in the context of the other lots it doesn't work

1494
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Because one is called Jurassic Parking

1495
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,000
And then the other just named like the name of the property or the name of the character

1496
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Frankenstein Parking

1497
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Exactly you have to make some sort of effort at puns for the rest of them

1498
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Or you don't do the Jurassic Park one

1499
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Because that's also too that's the one that's not a character

1500
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Like a lot of them yes, Curious George and E.T. are the names of the franchises

1501
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
But they're also the name of the characters

1502
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Jurassic Park is not a character

1503
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:19,000
It is a I mean in a sense Jurassic Park the setting is a character in the film of course

1504
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:26,000
In the same way that New York is a character in Woody Allen's Any Hall

1505
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Oh fuck I never thought of it like that

1506
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
But it's like it's so

1507
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
But it should be like the Ian Malcolm lot or something like that right

1508
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
It should be like a character from Jurassic Park

1509
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
If it was the Velociraptor lot

1510
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
If it was that sexy Ian Malcolm that everybody likes online

1511
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
And that with that artwork

1512
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
That would be great

1513
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I mean that's a little too body for me

1514
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
It's also bleeding

1515
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Everyone forgets sexy Ian Malcolm is bleeding

1516
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Make it as you're saying E.T. is a little old

1517
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Like make it the new character you know the main character of Jurassic World

1518
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
That character that we all can name right now

1519
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Oh you Chris Pratt's character

1520
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
No but his name we know his name

1521
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
One two three four Owen Grady

1522
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Of course right

1523
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Owen Grady everyone said it

1524
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I definitely didn't say Jonathan Borg I said Owen Grady

1525
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I think is Grady's last name?

1526
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Yes

1527
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Yes it is

1528
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,000
There will be no further discussion at this point because it is

1529
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I agree

1530
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Jurassic Parking is really where it gets chaotic

1531
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
That's where chaos theory unfolds

1532
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
That lot sucks

1533
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Yes I think that's I think I would call that the worst

1534
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
It's the most claustrophobic and it's the one where

1535
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,000
If you park in there you don't know where you're going to come out

1536
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
You don't know if it will be in the food court

1537
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
You don't know if it will be above the Bubba Gump

1538
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I think there's still another one like under the Skechers

1539
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,000
It has many exits and you don't know which one it's going to be

1540
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
If you're trying to meet friends you don't know how to meet them and where

1541
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:04,000
A lot of times you have to immediately like walk to the edge of it

1542
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
And then go down to get to what feels like Gramp

1543
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
But like it can trick you into thinking like wait no I thought I was on Gramp

1544
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
But it's like no you might have to go down one or two escalators

1545
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
It has a light tunnel too similar to ET

1546
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I think it's just not as good

1547
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
No it's not

1548
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,000
It also has an area that has caused us a lot of turmoil

1549
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
And that is the valet lot

1550
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,000
And we have several instances of parking in the valet lot to talk about

1551
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I think Peter complained about this a little bit when he was on

1552
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
But we've had some incidents as well

1553
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Would you like to talk about I believe you have one but there's also another story

1554
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I have a valet

1555
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I tried valeting in both of the Frankenstein and Jurassic Park

1556
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Mr. $90 huh?

1557
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Well there were seven they were $7 because I had meals

1558
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Set a timer and sprint to your destination

1559
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Yeah man that's stressful

1560
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:06,000
I did the Jurassic Park honestly the Jurassic Parking valet even though it's not as nice aesthetically because it's older

1561
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
That went or no excuse me I reversed that

1562
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
That one actually is nicer than Frankenstein

1563
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Frankenstein valet

1564
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Well do we save it for Frankenstein?

1565
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Yeah that's what maybe

1566
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Because the other story we have is about Jurassic

1567
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
So should I is that what you're getting at?

1568
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Alright so here's what's happening earlier in the series in a previous sector

1569
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:31,000
We pre-recorded some thoughts about a valet incident with our guest Jason Walliner

1570
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,000
And now we turn to a pre-tape

1571
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Hey future us it's we're back here in sector three having just recorded with Jason Walliner

1572
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Yeah what are your lives like now I want to know

1573
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
How is it going up there in three weeks from now?

1574
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Yeah you got to be having a blast especially wandering around the parking garage

1575
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Anyway so we're here to talk about our experience with Jason while you're here

1576
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Because you utilize the valet parking at City Walk and had a particularly odd experience

1577
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Yeah I found out because I was going there to meet a friend a couple months ago at Margaritaville

1578
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:24,000
And they said if you valet you can get it validated at Margaritaville or Bubba Gump

1579
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Or any of the sit down restaurants not the fast food places

1580
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,000
But any of the sit down restaurants validate and instead of 25 bucks it's like 7 dollars

1581
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:37,000
So I valeted and then we went and checked out sector three

1582
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,000
And then you guys kind of walked me around and talked about the other sectors

1583
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:48,000
And then you guys had wisely parked outside of the camp property

1584
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I was dropped off by my wife you guys walked from very far away in the neighborhood

1585
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
So I was going to give you guys a ride back to your car

1586
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:04,000
So I got it validated at Bubba Gump having not eaten there

1587
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Which is kind of a hack that I came up with

1588
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:12,000
I walked into the gift shop and I was like hey could you validate this

1589
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
And she did

1590
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
So I didn't say that I had eaten there

1591
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Do I come off bad in this anecdote?

1592
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
No I mean we're good boys as you know on this podcast

1593
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,000
So we're a little uncomfortable by it but we've straight here and there

1594
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
We've done some things similar to this

1595
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Jack Allison ripped off City Walk more than any other guest

1596
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,000
So you're not as high on the spectrum as Jack on the ripoff spectrum

1597
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
How did he do it?

1598
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Well the audience has heard this now back in whatever sector he was in

1599
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:50,000
But he snuck into Universal he put highlighter on the back of his hand and said it was a stamp

1600
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Oh that's much more than just elevation here

1601
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
But you were punished then

1602
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,000
That actually, slightly less future us knows that

1603
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Past us maybe shouldn't know that

1604
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Oh boy we're hitting some paradoxes

1605
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:14,000
So then we went to the valet and to pay the $7 I was planning to pay

1606
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
And then the guy was like $45

1607
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I was like what? No I got the, do you not see the Bubba Gump stamp on my ticket?

1608
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:32,000
And he points to the sign which says, I can send this to you guys if you want to put it on the Facebook group

1609
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Should we blur the guy's face?

1610
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:44,000
So the unvalidated it's $25 for 2 hours, 45 after 2 hours

1611
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Validated it's $7 for 2.5 hours, 15 for up to 3.5 hours and then 45 after that

1612
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:58,000
And we were like just over 3.5 hours or I was because I got there a little earlier

1613
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,000
So the tiers of this to say those prices again

1614
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Yeah it's $7, 15, 45

1615
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
It comes from 15 to 45

1616
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:18,000
It makes sense that once you get to 3.5 hours if you have the balls to present them a validated ticket

1617
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Thinking you'll get a discount but you spent 3.5 hours there

1618
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,000
They want to say to you no you're not getting any discount

1619
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Like you obviously, you didn't come here just to eat

1620
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
You came here to enjoy this place and you're going to pay like anyone else

1621
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
But Mike was saying, well there's the trick

1622
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:43,000
The upside is he knew a trick that when you valet they give you a golden token

1623
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Official golden City Walk coin I'm holding in my hand for a coffee machine

1624
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
A sort of instantly or hot chocolate

1625
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
You know you pick your drink

1626
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
One side of the coin says City Walk, one side says Cup of Joe

1627
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
So these are specially made

1628
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Oh yeah and he told us that while we were walking over he was like you gotta get that token

1629
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,000
You have to ask for it because I've seen people not ask and not get it

1630
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
And so I was like $45 I validated it and he's like look at the sign

1631
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:16,000
It doesn't matter after 3.5 hours and I was like well can I at least have my token please

1632
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:21,000
And he went yeah sure and handed it to you and then we went around the corner

1633
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:25,000
And the machine has a giant Aldebaran sign on it

1634
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,000
And there's no way he didn't know that the machine is broken right

1635
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
He would already have gotten into it a little with him

1636
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
$45 what do you mean yeah that's what it is it's on the sign

1637
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Okay can I have the token?

1638
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Just give me the damn token

1639
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Yeah go get your coffee white don't you

1640
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
It's like the last little bit of

1641
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
He got a dig in at you at the end

1642
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Yeah

1643
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,000
The reveal as we rounded the corner that the coffee machine that you spoke of so highly

1644
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:53,000
You as if clear dialogue in a film you have to get the token to get that coffee

1645
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Oh that sounds good I love getting free coffee at places

1646
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Yeah there was

1647
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Alright let's go get the coffee turn the corner out of order

1648
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Also he should have given us four tokens for our troubles

1649
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Good point every time

1650
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
That was never going to happen

1651
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,000
He's only been one so yeah that seems that seems like a pie in the sky kind of a thinking there

1652
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
That's too much money they don't want to piss away

1653
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
So this was a disastrous encounter

1654
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
As well as my valet parking experience

1655
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Presumably I'm not sure how this is going to plug into the episode but we're probably about an hour and 45 minutes deep into

1656
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Complaining about other parking issues so this settles right in and helps us

1657
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:35,000
And we'll pass the baton to Nick Weiger now and see where he takes this discussion

1658
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:39,000
But I'd like to just point out though that this makes Jason Wollner a four time guest

1659
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I don't know if that really matters

1660
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Four time is cool

1661
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Oh wow

1662
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Yeah well congratulations

1663
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Anything you'd like to say to Nick Weiger

1664
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Wish him luck on the episode

1665
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Yeah good luck and yeah just go for it just you know yeah here's the baton

1666
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And just like me in the past I now hold that golden coffee cup point in my hand

1667
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
There it is

1668
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,000
From the story from 15 sectors ago

1669
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
From the very story

1670
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Wow

1671
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
I've held it on to my person this whole time

1672
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Is that ebayable

1673
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Maybe

1674
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
It is now with photos with certification

1675
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Well as we learned from Jason in the prior episode if we get a photo of Leah Thompson

1676
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Signing it or something next to it then that validates everything

1677
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:46,000
But anyway that story just meant to show the madness and the depths that the valet situation

1678
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Can lead people to $45 cards and coins there's so much confusion

1679
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Yeah I was just gonna say I set it off there but I should have set it on my story is worse

1680
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Wow

1681
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Yeah exactly but when we get to Frank I mean maybe we'll write here but whatever you're gonna say

1682
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Well the other lots I don't have much to say about

1683
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:14,000
The last thing I'll say about Jurassic Parking is there shouldn't be a situation at a theme park

1684
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Where people are stalking people leaving

1685
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Which is one of my I hate when people in a parking garage wait and sit and wait for somebody to pull out

1686
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
I agree

1687
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
There's gonna be another space just move you're stopping the whole thing from like

1688
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Oh that's the worst

1689
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Following people but this parking garage is constantly it's happening and it's so narrow

1690
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,000
That it's hard to go around sometimes it blocks the whole thing up

1691
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Yeah

1692
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Like it's the worst parking garage there

1693
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
The most bottlenecks

1694
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:46,000
And that especially like because there's you know there's no employees there and at that point

1695
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
It's been filled up because I think they must fill this one up early

1696
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Well this one I think is kind of where you it's not a guarantee but if you're coming from Lancashen

1697
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,000
This is probably where they'll direct you again no guarantees

1698
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,000
I'll say this about Jurassic Parking it's got a nice little the valet part has a nice little lighting

1699
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Yes that's nice

1700
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Popcorn lights

1701
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
That is nice

1702
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:10,000
And when I went up for my solo buka meal

1703
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:15,000
I got the coffee machine was working and I had a nice

1704
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Oh hell yeah

1705
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Oh there you go

1706
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
There are happy endings

1707
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
So that was good

1708
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,000
The first time too when I went up and I did the Jurassic Parking valet that's the cough

1709
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:29,000
That's when I learned about it I went I got Johnny Rockets validated and I had like a hot

1710
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Cocoa in my car on a 90 degree day

1711
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
With no lid filled right to the top

1712
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
With no lid yeah

1713
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:41,000
But it sounds like we've had two positive experiences and two negative which is not a great ratio

1714
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,000
So yeah as far as Jurassic Parking that's those are my thoughts

1715
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Jurassic Parking should be chained

1716
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
They need to do some work

1717
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
They gotta do something

1718
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Demolish it

1719
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Blow it up like Jurassic Park itself

1720
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Yes

1721
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
It's time for a site two

1722
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Yeah

1723
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Bomb it like they did at the end of the first book

1724
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
In the book and not

1725
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Isla Nublar was bombed I believe yeah that's right

1726
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Because they weren't thinking about it the sequel

1727
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Right like the Jurassic Park franchise the

1728
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:17,000
There's just so much peril and danger and honestly like inconsistent quality in Jurassic Parking

1729
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,000
And you know I mean that's just an issue

1730
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:26,000
I would say that for hearing your guys' valet stories I've never attempted to valet universal

1731
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:31,000
But it seems like the valet hacks are high risk high reward

1732
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Like the reward is like getting $7 parking that's great

1733
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,000
But the risk of getting $45 parking is just so punishing

1734
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Like that is just it's such a

1735
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:46,000
It's crazy and I'll say bigger picture I think the general parking rates

1736
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
It really seems like early generation CityWalk

1737
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
It seems like they wanted the locals to come

1738
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Now it seems like they're trying to keep people out

1739
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
It's pretty hostile in terms of how expensive it is

1740
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Yeah I mean even like I guess like oh after six o'clock $10

1741
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:06,000
I guess that's okay but you can go to other malls in L.A. and park for free

1742
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:11,000
It's just a mall you can go yeah it's like you know what's another comparison

1743
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,000
The Grove the Grove parking is no is you have to pay at the Grove

1744
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
But it's nowhere near as expensive as it is at CityWalk

1745
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
And there's much better stuff to do there

1746
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
There's more stuff there

1747
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
It is better

1748
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Yes

1749
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:30,000
So why how does CityWalk hang on and especially how do they hang on when this is how they treat their parkers

1750
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
It's just such a it's a small amount of real estate

1751
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Yeah

1752
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:38,000
That's the problem because there's a if there wasn't a theme park attached to it that's the issue here

1753
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Right

1754
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Because the theme park lives on sucking parking money out of people

1755
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Yes

1756
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
And there happens to be one that's just plugged in next to it

1757
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:52,000
So it's impossible to take that element out of the because everyone would be parking up there for free then

1758
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
It's serving dual purposes and that's its downfall

1759
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
But if you went to Shoe Palace and bought like a 50 or 60 dollar pair of sneakers

1760
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
And they won't validate like that's crazy

1761
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Yeah

1762
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
And then you spent $25 for parking

1763
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
But they probably worried about like a trick where you would like get it valid

1764
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Like there would be so many ways to validate general parking it would be like crazy

1765
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Yeah I mean the only way to live in LA for sustainable amount of time is to figure out all the tricks

1766
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Sure I hear what you're saying

1767
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
These tricks that we're giving you if you're thinking about moving to LA

1768
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
These will be crucial

1769
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
This might be

1770
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Or you could not go to CityWalk at all

1771
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
But don't do that

1772
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
That's not a way to live

1773
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
You want to go to the Americana

1774
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,000
You want to go to the Americana park at the Galleria by the Target

1775
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
It's free

1776
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Let me do my story then

1777
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Yes please

1778
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Let me ask what we got for Frankenstein

1779
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
We'll start here

1780
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Okay

1781
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
So this was at the Bucco di Beppo episode

1782
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Or Pepo as Jason called it on the episode

1783
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Remember everything

1784
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
What is it supposed to be called?

1785
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Bucco di Beppo

1786
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
B

1787
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
B not a P

1788
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Where did you get Pepo?

1789
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
I think I was saying Beppo

1790
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
You said Pepo and Scott says like oh he doesn't even say it right

1791
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Beppo

1792
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
You said Pepo

1793
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,000
And in that one episode you did say that's a good note to go down on

1794
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Hey 24 7 365 something stays on my mind right folks?

1795
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
No

1796
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Oh whoa

1797
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Do you know what that even don't even

1798
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Do you know about Runaway?

1799
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
The Kanye West song

1800
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
You know you don't even know who he is

1801
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
No

1802
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Jason's being naughty

1803
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Yeah naughty

1804
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Okay so

1805
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
So we're back to

1806
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:29,000
I think if I remember when I was amongst you during that time

1807
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
You blamed it on having Philly mouth

1808
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Well I did that is true

1809
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
You mush mouth it a little bit

1810
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Philly mouth

1811
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,000
We get so angry sometimes we can't even finish the words correctly

1812
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Bucco di Pepo but it's Beppo

1813
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Beppo?

1814
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Yeah

1815
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Yeah you're saying it right now

1816
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
The sector keeper told you a long time ago

1817
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
So you did think that was Pepo

1818
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
That was not just a Philly mouth

1819
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
No I know it's a B

1820
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Oh you do

1821
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Beppo

1822
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
You're saying P though

1823
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
You're definitely out loud saying P

1824
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Pepo

1825
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
And I guess you're thinking about P too

1826
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Tell us your fucking story

1827
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Okay my fucking story

1828
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Frankenstein valet it was the Monday episode

1829
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
And Monday and I were running a little late

1830
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,000
We had just come from an important digital content

1831
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
That we were involved in some digital content

1832
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Very cool

1833
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
On Wilshire

1834
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Really?

1835
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
And yeah so we were running a little late

1836
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
And we were coming

1837
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
I was like you know what

1838
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
We're gonna valet

1839
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
It's gonna be right there

1840
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
It's gonna be no problem

1841
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I thought we were going to the Jurassic valet

1842
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
It's impossible to figure out how to get to

1843
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
One specific parking structure

1844
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Like if you're coming up Lancashire

1845
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
I'm like I know where we're supposed to go

1846
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
And I thought we were going in the right spot

1847
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
But we ended up in Frankenstein

1848
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Which is on the other side of City Walk

1849
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
From the Bucco di Beppo

1850
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
And so we went in

1851
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I go no problem valet

1852
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
We just walk across City Walk

1853
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
It's still you know six seven minutes

1854
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
But not a big deal

1855
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
We go to valet

1856
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Everything's fine

1857
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
We have the keys

1858
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
We have a nice time

1859
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
I get a free hat

1860
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
It's lovely

1861
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
We go back

1862
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
And it's about 9.30

1863
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
It was not a late night

1864
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
We got there at 7.05 or something

1865
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
And I know

1866
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Because I checked texts of like telling Scott

1867
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
We're here

1868
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
So I go up

1869
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,000
I put the ticket down

1870
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
And the guy goes $25

1871
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
And I go no no no

1872
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I go it's I was here

1873
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
For under two hours

1874
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
And he goes no you were here at six

1875
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Like 15

1876
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
And I go no

1877
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
There's no way I was here for six

1878
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
At six fifteen

1879
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,000
He goes the card says six fifteen

1880
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
I was like but

1881
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
And I'm just like I don't know how many

1882
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
I go I can show you text messages

1883
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
That say I'm here

1884
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
I go there's no way

1885
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
I got here at seven oh five

1886
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
That's not

1887
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
I'm not crazy

1888
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
And the guy's like it says six fifteen

1889
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
$25

1890
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
And I was like but you don't understand

1891
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
I'm not trying to scam you or anything

1892
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
I go it's truly I ate dinner

1893
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
And then we went to the hat store

1894
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
And we're here

1895
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
I'm not he goes

1896
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
And then I see the valet

1897
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,000
So now I'm to a person that's just watching this go down

1898
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
I'm a madman

1899
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
I see a valet

1900
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
I go hey oh hey hey

1901
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
You remember like I came in

1902
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Like a little while

1903
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,000
He looks at me like he's never seen me in his whole life

1904
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
And he's like oh I don't hey I don't know

1905
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
I'm not sure

1906
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
I go but I came in earlier

1907
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
And I go you know it was like around seven o'clock

1908
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
And the guys are going I don't know man

1909
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I'm so I don't know I don't know what you're talking like

1910
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
He just was like I don't need to deal with this maniac

1911
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
And I go back up there I'm like I don't

1912
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
And Monday was just sitting over

1913
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Like far away just looking at his phone

1914
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
He was not involved in this at all

1915
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
I kind of wish he was

1916
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Because I think he would have like put his fist through the glass

1917
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
He's always saying he'll stick up for us

1918
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Right

1919
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
And beat somebody up for us

1920
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
This was his chance

1921
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,000
He loves

1922
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
He didn't say it

1923
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
He loves talking about how like

1924
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
The acquaintances of his

1925
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
He would like bring a gun and meet them

1926
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Somewhere downtown if they asked him to

1927
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
He said that about Evan Susser

1928
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
He said I don't know Susser that well

1929
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
But if he needed me to kill somebody for him

1930
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
In the middle of the night I would do it

1931
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Quote Nick Mundy

1932
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
He did say that yeah

1933
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,000
We were talking on the phone

1934
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
And he's sitting there ignoring

1935
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
This crisis you're in

1936
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Yes he could have come in and like

1937
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
He I'm not a tough guy

1938
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
He's a tough guy

1939
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
He could have really intimidated this guy

1940
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
And this guy and I are just having a standoff

1941
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
And I'm like

1942
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
I'm feeling crazy because there's no

1943
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Chance

1944
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
That we pulled in at 6.15

1945
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
There's no chance

1946
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Hold on so was the card time stamped

1947
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Yes

1948
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
So what must have happened is somebody

1949
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Timestamped a card before

1950
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
I was even in there and they didn't even realize it

1951
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Yeah that's shady fucking business

1952
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
That's so crazy

1953
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
You're supposed to use

1954
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
You're paying a premium to use the valet

1955
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
You're supposed to get a different level

1956
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Of service

1957
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
And it wasn't even like

1958
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
The guy who couldn't

1959
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
And again these people are

1960
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Who knows how they're paid or treated

1961
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
But like the guy could have given a fuck about

1962
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Like he was just like

1963
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Either I don't believe you

1964
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I don't care

1965
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
I paid $25 to get my card

1966
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Like I felt so crazy

1967
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
That sucks

1968
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Like I was trying to prove every which way

1969
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
And no there was no

1970
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
So I was like fuck

1971
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
This is the worst

1972
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
What a nightmare

1973
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Denied at every turn

1974
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Using logic

1975
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
And you don't feel like you're being heard

1976
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
It's like the American people right now

1977
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
You were a make up for

1978
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
You weren't represented

1979
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Thank you

1980
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
It is exactly like that

1981
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Someone had to say

1982
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
So is it

1983
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
So you had the card in your possession the entire time

1984
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Yes and then they validated that at Bucatibepo

1985
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
So the fraud took place before you were handed the card

1986
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Right so what must have happened was

1987
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Either somebody came in

1988
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
And they thought they were going to have to go valet

1989
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
And they pulled out

1990
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,000
And they stamped a card

1991
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
And then ended up just putting it on the thing

1992
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Or there's some funny business going on

1993
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Or they transposed that card with a different card

1994
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Like they should have handed you a different thing

1995
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Maybe

1996
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
I mean they

1997
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
The problem is then too

1998
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Is that the guy had already taken the card

1999
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
So I never got a chance to take a picture of the card

2000
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
To sort of like figure it out

2001
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
I should have

2002
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
You know I really should have emailed and complained about it

2003
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I was waiting to say it on the show

2004
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
I can still email and complain

2005
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
You're waiting for a fan to write all this fan

2006
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
And them to email it

2007
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:05,000
They owe me 18 motherfucking dollars

2008
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
They absolutely do

2009
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Yeah let's get your 18 dollars

2010
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
But we need to get Jason's Lowry's points back

2011
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Landry's points

2012
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Landry's points

2013
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
That's my mistake

2014
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
We need to get our 15 dollars each

2015
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
We paid Jason Woolitor

2016
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Boys, boys, boys

2017
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Yes

2018
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Rob the vault

2019
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Wow

2020
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Why aren't we talking 18 dollars

2021
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
When we could have 10 thousand dollars

2022
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Good point

2023
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
He's really been listening to that new metal

2024
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
The situation you've described

2025
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
You would have had to

2026
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Enter from Lancashire

2027
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
You would have had to avoid it

2028
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,000
The little turnstiles to go into Jurassic Parking

2029
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Taking the road down

2030
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Past the hotel that kind of wraps around the Hilton

2031
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
To get to Frankenstein?

2032
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
No, no to get to Jurassic Valley

2033
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
If I wanted to do that you're saying

2034
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
If you wanted to do that

2035
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
You would have had to take this little road

2036
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Right, right

2037
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,000
That goes by the old box office for the

2038
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
The late Gibson amphitheater

2039
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,000
And then gone up the entrance from Cuenca

2040
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Yes, that's correct

2041
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Which is craite

2042
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Such a pain in the ass

2043
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Right

2044
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Why isn't there just signage directing you towards these lots

2045
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Why isn't there just a clear way to get there

2046
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Kind of is, but it's rough

2047
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
The problem is

2048
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
The problem is it's too much information

2049
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
As far as which valley you're going to go to

2050
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
To convey to a person driving

2051
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Right

2052
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Like they're on opposite sides of City Walk

2053
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
But it's going to be impossible to be like

2054
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Where are you going in City Walk on a sign

2055
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
And say here and then direct people

2056
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Like it's that's

2057
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
I get it that it's just like

2058
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Valley parking this way

2059
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
And if you came up here you're going here

2060
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
And if you came up off of Ventura you're going here

2061
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
We know City Walk better at this point

2062
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Than any other human being on the planet

2063
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
And it's still

2064
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Other than the people who built it maybe

2065
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Yeah

2066
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
To figure it out

2067
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
There shouldn't be complicated verbal maps

2068
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
That have to be described

2069
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
There shouldn't be tickets with false timestamps

2070
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
No

2071
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
And coins

2072
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
No

2073
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
That don't lead to free coffee

2074
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
This is all madness

2075
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
It's madness

2076
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
And you know we could keep talking about

2077
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
The other parking garage

2078
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Throw in anything else you have

2079
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,000
But this is all

2080
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
It's led me to a higher point

2081
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
That

2082
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Okay

2083
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
In the first episode we talked about

2084
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Some general stuff about City Walk

2085
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
And the founding of City Walk

2086
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
And what it was trying to do

2087
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
And what neighbors wanted out of it

2088
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
But there were

2089
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,000
I didn't get into this in episode one

2090
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
There were a lot of people

2091
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Who were angry about City Walk

2092
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Authors and social critics

2093
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
And that kind of thing

2094
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Wow

2095
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
And I have some quotes from a couple different sources

2096
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
But it starts with

2097
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
A book called City of Quartz

2098
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Excavating the Future

2099
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,000
The author Mike Davis

2100
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Who sighs at the mention of City Walk

2101
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
And let me

2102
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
The bigger

2103
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,000
The entry point for all this

2104
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Is that people were upset

2105
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
When it started

2106
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
That you know

2107
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Like town centers should be

2108
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
A vibrant part of the town

2109
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
It should be up on a hill

2110
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
And only for the super wealthy

2111
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
It is like City Walk is trying to get people

2112
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Without money to stay down

2113
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
To not climb up the hill

2114
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Right

2115
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
If you are a poor person in a wheelchair

2116
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Who can't roll your chair

2117
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Up the freeway overpass

2118
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
And to get up to

2119
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
The Golden City on the hill

2120
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
What do you do

2121
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
So authors that people were tearing apart

2122
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
City Walk in 1993

2123
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
And here is a couple of choice quotes

2124
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I consider

2125
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Mike Davis

2126
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
I consider it the moral equivalent of the neutron bomb

2127
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
MCA executives have always stressed

2128
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,000
The most popular parts of LA are now too dangerous

2129
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
The city scene is a criminalized third world

2130
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
So now they go off the real world

2131
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
To simulators

2132
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Buzz buzz

2133
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
There is a struggle going on today

2134
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
To save the democracy of public space

2135
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
I think City Walk ought to be burnt down

2136
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Wow

2137
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
That is harsh

2138
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
From social critics

2139
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Here is one I don't know the source of this

2140
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
You can Google this quote

2141
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Or I will figure out where it is from

2142
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
This guy gets even heavier

2143
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
City Walk sneeringly mocks us

2144
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
As it erases any trace of our real joy

2145
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Pain or labor

2146
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
City Walk is the moment when

2147
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Baudrillard, not sure that is

2148
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Draws a huge satisfied breath

2149
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
And draws deeply on his cigar

2150
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
It is the simulacrum of the simulacrum

2151
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,000
And then there is further quotes about how LA's

2152
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,000
You know, the MCA executives did say

2153
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Downtown is too dangerous

2154
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
We built a city for you

2155
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
So you don't have to get into gunfire

2156
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
They said real brazen stuff like that

2157
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:23,000
And that leads this author to this quote

2158
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
This author predicts

2159
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
That as economic problems worsen

2160
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
The territorial carve up of LA

2161
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Will lead to a Brazilian or Filipino style

2162
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Final solution

2163
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Private death squads protecting the enclaves

2164
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Of the super rich from everyone else

2165
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Wow

2166
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Yeah, kill me with a gun

2167
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Universal death squads

2168
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Whoa

2169
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
So this is

2170
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
By episode one

2171
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I thought this is silly

2172
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
So that is pretty insane to derive all that

2173
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,000
From just putting a fake city up on a hill

2174
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
But after all of this parking madness

2175
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,000
I kind of think Mike Davis, author of City of Quartz

2176
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Is onto something

2177
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
And now I'm getting real worried about those death squads

2178
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Yeah

2179
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Well, Uhteriard is a French philosopher and sociologist

2180
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Often quoted in like college

2181
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,000
You know, meta-textual papers and stuff

2182
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
And in comedy stuff written by Harvard dudes

2183
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Right

2184
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
I see, okay, very good

2185
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
So anyway

2186
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Yeah, the kind of people who read Howard Zinn

2187
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,000
There's George Will quotes in year two

2188
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
There's a lot going on

2189
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Wow

2190
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Oh, God

2191
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I wish there was baseball up there

2192
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
You know that bitch loves baseball

2193
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
George Will, you a bitch who loves baseball

2194
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Now that's one for the Harvard guys

2195
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
So, I don't know

2196
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Don't these quotes ring a little more true to you

2197
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Having been in these, you know

2198
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
These awful confined quarters

2199
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
In these parking garages

2200
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Here's the thing

2201
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
There's places in Los Angeles

2202
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Up in hills

2203
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Like little places to shop

2204
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:02,000
And you really get the sense that

2205
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
These are for rich people

2206
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
All the shops are for rich people

2207
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
And it's like it's literally up a hill

2208
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
So if you're homeless

2209
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
There's no way you're walking up that hill to go get up here

2210
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I think there's truth to it because of geography

2211
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
If City Walk wasn't just full of trash

2212
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Right

2213
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
And I mean food

2214
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
I mean

2215
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
They're protecting the flip flops from the poor

2216
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,000
If it was a much more attempted high brow experience

2217
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,000
I would more agree with what all of these people are saying

2218
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
But

2219
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
And I say trash

2220
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Mostly lovingly

2221
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
It's full of trash

2222
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
We had a good time

2223
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,000
I've ended up being more positive in this series than I thought I would be

2224
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
But this parking garage

2225
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
The more you lay it all out

2226
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
You hear Jason's tale of woe

2227
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
They're frustrated

2228
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Here's the issue

2229
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
And this is what Mickey and Friends gets right

2230
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Is that the start and end of a day of a delightful day

2231
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Is as stress free as a stressful thing can be

2232
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Right

2233
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
And here I feel like it's the most stressful parking situation you'll ever encounter

2234
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Both parking and exiting

2235
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:13,000
In particular hearing your guys' stories about valets and hacks gone wrong

2236
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:20,000
It's just you potentially could be left with a very large bill upon exiting the lot

2237
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Exiting CityWalk slash Universal Studios where you've already spent a lot of money

2238
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Where it was already an indulgence

2239
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
It's like an extra fuck you out the door

2240
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Sure

2241
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:34,000
And that is not what a parking structure should accomplish

2242
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,000
To the quotes you were talking

2243
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:43,000
CityWalk is not an exclusive enclave for the super wealthy

2244
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
It is not the Brentwood Country Mart

2245
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:53,000
It's very different than what those people were anticipating it was going to become

2246
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Because to Carlson's point it is just a trash place

2247
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
It's just a junkyard

2248
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:05,000
The super enclave for the super wealthy don't usually have an upside down pink Cadillac with a cow in the driver's seat

2249
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Not all the way, they might

2250
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Yeah

2251
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,000
There isn't a giant candy store

2252
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:16,000
It's a tacky place

2253
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
It's very tacky

2254
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
It's a super tacky place

2255
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:19,000
It's a touristy place

2256
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:23,000
The parking structures I think suck

2257
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Frankenstein lot I've never parked in

2258
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:29,000
The thing I liked about it is that it's underneath the Minion Mayham ride which is great

2259
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
That's kind of cool that you're just underneath it

2260
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
And I think the signage there is actually kind of fun

2261
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:39,000
There was a Frankenstein restroom sign that you took a picture of

2262
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,000
That I thought was just in a nice

2263
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Where the bathroom silhouettes, one was the hair of the bride of Frankenstein

2264
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:50,000
And one was like a Frankenstein monster

2265
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Which is great, that's a lot of fun

2266
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
I would like that

2267
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Thanks for getting back to a positive note

2268
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I think the theming at the Frankenstein lot is okay

2269
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,000
The other lot there that we didn't touch on

2270
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:09,000
There's the fabled King Kong lot which I've never even seen in person

2271
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
We found that at the very end of the night

2272
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,000
So that is sort of like a little surface lot during horror nights

2273
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Where a lot of pick up and drop offs are

2274
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:25,000
It's adjacent to the, again, the old Gibson amphitheater standalone little hut box office

2275
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:28,000
And now it's used where like crew trucks will park too if they're shooting

2276
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Got it

2277
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Nice and simple

2278
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Paints an easy mental image

2279
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:37,000
The Woody Woodpecker lot is a surface lot adjacent to Jurassic Park

2280
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
And that's the one where if you pay $35

2281
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Which, alright dude, why would you do that?

2282
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Like that gets you, I guess a little closer but not real

2283
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
The main thing it does is you end up skipping City Walk

2284
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Which is maybe something you pay $10 to do

2285
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
But also why would you? Especially after all this

2286
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Wait, you skip City Walk because it dumps you out right into Universal Studios

2287
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Closer

2288
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,000
But you can backtrack still into, you're not banned from going into City Walk

2289
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Okay, right

2290
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:09,000
What confuses me early on like as you're talking about this

2291
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Like the newer restaurant Vivo, it's an Italian place, just opened

2292
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:20,000
That is like a higher quality than a lot of the places we ate up there

2293
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:26,000
And a lower price point than say like a Bubba Gump or a Margaritaville

2294
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:30,000
So like I kind of, I don't understand, so the parking is going up

2295
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
But food prices are going down, same with Ludo

2296
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Like Ludo is cheaper, like you get a little bit of a premium charge on that

2297
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Because it's a little better ingredients than like the Panda Express

2298
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Because they made the chicken extra cold for you

2299
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Yeah, because they pay for the cold

2300
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
They're not perfect

2301
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:53,000
But the Panda Express is the same Panda Express that is a few blocks down on Ventura

2302
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
For like two or three dollars more

2303
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
The economics of it makes no sense

2304
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:01,000
It's kind of confusing and I think that's the spot where City Walk is weak

2305
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Where it's like, oh even Jason's parking that did go over

2306
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,000
There's at least a minute logic, there's at least a logic to that

2307
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,000
It's the stuff that there seems to be no internal logic

2308
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Or it's grown bigger than it can control

2309
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
It's a weed, it's out of control

2310
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
It's a weed that's out of control, yeah

2311
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,000
I think it doesn't have to be this way, I think there's hope

2312
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Look at that, that Vivo situation, there's more reasonably priced restaurants

2313
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Where you actually get the value that you're after

2314
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:30,000
I think that, here's what I, and I think they have to do this

2315
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
With places like The Grove and The Americana

2316
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Which are total successes, everyone, snarksters love The Americana

2317
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
This mall in Glendale with a little trolley and everything

2318
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Super cynical people, go have a great time

2319
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:48,000
I think it's, some parts of it have like Disney level theming and production value

2320
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
They did a great job

2321
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
And City Walk I think has to step up their game

2322
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:57,000
I think you'll see a lot more local traffic if they ease off on all this

2323
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Why do they have to be such greed mongers in this parking area?

2324
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Right, yeah, it really doesn't make any sense

2325
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:10,000
But you know what's gonna happen in response to this is that they're going to add like

2326
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,000
The Fiona lot from Shrek

2327
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
That's like, they'll pick that character for some reason

2328
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,000
And then parking there will be like $55

2329
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Unless you get there before 5.30

2330
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:29,000
At which point it's $8 if you stay for 4 hours or fewer

2331
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:34,000
It's like they're gonna have a more complex solution that's gonna make this even more

2332
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Complicated and convoluted for customers

2333
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:45,000
I just think like, I don't love getting there and getting out of there

2334
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,000
But I kind of do have fun when I'm there

2335
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,000
City Walk, yeah, like Jason was touching on the economics of the different establishments

2336
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Don't make any sense, they're wildly inconsistent

2337
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Some places are overpriced, other places are resembling a value

2338
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
The movie theater I kind of like

2339
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
I don't know why I'm getting into my general thoughts

2340
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
We're supposed to be in Sector 19

2341
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
We're wrapping up the saga, say whatever you want

2342
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Okay, because I was worried the Sector Keeper was glaring at me

2343
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Go for it

2344
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:19,000
But yeah, a lot of the businesses there suck

2345
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
And a lot of them are really bad

2346
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
There's a few diamonds in the rough

2347
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:26,000
And it's also just kind of like a fun thing to walk through

2348
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
If you're going to Universal Studios

2349
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
It's like a fun little bonus

2350
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Like the same purpose that Downtown Disney serves

2351
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
So I like it for that reason

2352
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:40,000
But yeah, I just wish they'd figure out the overall experience

2353
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
By the way, we think of all the lots

2354
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:52,000
King Kong, Woody Wedpecker, E.T., Frankenstein, Curious George, and Jurassic Park

2355
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Just like the most incoherent Avengers movie ever

2356
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Like what is happening here?

2357
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
And the E.T. attraction long gone

2358
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
The Curious George play area gone

2359
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
I guess he walks around still

2360
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Frankenstein definitely walks around

2361
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Maybe they should just re-theme them all to characters from one of the movies

2362
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Right, just make them all minions

2363
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Just make them different minions

2364
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,000
And then kids get to see minions on their way in

2365
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,000
You get to see Bob, you get to see Stuart

2366
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
You can tell which...

2367
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:29,000
I mean, that could be confusing because the minions do look pretty similar

2368
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
So maybe that's not a good idea

2369
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
No, it's the three-eyed one

2370
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
It's the one without goggles

2371
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
But you could be in the minions garage

2372
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Or the Gru garage

2373
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Or the girls garage

2374
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
The Pharrell garage

2375
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Yeah, the Pharrell

2376
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,000
I was going to say just make them all E.T. characters

2377
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
E.T.'s depressed mom

2378
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
E.T.'s depressed mom

2379
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Depressed Elliot

2380
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Depressed Elliot's sister

2381
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Maybe they're all just versions of Elliot

2382
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Isn't every character depressed in that movie?

2383
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Sick Elliot, healthy Elliot

2384
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Obviously the garage that you want

2385
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Hashtag Botanicus

2386
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Yeah, he would cheer everybody

2387
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:13,000
And he'd be a nice kind of like guide on the way

2388
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
To start your day

2389
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:18,000
And put the robot, what's left of the robot in there

2390
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Yeah, he's still bumming around

2391
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:24,000
I hope putting the photo out there can help us track down where Botanicus is at

2392
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,000
God, it's so sad

2393
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Yeah, have him welcome you

2394
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
This way he can explain all the rules

2395
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,000
$45 if you're here past two and a half hours

2396
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
You know, I think this is it

2397
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
I think this is what the solution is

2398
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
I think you keep Jurassic Parking

2399
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
And use that as a baseline

2400
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,000
And you go around and you make the other lots named after dinos

2401
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
And then so you've got

2402
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Because dinos are different sizes and they look differently

2403
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
And that's also fun theming

2404
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
And then it's all like Jurassic Parking

2405
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
It's all like part of that

2406
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
And you've got the main hub

2407
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
And then you've got the peripheral raptor lot

2408
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
And the T-Rex lot

2409
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
And the Triceratops lot

2410
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Was there Triceratops in Jurassic Park?

2411
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
I don't remember

2412
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Oh, that's right, that's right

2413
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
And you know, and

2414
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Big pile of poop lot

2415
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Right, there you go, yeah

2416
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
I agree

2417
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Here's my idea of a solution

2418
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Private death squads protecting the enclaves of the super rich from everyone else

2419
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Well that sounds like Universal's The Purge series

2420
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Oh yeah, oh name them after all the different purges

2421
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
There you go

2422
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Anarchy first year

2423
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:38,240
From Fitzr

2424
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:40,240
I have a radical idea

2425
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:42,240
That's my idea for what City Walk would be in ten years

2426
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:44,240
Oh, I'd like to hear it

2427
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:46,240
I think they should just get rid of all the parking garages

2428
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:48,240
And there should be parking garages

2429
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:50,240
Like kind of far away

2430
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:52,240
But then there will be like a high speed

2431
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:54,240
Something, a high speed gondola

2432
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:56,240
Something to shoot you up into City Walk

2433
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:58,240
Because we need so much real estate now

2434
01:47:58,240 --> 01:48:00,240
For more City Walk

2435
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:02,240
For more theme park

2436
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:04,240
And that, those parking garages

2437
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:06,240
Take up a lot of space

2438
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:08,240
And the way we're going, if they keep expanding

2439
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:10,240
There's only going to be more people

2440
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:12,240
So we're running out of space as it is

2441
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:14,240
Let's get rid of all parking up there

2442
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:16,240
Except maybe for an employee

2443
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:18,240
Let's let the employees park up there

2444
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:20,240
Yeah, move it a little bit

2445
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:22,240
Get a little bit further off site

2446
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:24,240
Have some sort of, what was Elon Musk's

2447
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:26,240
Cocaine dream for Dodger Stadium

2448
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:28,240
Magic roller skates you're getting on

2449
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:30,240
Yeah

2450
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:32,240
Fucking George Will-ass bitch

2451
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:34,240
Hahahaha

2452
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:36,240
Hahahaha

2453
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:38,240
Let's get Elon Musk to build a high speed gondola

2454
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:40,240
That will shoot you from

2455
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:42,240
Like some Burbank parking garage

2456
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:44,240
To Universal in 25 seconds

2457
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:46,240
I think if you tweet that at him

2458
01:48:46,240 --> 01:48:48,240
There's like a 30% chance he'll just

2459
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:50,240
Say yes

2460
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:52,240
We're working on it already

2461
01:48:52,240 --> 01:48:54,240
Yeah, we're already underway, we asked this one guy to build it

2462
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:56,240
But he's a pedo

2463
01:48:56,240 --> 01:48:58,240
Yes, once again the diver is a pedo

2464
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,240
And I will get on top of that

2465
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:02,240
But yeah

2466
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:04,240
Abolish all parking at CityWalk

2467
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:06,240
Yeah, I think that's great because also too

2468
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:08,240
That solves a lot of the confusion

2469
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:10,240
You got one central lot and that's how a lot of theme parks work

2470
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:12,240
You're directed to a lot

2471
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:14,240
And then there's a shuttle that takes you to the facility

2472
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:16,240
Why shouldn't CityWalk be modeled on that

2473
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:18,240
Helicopters, like Jurassic Park

2474
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:20,240
Yes, fine, great

2475
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:22,240
They're running helicopters all day

2476
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:24,240
And you park up in the Burbank Hills

2477
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:26,240
And then you see

2478
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:28,240
CityWalk and Universal Studios

2479
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:30,240
Approaching as you fly over it

2480
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,240
I don't want to just walk right into my

2481
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:34,240
Segment, but maybe I will

2482
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:36,240
Then you can make a big

2483
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:38,240
Sort of lake out by Margaritaville

2484
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:40,240
A little man made lake

2485
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:42,240
And then you can fly Jimmy Buffett's Hemisphere

2486
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:44,240
Dancer plane, the plane

2487
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:46,240
Famously shot up by the Jamaican government

2488
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:48,240
That he wrote the song Jamaican Mistake

2489
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:50,240
Oh, okay, thanks for reminding me

2490
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:52,240
Would there be a

2491
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:54,240
Walkaround Bono character on this plane

2492
01:49:54,240 --> 01:49:56,240
As he allegedly was

2493
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:58,240
Oh, that was scary

2494
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:00,240
Close call

2495
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:02,240
I've got a radical solution

2496
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:04,240
For this radical problem

2497
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:06,240
Yank that Were the World set

2498
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:08,240
Wow

2499
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:10,240
Get it out of there

2500
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:12,240
That's a huge plot of land

2501
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:14,240
That's been there for so long

2502
01:50:14,240 --> 01:50:16,240
What do you think about this

2503
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:18,240
It's such a hit though

2504
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:20,240
It's so amazing

2505
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:22,240
Such an amazing set

2506
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:24,240
Radical problems require

2507
01:50:24,240 --> 01:50:26,240
A radical solution

2508
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:28,240
I don't know, it's time for the new

2509
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:30,240
Would you keep Whoville

2510
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:32,240
Always keep Whoville

2511
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:34,240
Of course

2512
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:36,240
Whoville is the only thing keeping the Grinch at bay

2513
01:50:40,240 --> 01:50:42,240
I don't know

2514
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:44,240
The War of the Worlds

2515
01:50:44,240 --> 01:50:46,240
I like War of the Worlds better than I like

2516
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:48,240
The Fast and Furious ride

2517
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:50,240
Part of the tram

2518
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:52,240
Practical

2519
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:54,240
I like seeing what a horrific plane accident

2520
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:56,240
Would look like in real life

2521
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:58,240
Versus the kind of screeny

2522
01:50:58,240 --> 01:51:00,240
But better than Diagon Alley

2523
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:02,240
Wait, we're not talking about Diagon Alley

2524
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:04,240
We're talking about parking specifically

2525
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:06,240
If you're telling me

2526
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:08,240
I have a choice between Diagon Alley

2527
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:10,240
Or a plane that's been

2528
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:12,240
Crashed

2529
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:14,240
Yes, I agree with you, put Diagon Alley over there

2530
01:51:14,240 --> 01:51:16,240
What if the crashed plane was

2531
01:51:16,240 --> 01:51:18,240
The Hemisphere Dancer

2532
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:20,240
In an alternate reality where the plane

2533
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:22,240
Was brought down by the Jamaican government

2534
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:24,240
That's a fantastic idea

2535
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:26,240
And there's a slain Bono on the ground

2536
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:28,240
His sunglasses

2537
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:30,240
Cracked in half

2538
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:32,240
And Horror Nights gets even more graphic

2539
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:34,240
Body riddled with anti-aircraft fire

2540
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:36,240
The Edge controlling

2541
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:38,240
The gun

2542
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:40,240
The Edge killed him?

2543
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:42,240
That's the sort of scary twist

2544
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:46,240
That you expect from Horror Nights

2545
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:48,240
Yeah, I'm okay with that

2546
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:50,240
I'm fine with that

2547
01:51:50,240 --> 01:51:52,240
Can I just, one more thing on the parking garages

2548
01:51:52,240 --> 01:51:54,240
It does kind of make City Walk as part of the city

2549
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:56,240
Kind of an eyesore

2550
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:58,240
Those parking garages are

2551
01:51:58,240 --> 01:52:00,240
Super aesthetically pleasing from the outside

2552
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:02,240
But I will say

2553
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:04,240
That in the last couple years

2554
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:06,240
They made the trip down the hill

2555
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:08,240
At night

2556
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:10,240
A beautiful experience

2557
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:12,240
You align them with palm trees

2558
01:52:12,240 --> 01:52:14,240
The lighting looks really nice

2559
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:16,240
So when you finally find your way out of this crazy labyrinth

2560
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:18,240
And you're going down

2561
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:20,240
I feel like it's a very nice and pleasant

2562
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:22,240
And better aesthetically than when you're leaving

2563
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:24,240
Making friends

2564
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:26,240
Some of the universal heroes

2565
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:28,240
Saying hi to you, King Kong, the dinosaur, the Simpsons

2566
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:30,240
All your pals waving goodbye

2567
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:32,240
This is true, there are signs saying have a good night

2568
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:34,240
Good night humans

2569
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:36,240
And this gives me hope for the future

2570
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:38,240
Of City Walk and parking

2571
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:40,240
The infrastructure that they've done

2572
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:42,240
In and around the area

2573
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:44,240
Yeah, that hill is nice, those signs are nice

2574
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:46,240
All the metro improvements

2575
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:48,240
Recently

2576
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:50,240
That stuff is good, some of that stuff is more

2577
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:52,240
Aesthetically pleasing

2578
01:52:52,240 --> 01:52:54,240
There was a lot of concern from residents about

2579
01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:56,240
That they removed a freeway

2580
01:52:56,240 --> 01:52:58,240
Overpass and that it was going to cause a lot of congestion

2581
01:52:58,240 --> 01:53:00,240
But it's actually been fine, they did a good job

2582
01:53:00,240 --> 01:53:02,240
So there's been some good universal things

2583
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:04,240
And I say all that just to say

2584
01:53:04,240 --> 01:53:06,240
Please let us come do live shows there

2585
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:08,240
And don't kick us out just because we set all the hacks

2586
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:10,240
And because I tried to sneak in with my paper ID

2587
01:53:10,240 --> 01:53:12,240
Yeah, we opened the John Lovett's comedy club

2588
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:14,240
So these guys can go into a live show

2589
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:16,240
Yeah, let us perform in the abandoned space

2590
01:53:16,240 --> 01:53:18,240
I don't want to rain on your parade a little

2591
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:20,240
But so having crossed over from the metro a lot this time

2592
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:22,240
More often than not

2593
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:24,240
The escalator up to the bridge has been broken

2594
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:26,240
So it's just kind of that weird sensation of walking up an escalator

2595
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:28,240
That's just stairs

2596
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:30,240
I hate that

2597
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:32,240
I hate that

2598
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:34,240
I hate that

2599
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:36,240
So I took the elevator the other day

2600
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:38,240
The elevator fucking beat up

2601
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:40,240
Oh no

2602
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:42,240
Flywood and duct tape

2603
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:44,240
Someone like punctured the glass elevator door

2604
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:46,240
Wait a minute

2605
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:48,240
I think I know who did it

2606
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:50,240
It's this newly brazen

2607
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:52,240
Limp biscuit listening brake stuff

2608
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:54,240
Sector keeper

2609
01:53:54,240 --> 01:53:56,240
Sector keeper?

2610
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:58,240
Yeah, that's right

2611
01:53:58,240 --> 01:54:00,240
Oh my god

2612
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:02,240
Violence rules

2613
01:54:02,240 --> 01:54:04,240
Oh shit

2614
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:06,240
We're better to rebel

2615
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:08,240
Than in your own home in city walk

2616
01:54:08,240 --> 01:54:10,240
Where you're trapped

2617
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:12,240
Yeah, I'm sick of this place, it's dumb, I want out

2618
01:54:12,240 --> 01:54:14,240
I think that's how I feel

2619
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:16,240
Sector keeper

2620
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:18,240
I don't know, you kind of imagine

2621
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:20,240
I can't take it anymore

2622
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:22,240
I'm lashing out

2623
01:54:22,240 --> 01:54:24,240
These are like my teen years, man

2624
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:26,240
He's got a cool

2625
01:54:26,240 --> 01:54:28,240
He has a cool leather jacket on

2626
01:54:28,240 --> 01:54:30,240
He's dressed like Shia LaBeouf's Matt Williams character

2627
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:32,240
Matt Jones 4

2628
01:54:32,240 --> 01:54:34,240
He's got a lighter with a body

2629
01:54:34,240 --> 01:54:36,240
Forties babe on it

2630
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:38,240
I don't care for that, could you please not show that to me

2631
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:40,240
I like babes and I like motorcycles

2632
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:42,240
Vroom vroom bitch

2633
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:44,240
Watch out, he's got a switchblade

2634
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:46,240
He's flipping it around his hip

2635
01:54:46,240 --> 01:54:48,240
Just to come

2636
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:50,240
Oh my god

2637
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:52,240
You got us

2638
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:54,240
SK, you got us again

2639
01:54:56,240 --> 01:54:58,240
I messed up the elevator good

2640
01:54:58,240 --> 01:55:00,240
Yeah, well I mean

2641
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:02,240
Wait a minute, but also if you're able to

2642
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:04,240
Manipulate the space around you

2643
01:55:04,240 --> 01:55:06,240
And if you're in your teen years

2644
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:12,240
And you're wearing these greaser clothes and everything

2645
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:18,240
I feel like that means that your strength is getting all the way back up to its final state

2646
01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:20,240
Yes, you've given me strength

2647
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:22,240
I think I have a reason for that

2648
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:26,240
It's because the Sector 19 stone this whole time

2649
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:30,240
Why it's been the City Walk gold cup of joe token

2650
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:32,240
That's right

2651
01:55:32,240 --> 01:55:34,240
We got it early on

2652
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:36,240
We didn't know the meaning of it

2653
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:38,240
It's just been sitting in your pocket

2654
01:55:38,240 --> 01:55:40,240
You could have lost it, you could have used it as a laundry coin or something

2655
01:55:40,240 --> 01:55:42,240
No, no, I kept this close to my heart

2656
01:55:42,240 --> 01:55:44,240
It was yours the whole time

2657
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:46,240
You had the key

2658
01:55:46,240 --> 01:55:48,240
And it only cost you $45

2659
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:50,240
For which you didn't get coffee

2660
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:52,240
Yes

2661
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:54,240
So we've got all 19 is what we're saying

2662
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:56,240
We've got all 19 stones

2663
01:55:56,240 --> 01:55:58,240
Boys, boys, you've given me great strength

2664
01:55:58,240 --> 01:56:00,240
You sound so much older now

2665
01:56:00,240 --> 01:56:02,240
That's right, I'm feeling great

2666
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:04,240
Whoa

2667
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:08,240
Wow, you sound like a guy who just did all 30 days of like Whole30 or something

2668
01:56:08,240 --> 01:56:10,240
Yeah, yeah, I'm feeling really good

2669
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:12,240
Oh my god

2670
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:14,240
Wow, you've been so many years all of a sudden

2671
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:16,240
Yes, it's all coming back to me, all of it

2672
01:56:16,240 --> 01:56:18,240
All the years that I've missed

2673
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:21,240
And boys, I have to say that not only do you give me strength

2674
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:23,240
You give me great knowledge

2675
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:25,240
I've learned that through this journey

2676
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:27,240
There are other places I want to visit

2677
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:29,240
You do?

2678
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:31,240
Boys

2679
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:33,240
I have to say that

2680
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:35,240
There's one more mission

2681
01:56:35,240 --> 01:56:37,240
You're kidding me

2682
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:39,240
As a boy

2683
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:41,240
I heard of a place

2684
01:56:41,240 --> 01:56:43,240
A place like CityWalk

2685
01:56:43,240 --> 01:56:45,240
But it wasn't just a city

2686
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:47,240
It was truly downtown

2687
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:49,240
Boys

2688
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:51,240
In order to complete my soul fully

2689
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:53,240
Oh my god

2690
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:55,240
The journey continues

2691
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:57,240
I need you to take me to downtown Disney

2692
01:56:57,240 --> 01:56:59,240
Oh, right

2693
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:01,240
You son of a bitch

2694
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:03,240
Damn it

2695
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:07,240
Watch your head, this old ass motherfucker

2696
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:09,240
Look what he led us into

2697
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:11,240
Oh no

2698
01:57:11,240 --> 01:57:13,240
Now that you're older I'm gonna kick your ass, you prick

2699
01:57:15,240 --> 01:57:17,240
Please, please, I need to experience it

2700
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:19,240
Take me around, the entertainment, the food

2701
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:21,240
I don't want to see it all

2702
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:23,240
Wait, you seem pretty like, corporeal now

2703
01:57:23,240 --> 01:57:25,240
You seem like

2704
01:57:25,240 --> 01:57:27,240
You just drive yourself

2705
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:29,240
You're just like a guy now

2706
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:33,240
Alright, well, is that an employee badge?

2707
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:35,240
Do you have a job now?

2708
01:57:35,240 --> 01:57:37,240
Do you work at the ESPN zone

2709
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:39,240
At downtown Disney?

2710
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:41,240
It's been closed though

2711
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:43,240
You got a job at a closed ESPN zone?

2712
01:57:43,240 --> 01:57:45,240
It might be reopening it

2713
01:57:45,240 --> 01:57:47,240
The hotel's not getting built

2714
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:49,240
I'm looking for a place, if anyone

2715
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:51,240
knows, has any leads

2716
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:53,240
Right now I'm crashing in Alta Nina

2717
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:55,240
That's a rough commute

2718
01:57:55,240 --> 01:57:57,240
It's a hell of a commute

2719
01:57:57,240 --> 01:57:59,240
All our places are pretty tight

2720
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:01,240
And it's all pretty close

2721
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:03,240
to Universal Studio

2722
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:05,240
We all live close to Universal

2723
01:58:05,240 --> 01:58:07,240
And you know that, you want to get into a different

2724
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:09,240
part of town

2725
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:11,240
I know a guy who lives in Santa Monica

2726
01:58:11,240 --> 01:58:13,240
who probably has some space

2727
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:15,240
Mr. Weiger?

2728
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:17,240
Can I stay with you?

2729
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:19,240
Look, Sector Keeper

2730
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:21,240
I'd love to help you out, but as we've already

2731
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:23,240
established, I'm fourth in line

2732
01:58:23,240 --> 01:58:25,240
for succession, so I mean if some tragedy

2733
01:58:25,240 --> 01:58:27,240
were to befall each of these three gentlemen

2734
01:58:27,240 --> 01:58:29,240
then that would be the only way I could possibly let

2735
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:31,240
you into the home in Santa Monica

2736
01:58:31,240 --> 01:58:33,240
that I share with my lovely wife

2737
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:35,240
Well, thankfully we're all

2738
01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:37,240
in great health, nothing will happen

2739
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:39,240
to us, we all eat right, we definitely

2740
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:41,240
we get all of our hot dog

2741
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:43,240
nitrates, and I'm not afraid

2742
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:45,240
of anybody having any sort of

2743
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:47,240
heart incident

2744
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:49,240
Jason has plenty of apple strudel all alone

2745
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:53,240
For dinner

2746
01:58:53,240 --> 01:58:55,240
That's right, Nick joined us on our hotel outing

2747
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:57,240
where the waiter owned my ass

2748
01:58:57,240 --> 01:58:59,240
Well, I like the

2749
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:01,240
waiter said to you, I guess

2750
01:59:01,240 --> 01:59:03,240
we're going on our own round too

2751
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:05,240
Oh boy guys

2752
01:59:05,240 --> 01:59:07,240
Here we go again

2753
01:59:09,240 --> 01:59:11,240
Oh boy

2754
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:13,240
Well, I guess with that being said

2755
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:15,240
Nick Weiger, you survived

2756
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:17,240
Podcast The Ride once again

2757
01:59:17,240 --> 01:59:19,240
You survived the City Walk Saga

2758
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:21,240
and all of you at home survived

2759
01:59:21,240 --> 01:59:23,240
the City Walk Saga

2760
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:25,240
Incredible

2761
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:27,240
To commemorate the closing out

2762
01:59:27,240 --> 01:59:29,240
I'd like to do something

2763
01:59:29,240 --> 01:59:31,240
I was inspired by Scott

2764
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:33,240
starting the City Walk Saga

2765
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:35,240
in a triumphant manner

2766
01:59:35,240 --> 01:59:37,240
and I'd like to close it out on a similar note

2767
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:39,240
Sector Keeper, if you wouldn't mind putting

2768
01:59:39,240 --> 01:59:41,240
your microphone toward

2769
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:43,240
the computer and I have not

2770
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:45,240
rehearsed this, so let's see if it happens

2771
01:59:45,240 --> 01:59:47,240
Can you put down your Jules Sector Keeper

2772
01:59:51,240 --> 01:59:53,240
Alright, here we go

2773
02:00:03,240 --> 02:00:05,240
I always knew City Walk was a great

2774
02:00:05,240 --> 02:00:09,240
place, now baby I'm sure

2775
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:13,240
I love sugar for the candy

2776
02:00:13,240 --> 02:00:15,240
even though

2777
02:00:15,240 --> 02:00:17,240
it's steaming's mature

2778
02:00:21,240 --> 02:00:23,240
I love Hard Rock's new doll mascot

2779
02:00:23,240 --> 02:00:25,240
her name's

2780
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:27,240
Harper Ray

2781
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:31,240
Jason's washing himself

2782
02:00:31,240 --> 02:00:33,240
with a donut

2783
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:35,240
What more can I say

2784
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:39,240
Alright everybody

2785
02:00:39,240 --> 02:00:41,240
No, you now

2786
02:00:41,240 --> 02:00:43,240
City walking on

2787
02:00:43,240 --> 02:00:45,240
City walking on sunshine

2788
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:49,240
City walking on sunshine

2789
02:00:51,240 --> 02:00:53,240
And it doesn't feel good

2790
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:59,240
Wow, I know you don't need it anymore

2791
02:00:59,240 --> 02:01:01,240
but does that give you strength?

2792
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:03,240
Oh man, I don't know what that gives me

2793
02:01:03,240 --> 02:01:05,240
it gives me something

2794
02:01:05,240 --> 02:01:07,240
Well, I can't

2795
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:09,240
think of a more beautiful note to end on

2796
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:11,240
other than my beautiful

2797
02:01:11,240 --> 02:01:13,240
note to end on because I also

2798
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:15,240
did the same thing

2799
02:01:15,240 --> 02:01:17,240
that you did

2800
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:19,240
Same song? No, no, no

2801
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:21,240
I was getting a little worried

2802
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:23,240
I thought of a different one

2803
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:25,240
and what I thought

2804
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:27,240
of kind of stems from, you know, in the first

2805
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:29,240
episode we were comparing all of the

2806
02:01:29,240 --> 02:01:31,240
architectural works of

2807
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:33,240
John Jertie to different

2808
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:35,240
U2 albums and we were just talking

2809
02:01:35,240 --> 02:01:37,240
about U2 now, about Bono's

2810
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:39,240
body shot down in the War of the Worlds

2811
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:41,240
area and yeah, yeah

2812
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:43,240
and you know

2813
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:45,240
I just feel so bitter sweet at this moment

2814
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:47,240
and I, it's just

2815
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:49,240
I feel like what I've learned

2816
02:01:49,240 --> 02:01:51,240
through all this is that City Walk is more

2817
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:53,240
than just a theme park adjacent

2818
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:55,240
retail center

2819
02:01:55,240 --> 02:01:57,240
what it really is, is the

2820
02:01:57,240 --> 02:01:59,240
mall that you can't leave behind

2821
02:01:59,240 --> 02:02:01,240
Here, Mike

2822
02:02:01,240 --> 02:02:03,240
hit it

2823
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:11,240
It's a double encore

2824
02:02:15,240 --> 02:02:17,240
And if the popcorn

2825
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:19,240
upless

2826
02:02:19,240 --> 02:02:21,240
no longer

2827
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:23,240
pops

2828
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:25,240
pops

2829
02:02:25,240 --> 02:02:27,240
And if the LA

2830
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:29,240
sock market

2831
02:02:29,240 --> 02:02:31,240
runs out of

2832
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:33,240
socks

2833
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:37,240
The Raiders still aren't

2834
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:39,240
in LA

2835
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:41,240
So indoor

2836
02:02:41,240 --> 02:02:43,240
skydive away

2837
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:45,240
You can fly

2838
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:47,240
Sector Keepers

2839
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:49,240
fly, you're free

2840
02:02:49,240 --> 02:02:51,240
now, goodbye boys

2841
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:53,240
Walk on

2842
02:02:53,240 --> 02:02:55,240
City Walk on

2843
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:57,240
If you park

2844
02:02:57,240 --> 02:02:59,240
you can rebate it

2845
02:02:59,240 --> 02:03:01,240
with your movie theater

2846
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:03,240
ticket, park on

2847
02:03:03,240 --> 02:03:05,240
City Walk on

2848
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:09,240
It's five o'clock

2849
02:03:09,240 --> 02:03:11,240
somewhere

2850
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:13,240
There you have it

2851
02:03:13,240 --> 02:03:15,240
Wow, there you have it

2852
02:03:15,240 --> 02:03:17,240
Boys, boys, you give me so much strength

2853
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:19,240
Thank you, thank you

2854
02:03:19,240 --> 02:03:21,240
Now why don't you do yours

2855
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:23,240
Yeah, I mean

2856
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:25,240
I was gonna do mine, but first

2857
02:03:25,240 --> 02:03:27,240
I wanted to let Jason do his rendition

2858
02:03:27,240 --> 02:03:29,240
of Walk on By

2859
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:31,240
by the Stardust Jazz Singers

2860
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:37,240
Were you Googling an old song with Walk in

2861
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:39,240
I was looking for something like

2862
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:41,240
Count Basie Big Band or something, that was the best thing to do

2863
02:03:41,240 --> 02:03:43,240
There's that song Walk Right In

2864
02:03:43,240 --> 02:03:45,240
Step Right Down

2865
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:47,240
So I was going, yeah, I was like, boots are made for

2866
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:49,240
walking, I thought about

2867
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:51,240
Walk On

2868
02:03:51,240 --> 02:03:53,240
It would have been funny if we both, we had two different

2869
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:55,240
Walk On

2870
02:03:55,240 --> 02:03:57,240
I had been trying to figure out how to

2871
02:03:57,240 --> 02:03:59,240
make the chorus of the

2872
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:01,240
Videopolis thing song

2873
02:04:01,240 --> 02:04:03,240
We're going to the walk to the city walk

2874
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:05,240
and that's about as far as I got

2875
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:07,240
That's pretty good, wait, do that one more time

2876
02:04:07,240 --> 02:04:09,240
though and just super commit, maybe we can lay in music

2877
02:04:09,240 --> 02:04:11,240
We're going to the walk to the city

2878
02:04:11,240 --> 02:04:13,240
walk on a shopping

2879
02:04:13,240 --> 02:04:15,240
time till we drop at the city walk

2880
02:04:15,240 --> 02:04:17,240
Great, great, wow

2881
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:19,240
We all did songs

2882
02:04:19,240 --> 02:04:21,240
and Sector Keeper

2883
02:04:21,240 --> 02:04:23,240
boy, I thought we were going to

2884
02:04:23,240 --> 02:04:25,240
I was worried I was going to have to say goodbye to you

2885
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:27,240
and we'd never see you again, but I guess

2886
02:04:27,240 --> 02:04:29,240
see you in Anaheim

2887
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:31,240
See you in Anaheim

2888
02:04:31,240 --> 02:04:33,240
Just be careful, you're spilling your dip cup

2889
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:35,240
Oh yeah, your char cup

2890
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:37,240
I chew skull now

2891
02:04:37,240 --> 02:04:39,240
Wow, that's cool

2892
02:04:39,240 --> 02:04:41,240
I spit it into Mountain Dew Code Red

2893
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:43,240
bottles and I throw it

2894
02:04:43,240 --> 02:04:45,240
Well, here's the roast

2895
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:47,240
So you've gone from like a 50's greaser

2896
02:04:47,240 --> 02:04:49,240
to like a Mid-Aughts

2897
02:04:49,240 --> 02:04:51,240
dirt bag

2898
02:04:51,240 --> 02:04:53,240
I'm still finding my way

2899
02:04:53,240 --> 02:04:55,240
Please forgive me if, you know, when you see

2900
02:04:55,240 --> 02:04:57,240
me next it's nothing like this

2901
02:04:57,240 --> 02:04:59,240
You know, I'm figuring it out

2902
02:04:59,240 --> 02:05:01,240
You're going to have some tribal tattoos and a

2903
02:05:01,240 --> 02:05:03,240
tap out shirt

2904
02:05:03,240 --> 02:05:05,240
Is it possible that you're going to sound like you're being

2905
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:07,240
portrayed by a different actor

2906
02:05:07,240 --> 02:05:09,240
entirely? Potentially, yeah

2907
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:11,240
depending on schedules and what not

2908
02:05:11,240 --> 02:05:13,240
So that people with audience would have to forgive

2909
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:15,240
that if that was the case

2910
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:17,240
You know, I think no matter what the case or cadence

2911
02:05:17,240 --> 02:05:19,240
or sound of my voice, you know

2912
02:05:19,240 --> 02:05:21,240
you'll see me one place and that's behind

2913
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:23,240
a paywall

2914
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:25,240
Oh, very good

2915
02:05:25,240 --> 02:05:27,240
I like the way you think

2916
02:05:27,240 --> 02:05:29,240
SK

2917
02:05:29,240 --> 02:05:31,240
I like the way you think, like the way you look

2918
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:33,240
which is kind of like a Phil K. Dick

2919
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:35,240
like morph suit from Skinner Darkly

2920
02:05:35,240 --> 02:05:37,240
where your identity is constantly

2921
02:05:37,240 --> 02:05:39,240
changing so as to disguise

2922
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:41,240
your real nature

2923
02:05:41,240 --> 02:05:43,240
but I guess that's between the worlds

2924
02:05:43,240 --> 02:05:45,240
you're walking between the dimensions still

2925
02:05:45,240 --> 02:05:47,240
Right, that's right

2926
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:49,240
Well, you're one of those and

2927
02:05:49,240 --> 02:05:51,240
us three, good but

2928
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:53,240
increasingly bad boys are going to be

2929
02:05:53,240 --> 02:05:55,240
heading down to Anaheim

2930
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:57,240
with a lot of trips with a teenage

2931
02:05:57,240 --> 02:05:59,240
dirt bag

2932
02:05:59,240 --> 02:06:01,240
Eventually, with no

2933
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:03,240
timeline attached to it

2934
02:06:03,240 --> 02:06:05,240
With absolutely no month commitment

2935
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:07,240
whatsoever or an amount

2936
02:06:07,240 --> 02:06:09,240
God damn it

2937
02:06:09,240 --> 02:06:11,240
I know the sector keeper doesn't know

2938
02:06:11,240 --> 02:06:13,240
the amount of sectors

2939
02:06:13,240 --> 02:06:15,240
It would have to be more than City Walk, right?

2940
02:06:15,240 --> 02:06:17,240
I don't know if it would have to be

2941
02:06:17,240 --> 02:06:19,240
I think there's an argument to be made

2942
02:06:19,240 --> 02:06:21,240
that it would be less

2943
02:06:21,240 --> 02:06:23,240
The problem is that we'd have to review all the businesses on Harbor

2944
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:25,240
Oh no

2945
02:06:25,240 --> 02:06:27,240
Yes, most definitely

2946
02:06:27,240 --> 02:06:29,240
Captain Kidd's Buffet

2947
02:06:29,240 --> 02:06:31,240
Let's cut this thing off before anyone gets

2948
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:33,240
The Mimis on Harbor

2949
02:06:33,240 --> 02:06:35,240
Harbor is a many miles boulevard

2950
02:06:35,240 --> 02:06:37,240
Yeah, yeah, just a couple miles of it

2951
02:06:37,240 --> 02:06:39,240
Oh no, alright

2952
02:06:39,240 --> 02:06:41,240
Well, see you for the 67 part

2953
02:06:41,240 --> 02:06:43,240
Downtown Disney

2954
02:06:43,240 --> 02:06:45,240
Saga

2955
02:06:45,240 --> 02:06:47,240
Someday

2956
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:49,240
Alright y'all, you did it, we did it

2957
02:06:49,240 --> 02:07:15,240
