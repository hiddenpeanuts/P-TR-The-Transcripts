00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Warning, if you're a preteen fan of the Disney Channel's Andy Mack listening for

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,680
the first time, this podcast may include mild swears and even worse, grown men

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,080
rambling about fake rocks. Recent Disneyland cavalcade participant

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,360
Lelon Bowden takes us under the sea with the Little Mermaid. Life is the Bubbles,

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:40,360
it's Podcast the Ride.

6
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,560
Welcome to Podcast the Ride, the theme park podcast hosted by three men who

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,200
judge a restaurant not by the quality of its food but by how many robots are

8
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,240
nearby. My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always Jason Sheridan.

9
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:59,080
Hello. And Scott Gairdner. Yeah, but it's a tough standard to meet these

10
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,000
days. Robot driven restaurants are increasingly few and far between unless

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,720
it's Japan. Yes, which is like every restaurant has a robot in it in Japan, as

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,840
I understand, I've never been of course. Yeah. We've argued about going to Japan,

13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,680
but yes, I have very basic understanding of the country. That's why you can't

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,160
spend the whole trip in the Disney parks because you got to go see what robots

15
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:26,800
are running around town. Believe me, when I go to Japan, it will all be nonsense.

16
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,800
It's just a matter of how you do you want to spread it out since. Yeah. Let's

17
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,640
bring a very special guest in though. You know her as Bex on the Disney Channel

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,520
show, Andy Mack. Ladies and gentlemen, it's Lelon Bowden. Yay. Can you believe it? You're here.

19
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:53,560
I can believe it. But that's not to say that I'm not very excited to be here.

20
00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:00,040
Well, thank you. You are our first Disney family member. You're in the family. Yeah.

21
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:10,840
And after this, you will be out of the family. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's gonna be rough. But yeah, you are.

22
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:19,240
Just like the Matterhorn. Yes, the Matterhorn is very rough. Is this humor on brand? Yeah.

23
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,400
It's such a rickety ride. Did you prepare a bunch of jokes about each ride? No. OK.

24
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:30,760
But maybe I can think of them like, give me a ride and I'll see what I can do. Space Mountain.

25
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:42,280
To tell you what, it's with the new buying of Lucas Films, it's Hyperspace Mountain. That is a statement.

26
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:49,640
That's a true fact. Oh, wait. It is Hyperspace Mountain. Yeah, unfortunately. Well, all right.

27
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,040
All right. We will do the rest. But if one comes to you, please interrupt whatever we're talking

28
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:00,040
about to just make a quick joke. Hey, look, that's a sort of off the cuff skill that thousands of

29
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,640
dollars of the improv classes we took, we all took together back in the day. Oh, no.

30
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:15,080
Were you all in the same groups? So to really get into a topic that's very interesting to the

31
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,880
audience, Jason Leilani and I have been taking improv class together probably, what, nine years

32
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,280
ago, ten years ago? Yeah, probably. It's been forever. This could be the first time that the

33
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,520
UCB theater has been discussed on a podcast. Yeah, no, it's very rarely brought up in the comedy

34
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:37,000
circle. What are the behind the scenes like in the comedy world? We'll never know. I believe

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,320
someone will answer this question one day. Some series of some kind. So yeah, we took improv classes

36
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:50,840
together. We loved every minute of all of it. And now we're here. Now Leilani is a big star and

37
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:58,200
the three of us are podcasting, talking about rides. So we're all doing good. A hit star podcast.

38
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,360
Yes, yes, yes. We're not stars. We're hyper space stars. Oh, gosh, how embarrassing to admit to how

39
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:11,800
many years of improv I've done. So sorry. Do you want me to cut that out? It's just like, what's

40
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,640
the joke on? It has to be Space Mountain like two, like in comparison to something. Like, am I making

41
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,520
fun of Space Mountain? Well, on this podcast, we never make fun of Space Mountain. We're very, we

42
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,400
love Space Mountain. That's scripture. We're afraid to even, that's on the list of episodes we're

43
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,240
afraid to even do. Yeah. Because some of the rides loom so large, we're putting, we're like punting

44
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,000
on them as long as we can. We haven't done Haunted Mansion. We haven't done Captain EO. Where's like

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,600
afraid they're too big of topics to like the existence of God or not. They're too, uh, too

46
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,120
giant of topics to even tackle. Hold on, hold on. Now we have roasted the Florida Space Mountain a

47
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,960
lot because the Florida Space Mountain uses the same, uh, sort of toboggan kind of track that,

48
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:02,440
uh, the Matterhorn does. So imagine the Matterhorn, but in pitch black and wrecking your body. Not

49
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:08,440
fun. Yeah. Yeah. It is scary. Turn down a free trip if Disney gives it to you, it'll mess up your

50
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:17,000
back. I can't show weakness in front of my younger co-stars. Oh, right. Oh yeah. I can't be like,

51
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,720
guys, it'll hurt mama's back. I can't go. I'll wait for you at the bottom. Do you find yourself

52
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,640
trying to, I mean, impress your co-stars or do they ever do stuff that's like cool? Do they ever

53
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:34,280
like want to like hang out behind a 7-Eleven and you're like, this isn't where people should be

54
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:41,240
hanging out? No, I think when you're like, you know, the kind of kid that's living the life where

55
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:48,040
you're on a TV show, hanging out behind a 7-Eleven is not really like on your cool roster of things

56
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:55,480
to do. Like it's not like, oh, that's the, that's the hotspot, uh, where, where, uh, you know,

57
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:03,000
life happens, um, because, you know, you're getting invited to like the solo premiere and stuff like

58
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,800
that. That's a good question. What are they like, uh, you know, you've, you've done the,

59
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,040
done the press rounds and you get to do fun stuff on your show. What, what, what is the most exciting

60
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:18,840
to, uh, uh, to your co-stars? Um, to my co-stars, uh, yeah, well, I think it's all really exciting.

61
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,640
Um, you know, I, I think that it's, it's gotta be crazy to be so, like for me, I feel like I revert

62
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,120
back to a child when it's like, oh my gosh, we're going to the Wrinkle in Time premiere. You know,

63
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,920
we did the, uh, we might talk about this more in the podcast, but we just did a Disney channel fan

64
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,520
fest where, oh, that we're going to talk about it. Oh boy. But that was just like, where just so,

65
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:50,600
oh, it was in Disneyland. Um, it was so much fun. And so for me, I just like become a full kid again,

66
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,120
but I think that for, like for my co-stars, that's a time where they're also growing up,

67
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,160
you know, at the same time. So it's like, it's like, they still have that joy of a kid. And at

68
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,640
the same time, I can see them like managing all this exciting stuff that's like coming their way.

69
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:12,200
Like they are, um, like, like giving all the good things, like at a birthday party that you could

70
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:19,320
have it and being asked to be adults by the amount of responsibility that they have for life. Yeah.

71
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,040
And you are, you are more just like, yes, I've hit the minimum for sag health insurance.

72
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:31,080
Oh, it's a good feeling. Oh yeah. Like, like I hit that party threshold like a long time ago where

73
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:39,080
it's like, this is awesome. Like, you know, even if like just guest starring on a Disney show would

74
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:47,400
have been great. So everything past that point has been just like icing on the cake, which has been

75
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:53,880
a cake that is nothing but icing. That's great. Let me ask you this. Has Andy Mack made you

76
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:59,240
eat a Tide Pod? That's the only thing I know. That's all I know about millennials.

77
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,640
You know what? I actually don't think that's like eating the Tide Pod is a, is a millennial thing.

78
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:16,600
I think that just like, you know, people of all ages, A, do stupid stuff, right? Um, and when

79
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,000
you're experimenting with like, you know, when you're becoming, when you're just like, your brain's

80
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,760
not mature yet. You're going to do weirder, stupider things. But you know, a couple of kids ate some

81
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,880
Tide Pods because I went down a rabbit hole of like reading articles about kids who ate Tide Pods.

82
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:40,200
And it's just like, there were enough copycats, um, that, uh, that, that like, it's like, oh,

83
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:46,840
millennials eat Tide Pods. But you know, remember 10, uh, 15 years ago when American Pie came out

84
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,880
and then there was that case, there was a couple cases of kids putting, putting their junk in pies

85
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,600
and getting burns because they were putting their junk in pies. They're all doing it. That, yeah,

86
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,040
that didn't define the generation, you know, of like, this is the American Pie generation

87
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:09,320
of where kids can not stop putting their junk in pies. But now we're in such a think piece culture

88
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:15,160
that, uh, it appears that all millennials have eaten Tide Pods and that all millennials are

89
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,680
actively trying to kill the Olive Garden and Applebee's. And, uh, I've seen this so many times.

90
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,480
Millennials are killing chain restaurants and they're killing big box stores and they're

91
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:34,040
killing, uh, go-kart tracks. Like millennials are being blamed for the downfall of lots of things

92
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,840
that would have naturally have downfalls. So this is a format for articles about like

93
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,960
millennials are killing blank of like, it is essentially just changing taste. Like people

94
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:51,960
aren't as into fa- like, you know, casual dining anymore. People want more like a Chipotle fast

95
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:58,520
casual mix sort of thing. So then the other kinds of businesses aren't going to as much, but then

96
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,640
there's so many websites that just need to churn out content. There's just like a lot of millennial.

97
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,840
Although this week I saw- Yeah, millennials take a lot of, and at this point, like a millennial is

98
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:12,520
not somebody who's 13. You're a millennial. No, we are technically older. Yeah.

99
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:18,600
Yeah. Yeah. I'm at the cutoff of it and I love it. Yeah. Wait a minute. You, you're in or you're out?

100
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,440
I'm in. Okay. I just made it. You're, you're creeping on Gen X though.

101
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,600
Well, yeah, I am. Well, you are too. Yeah. Is it X though? Isn't there something in between?

102
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,040
Well, there was Gen Y. Oh wait, what's Gen Y? But then I think Gen Y like turned into millennials.

103
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,920
Well, that's, it's weird because I think the, the definition of a generation is like you were born

104
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:44,360
within a 20 year age range, but then there's also for the sake of popular culture, it's like, yeah,

105
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,040
if you were born around here, you're this. The point is I'm personally killing Olive Garden.

106
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,640
Yeah. You didn't even realize it, but you are. There's not an art. There should be an article,

107
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:59,400
though. Jason Sheridan is personally saving Olive Garden. Oh yeah. Well, no, that's not true because

108
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:05,960
I, I define endless pasta. Like I see endless pasta and it's like, keep, keep it coming boys.

109
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,960
Jason's destroying Olive Garden in a different way, but bleeding them dry.

110
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:18,040
I did see this week, my, the first millennials are saving blank, which is millennials are saving

111
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:24,520
the frozen food aisle. Apparently like frozen. Oh, that's straight up true. Food like is very,

112
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,720
it's doing very, especially like higher end, like organic or like natural, you know, frozen foods.

113
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,320
Oh, they have my number. That's what I do. I go straight to the organic frozen food section

114
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,600
of the grocery store and then I'm done shopping. Are we talking like Amy's? Oh, we're talking Amy's

115
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:46,040
because I like a lot of the Amy's stuff. And that rice mac and cheese. Yum. I have that. That's good.

116
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,360
Is that the gluten? That's the gluten free or no? I don't know. I have this gluten free macaroni

117
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,080
cheese for Amy's. It's very good. All right. Anyway, do you guys mention a lot of brands on this

118
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:02,120
show? We love brands. Like, do you get sponsorship by these brands? No, no, no. Oh no. Well, we were

119
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,480
open. If Amy's wants to get involved in podcast, the ride, we're here. We're ready to have that

120
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,520
meeting Amy's. I think that like you're already doing it for them. So I feel like if I was part

121
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,240
of the Amy's like marketing team would be like, we'll just let this be. Sure. Yeah, we already

122
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,080
did it. Why do they have to pay us? Wait, no. Okay. Here's what we'll delete out. This whole podcast

123
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,880
is just an ad for these theme parks. Really? I guess you're right. They'll say the F word once

124
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,080
in a while and we'll be like a little bit salty about certain rides. But like really people are

125
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,120
just listening and going, yeah, I want to go to these parks and then every now and then I'll drop

126
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,920
in like a very forced like, oh man, you know what I was doing the other day? Enjoying a great blue

127
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:48,760
e-cigarette, like really ham fisted, like just trying to get that endorsement, get that sponsorship

128
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:56,680
going. That's your number one. I got to keep my podcast and pipes running fine. Yeah. I can't

129
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:02,840
have a scratchy voice. That's what blue helps me out. I quit dip and I've gone to blue e-cigarette.

130
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,560
It would be great if we all buy like in a year or so each had like a sponsor, separate sponsor. So

131
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:13,160
like at the UFC when, you know, Brock Lesnar has Jimmy John's on his shorts, each one of us will

132
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,760
have a different sponsor that will constantly be plugging personally in addition to many other ads.

133
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,240
So we want this thing to become, you know, very corporate, very. Anyone, do you guys have ideal

134
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:30,760
sponsors? Well, Tristan's is a e-cigarette or a Olive Garden. Yeah. Or Raytheon,

135
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:41,400
the defense company. I want to be sponsored by GRP records, a jazz, a smooth jazz vinyl label

136
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:48,120
from the eighties that I'm not sure is still around, but quality albums. Kevin Eubanks put out

137
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:54,520
a lot of great jazz. Wow. Yeah. So yeah. Kick. Give me some kickbacks. GRP records. Thanks for

138
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:00,040
the jazz. I've been buying a lot of pants lately. So Levi's I would go for Levi's if they would,

139
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:07,320
they would be a sponsor of Michael. Also heels in your quest to always look younger. Oh,

140
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,280
prove you're on the millennial side of the fence. That's true. That would prove it.

141
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:23,400
A personal brand. Yeah. I mean, uh, no. Okay. I don't know. It's just like, uh, I mean, I have

142
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:31,320
things that I like, but I feel like part of my deal is that not one brand can't own me

143
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:39,480
unless I guess it's a Disney, which I'm very happy about. So cool. Any brand is going to,

144
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:46,760
and they own most of the best things. So you're on a good list. So yeah, before, so, so we didn't

145
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,840
even say like, we're going to be eventually talking about the little mermaid, Ariel's undersea

146
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,960
adventure ride. That was your choice. And we're going to get way into it. But first we do have

147
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:01,480
to talk about this fan fest that you just participated in, um, for promotion for the show.

148
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:09,080
Oh, let us know. Let us know. Just tell us where we were. I was, I was watching. There was a live

149
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:14,600
feed of it. You were in a little car. You were in a parade. You were honored. Those older Disney man.

150
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,520
He has a little cap on you. Pluto was in the car with you. It was in the car. It was a whole thing.

151
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:30,360
It was down main streets. You drag race the DuckTales cast. Yeah. It was, uh, it was super fun. I

152
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:37,000
believe it's the first one, um, that, uh, Disney channel has done, um, where they take all the

153
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,720
stars from their shows and on the lineup to come and, um, pop them in cars and we get to do a little,

154
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:51,560
it's called a cavalcade. Yeah. I love that. Um, I'm going to show Scott a photo of the car.

155
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,600
Oh yeah. I'm going to miss this. Whoa. I learned some really cool trivia about that car that we

156
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,160
were in. Um, the driver was, uh, I think that's like part of his deal too. He's like, do you want

157
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:08,920
to know about this car? Um, that car is, is, uh, almost as old as the, the Disney parks. Yeah. Um,

158
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:16,760
it's like only a couple years, like, uh, a couple years younger. It's like super old and there's only

159
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,960
a couple of those cars. So there, I wish I could remember how many, but there's like five or

160
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,840
something and a couple are in here and a couple are in Disneyland, Florida, um, Disney world. Um,

161
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:34,840
and, uh, the fire engine, um, that was one was the very first. And there was like a whole story

162
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:43,640
that he told me about how the designer of that car literally drove that car, um, from Burbank to

163
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:50,360
Anaheim. Um, but it's like, it's not a real car. Everything's five, eight scale. So those, um,

164
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,160
I mean, it's a, I mean, yeah, it's five, eight scale of like a, uh, a normal car,

165
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,720
like main street itself. So it fits in. Yes, exactly. Main street is five, eight scale. Wow.

166
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,120
And so it fits right in. It looks normal. He looked funny driving this thing down

167
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:11,880
from Burbank to Anaheim. Um, the, the, the cute joke is, is that like, uh, a, um, car was passing

168
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:18,440
and a kid out the end was like, Hey, Mr. By the time you get to the fire, it'll already be out.

169
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:24,840
That's one of the original imagineers getting roasted going down the five.

170
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,760
And this was, but this was a Burbank long before Jay Leno, uh, was constantly driving old timey

171
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:38,120
cars around. No one was used to it yet. Man, Jay, I bet Jay would love to drive some of those main

172
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,760
streets. He ever driven one of the main street cars? I bet Jay Leno would love to, if he ever

173
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,880
went down there, an idea for a Leno's garage. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would also like to,

174
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,360
drives a double decker bus and stuff. I would also like to be sponsored by Jay Leno's garage.

175
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:57,400
Sure. That would be cool. He has a show on CNBC. Is that right? Yeah. Jay Leno,

176
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,240
he just goes around and fixes cars and drives cars around. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's for some

177
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:07,000
people. Sure. Yeah. It's all, it's a foreign language to me, but so is this podcast to a lot

178
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:15,480
of not remotely. Uh, I can't even, if I have to like improvise fake car facts, I'm dead in the water.

179
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:21,720
20 horsepower silence. 20 horsepower silence. E-pants run away from wherever I am.

180
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,280
Yeah. Believe it or not, Leland, we're, the three of us aren't big gear heads.

181
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:34,280
We don't love getting our hands dirty in a garage. Or the sun. Not big fans of the sun. Or the sun,

182
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:41,720
unless we're outside at a park. Getting our skin toasted. But we do love the Autopia at Disneyland.

183
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,360
Actually, we don't love that. I tried to look, I think it was Ward Kimball was the Imagineer

184
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:53,640
who designed the fire truck. Oh, right. Well, he was the, he had his jazz band, the Firehouse 5

185
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,960
or something of that. It was like, or Firehouse 5 plus two, something like that. It was a Firehouse

186
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,240
themed, uh, jazz band. Yeah, this all tracks. I didn't need to keep explaining, but yeah, it must be,

187
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:11,640
uh, I'm done. You're the fire guy. Oh, you know what y'all are? Trivia heads.

188
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:19,320
Yeah. Oh, we love it. That's pretty true. I'm really good at, like, I, I, uh, I don't absorb small facts,

189
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,600
uh, well, I can, but it's not my strength. Man, I'm so sorry that you're here then.

190
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,800
We hide our notes. I'm just here for the party. Our voluntary notes documents. Small facts. So,

191
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,800
we made you do this, uh, eight, nine years ago when we would just pull out random

192
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:43,080
bullshit on stage, uh, doing improv. Oh, I know you guys were constantly like, so, well, uh, not as

193
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:50,920
bad as, as like, uh, when I was on, um, tab, uh, with our friends, uh, Casey and Jacob, they would

194
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:57,080
constantly, um, set me up to no sports specifics. And that was just a nightmare where they'd be like,

195
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:03,080
oh, look, everybody, it's LeBron. Tell us what team you're on. And, uh, you know, I should know.

196
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:09,080
And I did it and it sucks. That I feel like is easier to fake than just random, like.

197
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:16,040
Trivia. Brainy bunches made for TV movie bullshit. Like. I don't think that's true. If, if, if you

198
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,280
get the name of LeBron's team wrong, people are going to know. You can't. Oh, you guys go like,

199
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,480
oh, LeBron, you're on the, what team? You're on the best one. My man, LeBron. You did not take that

200
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:32,600
at all. That would not fly in front of an audience because they could tell you. The good team,

201
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:39,240
that's not easy to fake at all. Anyway. Um, we distracted from the general. Yeah. So we're back

202
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,440
to being in this parade. You're in a tiny car. Some of these cars, by the way, I look at that,

203
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,200
that car is a bright yellow car that you were in. And I look at that and I remember seeing

204
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,080
footage of parades where like Ronald Reagan's being driven around and I know it was like that

205
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:58,840
car could have been used by very famous people. Apparently the fire truck is the one that was

206
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:05,560
reserved for diplomats and like a big, big town, big time people. There was a, I think the one when

207
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,400
I went, I went to alone to Disneyland a couple of years to go see Dick Van Dyke in a parade

208
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,960
and he was driven around in the car, but I believe it was the green car. So you guys were in a yellow

209
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:19,880
car. Oh, oh my gosh. Oh, this is why I wish I knew trivia better because the driver of the yellow car

210
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:25,160
told me which car Dick Van Dyke was in for his like 90th birthday or something like that. Right?

211
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,880
Yes. That's what I was there. I went alone. He told me which car he was in and I don't remember.

212
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,400
You got pretty good recall though. You got pretty good recall of this. Uh, it's a,

213
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,520
all the anecdotes this guy gave. Um, I have a picture of Dick Van Dyke somewhere so I can find

214
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,720
it. We can figure out what car he was in. Cool. Um, but you, so, so you guys started the parade

215
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,760
back, what, by a small world? That's generally where, where the parade comes out. Here's a thing.

216
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:57,000
Uh oh. I have no idea. I have no idea. It's just like, did you just black out and wake up in a

217
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,760
parade? Yes. That's what it felt like. Well, because, uh, we, the, the ready station was in the, um,

218
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,440
uh, the hotel, the California hotel. Right. Um, and so that's where we were prepping and stuff

219
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:14,840
like that. And we were ushered, you know? Um, and so we were ushered, um, on a, on a, like a moving

220
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:20,680
bus, not like a parade bus to the start of the parade. And, uh, I don't, I didn't know where we

221
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:26,520
were and I didn't recognize where we were during the parade. Cause I was so overwhelmed with like

222
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:32,280
people waving. Right. And so like it, it was a blur. I was just like, wow. So more photos were

223
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:38,120
taken of you in that, uh, I don't know how long to 15 minutes to half an hour, probably than ever

224
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:43,320
in the rest of your life. Like you gotta be on, you're posing. Oh yeah. Yeah. Like there's no time

225
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,680
until I kind of scratched my head and be like, wow, well, this is the fancy land, you know, like, uh,

226
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:55,960
did you just call it fancy land? The fantasy land. I said it was this fancy land. This is, this is

227
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:02,840
fancy. All of Disneyland is fancy land. Yeah. That's accurate. Yeah. Um, that's maybe frontier land.

228
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,520
That's rough and tumble. Yeah. Um, but so, so it, but it was a lot, I guess we're by really,

229
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,440
I'm asking like it would felt like it was 15 minutes ish that you were actually in the parade.

230
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:18,360
That sounds about right. Yeah. It, it, but it went by so quickly, you know, it was, it was just like,

231
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:25,640
oh, and people are excited and the, oh, the, the cutest thing is that there were a group of young

232
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:33,400
girls who were all together who maybe around like a young teenager age, um, who saw the Andy Matt

233
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:39,400
car and they were like weeping. Oh yeah. And like, and they were smiling and taking pictures and just

234
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:46,280
like, just like overwhelmed and, uh, Peyton like straight up like leaned, like leaned over, like

235
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:54,440
the car was like, Hey, are you okay? And they're like, yes, we're great. Okay. Wow. It's like,

236
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,240
you'll meet, you were like, be experiencing Beatlemania or something. Yeah. It was,

237
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:06,520
it was pretty wild. And it was like, uh, it, like I talked to, uh, Kate McCoochie after who was in

238
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:12,360
the DuckTales, uh, vehicle. And she was just saying that she just cried the whole parade

239
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,160
because it was just so moving and cool. And it's like, and Disneyland is such a big part of,

240
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:25,160
you know, all of our childhoods and to be like an attraction. It is just, you know,

241
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,480
mind boggling to the other end of this where you're literally in, you're in areas people

242
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,920
don't get to see and yeah. And you know, I didn't get to take advantage of that anyway,

243
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:41,000
cause I was just so like, Whoa, it was crazy. Yeah. A lot of those sorts of things you get ushered

244
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,080
from thing to fit, like, you know, people are just like, okay, we got to go over here. Now we

245
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,800
got to go do this. Now we got to take pictures, that sort of thing. Yeah. Oh yeah. The whole day

246
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:57,320
was just getting ushered around, um, uh, by the, uh, the, the guides in plaid. Of course. Um,

247
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:02,920
super cool. Let me ask, did you guys, did you guys get, you didn't get to choose Pluto as the

248
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:08,520
character in the car with you? Uh, Pluto was assigned. He was assigned. Okay. I would know

249
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:14,520
we didn't, we didn't show us like a look book and they were like, you know, find what, what

250
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:21,720
character speaks to you. Um, no, but you know, no complaints. Sure. No, no. I mean, I just was

251
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,720
wondering like, if they were like, all right, Pluto's with you, we're sending Mickey over here.

252
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,360
Yeah. Was, were the DuckTales people with the DuckTales characters? You know what? I feel like

253
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,520
I have this vague memory. I mean, it could be, it could be corroborated just by looking online.

254
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:41,160
I think I know the answer to this. Um, but I think Scrooge McDuck was in that, the, uh, Raven's Home

255
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:46,760
vehicle. Okay. I believe that. Yeah. I was confused too, cause Scrooge was not with. DuckTales. Yeah.

256
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,040
Let me see if we can find the feed of this. We'll, we'll post it of course, for the audience. If he gets

257
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:57,320
too close to David Tennant, like a wormhole open, like reality starts to bend. Um, what, what, like

258
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:05,320
that's DuckTales, uh, cast is the ultimate hipster lineup. Right. Who else is in there? Who's in the

259
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:13,400
new crew? Bobby Moynihan, Ben Schwartz, uh, Danny Pudi. Yes. Yes. Uh, Beck Bennett, but he wasn't there.

260
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:22,760
Correct. He wasn't there. Um, yeah, it's yeah. Kate Mccoochie, like it's, it's like a perfect,

261
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:29,880
like all star cool town lineup. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Scrooge and Launchpad are in the Raven's

262
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,320
Home car. Yes. Yes. For whatever reason. They didn't want to be too obvious, I guess. Yeah. Two on the

263
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:40,760
nose, I guess. Yeah. So, but for whatever reason, but you're the fact that you're, you're, uh,

264
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:46,920
streaming through a video of this parade. Oh yeah. I, well, the, when this fan fest was- Cavalcade, you guys.

265
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:52,920
Cavalcade. Cavalcade. When this was happening, like I was looking at, like I have a Twitter list of

266
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:57,640
like theme park news sites and blogs and stuff. And I was like, there's Leelod, scrolling through it.

267
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:03,480
It's like, there's Leelod. There's Leelod again. There's Leelod. Like as people were there posting,

268
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,240
but we're sharing like, you know, whatever pictures they were sending out on the wire.

269
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:14,680
You were the star of theme park social media. Uh, so it's something, an honor usually reserved for

270
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:24,360
ice cream cones. I finally made it to ice cream cones. I'm in. So, so you get through with the parade.

271
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,360
And then you have what, a signing, was that right? You like, was it a meet and greet? Yes, it was a

272
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:35,800
meet and greet. And so it was like, uh, it was a thing where fans could, um, walk a step and repeat

273
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:42,200
and take pictures with the Disney channel shows and stuff. Uh, and that was, uh, that was fun. But

274
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,440
also, yeah, like a big whirlwind of like, Hey, what's your name? How's it going? Blah, blah, blah.

275
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:52,840
Let's take a picture. Hold the sign. Yeah, it's fine. Okay. Bye. You know, like, um, and, uh, and

276
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:59,880
then after that we had a, uh, a talk back panel with, um, the cast of stuck in the middle and,

277
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:07,560
uh, with radio Disney with, uh, so radio Disney was the host, the panel, and it was so much fun

278
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:13,640
because like the fans are like, so like pumped, you know, that they were not afraid to shout out

279
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:19,240
exactly what they felt about characters, you know, like it was like medieval times, you know,

280
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:27,480
where it was just like, you know, and, uh, well, nobody says I hate you today. The nights and

281
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:34,920
medieval times. Yeah, I did. Well, Mike, if they were in the other side, I would yell something

282
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:41,560
like just screaming. I hate the monarchy. You're all part of the problem and oligarchy for this

283
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:48,840
kingdom. Um, but, uh, but yeah, like they were very vocal about like who they shipped, you know,

284
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,480
and, and like what, what care? Yeah. What ships they like better than other ships, you know?

285
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:00,200
Yeah. Ships are you sure? Well, everybody's shipping me and Bowie, who's the father of

286
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:06,200
Andy Mac. Uh, cause you got to, you know, you got to root for the family. I have, I searched your

287
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:12,840
name and hashtags on Instagram. Did you search Tumblr too? I didn't search Tumblr. Oh boy. Jason,

288
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,320
search Tumblr for Leland. I don't know if I want to go down that rabbit hole. Do you know what my

289
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:23,720
persona is on Tumblr? No. What do you mean? Um, uh, well this was, I, you know what? I haven't

290
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:30,120
checked Tumblr in a hot second now, but, um, when Andy Mac first came out, uh, it was like,

291
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:37,000
I got a text from one of the, the, the, uh, I got a text from the main writer being like,

292
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,560
wow, you're really popular with the lesbian community. Like the, the Bex's style and persona

293
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:51,080
is like a hit, you know? And I was like, cool. Um, I was just, I, uh, mine was not about the

294
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,880
lesbian community. It was just that I had seen a lot of different pictures of the two of you and

295
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:01,480
the people are like, they are so cute together. People like just posting like photos and photos

296
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:07,640
from the Disneyland like press conference. So, um, yeah. People ship Bexie, hashtag Bexie.

297
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:13,640
Is there any weird, is there any weird one? Like you like ship with a real, like a random guest

298
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:22,920
star or like a different show? Have you seen any weird one? Like you and Pluto? Hashtag Plex.

299
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:33,640
That's pretty good. Yeah. Very, very snazzy ship name. Um, well, I mean, the internet is a weird,

300
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:39,560
weird place, you know? And so I think that like the goal, you know, of the collective

301
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:44,840
internet body is to try to make every ship possibility, you know, every combination.

302
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,200
So I've seen it and it's weird because it's like they just ship everybody in the show,

303
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:58,520
but I'm much older than most of the people in the show. So there's less boundary should be kept.

304
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,400
Boundaries should be kept. Right. That's why I said like random guest stars. Cause I didn't want to,

305
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:09,640
because there's not many options for you. No, I mean like Bex has pretty much just had, you know, Bowie is like,

306
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:15,960
the, there's not really a contender. Right. Shipping though, in general is not necessarily, it's not,

307
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,000
uh, there's like, there's a pretty like sweet component to it. I don't necessarily have a full

308
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,080
understanding of it, but like it's not, it's not like erotic fan fiction necessarily. It's like,

309
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:33,080
I want them to be together. Yeah. No, it's yeah. Yeah. Exactly. That same feeling and tone and

310
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:40,440
cadence. Like, I wish they were together. Yeah. They'd be so happy and so would I. Yes. It's gentle.

311
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:47,800
Drawing of a Bex exchanging Valentine's gifts with Bob Iger. Interesting. I guess they, uh, yeah,

312
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:53,880
they did run out of age appropriate characters to pair off with. Should we declare if we're,

313
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,120
if we are to be shipped, I was just trying to combine them in our, it's, it would be

314
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:04,200
hashtag Garrett Garrett son, Gerson den. Oh, you mean if we were all shipped together? Yeah.

315
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:10,120
If people were to say like with other first names guys, it would have to be like,

316
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,240
huh? Like we don't have a lot of room to work with. Yeah.

317
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,840
Yeah. It would be like, go to the next go to the next hashtag. Go tonight. I don't know

318
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,480
the spelling. You figure it out. That is your ship name. I think people should ship Jason

319
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:35,080
with different treats. Oh, I think they should too. I just want to see him eat a funnel cake.

320
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:43,560
If he would only eat a funnel cake, hashtag J C's cake. Like what treats would you like to ship Jason

321
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:48,280
with? Let's ask the audience though. They can come up with some good stuff to be with fried Reese's

322
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:59,320
pieces at my local fair. I just want to see him with sorbet. Please someone please draw like a,

323
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:09,560
a sailor moon escrow drawing of like sorbet. Are we calling for fan art? I don't even get fan art.

324
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:15,800
Like you guys get fan art. Like we've, we've had two and we demand it also. I've seen them.

325
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:22,840
I still post a picture. I have the original art. Oh yeah. You got sent the original. Oh yeah.

326
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:29,240
Yeah. So I have the original art and the artists, uh, very nice. Uh, I will give him a shout out on

327
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:38,360
Twitter. The specific artist, the twain and the mayor he sent to, and he also said a lovely opening

328
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:46,520
MGM studios, a program guide guide. That's cool. So, uh, a picture of that. When this goes up,

329
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:52,280
have you gotten any fail? You have to get fan mail somewhere. Like you have to get some. Yeah. Um,

330
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:57,880
yeah. I mean, do you have to go pick it up or you don't get it directly to your, no, uh, the,

331
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,320
the Disney channel will keep fan mail for us, uh, at the office and then we get to read them and

332
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:11,080
they're the sweetest things. Like there's, uh, I just, like my heart explodes, you know, like

333
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:16,600
there's glitter on the outside of the envelopes and there's stickers and, and, you know, you can

334
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,240
tell that like, you know, kids have spent a lot of time in the block lettering and stuff like that.

335
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,640
It is just like, it just makes your heart melt, you know, and they just have really nice things

336
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:30,600
to say. It's like, you're my favorite. Oh, you know, what's really cool is, uh, when we were

337
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:38,840
doing our New York press junket, um, Josh, one of the kids in the show handed me, um, a paper. Um,

338
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:45,160
and, and it was just like a random paper and he was like, Hey, uh, a gal asked me to give you this.

339
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:50,200
And it was like a note of being like, I love your character on it, Andy Mack. And at the end,

340
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:59,640
she wrote stay woke. Wow. And it meant a lot. Yeah. Very cool. That is cool. That's like, yeah,

341
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,680
that would be overwhelming by like, like people, like seeing so many people's feelings at once.

342
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:11,160
It is like a good version of Twitter or something. Yes, it is. It is constantly overwhelming.

343
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:16,120
Yeah. It's like, yeah, like I, you can't see cause it's a podcast, but I just squinted my

344
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:20,280
eyes and blinked really hard because it's like, you can't look at it directly. It's like the sun.

345
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,960
Is this really happening? Sure. Yeah. So cool. It's nice to know that it like comes,

346
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,440
that it can come back around to you. I feel like I've always been, uh, uh, confused about

347
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:36,520
does fan mail actually, uh, actually get to the person or is some, uh, guy in an office, uh,

348
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:42,520
writing form letters back and says to here, can, uh, can make it to you. Yeah. It's the,

349
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:48,040
there's a high volume, you know, um, but we, when we're there, we get to read them.

350
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,880
And that's why you just have a rubber stamp made up that just says best of luck in your future

351
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:59,720
endeavors. And you just stay up ahead shot and I should bulk media mail and I should, well, like

352
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:04,360
when Andy Mac first came on, I did try to, you know, reach out to fans and send pictures and

353
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,360
stuff like that, you know, because it's like, oh, I could. And then just, it was like, oh, okay.

354
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:13,480
I won't be able to keep up, uh, with this. Cause it was just, it's one, one bit operation here,

355
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:20,680
guys. You also have to, uh, work. You have to do the show. I don't have like, you know,

356
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,800
and, uh, yeah, assistants or whatever, you know, they're not going to let you write letters back

357
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,440
in the shots. You have to do the things the scene requires. Yeah, exactly. That's why,

358
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:36,200
that's why sometimes people get paper cranes or like a stew or whatever Becks is making that day.

359
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:44,520
I got to get my responses out where I can. You don't have an assistant, but you have a very, uh,

360
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,280
imposing bodyguard standing behind you who keeps really giving me a look.

361
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,280
He looks really mad at me.

362
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,160
I'm nervous you acknowledged him. Yeah, they come with me everywhere.

363
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:03,160
Um, so not true. So Mike, for my, I had a question this whole time. Uh, which was this out all at

364
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:08,280
grand California in the fan fest was that the hotel, where was all that? Where were the questions

365
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:15,960
being asked or was it in the park? Um, the, the panel was, uh, in California adventure. Oh,

366
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,520
it was. Okay. So it was probably in that big area by the monsters, ink ride. I'm assuming stage,

367
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:26,280
stage 12. Yeah, that's where, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. The former, uh, who wants

368
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,840
to be a millionaire. Yes, of course. I know that there needs to be a huge, who wants to be a

369
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:36,840
millionaire in that stage. We're pretty sure. Oh, or was it also where the Tron arcade was? Cause

370
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:41,240
that was in a big like open space. That was really well done. Did you ever see the Tron?

371
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:46,760
Oh yeah, of course. Yeah, that was great. Very cool. Well, I'll load history flex. Wait,

372
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:53,080
Tron, Tron is the game where you sit in, it's a two person. Um, and you, and you sit in it and

373
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:58,600
I'm sorry, I'm thinking of T-mech guys. Um, all right. Is there a specific, well, there is a

374
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:03,960
specific Tron game that was based on the movie. I've seen the movie, but, but I just confused, uh,

375
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:12,920
you T word of your arcade. Yeah. They made a replica of the arcade that they like. Understood.

376
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,960
In both movies. Oh, that's really cool. Yeah. It was fun. And then they had like an electronic

377
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:24,440
dance show as well. They had like a, the whole area looked like the, the Tron for a little while.

378
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:31,000
So yeah, when there's the Andy Mack, uh, rave, then you'll know when it's a permanent fixture

379
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,120
in the parks. That's when you'll know it. It's a themed rave. You gotta be in bed by nine.

380
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,280
So once all that stuff was then out of the way, did you guys get to just do whatever you wanted

381
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,440
at the parks? Like how did it work? Were you escorted around at that point? Or did they say,

382
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:58,520
have attitude, whatever you want? Um, uh, we, uh, we stuck with the guides, um, but it was,

383
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:03,720
you know, a lot we did, we got a lot done that day. You know, we did promos for different things.

384
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:10,680
You know, we, uh, uh, we took pictures with like Jesse and Woody and the, and Mike and Sully and

385
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:17,000
stuff like that. And so we had a lot of things to go to. So I was excited to hit the rides after,

386
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:25,080
but it, like I said before, I'm, I don't have the same kind of boundless energy as my younger

387
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:34,840
co co stars. Um, so I went on like five rides and I was like, I gotta go home. Each one. I,

388
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:41,480
like, I felt like a little bit more like sick than the last one. Oh my gosh. I was like,

389
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:47,160
but I kept wanting to go because like, a it's Disneyland. You have to, and, um,

390
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:53,560
B like I've got like my mother's mentality, you know, where it's like, oh, you can't just waste.

391
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:57,720
You have to actually have that in different ways. Like my mom just kind of has that, like,

392
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:03,720
you know, you just can't waste money, you know? And then my dad is just like a Disneyland fanatic.

393
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:09,400
He is, he, oh yeah. It was so cool last year going on Thanksgiving, the Thanksgiving holiday.

394
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:15,000
This was my first time going with a guide and I took my dad and my little brother and his girlfriend

395
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,360
and, uh, I like, we were exchanging emails and my, and it's like, yeah, we can decide when we want

396
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:25,320
to be there. And my dad's email back was so intense. It was like, we will get there, um,

397
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,960
right before the park opens, we will go on all the rides. I would like the park hopper tickets

398
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,400
and we will leave at midnight.

399
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:39,880
Road drop to midnight, baby. That's how you do it. Uh, even we weren't able to, to stay until

400
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,600
midnight at a certain point, we're like, okay, I think it's time to go.

401
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,680
Wow. So you can't keep up with either generation on either side of your,

402
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:54,040
younger or older. Well, I mean, the thing is, is that like, if you're the way we did it when we

403
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:58,920
were kids, it was like, we didn't have the luxury of a guide, you know? Um, and so the times in

404
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,920
between are actually important when you're waiting to get on a ride because your body is at a state

405
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:10,840
of rest, you know, but a guide gives you those like special powers where you can fast pass it and,

406
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:18,760
and, uh, you know, uh, you can, you know, do so many more rides and, uh, like it's, you don't

407
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:24,840
realize that like, you know, you just put your body on like, like a machine going like, you know,

408
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,200
a hundred miles an hour or whatever. And then you, and then it's like, okay, now this one,

409
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,280
you spin around and then this one, you just go like loop de loop. And then there's colors and

410
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:38,040
lights coming at you from all directions, every single ride, you know, we did the entire California

411
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:46,040
adventure park before 11 AM. Oh yeah. You know, and so it was just like, we just, we were going at a

412
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:53,000
much higher, um, uh, pace. Sure. That's also on top of like, I mean, if you go to a park all day,

413
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,960
especially in Southern California, it's probably going to be sunny all day. Like, so you spend a

414
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:03,720
lot of time in the sun, which can be tiring. Yes. And then the sun goes down and, uh, it gets cold

415
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:10,040
at night a lot of the year in California. So then you have that beating against your, uh, potentially

416
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:18,440
sunburned skin. Uh, so I find, I find Florida, like I can go for a lot longer in Florida. I mean,

417
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:24,680
I guess it's also like vacation. But it's the hottest, most humid. I love it. I love it. That's

418
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:30,200
insane. I love to sweat it out, but like, I hate, I don't like the cold nights here. You prefer

419
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:35,080
humidity and hurricanes? Oh, I love the humidity. Yeah, I love it. I'll, I will take a humid night

420
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:41,320
over like a cold night in Anaheim, but it's so, it can get, I was, we were there in like September

421
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:47,000
last year and it was a press, it was 90 degrees. The heat was unbearable and it was also humid.

422
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:53,320
Like that's, it was, that's a crazy climate. I like humid too. I'm just saying to still prefer one

423
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:58,120
drastically over the other, I think is just as pure insanity. Jason, I think you used to say

424
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:05,400
just as pure insanity. Jason, I think you just gave me more empathy of, uh, what it's like to

425
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:13,480
not have my, um, pigment of skin, you know, cause I would never, I would never think of like the,

426
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:18,840
the factor in, oh, well we're going to be in the sun and then the night will beat down on your,

427
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:27,160
your skin, you know, like, that's like, that's my fine Irish heritage. That's why, uh, the people

428
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:34,680
made to, uh, uh, drink whiskey and then die from lack of potatoes. Uh, so not exactly the most

429
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:41,880
evolutionary advanced, uh, people and run from the British, like hide from the British or fight the

430
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:47,880
British. Y'all have survived famines galore, you know? Like that's, I would say that you're

431
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:54,120
evolutionarily strong. So the young Jason can eat all the treats. Mike is like, Mike is stuck cause

432
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:59,160
he's got like five jokes at once. Yeah, it's too much, too much clogging the pipe. I'm just saying

433
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:03,000
I've been with you to Disneyland many, many, many times and there's never been a scenario where by

434
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,520
six o'clock you're beat red and like you have a crazy cartoonish sunburn. I think I just find it

435
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:14,120
more draining. I'm also pretty diligent about sunscreen. I have the place, I, you are drained.

436
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:19,800
What's the problem? I will say this. I've seen you drained every place in Los Angeles, except

437
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,840
Disneyland. That's the only time I don't think you're exhausted. You've fallen asleep on my

438
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:30,280
couch in various apartments over the years, but Disneyland, you are wide awake. I've told other

439
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,920
people, this is your place. This is the place where you will see this man at his most alive.

440
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:41,160
We added that is accurate too. We edit out the moment in every podcast where you're like,

441
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:52,040
sorry guys, I need a break sunburn nap time for me. You are, you are, you can stay awake. I'm,

442
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:56,680
all I'm saying, I'm giving you credit. You could do a 16 hour Disney day. I can do a 16 hour. I'm

443
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:02,280
not sure about Scott. Scott, I think is the one who likes to, cause Scott will generally be like,

444
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,000
I'm coming down. Uh, we're going to go on one ride and then we're going to leave. We're going

445
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,480
to eat dinner. Then we're going to leave. Yeah. When we've hung, it's usually, yeah, we join you

446
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:16,200
for one or two things. Yeah. The car they circle lounge for a while. We have like, it's me and the

447
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:21,640
wife speed. We have two cocktails. Scott goes on a ride before that. He goes on a ride after,

448
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,800
and then they go home. And then we were Lindsay and I stay. That's the way to do it. You know,

449
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:31,800
I don't want to like jump ahead in the order, but this is a perfect segue into, uh, today's ride

450
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:38,840
topic because the little mermaid ride is a perfect ride for that. If I just want to go have a couple

451
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:44,120
drinks and take, take some nice photos by the, by the old sun wheel and walk around and like, all

452
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:51,000
right, solid three hours. Uh, uh, the little mermaid is a perfect one to, uh, that's, you know,

453
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,560
that reliably doesn't have a line or it's a very fast line. If, if, if the park is clearly, uh,

454
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:02,120
jammed to the brim, I know I can at least get on the little, we are, we are talking about California

455
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:07,400
adventure. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Cause that's the one you can, you can drink at. Yes. Oh,

456
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:14,200
yeah. I see. Yeah. Uh, sometimes I'll go down just for like, you know, two glasses of white wine

457
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:20,360
purposes. It's great. No one should be upset about it. It's a gas. This is the way to do it.

458
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:25,480
I've had some of the best days and nights of my life, having two glasses of white wine and then

459
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:35,320
leaving. Oh my goodness. I can't deal. That's the nice thing. 16 hours where you fit in everything.

460
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:42,440
Sounds good too. Like, oh my, when I was a kid, I would, I would force my, I was definitely,

461
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:49,320
would you call it a ropes to a road drop to like, park clothes? Yeah. Oh, I wore out my parents. I

462
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:55,400
was definitely that way as a kid, like an exhaustive and then like midnight is technically the closing

463
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:00,920
but I, you can still kind of dilly dally and main street for a while. I would do all the way from

464
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:10,280
8 AM to one. So I, I've done my, my time in the exhaustive manner, but man, these days, oh boy.

465
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,520
If you linger long enough, you can see the kiss good night. Leland, you know about the kiss good

466
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:21,160
night. I don't know about the kiss. This sounds like a phrase I would make up. When we saw the

467
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:25,880
mainstream electrical for it, didn't we see all the characters? Yes. That's a different thing than

468
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:30,360
what you're talking about. Oh, it is. Okay. Nevermind. What's the kiss good night? It's, it's shortly

469
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:35,240
after official park clothes, the castle like twinkles and an announcement comes on and it

470
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:41,160
says like Disneyland has concluded its operational day. Like, you know, we hope you had a magical

471
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:46,440
time and get home safely. It's a magical use of the word operational. But it's just like a little light

472
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:52,760
twinkling. They make a lot more of it in Florida. They do a lot more of the kiss good night and they

473
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:57,640
play it like over every 15 minutes after the park closes. Basically, I think I don't know the actual

474
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:03,000
number. People are yelling now at their phones. Wait, what is the kiss good night? I don't,

475
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,160
it's a phrase that why Walt use that would say like, it's a little, like a nice little thing to

476
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:12,200
say goodbye to everybody at the end of the night. Okay. That refers to the recording of like,

477
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:19,560
Oh yeah. And a little light, light. Yeah. There's no kiss. No one gets kissed. That would be illegal.

478
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:29,320
Every guest. When Jason is mayor, he will, he will make that a law at Disneyland. But until then,

479
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:36,280
Pucker up everyone. Come give Jason a kiss. Jason is like Richard Dawson just standing outside the

480
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:42,760
exit gate and you have to kiss him on the way out. That's for the younger folks. That's a,

481
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,800
that's a very old reference to a host of the family feud who liked to kiss all the contestants.

482
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:52,760
And it was more okay then than it is today. Oh yeah. No, he would not, I don't think anyone

483
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:57,560
liked doing it back then, but especially today that would not, that would not fly. Steve Harvey's not

484
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:04,360
kissing all the guests. Don't get a little mustache brush if you're a guest on the show.

485
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:12,280
So little mermaid ride. Yeah. Yeah. Ariel's undersea adventure. But in Florida it is called

486
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:18,520
under the sea journey of the little mermaid. And there's also a live show, which is called

487
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:24,920
voyage of the little mermaid. Yes. There's a lot of little mermaid title confusion going on across

488
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:30,040
these parks, but it was, you just end up calling it the little mermaid ride. Right. I just, what is

489
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:35,720
the, why call it two different things in Disneyland? It's confusing because I, the ride is I'd almost,

490
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:40,920
they're almost identical. I was, I've been on both of them in the last few months. So,

491
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:46,440
and you will again. Yeah. It's just the exterior is really the cue and the exterior is the

492
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:53,240
difference. Out here it's in a repurposed golden dream, which was the old whoopee Goldberg film.

493
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:58,120
They repurposed the building, which is an old piece of California, like architecture. It's the

494
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:03,880
palace of the fine arts in San Francisco, right? When there were a lot of like many recreations

495
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:13,160
of California things in California adventure. They really trivia. Yeah. If you want to like,

496
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:20,440
just shout nerd or like, like push us or something you can lead. I'm gentle in heart. That's, I know

497
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:28,360
that. Uh, body guards who I've learned are named brick and mortar are making her a sandwich now.

498
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:42,040
Mortar 1920s, going from seven friends of Bugsy. Uh, so, and then the, the line outside in Florida,

499
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:47,720
the outside is, is more like rock because it's more of a theme. What you're saying that it's like

500
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:53,320
the cave of one, the not the cave wonders, not Latin, but the cave with all her, it's sort of

501
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:58,600
like the, where does Ariel live? Castle from the movie. Oh, right. Yeah. There's sort of like a

502
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:03,240
castle. This is, this picture is pretty small, but it looks like you're the two back to back.

503
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:07,880
Oh, oh yeah. They're very different, huh? Yeah. Okay. So you're saying one you,

504
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:13,000
Ariel is inside of Ariel's castle. And then another one, Ariel is inside of a concert

505
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:20,040
venue in San Francisco. I am saying that. And yeah, so, but though I like the, um, the California

506
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:24,200
but that's no slam on that. I think it's, I think it's kind of fun that they weaved that into that

507
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:30,360
space and left that kind of that dome and that glass walls. It's a nice piece of architecture.

508
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:34,280
It's kind of cool looking. I mean, I think I probably prefer the one that seems like you're

509
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:39,880
more like by the sea. That would make more sense to be like, Oh, I'm going under the sea now.

510
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:45,160
I mean, the Florida one is. I never judge the outside of a ride. Oh my God, you're on the wrong podcast.

511
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:52,440
That sounds insane to me. The ride is about the ride. The ride starts, the ride starts from looking

512
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:57,080
at the outside of the ride and then going through the queue because your experience should start

513
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,920
there. It's like the Indiana Jones ride. That's a whole part of it. I guess you're right. And it is

514
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,080
really important to have a good line experience because you will be in it and stuff like that.

515
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:13,720
I think my favorite is probably Space Mountain because it's cool. Yes. In there it's like cool.

516
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:19,480
And there's like machines just going, you know, like, yeah, I think it's a little bit of a bummer

517
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:23,960
that they like, I don't know why this changed, but I think you used to like kind of do the ride,

518
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:29,160
do the line all the way inside Space Mountain and maybe it's a capacity issue, but now they kind of

519
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:33,880
rush you through all those tunnels, which should be fun to hang out in there as opposed to on that

520
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:39,880
like that deck for a long time. It's like Indiana Jones too. Do you mean in general or like when you

521
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:45,080
have a guide or whatever? No, no. If you go, anytime you go on Space Mountain in Disneyland,

522
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:51,400
like you get, once you get in the actual building, you like rush through all that interior stuff.

523
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:57,960
They have a lot of outside line space now. And that led in like groups of a couple dozen at a time.

524
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:02,040
Oh, I know what you're talking about. Okay. Yeah, yeah, I hear you. But it'd be nice to be in there.

525
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:08,840
Yeah. Yeah. There used to be like, like more lax codes, I think, like for having like fire codes,

526
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:13,080
I think where you could like, cause the Indiana Jones ride and the Space Mountain, they're like

527
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:17,560
pretty narrow and they probably don't want to pack people in a place where if there was a fire,

528
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,760
it would be hard to get them all out. That totally makes sense. So in the old days,

529
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,160
no one cared about that. And it was fun because you just get kind of trapped in these fun little

530
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,320
lines. But now it's like, you got to sit mostly outside and then they kind of rush you through

531
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:37,880
the cool line. Do you have a lot of capacity complaints like we do? No, I just think it's like,

532
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:42,040
even then like being in the line, that's still the experience of the ride. You guys are talking

533
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:47,720
about straight up the like the outside. Oh yeah. Oh sure. Well, but I'm a fan of architecture in

534
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:52,520
general. And I like when it's a cool looking building. Space Mountain is a cool looking building

535
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:57,720
and it makes sense that it looks like a cool spaceship thing. You know, it's a good example

536
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:05,320
of this issue is that it's a small world in Disneyland is that grand 60s pop art exterior.

537
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:09,960
And in Disney world, it's just kind of jammed into like a storefront and you don't really get

538
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:14,280
all that. And it sort of makes, even though it's almost the same ride, it makes it like a little

539
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:22,040
less of a full, yes. Yeah. Magical experience. So yeah, so it's, it's a little, it's underwhelming

540
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:25,240
of a line. I guess we're starting in the line here, but for a little mermaid in California,

541
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:29,080
I'm not even saying that necessarily. I'm saying, Oh, you are. Oh, we've done the Florida one,

542
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:32,120
which I have a floor. One is just a little better as well. All that rock work and everything.

543
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:38,440
Rock workers. We love fake rocks on this program. We love, that's one of the things we all agree on.

544
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:45,080
We love fake rocks. That's a Disney. That's a really good, I want so badly for you to find

545
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:52,680
a fake rock company to sponsor you. Oh yeah. Oh, we love that. What a match. Like what other

546
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:58,680
thing is going to seek out a company of fake rocks to be like, we want to promote your fake rocks.

547
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:07,480
However, the, the like who out there listening to this podcast has a need for, and the money

548
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:15,640
for a lot of fake rock work. Yeah. I mean, if you build it, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.

549
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:21,880
We have a couple like very rich listeners that like have a lot of room to make like fake rocks

550
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:27,320
and stuff like a fake Mesa rich. Maybe it's just like, you know what? Everybody's got something

551
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,920
that they want to invest in. And it's like, I think it would be cool to have fake rocks in my

552
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:38,680
living room or whatever. Like, I don't know. I would do if I had like a crazy backyard is like

553
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:46,040
fake rock work, water slide. Oh yeah. I want like, I want a level slide. There we go. I can't,

554
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:51,880
it's beyond that. I would need like some more money to have that. I would need tens of millions

555
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,960
more dollars to have that. I will not real rocks. They're fake rocks guys.

556
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:02,600
But somebody has to design them and mold it. These are, these are artists and technicians.

557
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:07,960
I think you could figure it out. I really want to, a few weeks ago when we were like

558
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:13,320
looking at the star Wars land progress and we're like, wow, fake rocks looking real good.

559
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:18,920
Yeah. We're getting really good at these rocks. We love looking at the rocks and progress.

560
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,760
The rock is because right now you can see sort of like that inside the steel before they put

561
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:27,560
the fake rocks out of the new star Wars land. Cause they're building it. Um, we love literally

562
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:37,160
yawning fake rock caused the other, but it's not, it might not be unrelated.

563
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,680
I would want like, we're going to get in the car after this and drive down to Glendale,

564
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:47,080
down to the flower street campus. And you're going to meet some of the extended Disney family,

565
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:52,040
some of your extended family members in the engineering department. And they'll tell you

566
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:57,000
all about the fake rocks all day long. You know what, we're throwing the topic out. It's fake

567
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:03,640
rocks for the rest of this podcast. Change of plans. Sorry, Leland. Fake rocks from here on out.

568
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:10,600
I've been duped. It's an ambush. Jump in if you want, but we'll be talking anyway. Yeah. Um,

569
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:15,560
um, so good fake rocks. So good fake rocks in Florida. That's basically what I'm saying.

570
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:23,320
Here in, in, uh, Anaheim, there is a lovely giant painting inside.

571
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:32,600
Giant painting. I watched a panel from D 23, a few, a number of years ago about making this ride

572
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:39,560
and like someone they like paint it that it's like, it was a giant canvass like that. It was

573
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:46,040
painted and like had an insane, they were talking about how like the guy who was painting it had

574
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:53,640
like a brush with a single hair on it to like do the eyebrows of this painting. Like that's how

575
00:57:53,640 --> 00:58:01,880
labor intensive it was. That sounds like the lore of a Disney movie. Like, it's like, get the brush

576
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:08,760
with a single hair and then you can find true love. It's an artifact that Ariel would find

577
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:14,840
in treasure and keep true that we've been, you know, we're talking about, uh, murals and rockwork

578
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:19,800
and so we haven't asked you why you chose this. What is your relationship with the rider with

579
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:26,840
the little mermaid in general? Um, it's the reason why I chose this one is because it snuck up on me

580
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:34,280
as far as how, how I would feel about it. Uh, I went last year, uh, with my dad and my little

581
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:39,080
brother and his girlfriend and, uh, it was one of the first rides we did of the day. So it's like,

582
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:46,120
we're all coffeeed up. It's like eight 30 or something like that. I'm just like, I'm still

583
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:51,640
trying to, you know, manage it. Like I, I have a thing when I'm with my family, I want to herd them

584
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:56,360
and I want to feel like I'm the person, like I want to be the guy, you know? And so like, I'm just

585
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:01,640
like, is everybody good? Is everybody, you know, like have, has gone to the bathroom, hungry,

586
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:05,480
whatever. And so like, I'm distracted. This is one of the first rides we go on in the day. There's

587
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:13,000
like no line. Yeah. And, uh, like you said, cause it's no line. Um, and we get it. I'm like, oh great.

588
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,960
Yeah. We can just like knock this one off. Like it's also, you know, my family has like a checklist

589
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:25,640
mentality when we go to the park. It's like, we got to do them all like Pokemon. Um, anyway, um,

590
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:37,160
I got to do them all the Pokemon. Great. Uh, you get it. Um, and like a third of the way into this ride,

591
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:46,280
I just start sobbing. Like it was, and I think what really made it so effective is that

592
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:51,640
I feel like a lot of the rides are usually like a take on the movie, you know? So it's like, uh,

593
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:57,160
uh, you know, it's like, oh, remember this from cars, you know, it's the, it's the cool, uh, like

594
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:02,760
low rider station, you know, but they give you something new. And I think that's, that's important,

595
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:06,440
you know, but what's special about the little mermaid ride is they don't give you anything new.

596
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:12,760
It's just straight up the scenes from the movie. It's the actual lyrics. Um, it's a, it's, it's

597
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:18,920
real voices. Yeah. It's the real voices. I think at least in the cases of any, if it's them singing,

598
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:25,400
if it's a, uh, or so are Ariel, it's the real recordings. And, and so it was like living

599
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:32,440
a movie, you know, it was, it was like being a child again, watching little mermaid and three

600
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:36,360
dimension. You can look wherever you want. And yeah. And so it was just like, it was layered

601
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:42,280
because it was like that movie I watched all the time as a kid. And you know, I was at Disneyland

602
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:48,200
with my family and which, you know, brings back those childhood memories too. And it was like,

603
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:53,560
just us on this ride. And it was like our own personal ride because there was no line and stuff

604
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:58,840
like that. And I'm like, it's beautiful. Like I was just like, and then I like pulled myself

605
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:02,840
together and it did not have the same effect on my family. Like, cool. Let's do California screaming.

606
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:11,400
Let's do a real ride. Um, but they probably like, I probably the ages line up where you were like,

607
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:16,440
you were super young and indelible and that must've been your movie. I think it was my movie.

608
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,960
Probably all of us to some extent was one of the first ones we were aware of,

609
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:25,160
or had been. So if they don't have the same, if that movie doesn't have the same pull,

610
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:31,400
yeah, it wasn't like my dad's childhood movie or my brother's, you know? Yeah, you're right. It was my

611
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:37,480
special movie that I watched again and again as a, as a tiny tot. Yeah. That's it. It's funny. And

612
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:43,480
you described that it has that effect on you even as an adult, because I imagine like that, like I

613
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:48,680
think it's neat and I like going on it. It's, but it's not, I, I, I, I'm always thinking like,

614
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:53,320
when you, when it spins you around and you see Ariel for the first time, probably young girls

615
01:01:53,320 --> 01:02:00,040
must be so like heart drained. Yeah. It's nice to hear that is the case. Oh, it's, it was so true.

616
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:05,000
And I didn't even see it come in. I was like, oh, we're just having fun as a family. Does everybody,

617
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:13,000
has everybody gone to the bathroom? And it caught me. Was there a specific show scene or was it just

618
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,880
sort of all of it at once? Well, you know how bad I am with specifics. Sure. I mean, but it was like

619
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:24,360
not Ursula at the, like stealing the voice that would be, and you're like, oh, Ursula. I just want

620
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:33,880
that power. Was it Flotsam and Jetsam or what was, was it under the sea? It was under the sea. I think.

621
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:40,520
I think it was, it had to be under the sea because that's, that's where the whole party is.

622
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:46,760
Everybody's there. It's like a family under the sea is the family reunion of the little mermaid.

623
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:54,520
Yeah. Interesting. You know, everybody shows up. Right. The flute plays the lute and the car plays the harp.

624
01:02:54,520 --> 01:03:02,840
Wow. And the boy fish blow. One thing again, listening to Imagine, the panel with the

625
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:08,440
Imagineers talking about building this ride. I mean, they, they encountered a thing that like a

626
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:11,960
lot of ride designers encounter when they're basing a ride on a movie. It's like, how do you

627
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:17,240
condense an hour and a half, two hours into a three minute experience. And with this one,

628
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:24,440
they said, well, we figured out, we just built it around the songs. Like we built,

629
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:28,280
essentially build it around the set piece because Little Mermaid was the first in like,

630
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:34,120
I mean, it was the first of like the big Disney animation revival in the late eighties and early

631
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:39,960
nineties with like Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Lion King, kind of all in a row.

632
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:44,920
And a lot of those kind of have like a Broadway musical sort of structure. So that's why, like,

633
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:50,600
you see under the sea and part of their world and kiss the girl. One thing that I always laugh at

634
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:55,880
in this ride, cause some, sometimes you to like condense a whole movie under ride, there's some

635
01:03:55,880 --> 01:04:02,520
stuff that's gotta go, which in this one, there's no song for the let's kill Ursula at the end

636
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:06,840
sequence. So that's why she just kind of like at towards the end of the ride, she's just like

637
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:11,560
sinking in the background. Like there's no fight scene in the room. She's in the shadows.

638
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:16,520
Yeah. I think that- Her death has occurred off screen or she were watching her demise in progress,

639
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:22,360
I guess. Yeah. It's weird. I mean, that's the one that I think the first time anybody goes on it,

640
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:28,120
generally, I go, wait, what? There's a, there's a, like it skipped a scene. It skips a scene

641
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:34,040
because because the, because the ride is so literally the story, it, I feel like everyone

642
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:39,880
expects like we're going to watch a giant Ursula get stabbed by the mast of a ship and it doesn't

643
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:46,520
happen. It's a little dark. But you could still have like a giant Ursula somewhere in a ship sort

644
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:50,680
of like coming at her. So you don't have to actually show an impaling on a ride. Or do the

645
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:56,600
classic, there's some sort of, um, strobe-y the way the witch dies in snow white. Right. The witch

646
01:04:56,600 --> 01:05:01,320
dies at the end of a snow white ride. Oh yeah. That's strobe. But we don't see the, the old

647
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:08,040
woman's corpse hit the ground or anything. Like, Oh my gosh. I mean, I don't know. Do you think if,

648
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:13,880
like, if they just didn't have any Ursula in it, like at the end, like would it kind of make the

649
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:20,360
ride feel not as whole? Like, I feel like the struggle is like, you gotta, like, like the whole

650
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:28,520
tension and stakes is like, you gotta get kissed before you become a little sea urchin guy, you

651
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:32,600
know? Um, and so it's like, that's the whole thing. And so once you do it, it's, it's like,

652
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:37,320
well, I guess we see them kiss at the very end. That's when they kiss in the movie.

653
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:43,080
They're, they presumably are in the, in the, in the kiss the girl sequence. Are they like leaning

654
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:48,920
in for a kiss? They don't kiss because Watson and Jepson, uh, top, top of the little boat.

655
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:53,160
Oh, that's right. Oh, I forgot. And that's the name of the Eels. Watson and Jepson.

656
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:57,240
Yeah. Alternate names for your body guards.

657
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:11,320
Don't like that. They are just like the actual Eels. Don't make eye contact. Make some angry guys.

658
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:18,760
Well, also though, characters, animatronics kissing is a hard thing. Does that occur in

659
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,360
any ride? Oh, that's a good question. Are there any rides where animatronics kiss?

660
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,760
It would be as awkward as the Mark Twain handshake. There's gotta be.

661
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:29,320
There's people again, yelling at the podcast right now, cause they know the answer to this.

662
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,920
All the dwarfs kiss. Remember all seven at one time.

663
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:38,680
Snow White makes them kiss for a reason. I like to think of as the,

664
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:44,040
the pirates of the Caribbean chasing, which is like, no, that's not kissing.

665
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:47,560
They're trying to get a kiss. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and pursuit.

666
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:52,840
We'll figure it out. We'll see if there's kissing with little mermaid. Yeah. I think

667
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:58,120
everyone has this, um, I, not every, but most people have an affection for a little mermaid

668
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:03,240
because as Jason was saying, it's like Disney got good again. And I mean, we were all little

669
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:09,400
at the time too. Um, so those, those few movies, we were talking about like the songs too, like

670
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:15,560
is part of your world probably like the best song of those move of Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty and the

671
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:20,120
beast. Oh, I don't know. It might resonate the most. I feel like people always say that's their

672
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:27,160
favorite. I feel like, well, I don't know if I'd say the best, but I think it's a very crucial

673
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:34,520
song in the really the revival of animation at Disney in general, because that is the heart of

674
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:40,680
Ariel and the character in the story. And it's a, and kind of a, you know, the, uh, the, the,

675
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:46,840
the character singing about what they want, which is some variances in that in most of those movies

676
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:53,720
you just described. And it's just such a soaring, uh, and supposedly isn't there some lore that

677
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:59,080
Eisner wanted to cut it? Oh, I've never heard that. I think this is addressed in some documentary,

678
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:07,320
which, and they, they had to plead, they had to say, how could you rip the heart out of this film?

679
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:14,200
We can, he's like, it's boring. It's not testing. Well, he like, really, hopefully I'm not throwing

680
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:18,040
him under the bus, but I feel like that is a true story. I don't know how seriously it was considered.

681
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:26,520
Katzenberg tried to cut it. Katzenberg, Katzenberg. Try apologize to Michael Eisner, Scott.

682
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:31,080
Officially apologize to Michael Eisner. Apologize to Michael and apologies to Breck, his son, who

683
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:35,320
we would love to have. We want all the Eisner's podcast to talk about all the rides that he

684
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:41,560
inspired. It's such a, like, it's such a huge, uh, want song, right? That's the Broadway term.

685
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:48,680
A one song is like a big part of a lot of musicals. Yes. And every Disney movie has that one. Like

686
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:56,440
Mulan has the reflection song. Yeah. Aladdin has the street rat song. And the Beast, the, uh,

687
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:03,960
I want adventure in the great white. So that, which is the very like, um, sound of music kind of.

688
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:09,160
Oh, so sound of music. Yeah. Uh, does, does blanking have one? He's going to be a king.

689
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:13,240
I'm going to be a mighty king. Yeah. I guess that's a one way. It doesn't always have to be a.

690
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:17,400
That's his literal want. Like out of all the songs, that's the most, that's one. It's like,

691
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:21,880
this is what I want. The title explains the desire. I was just thinking, because often these songs are

692
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:27,800
like these kind of stirring melancholy, but I guess in that case it's a fun one. Yeah. The Mrs. Pot song from Beauty and the

693
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:32,600
What is that called? Mrs. Pot sings the, I was trying to think, I was thinking more about

694
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:37,560
part of your route being like a very emotional, uh, song in terms of like, can you feel the love

695
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:43,560
tonight or tail as old as time? That's the love song. She doesn't have a want song about wanting to

696
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:50,280
pour tea out of her nose. No, no, no, no. That's like the, can you feel the love tonight? Yeah.

697
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:58,200
That's the kiss the girl, you know, the, that's what that, um, that song plays in the Mrs. Pot says no wants of her own.

698
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:06,440
Whatever you want, dearie. She's just happy to be there. I just want Chip to move out. I don't want him to

699
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:12,600
steal. When he's an adult, I mean, when he's of age appropriate, I just don't want him crashing in the

700
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:19,640
basement of the castle for too long. Find a girlfriend. Just meet a nice girl, a nice cup girl. But didn't,

701
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:27,080
part of your world is, part of your world is like, is the, if it's the first one of those, what became

702
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:34,840
a trope by the time, because much more like, uh, uh, calculatingly that song exists and like hunchback,

703
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:41,480
um, uh, or, and just around the river bend is good, but we're starting to get people are a little

704
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:48,200
less moved by these, these want songs. And then which takes you into the South park, um, uh, uh,

705
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:52,840
what's it called? Bigger, Longer, Uncut, which has the devil's want song. By the time they were doing

706
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:57,640
that movie, it was like a, such a trope that there is the want song. I don't know if that takes us

707
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:04,600
into South park. That's a hard turn, Scott. Why me? Like, you know, you know how like little mermaid takes us to

708
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:10,760
lion king that takes us to Pocahontas, you know, and then we go to South park naturally. Well, that is

709
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:15,240
interesting because there was a Terrence and Philip cameo in this ride originally. No,

710
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:24,120
no, my mind wouldn't make it past that piece of trivia. That's too much. Well, there is, we're

711
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:29,880
going to get to, we're going to, I mean, I guess we're going to get to it now. There is, stop that.

712
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:36,840
You creeped out by that. What's that crab doing buddy? Stop that.

713
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:45,640
Now we know you're scared of Terrence and Philip. Yeah. It's just the combination is just creepy,

714
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:50,840
creepy. It's weird. Yeah. The, uh, that I was going to say though, the quick, we'll quickly go,

715
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:55,800
we'll go back to this topic, but the, the cameo on this ride, which might be my favorite part of this

716
01:11:55,800 --> 01:12:01,160
ride. What? I don't know. Do we not know this? So it's only, I believe in California, but if,

717
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:05,880
when you're on the ride in the end of the sea room, if you look kind of behind your clam shell,

718
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:10,760
cause it's pointing to more toward the action. If you look toward the end, as you're exiting the,

719
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:20,040
the incredible Mr. Limp it, the fish, the Don knots fish character from the old movie is in shadow.

720
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:26,680
He's not a Disney character. He's a Warner Brothers character and he is hidden on the ride.

721
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:33,080
And I look for him every time I'm delighted by this bizarre choice to put him on there.

722
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:37,240
How's this never come up? You've never, I didn't, you never seen, we've talked about this. Yeah.

723
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:41,160
We've been on this ride, I think at the same time, and I'm surprised I wasn't just talking

724
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:49,800
about Mr. Limp it the whole time. Yelling back out of your, there he is. Look kids cheering for an

725
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:56,440
old Don knots movie. Here, I'll find a picture of it. Yeah. Yeah. So that is such a cool Easter egg.

726
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:01,880
I have not heard why they did it. He's a fish. I guess is all you need to know. And there's probably

727
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:11,400
a fan and he's the only like, here he is. Whoa. Mr. Limp it. It's a picture. That's so fun.

728
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:17,560
It's my favorite thing. Accurate enough, but also copyright free enough. Yeah. Yes. And he's just

729
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:25,400
kind of peeking out. He doesn't move or anything. Isn't now there's some weird thing that our buddy

730
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:29,800
Andrew Grissom talks about where they, there was like an, there's artwork you can find of a Mr.

731
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:37,960
Limp it remake with Jim Carrey. Is that correct? Someone else where like you can see a fishified

732
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:44,120
modern actor and it's very terrifying, like, like nightmare concept art that makes you glad

733
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:51,320
there was no film. Does that ring a bell though? Is that? Yeah. This is what Don knots. This is the

734
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:58,040
movie. The fish looks like I'm a little weird. So yeah, that's another very timely reference.

735
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:03,720
That's a cool little trivia. Yeah. So that's, that's very fun. And that's the only like

736
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:11,480
fish out of water on the ride. Ooh. As far as I know, I mean, I haven't seen, there's no like

737
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:19,160
secret, uh, apple dumpling gang animatronic, the other Don knots Disney movie. Yeah. What are their

738
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:25,080
famous cartoon fish? I mean, yeah, there should just be more Don knots animatronics on this ride.

739
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:31,000
I think fish police arresting her. So, Oh, wait. Oh, now I'm forgetting. I, you know what,

740
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:37,320
as part of this, I was recalling that there was a little mermaid animated series. Yes. There was

741
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:41,880
an animated series where she had like a buddy. I didn't watch it. I don't know. I've maybe was it

742
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:49,800
on Disney channel. It was, um, not sure it may have been syndicated and it was like, it was kind of

743
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:57,400
like the movie never happened. Like Ariel was a mermaid. She has a buddy, like I forget the guy's

744
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:04,760
name, but she had a friend who was like, uh, another kid flounder and, and, uh, they're all in it.

745
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:09,720
I think she's got a little orca friend too. I'm looking it up as fast as I can, but I think there

746
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:15,080
were like fish police esque elements in the show. Like they're, oh, there, yeah, there's a,

747
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:22,360
a race of shark, like merfolk, uh, who are like, uh, mean and like, and shady like sharks. And

748
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:27,640
they're called the shark canians. Wow. Really? That's the, it's something you didn't know about

749
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:32,280
little mermaid world, the shark canians. And there's another, there's another like mobster group.

750
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:38,680
I'll, I'll interject if I find it. And then one, the other bizarre, oh, there's a lot, the lobster

751
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:44,920
mobster. So there's a lot of crossover between the odd failed show fish police and the little

752
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:48,600
mermaid animated show. There was, there's an underworld that Triton has to deal with.

753
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:52,840
You think Triton's just like a king in theory, but he's got to like cut deals with the

754
01:15:53,880 --> 01:16:02,120
sea underworld. Tony's a piano or something. He's keeping the, keeping the sea together.

755
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:07,720
I mean, that was in the era of like, you know, these big tent pole Disney movies would come out

756
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:14,840
and the sequels would either be TV shows or like direct to videotape, like the return of Jafar.

757
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:21,720
Yes. Yeah. Aladdin movie. They weren't valuing these things as many multi-sequel. I think

758
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:26,360
Toy Story 2 was probably what, what broke it, which itself was going to be straight to video.

759
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:31,160
Right. Yeah. Until they bought Pixar and retooled. The other thing I want to say about the show is

760
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:41,160
that there is an episode where Ariel meets a young author who she comes to know is Hans Christian

761
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:47,960
Anderson. She saves him and he's looking for inspiration for a book and boy does he find it

762
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:53,880
with the little mermaid and he writes the book and becomes the author we know and love today.

763
01:16:53,880 --> 01:17:01,560
And Hans Christian Anderson is voiced by Mark Hamill. Wow. That is incredibly meta.

764
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:06,120
Yeah. Very weird. And then there was a Tarzan. And that's cool because it's like, that's the

765
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:14,120
beginning of the marriage of Star Wars and Disney. Yes. This is the, yeah, actually canonically,

766
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:21,320
that's where it, that's the juncture point. That's where it started. Really the tale begins with,

767
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:26,760
but then there was also a Tarzan animated series where they did the same plot with Edgar

768
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:32,520
Respiros. Oh really? Where he meets Tarzan and inspires. So, and this, this all, this is all

769
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:38,200
like what we talked about just recently with, you know, chubby checker learning the twist from,

770
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:45,400
from the quantum leap guy. Right. White guys teaching black guys that about their famous thing,

771
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:50,520
basically. But in this case. Like getting back to the future. It's that authors have no ideas

772
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:56,120
and they steal them from accidental run-ins when they get lost in the jungle or the sea.

773
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:02,280
Just real quick here is the concept art of what the Jim Carrey fish was going to look like.

774
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:09,480
That is terrifying. No, no, no. That's a no go. Oh God. Oh wow. It's a. Are you going to say you

775
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:13,160
like this? Like the baby Grinch? Hold on. Let me see it again. Maybe I like it. It does look like

776
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:23,720
the baby Grinch. Do you put these pictures like up when this? Yes. We'll show it. Yeah. I still,

777
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:29,160
I still like baby Grinch. I like baby Grinch more than this. Okay. Cause baby Grinch from the movie,

778
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:35,000
the Grinch, the Jim Carrey Grinch movie. He is a little scary, but he's, I like him. He's cute.

779
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:40,360
And I think I'm not alone is what I'm saying. Also, you know, if they had made that movie,

780
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:45,480
Jim Carrey would have gone really method. Like he would have insisted in floating in a pool all day.

781
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:51,160
If he got out of the pool, he'd be like, I can't breathe the air. Is that something that Jim Carrey

782
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:55,560
does? Is he a method actor? Well, kind of on the man on the moon. I think on the man on the moon.

783
01:18:55,560 --> 01:19:01,640
That's different because like Andy Coffman was such a. He was, it was a level of commitment.

784
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:06,280
But you're saying he wouldn't have gone full fish. He wouldn't have gone full limpet.

785
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:12,200
He wouldn't have gone full. Jason's remarks about him are untrue. I don't think that like

786
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:17,640
Jim Carrey tried to break into an insane asylum, liked for research for pet detective, you know,

787
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:25,160
like either one he could use one for the other. We're the number 23. Well, he has, he's since gone

788
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:31,160
method. He's stayed as his number 23 characters since the release of the film. That's a good point.

789
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:38,520
Um, so, okay, we're talking. He's not in it. What have we missed? Oh, you know, the songs and the

790
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:45,560
songs and the ride. That's a weakness. So another interesting thing about the ride, uh, uh, that

791
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:50,120
the imaginators talked about was if you think about the ending of the movie, the little mermaid,

792
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:58,280
they get married during the day on a boat, which is difficult. It's difficult to do daytime in,

793
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:03,720
in dark rides in Disneyland style dark rides. It's difficult to simulate daytime inside. That's why

794
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:08,280
a lot of them, I mean, that's why they're called dark rides. Cause it's usually darker because you

795
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:14,760
have to hide stuff in the dark. So they had to get approval and pitch like the end of this.

796
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:22,360
What if they get married and it's night and what if it's just like them waving from a castle instead

797
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:27,480
of a boat? Yeah. That's why the end, the end is a little different. And some of the fish come back

798
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:32,920
and King Triton is waving at you. Yeah, I do remember that. I was like, okay. Yeah. Yeah.

799
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:38,040
This isn't right, but fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. King Triton, a very handsome animatronic at the end.

800
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:42,440
Yeah. He's, I always notice him. He like, he's in a good shape, but like he looks younger than King

801
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:47,720
Triton does in the movie. I feel. Yeah. Uh, he has, he looks, I mean, if it weren't for his like

802
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:54,040
white flowing hair and beard, he would just be like a hunk Fabio same body of like Hercules,

803
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:59,480
you know, like it's just like the same template, you know? Uh, but was he really that like,

804
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:07,480
he was jacked in the film. Okay. Without that white hair on the animatronic, he has a very small head.

805
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:12,600
Really now? Yeah. I guess that might be a giant body at a tiny head because it's like, well,

806
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:17,400
you don't need to finish the head if it's going to be covered in hair. Yeah. He's jacked, but he

807
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:22,200
does look like more of an old man in the cartoon. Like he looks, he's Jack. He's like a jacked old

808
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:26,920
man. He's like her all over the hair. Mostly hair, you know, you've seen that picture of her all dough

809
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:33,080
with his shirt off. He's 70, like he's incredible shape. I have not exaggerated. The beard is,

810
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:38,600
I mean, it's a huge, all those selfie. I'm good. It looks like he has a small head in the cartoon

811
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:44,040
as well. It's consistent. Is it, I think it's, I'm freaked out by him because he has the real hair

812
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:50,360
and Ariel has the odd plastic hair that was issue kind of in making the ride. Hey, we got her all

813
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:54,920
together. Jacked as a King Triton, but he's in good shape. He's 70 year old man. I mean,

814
01:21:54,920 --> 01:22:01,080
he's a good shape. I'm glad that Triton is like sunken lower in the sea. So as to not see his

815
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:05,960
pelvic region, unlike the her all the selfie, you just, I don't want to know what's on the way

816
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:14,040
to the balls. Her all the must've seen the DeAngelo video recently. And he was trying to

817
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:18,440
recreate that with that picture. He's not, but DeAngelo doesn't have that much more going on

818
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:24,120
than her all though. Her all those not looking bad there. Yeah. Um, so it's got no mustache. So,

819
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:29,560
Oh, that's another DeAngelo is hidden in this ride. There's a brief DeAngelo.

820
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:37,080
Who is DeAngelo? Uh, he was a singer, the singer, he had the, the, the music video. That's just one

821
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:42,680
long revolve around his perfect body. Uh, is a very sensual R and B.

822
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:48,520
How does it fit? Okay. Scott'll do a couple of minutes of the song for you right now.

823
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:55,640
Can you just please. You can't understand a Leela. That's basically what it is. Uh,

824
01:22:55,640 --> 01:23:03,480
All right. He's good. Does this look familiar? This man, this is the video. Uh, I mean, no.

825
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:10,360
Okay. And whose butt, if you look at him versus her all the versus Triton, who's, who's back in the

826
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:17,880
very cut. We'll do a poll. Who do you like best? Try to draw the DeAngelo shirtless guy of all

827
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:22,040
types. We already narrowed it down to three. We all agree that the top three, but who's the top one?

828
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:26,920
Right. Please decide for us audience. We have a huge bracket on a white board here in the

829
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:34,040
recording space. Uh, sure do. And this is what we all want to, sorry, my guards had to take that down.

830
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:42,440
So yeah, it was casting a weird shadow on my face. They're always looking out for me, you know?

831
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:47,400
Yeah. So we've, we've put it, I've put it off long enough to the, this is the thing we have to talk

832
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:54,200
about to many people. And I will consider myself included. This ride is a little disappointing.

833
01:23:54,840 --> 01:24:02,280
I find, I find that Jason, do you not disagree? I'm so sorry. I was curious. Uh, I know why though

834
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:08,760
it's, it's so Lizzie and I went, we went up, it was an eight back when they used to do an AP preview,

835
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:14,440
which was an annual pass holder preview for a ride. Now these days they're doing like a $300 party

836
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:18,200
that you have to pay in addition to your pass to go on in these rides early. We waited, I think

837
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:24,520
four hours for this. We were very excited. Uh, three or four hours. Um, and we went on and we

838
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:29,720
were like, it's fine. And I feel like that was a review that this ride got a lot, like, oh, no,

839
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:36,520
no, it was nice, but it feels a little still. It feels a little static. It doesn't, uh, it doesn't

840
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:42,840
do to me what pirate pirate, excuse me. Uh, Peter Pan does it. It doesn't transport you as much.

841
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:48,760
Uh, I, I agree with that. I think that if you had to wait four hours with anticipation, I think that

842
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:54,280
it was just kind of this happy, you know, planets aligning of, of it's just like, it was bright in

843
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:59,800
the day and we were just, we were there. I think what made that experience for me so magical is

844
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:04,920
that it was just like, it was kind of thrust upon us before we even know, knew what was happening.

845
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:11,240
Sure. Um, but yeah, it doesn't move very quickly. And like I said, it doesn't give you a lot of

846
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:17,160
things that are new and things that are new are like, just like confusing. Well, I think even

847
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:23,960
that three or four hour, like I waited for it. There's a, the Harry in, in, at the Harry Potter in

848
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:29,160
Florida, there's this ride escape from Gringotts, which is like a roller coaster with like show

849
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:33,880
scenes. Like you're trying to get out of the bank and escape from Voldemort. And I waited three or

850
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:39,400
four hours the summer that opened and I was afterwards, it's like, yeah, it was good. I was

851
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:44,520
glad I did it, but I feel like shit. But I'm going to say, like when I say we waited three or four

852
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:48,520
hours, I'm not trying to say, oh my God, we were depressed and like, that's going to affect the

853
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:53,640
ride. I've been on, we went, we waited three or four hours for guardians of the galaxy last year

854
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:59,480
and we loved it. When I was younger, three, three or four hours for Spiderman in Orlando, we loved

855
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:05,480
it. Well, I mean, yeah, like if you wait three or four hours and then you just get like suspended

856
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:11,160
air and dropped over and over again to eighties music, like, like you're going to completely

857
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:18,600
forget like that you waited all that time. Yeah. I guess the endorphins like take over. Yeah. And

858
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:23,080
the same thing happens with Peter Pan. Peter Pan is, I think it's the most popular ride at Disneyland.

859
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:26,760
Is that right? You guys would know. Well, it's not, I mean, it's all the first certainly,

860
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:31,320
sir. Certain it's the dark ride. That's the most popular. It's always the long, like, yeah, it always

861
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:34,760
has the one. I believe it's the one that fast passes don't work on, right? Something like that.

862
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:40,920
They don't have fast passes for any of those. They have it in Florida, but they

863
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:46,120
don't have it out here for the family. My dad's favorite ride. Yeah. Cause my dad really likes it

864
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:52,360
too. Yeah. Yeah. That's his little mermaid, I guess. Yeah. But I can completely understand,

865
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:56,840
uh, just because there's a whole like, yeah, like that is a transport.

866
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:02,840
It's a ride. It's when we're talking about when imagine, like I've, we've talked about Mr. Tony

867
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:08,360
Baxter, who was one of the top imagineers of all time. He didn't make this ride, but he, he calls

868
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:13,560
this type of ride and many people do, and many message board people do call this more of a book

869
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:19,800
report ride versus, you know, Peter Pan. It's, it's a ride that just kind of tells you what happens

870
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:27,160
as opposed to what does Peter Pan do that? Uh, it's not quite as like Peter Pan has moments

871
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:32,440
where you're just flying over the city. It's, you're the sort of star of the story as opposed

872
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:37,880
to little mermaid where you're watching things happen. Peter Pan has show scenes and stuff,

873
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:42,920
but it's not so dependent on a narrative. It's not like you go through the things that happen in the

874
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:47,880
movie where you're the car that's out of control. Yeah. You're you're it's your adventure. That's

875
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:53,720
sort of what Tony Baxter talks about. You crash your in hell. Yeah. That ride ends in hell. So

876
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:59,400
I guess they could have had Ursula getting killed. Uh, I don't know. There's something just so like,

877
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:03,800
I mean, I didn't even remember that in the movie until you mentioned it. She gets impaled by it.

878
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:10,600
Oh yeah. It's crazy. Because she is like a Kaiju level monster. Like even like Gaston, he just like

879
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:14,280
drops off a building and we assume that he's dead, but he disappears in like literal fog.

880
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:18,920
Right. We don't see him splat. Yeah. Yeah. Where it's like, you just see it, you know, like,

881
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:25,160
like, and it's so, it's a close up, you know, it's so intense. All the deaths are like, Scar

882
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:31,000
gets eaten by the, uh, people he was praying to a little while ago. That's true. This is the one

883
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:36,200
where you see it the worst. You're right. Yeah. Oh geez. And like, she's like, oh, like it's just

884
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:41,160
like terribly upsetting. What is Jafar ultimately? He goes back in the lamp. He goes in a lamp.

885
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:48,200
Snake is before Jeannie. He's a big snake. He turns into the snake and then he tricks. Yeah. Then

886
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:51,960
he tricked or they trick him into saying he wants to be a Jeannie and he gets put in the lamp.

887
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:56,280
So he's trapped. So there's no like, yeah, it's not a bloody, he doesn't get murdered. Yeah.

888
01:28:56,280 --> 01:29:03,400
He doesn't get stabbed to death. Got it. So, so, so yeah, so that's a, that's what, uh,

889
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:11,240
you reminded me of a point I wanted to make. I feel like it, a ride, the way it affects you

890
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:16,120
depends on, I think, where you are in your life as well, because I feel like I'm now in like a new

891
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:22,200
stage of Disneyland appreciation where it's, but I felt like the longest stage of it's like bigger,

892
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:30,040
faster, better, you know? Uh, and so I didn't want to waste my time on like the Snow White ride when

893
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:38,200
I could do, um, like, uh, Space Mountain and Star Tours and, uh, Indiana Jones and, uh, and Peter Pan

894
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:42,440
I could, I can handle because it's like, that's the one that felt like it was moving the most.

895
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:47,240
You know, Mr. Toad was like, Whoa, that's the one that's like a smaller ride. That's not as intense

896
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:51,720
where it's just like, wow, that you still get like a lot of like action and endorphins and stuff like

897
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:56,600
that. And, oh gosh, like you had to do it's a small world, but yeah, like I would just kind of like

898
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:01,800
grit my teeth and smile through it. Cause it's like the family wants to do it, you know? But like,

899
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:08,600
but that ride, The Little Mermaid hit me at a point where I was so open to nostalgia.

900
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:15,880
And so as far as a ride itself, I agree with you, it ranks lower than Peter Pan and blah, blah, blah.

901
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:23,000
Um, but as far as a nostalgic experience, it's, uh, top notch because like you said, Scott,

902
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:33,240
it goes slow. So it's like a two white wine ride. And like, there was so much time to absorb those

903
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:37,880
memories and recall those memories and stuff like that. So yeah.

904
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:43,080
Huh. I'm trying to think of what the, like, how do you resolve this exactly?

905
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:46,040
Exactly. Here's the thing. I think I did it really well.

906
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:52,920
No, no, no. I just mean, what is the fix? I mean, like if you were going to be more actively,

907
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:56,440
are you, are you going to talk about this? What's going on there?

908
01:30:56,440 --> 01:31:01,080
Pre-alternate ride. So on one of the DVDs, they were trying to make this ride. They were,

909
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:04,280
they've been trying to make this ride for years. Yeah. They were going to make it in the 90s and

910
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:11,240
put it in most of the magic kingdom style parks around the world. And it's like, in, uh, I took

911
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:15,800
Disneyland Paris that has never been filled by anything. And it's mentioned on a special,

912
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:20,920
it's described by Melanie Griffith as like a something it's cause she, she in this very

913
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:27,880
sedate manner, like in 1994, Ariel will join the family. It's a very odd clip.

914
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:33,160
And this is the sort of thing they don't really do anymore. When we had Eva Anderson on, like,

915
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:39,800
you know, we showed, uh, uh, the clips of, or we talked about her, there was a Disneyland history

916
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:45,800
special that her father had hosted. And like, and it's like, here's all the rides coming in the next

917
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:51,640
five years. And most of them didn't happen. And Ariel was mentioned in that. And so when they put

918
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:57,320
out the little mermaid on like special edition DVD in like 2006, this was in the special features.

919
01:31:57,320 --> 01:32:02,600
It's a CG animated, like here's what the ride was exactly what the ride would have been.

920
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:08,680
And we're watching it here. So yeah. So like it starts out in like a cool, like it's like wreckage

921
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:14,200
of ships and the dark ride thing. Yeah. So like, it's almost the start of pirates where you're like,

922
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:19,800
you're in a place, but then very quickly you're about to go under the sea. Yeah. So I would say

923
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:26,600
that the ride itself does not really honor like the dark ride can do, you know, um, this is spooky

924
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:32,680
and cool. This is spooky. It's more like place making going on in this you'd say, right? We got

925
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:39,640
Prince Eric's ship. Uh, so instead of just, you round a corner and Ariel's in Ariel, Ariel, like

926
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:45,400
emerges from the shadows and this grim seascape and she brings light to it. And then you go

927
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:51,640
under the sea. And what is the deal with this? How was this going to work? You mean the, how the water

928
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:55,640
I've heard Tony back to talk about this. So they were going to work. They were going to do like,

929
01:32:55,640 --> 01:33:00,440
it was going to be like laser, like a laser to like make the like surface different from

930
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:06,840
the water. So it would be like missed and laser. So it would look like there was like a layer of

931
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:11,480
water and then you would go under it and then it would be lit differently. Once you got down there

932
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:17,960
to make it completely look like the bubble transition parts in the existing ride is very

933
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:22,760
pleasant. I enjoy it. I like going under and coming out of them. I think it's clever that they use

934
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:28,440
the blank space of the shells to project the bubbles. They like, yes, and they changed that.

935
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:34,440
They had to add more bubbles as the, as I think after thing happened. So yeah, this is just more,

936
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:38,120
it's just more like kind of in the Peter Pan tradition. You see stuff that happens from the

937
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:42,520
movie, but it's sort of like, you're kind of going on your adventure, exploring this world.

938
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:48,680
Yeah. As opposed to just sort of, yeah, like you're just watching examples of book report rides.

939
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:53,240
Yeah, I'm trying to think. I mean, like kind of the monsters ink ride in California adventure is

940
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:57,960
a little, is like that. Yeah. You're not really, there's no real premise. Like you're the most,

941
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:01,880
there's a monster on the loose or there's a kid shot and Lisa Monstropolis, but how are you?

942
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:09,800
Yeah, it's a little duty within that story. Yeah. Which is opposed to like radiator Springs racers

943
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:14,840
and cars land. It's kind of like, yeah, you see the characters, but it's sort of new. It's telling

944
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:19,000
like a new, you're in cars, you're coming to radiator Springs, you're going to race that

945
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:26,040
the adventure you have to get right. Most of them aren't, if they have a property, most of them are

946
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:30,760
sort of their own little original thing, not a rich, completely original, but like have that element

947
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:38,440
of like kind of exploration. However, what you just showed, does that really solve that? Well,

948
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:43,240
first of all, what vehicle, what's the ride? You know, what's interesting is that, that, uh,

949
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:51,320
that simulation has a couple of like pirates of the Caribbean ish elements to it. Especially like

950
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:56,040
the shipwrecks and the mist and stuff. Like I watched, it reminded me cause there's a different

951
01:34:56,040 --> 01:35:03,880
sort of pirates ride in Disneyland Shanghai. And it seems like that is kind of big moments in that

952
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:11,960
ride. Remind me of this animatic. Yeah. Yeah. So the, the vehicle was not just sort of a, uh,

953
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:15,800
a thing that would be on the ground. And it was not, it was like something that would be kind of

954
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:21,400
suspended in the middle. Basically. I mean, there was, I think you can see to the start here. Um,

955
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:25,720
it's like, I think it's like technically hanging from the ceiling. It's what kind of shell,

956
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:31,880
it would make you feel like you were floating. You're in a big shell and it's that like corkscrew.

957
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:37,080
Right. It's a mollusk kind of shell. Uh, um, but yeah, wait, I don't even know what I'm looking.

958
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:41,960
It's not from above, but yeah, there's two, there's two like wires that are hanging. So like you would

959
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:46,600
be a little suspended and it will allow you to kind of like Bob, which would make you feel a little

960
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:51,240
bit more like you're under water. Why didn't they do it? It's, I'm sure it's just politics. It's just

961
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:56,360
like, what, whatever expense is a big thing. Watching, watching that, cause I watched that

962
01:35:56,360 --> 01:36:02,440
through a couple of times and it's also like, uh, uh, it looks like the blue sky version of that

963
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:08,680
ride. Cause like, yeah, they would have to invent a new ride system for that. Also like trying to

964
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:13,880
wrap my head around the space of that building that it could go in. It would have had to have been

965
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:17,880
huge. Right. It would have been probably a different building. The show scenes in that are very large.

966
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:22,200
It's a double decker. If we haven't described this properly, you're, you're like, it's all surrounding

967
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:26,520
the boat and this stuff above the water and below the water. So it's this double decker ride,

968
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:32,520
which I agree makes it a more interesting setting to explore. Uh, it's like how Alice in Wonderland

969
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:36,040
is made more interesting by the fact that you're going upstairs and you go outside for a bit and

970
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:40,200
then go back into this different room. Yes. That just that subtle that it's this double decker

971
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:46,040
thing makes it more interesting. So, so yeah, this is just look, the ride I, I, I'm being on the ride

972
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:50,920
is some cool robots. The Ursula robot is awesome. That scene when that's my favorite, I think,

973
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:55,640
scene in the whole thing is when she's in front of she's singing poor unfortunate souls. Incredible

974
01:36:55,640 --> 01:37:00,040
the animatronic. It's huge. Like, you know, we've gotten stuck there and that's great. Like, oh,

975
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:05,720
please last longer. I wanted to stare at the robot more. Um, but I do think a lot of people

976
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:11,480
have a feeling after they get off of it, like, good, good. Like, and it doesn't, that's, that's

977
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:15,400
my feel. I wouldn't argue with you there, but I don't mind that feeling. I think some riots can

978
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:20,760
have that. Sure. I also think like Leland, I thought you brought up a great point about like

979
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:25,880
how you are feel the context you are in going into a ride can affect it. Cause I remember going on

980
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:31,960
this. Uh, I, when I first went on it, like it would have been a little while after a couple

981
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:38,040
months after it opened. So it maybe had a little weight, but not a huge weight. And it was like,

982
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:44,760
the context for me was like, Oh, this is a new ride. This is one part of the big like redo of

983
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:50,920
California adventure. And I was like, yeah, this was nice. This is a very pleasant ride. And also

984
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:58,360
like was greatly missing from this park. Like for years, this park had very few rides period, let

985
01:37:58,360 --> 01:38:03,240
alone these kinds of like classic Disney dark ride. So I was like, Oh yeah, this makes it. And

986
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:09,000
now it's technically was in the San Francisco section of the park. So that doesn't entirely

987
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:14,760
make sense, but yeah, that's a weird thing. Like where it's like this, it's, she's like the outcast

988
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:20,440
prince. Yeah. Everybody else is chilling in fantasy land. Like, and it's just like, you have

989
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:25,720
to get to Ariel, like all the way into another park. You were in the Bay area. She's, she's,

990
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:30,520
she's very privileged. She's, she can afford to live in the Bay area. So why wouldn't you?

991
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:38,600
That real estate. But yeah, so I guess in my sense, so I did not have like a huge weight for it. And,

992
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:43,080
and I was kind of like, Oh yeah, there's construction walls up everywhere. So I'm just

993
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:51,400
kind of happy to be on something, be on something in 2000, fall of 2011. I guess like the statement,

994
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:56,840
I was just happy to be on something. It doesn't sound like a ring endorsement, but it was also

995
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:02,120
like, Oh yeah, more of this to come. And then it was good. Good world of color. Uh, came right

996
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:09,240
around that time. Yeah. Um, but you know, I really like seeing that, um, animation of the, what the

997
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:16,520
ride was gonna be originally, because I've never really thought about the architecture of rides.

998
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:22,440
I've never really thought about it, you know, and, and, and I, I like thinking about now,

999
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:26,920
cause that does make me appreciate it's like, Oh yes, there's a lot of thought. And it's like,

1000
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:30,120
this ride is to make you feel like you're on a bubble. And this ride is to make you feel like

1001
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:34,920
you're flying in the air. And this one is to make you feel like you're trapped in a jungle, you know,

1002
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:43,160
like, um, or like on a, on a rickety car, like, uh, that's, uh, like through a temple and, and,

1003
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:50,840
and it's like, Oh yeah, there's a, there are people who, um, have spent a lot of time and teams,

1004
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:57,240
like in perfecting, you know, how to make it feel like you are running through a temple. And,

1005
01:39:57,240 --> 01:40:03,480
and that's so cool. Yeah. Never thought about them. Things are like impossible to achieve. So,

1006
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:07,960
you know, in the, like I've said before, like sometimes you're dealing with like military grade

1007
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:13,320
technology things that like, so like star tours or whatever, like the simulators had not really

1008
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:18,520
been in the public before. Like, so to be able to create some of these feelings, you have to

1009
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:24,680
deploy very crazy new technology and which is probably also very expensive. And I bet when

1010
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:30,280
they were analyzing, how do we get this little mermaid ride into that space? I bet it was like,

1011
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:36,680
we got to take out that movie theater quick. And so we can't do this double decker thing.

1012
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:41,800
And it was also probably, let's do a vehicle very similar to the haunted mansion so that it's not

1013
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:47,080
an new untested technology. Like what you're showing costs. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, cost has a

1014
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:51,160
lot to do with it, but then like, I do think politics, like politics and up like this guy,

1015
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:56,360
Tony Baxter is clearly like salty about the version of the little mermaid that's in the park

1016
01:40:56,360 --> 01:41:01,240
now. And he's, he's of course, we've talked about him many times, big thunder star tours,

1017
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:06,040
figment in Florida, uh, splash mountain. He did all these, like the main guy in church of all those,

1018
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:10,920
but he's like cranky. You can hear he's cranky about this version of the ride being in here

1019
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:14,760
because he knows there was a better version. And it probably like, when he walks by it, he goes,

1020
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:21,240
oh, like he's upset about it. It took them like over a decade just to get this made. So I'm sure

1021
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:28,520
it was also like handed off from designers and teams and stuff just in terms of politics, but

1022
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:34,840
like, yeah, I mean, cost is a factor too, cause however many, was it a couple billion to revitalize?

1023
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:42,120
Yeah. So like if one thing turns out more expensive, they have to take the money from

1024
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:49,000
something at that balance, the book somewhere else. I always wonder also if this, if the, uh,

1025
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:55,000
if, if, if it kind of backwards, if it was backwards dictated, like the Disneyland one, um,

1026
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:00,440
caused the Florida one to have to be a little less interesting. Like if, if they weren't jamming,

1027
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:05,560
cause it's, it's kind of copy pasted for the most part in terms of layout and everything. So,

1028
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:11,560
so in other words, is the Florida one, the exact same layout as the, as the whoopee Goldberg

1029
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:16,280
theater, like did they have to make it exactly the same? I watched, there's a video where you

1030
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:21,480
can watch both rides side by side, which is a disorienting experience, but they are pretty

1031
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:27,000
much identical. The lines felt identical. Yeah. The lines are clearly different and the loading

1032
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,920
areas a little different, but like, yeah, I mean, Florida benefits Florida is sitting though. The

1033
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:37,720
one in Florida is sitting on top of what used to be 20,000 leagues under the sea. That's where

1034
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:44,840
it's located in the Florida park, but I, by putting it in fantasy land, like, I mean, it's

1035
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:50,840
literally called fantasy land. So there's like a carousel next to the dwarves house next to a,

1036
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:57,400
the Winnie the Pooh ride next to, uh, the, the beauty and the beast be our guest castle restaurant

1037
01:42:57,400 --> 01:43:01,880
is what you're saying to the little mermaid. So yeah, it's just kind of like everything can be

1038
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:08,040
next to each other. All your toys are on the floor. Yeah. Kids love it. Yeah. That's the funnest time.

1039
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:11,560
You know, you had a good time with it. Yeah. You're aware you have to show us the, cause the one big

1040
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:19,000
difference. Oh yes. There's a big Ursula here. You do look at that. Yeah. Yeah. There's a massive

1041
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:24,760
Ursula and there's a slide next to the ride. You do get the Ursula death. Probably the biggest

1042
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:29,560
difference in this version. Is that, is that better? Do we like that? Yeah. Oh yeah. And then,

1043
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:34,200
I think six year old Scott doesn't like it. Six year old Scott is screaming and crying.

1044
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:39,480
I think 32 year old Scott also probably doesn't like the giant Ursula. Well, I talked about how

1045
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:47,480
I don't like big things in small rooms. Like I am afraid of the giant boo in a super Mario world.

1046
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:53,240
Right. Like, Oh, on the video, just on the straight video game. Giant, the, yes, I'm not even there.

1047
01:43:53,240 --> 01:44:00,360
When I see my avatar of Mario paired with a gigantic boo, I freak the fuck, it gives me this weird

1048
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:05,080
spatial relation. It scares the shit out of me. So this Ursula gives me some of that big boo feeling.

1049
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:10,840
What an interesting phobia. What do you think about in small rooms? I feel like weird body tension,

1050
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:17,320
even talking about big boo. It's the thing I'm the most afraid of. If big boo, like imagine

1051
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:23,000
we're in a pretty like, you know, like I guess it's kind of a small like living room here. And if

1052
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:30,680
boo was filling all of it, Jesus Christ. What if like Mike had like a giant like great America

1053
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:36,680
stuffed teddy bear or something? That's fine. I feel we're the size of the room. If it were all

1054
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:41,800
the way up to the ceiling. I guess I just think that was odd. I saw your eyes. You looked at the ceiling.

1055
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:47,960
Yeah. And you're like your pupils got smaller. You went big things. Maybe freak me out. Let me ask

1056
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:55,480
you this. How do you feel about the big Muppets? You mean like sweetums? Like sweetums or like,

1057
01:44:55,480 --> 01:45:01,240
I'm thinking of, do you know the Muppet Christmas Carol? Yeah. The ghost of Christmas present.

1058
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:07,960
He's like a large man. He's like, he's a large, jolly man, but he is like one of the big walk

1059
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:12,760
around Muppets. Or I feel like there's some of the lab or just sort of like the big kind of Muppets.

1060
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:22,120
Not if, if your size is big already, then it's fine. But if you are supposed to be small and

1061
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:29,320
then you become big. I know you're a small version. Now you're big. Is your worst movie like Alice in

1062
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:33,480
Wonderland? There is weird stuff with Alice in Wonderland. Yeah. Yeah. This for this drinking

1063
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:38,120
in the ground. Because that's exactly what that whole movie is. Yeah. I think it freaked me out

1064
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:45,400
when she like grows and is the size of the house. It's an upsetting thing to think about happening

1065
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:50,360
to you. I don't think that this bothers you, but I'm just curious. I just want to really explore

1066
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:57,240
this. I like the tests. Thanks for this therapy session. So like part of the Disney channel fan

1067
01:45:57,240 --> 01:46:05,800
fest is we took pictures with Mike and Sully and we were in an enclosed space, maybe like this

1068
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:15,000
living room-ish. And Mike is like four feet tall, which is really interesting. But Sully was like

1069
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:24,040
eight feet tall. Does that make you feel weird? Weirdly, no. But I bet my wife would feel weird

1070
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:30,040
about it because we all met Chewbacca together. And when Chewbacca rounded the corner in that

1071
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:35,320
tight little corridor, she like, ah, like, I think because he so filled the small. And he's so real.

1072
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:42,040
And he's a hugger. And he's a hugger. He is a hugger. He'll grab you. I think again, I don't know

1073
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:47,240
the size of Sully. He could be that, but here's what I was going to say back to the Muppets,

1074
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:51,320
is that when there's walk around Muppets, which there have been in the parks a little bit,

1075
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:57,560
when there's a man sized Kermit freaks me out a little. Yeah, because Kermit is supposed to be

1076
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:02,760
small. Yes. And Sully is supposed to be big. So it's like, okay. Or I just don't know. You can

1077
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:09,960
define for me for the first time how big Sully is supposed to be. I'm kind of weirded out by,

1078
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:16,200
maybe not scared of, but I think it's funny to go back to Mrs. Potts that in the Beauty and the Beast

1079
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:22,200
live shows that there is a Mrs. Potts that is much bigger than Belle. I'm not scared of that,

1080
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:28,440
but I think it's strange. Two questions. Scared of the baby in Honey, I Trunked the Kid,

1081
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:36,840
I Blew Up the Kids? No, no. I don't think I have any like weird childhood trauma from that. Amazingly.

1082
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:43,320
Yeah. Scared of animal at the end of Muppet movie, when animal grows giant. Oh. Because I actually

1083
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:47,400
think if I think about it, I was a little uncomfortable by how big he was. Maybe I've

1084
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:50,200
blocked that out. Maybe I avoided. You don't even remember it because there's a big showdown. Mommy,

1085
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:55,800
I don't want to watch that one. I just politely requested. You know what, actually, but maybe

1086
01:47:55,800 --> 01:48:01,640
that's an outdoor, this is the strangest specific issue we're dealing with. I think I'm, if I'm

1087
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:08,280
freaked out by any of Honey, I Blew Up the Kid, it's when the kid is in the living room as opposed

1088
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:17,000
to walking around the street. If I've got, if there's open air, I'm fine. Big Boo with open sky

1089
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:22,360
is okay, but if I'm in a room and it's just me as Mario and Big Boo, that's the scariest thing.

1090
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:28,600
If you're in Bowser's Castle, it's bad, but if you're in Mumu Farms, it's fine. Yes, because I know,

1091
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:33,880
you know, I could, I could fly away. He could fly away. I can get away from him easy. I'm not

1092
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:38,280
tripped. I'm going to go the other direction. Do you know Mulholland Drive, the David Lynch movie?

1093
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:42,440
I haven't seen it in decades. Okay. Do you remember there's an old couple in it that they're like

1094
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:46,680
riding a bus at one point? I don't remember this. Okay. So there's a sequence where there's like an

1095
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:51,880
old touristy couple and they get on a bus and they're really like creepily smiling and they

1096
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:56,520
don't say anything. And you're like, and it's kind of comes out in nowhere. And then you don't see

1097
01:48:56,520 --> 01:49:01,640
them again for a while. And then at some point, like one of the versions of Naomi Watts, cause

1098
01:49:01,640 --> 01:49:07,880
there's like two realities in that movie. She like lies down on the couch in her living room. And

1099
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:15,320
then it, it cuts, there's a shot of the door, the front door of the house. And it's like about

1100
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:21,960
an inch gap between like the door and the floor. And there's just teeny tiny versions of that old

1101
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:27,880
couple like running and are screaming. And then they get into the room and I think they like pop

1102
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:34,600
up to big size and like terrorize her. But I just remember watching that and these teeny tiny couple

1103
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:40,360
of like, Oh no, how did they get small? Yeah, that might do it for you know, uh, Edwin,

1104
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:47,720
just as I said that Edwin just very quietly walked into my field of vision. Edwin is very small and

1105
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:53,080
he has just returned from a walk, but if he came back from the walk and was the size of the room,

1106
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:58,760
this podcast would be over forever. If he was like coming back here, we got to do it outside.

1107
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:04,360
From now on, if he was Clifford size. Oh yeah. Oh, maybe I'm scared of Clifford. Yeah. He hates

1108
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:08,520
Clifford. I might hate Clifford. I think I actually prefer, wasn't there another Clifford where

1109
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:16,840
Clifford was small? I think I chose the normal size around on his knees. I mean, that's a terrifying,

1110
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:22,760
that's a Freudian terrifying movie. What if you're big like, like when you go into Toontown and

1111
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:28,920
there's like small, small things. No, I don't think I have issues there because I'm, I have the power.

1112
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:33,880
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. But you're the oppressor. I'm having one more and then we'll move off of

1113
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:39,320
this. We better move off of it. Uh, I think the, I think maybe I was somewhere as a kid and there

1114
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:45,720
was a, a walk around Kool-Aid man. It freaked me the fuck out. I don't want to keep adding to this.

1115
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:51,640
I was scared of giant balloons in front of car dealerships as a child. So if it was a giant

1116
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:57,160
ape, there was like a giant eight balloon. I didn't like it. And once my dad one time made me go up

1117
01:50:57,160 --> 01:51:03,560
and like touch one of them to like, to break my fear of it. I kind of, I think I was still kind

1118
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:07,000
of uncomfortable because there would be like, if we were driving down the expressway, um, there would

1119
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:10,920
be like, like maybe there's something promote, I don't know what it would be being promoted,

1120
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:14,920
but seven of them would be in a line. And I remember kind of just like looking to the left.

1121
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:19,080
So I guess I had that too. Now that I think about it. Well, I think I would have had the same issues

1122
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:24,600
with you, but only if it was indoors. Uh, that's where these, these particular deviations of these

1123
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:31,000
fears. Very bizarre. Anyway, to bring it back to the, I, so what I'm saying is, uh, uh, fuck this

1124
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:34,920
ride, uh, fuck Tony Baxter. I don't want this giant earth. So they'll get it out of here. The

1125
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:39,720
ride is perfect. I'm going to enjoy my wine and not see any giant things. It'll be the only ride

1126
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:45,160
you're out that day. So to sum up, you are saying keep as is Scott, cause Leland, so what we do at

1127
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:49,080
the end is we say like, what would you do to the right? Would you keep it perfectly as is,

1128
01:51:49,080 --> 01:51:53,160
would you plus it up? Do you have any ideas or would you burn it down, uh, in a mysterious fire

1129
01:51:53,160 --> 01:51:58,760
for insurance money? I'm mysterious. Uh, no, I keep as is. That's why I brought it up. Okay.

1130
01:51:58,760 --> 01:52:04,040
Jason. Well, you know, uh, a couple of years after the ride open, they did like, uh, uh,

1131
01:52:04,040 --> 01:52:10,840
some minor plus it ups. Like they, they changed the, the hair, like this is such a weird thing

1132
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:18,280
to talk about that the hair in the under the seat sequence, Ariel's hair, like they tried to mold

1133
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:25,000
the hair. So it looks like the one shot in that sequence when she's like swimming directly down.

1134
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:30,680
And so her hair is above her in the water. So they tried to recreate that in three in physical space.

1135
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:37,400
And a lot of people's complaints were that it like, this looks like she has a beehive, like a fifties

1136
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:44,280
I do. Yeah. It looks like an ice cream cone. It looks like, yeah. So I'll serve ice cream. So they

1137
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:49,720
changed that. And they also changed, like, there's some sequences with screens where like when she's

1138
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:58,440
transforming that were much more CGI 3d back in the day. And then they kind of changed it to be more

1139
01:52:58,440 --> 01:53:03,800
2d animated in the style of the movie, which I think works. So I think like, and then they added

1140
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:09,160
some more fish, I think throughout it. So like, I think just keep adding to, I like seeing little

1141
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:15,880
touches to rides, like little plus ups, more animatronics, more fish. I say fill that under

1142
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:23,640
the sea room with fish. Like I want there to be so many fish. Uh, not that they would form a giant

1143
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:29,160
Voltron Scott that you would be uncomfortable. Thanks for anticipating my worry. Uh, but like,

1144
01:53:29,160 --> 01:53:37,080
yeah, more, more, uh, dance. Oh, you brought me to the worst one of all the fish that swallows you.

1145
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:45,240
Oh God. The one that jumps out of the water, the big red fish. Uh, that was in Mario.

1146
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:53,720
Dear that is me. You were terrified of Mario. Just playing the game. Mario. It was terror.

1147
01:53:53,720 --> 01:54:01,320
I've never been a big gamer since level number one, there's size levels too. There's giant

1148
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:05,160
Goombas and all that. Uh, so I, when I was thinking about fish to add to that scene,

1149
01:54:05,160 --> 01:54:08,760
just not that one that swallows you whole reasonable size.

1150
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:14,120
Reasonable size. So, so a few more reasonable size fit just every now and then. I think that also

1151
01:54:14,120 --> 01:54:19,240
shows a attention to detail care when parks are like, Hey, we shut this down to clean it up,

1152
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:22,440
make sure everyone's working. We put a little couple of extra things in there. I like when

1153
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:26,360
parks do that. And also on April fool's day, I think they should put in Terrence and Philip

1154
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:32,840
animatronics, uh, to just wave at you when you go by. Uh, okay. That's all. Big thumbs up to that idea.

1155
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:37,480
Brick and mortar and not please. Yeah. Brick and mortar and not please.

1156
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:41,480
I gotta say, yeah, I plus it up. I mean, I think it would be real cool if they were do,

1157
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:45,800
would do something with the ride vehicles that did kind of give you like a little bit of an up

1158
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:50,520
and down motion. That's probably very expensive, but I would like them to do it. I would prefer

1159
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:55,480
it if they did it. Uh, cause I think that would go a long way sort of in making you feel like you

1160
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:59,960
were really, uh, under the seat. Uh, I also think they should take out the kiss the girl and put in

1161
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:07,800
a death scene for Ursula. I think that's more important. I think that there should be a full

1162
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:11,880
sized, I think that should be the bigger than the one we saw in that video of Ursula. I think she

1163
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:19,320
should be in the room. Her head should be maybe like 20 feet long. Do you want me to stay here or not?

1164
01:55:19,320 --> 01:55:24,360
Well, you're just driving me out of the room. You want that. You just want a scene of like,

1165
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:30,040
cause in the movie Prince Eric Prince, Prince Eric is like his shirts all ripped and he's like a

1166
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:35,880
heroic hunk and he steers the ship with the last bit of strength. So you want like something for

1167
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:42,680
the guys. You want some guy, you know what? Here's, I got an idea. You just gave me a very,

1168
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:49,560
very good idea. Okay. You add a, like a, an old broken mass to the front of each car. So, oh,

1169
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:55,000
Mike, no. Well, wait, let's see where he's going with this. Cause I can't see it.

1170
01:55:56,440 --> 01:55:59,640
So you see like you, like there's a room and obviously they have limited space. So it's just

1171
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:05,560
like Ursula's giant head, but then her body. So the way to defeat Ursula is to have each car

1172
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:10,600
drive their dirty wooden mast into her stomach. And then you go kind of through it and there's

1173
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:14,280
like kind of a lighting effect and like it goes black. So obviously you're not making contact.

1174
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:19,000
Oh, it's over the track. Yes. It's over the track. You go through it. It's kind of like a door.

1175
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:24,520
So we're all now, now it solves the problem of, of it's our adventure. We are helping. We're

1176
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:31,800
the hero. We're the hero. We're the heroic sea witch murderers. We're the shit. And we all can

1177
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:36,520
feel like Eric with our shirt ripped and we're like handsome now and we're finally doing it.

1178
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:41,000
So I think that would be a good, I mean, let me throw one more thing in for context,

1179
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:45,560
which is that what if there was a way to see what you would look like as a little shrunken,

1180
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:53,000
uh, zero voice creature so that you could see what hypothetically Ursula might do to you.

1181
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:57,880
And then that gives you blood lust. Like I want to tear her rib cage. That's good too. Yeah.

1182
01:56:57,880 --> 01:57:03,160
Yeah. You guys are ruining this. We're blue sky. This is just, these are ideas.

1183
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:09,000
Yeah. You think adding horrendous violence would not be a help? More creepy creatures, more death.

1184
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:15,560
Of your possible future. And the only other thing I'll say,

1185
01:57:17,800 --> 01:57:22,680
the only other thing I'll say is at the end of the wedding ceremony, just give me Mr.

1186
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:29,000
Limpett and a little white like tuxedo and a little top hat wishing him luck and he's

1187
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:32,760
having a good time. Cause he appeared earlier and I want to see where he's at by the end of the ride.

1188
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:37,160
I'm for that. Yeah. It's that one's at least I think we can all agree that's a nice cheap way

1189
01:57:37,160 --> 01:57:41,560
to plus the ride up and we'd love it. Have a nice laugh you two. Oh, Andy.

1190
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:46,760
One of us has to have a Don Nuts, right? Uh, yeah. I kinda, I don't, I don't know.

1191
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:51,080
We'll work on it for future. My Don Nuts are just like, whoa, Andy.

1192
01:57:51,080 --> 01:57:54,040
Yeah. It's reaking, it can be real close to Jimmy Stewart. Yeah. Whoa.

1193
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:56,120
Or Andy. Yeah. Oh well.

1194
01:57:56,120 --> 01:57:59,960
Do you have one? Oh, Andy.

1195
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:07,560
Wow. I think it was better than ours. Well, Leland Bowden, you've survived podcast the ride.

1196
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:09,000
Yeah. It was awesome.

1197
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:16,280
What do you want to plug? Plug away. Andy Mack is returning to the airwaves,

1198
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:23,240
June 4th, 8 PM Monday nights on Disney channel. Yeah.

1199
01:58:23,240 --> 01:58:25,560
And you're going, what's going to be more? You're doing more.

1200
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:32,120
Also, when does this come out? Cause if it comes out, like anytime before the next two weeks,

1201
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:36,920
I want to plug me being in LA to all my friends and I want to hang out.

1202
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:39,960
What's the cutoff? June 2nd guys.

1203
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:41,560
Oh, we probably won't be out by then. No.

1204
01:58:44,280 --> 01:58:47,000
I'm sorry. I missed you guys. So apologize to your friends now.

1205
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:52,840
Oh yeah. Guys. I really want to make it to your thing. I'm so sorry. I can't come visit me in Utah.

1206
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:56,600
Okay. That's nice. Twitter. Do you want a Twitter plug?

1207
01:58:56,600 --> 01:59:01,480
Your, your want song is wanting to see all your best buds while you're in LA.

1208
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:06,280
You want to be part of their world. When's it my turn? Um, at your friend Leland,

1209
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:15,000
Leland is spelled L I L A N. Don't make it Lillian. That's not my name. Whatever I can do.

1210
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,920
That is what people think. I think I thought that's what was your name for a month.

1211
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:22,120
Somebody's squad on that name. And then, uh, uh, you're, uh, then you're an alternate.

1212
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:30,360
I actually own Lillian Bowden.com. I use it to sell all sorts of, uh, multi-level marketing schemes,

1213
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:36,360
diet pills, that tea that people promote on Instagram. You sell fake rocks. I sell fake rocks.

1214
01:59:36,360 --> 01:59:42,680
Hey, anyway, I can help my friends. Thank you. And you are Instagram's my main squeeze though.

1215
01:59:42,680 --> 01:59:48,200
Oh yeah. Same, same handle at your friend Leland. Nice. Uh, and then obviously like

1216
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:54,440
send all your shipping requests, uh, to that Lillian and her Twitter and your hashtag ship

1217
01:59:54,440 --> 01:59:59,480
request. Who do you, so, so yeah, so for this episode, we're shipping Lillian and various Disney

1218
01:59:59,480 --> 02:00:05,160
characters and executives and we're of course, most importantly, shipping Jason and many

1219
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:11,160
and different treats and treats. And also if anyone wants to draw a picture of us recording,

1220
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:16,520
but I'm just real big and take up the room and Scott is like sweating and really nervous.

1221
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:23,160
Oh, if you want to draw that for like 10 days, it would be funny. Like just a picture of Scott

1222
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:30,920
and then like Clifford and the baby from honey. I blew up the kid surrounded by all of these things.

1223
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:37,000
Scott, this is how we calm you down. Like the mushroom omelet in a Phantom thread for all the

1224
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:42,840
thread heads out there. This is how we calm you down when you're a little too wound up and you,

1225
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:49,080
we, we sort of set you back to one and I've been too demanding in setting this podcast schedule.

1226
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:55,640
Scott is the Reynolds Woodcock of podcast, the ride. That's for sure. It's not to my liking.

1227
02:00:56,440 --> 02:01:03,240
Throw this episode out. All right. Well, we are you dare, but do dare go to our Twitter

1228
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:10,760
podcast, the ride and Instagram and podcast, the ride at gmail.com. If you want to email us.

1229
02:01:10,760 --> 02:01:15,880
Mm hmm. Yeah. And rate and review us on iTunes and do all that. Is it called iTunes? I keep Apple

1230
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:21,480
podcast. Okay. I podcast, whatever. Yeah. We need, we need those sweet reviews. Five stars only. Of

1231
02:01:21,480 --> 02:01:25,320
course. I just saw somebody give us a four star and said that we need to tighten the podcast up.

1232
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:33,080
Not going to happen. So go back and amend it. I think that's a great note. I think every podcast

1233
02:01:33,080 --> 02:01:40,920
could be tight. I believe it specifically, um, uh, they, they go on tangents a lot, which that is,

1234
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:45,960
uh, all podcasts. And I hope you like that. 10 minutes we did on giant things.

1235
02:01:47,320 --> 02:01:52,440
All right. Uh, that's it for us today. Uh, thank you. We're in the process of not keeping it tight

1236
02:01:52,440 --> 02:01:58,440
right now. We could just keep going just to punish that Mr. Four star four stars here. This is for

1237
02:01:58,440 --> 02:02:06,600
you. Here we go. Probably not listening. I think it was a woman or she are she. All right. Bye.

1238
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:08,000
Bye.
