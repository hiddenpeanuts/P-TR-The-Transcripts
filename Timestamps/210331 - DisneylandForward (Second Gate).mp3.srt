1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,280
Five, four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,940
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, The Second Gate, where today we will unveil PTR Forward, a new

3
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:31,320
proposal that puts forth an initiative that might shape the future of Podcast The Ride.

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,220
My name is Mike Carlson, joining me as always, Jason Sheridan.

5
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:42,480
Michael, I'm feeling very interactive, very immersive, and very mixed use today.

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,100
Great, that's exactly what we need to be feeling.

7
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,820
Scott Gairdner here also.

8
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,880
That's right, and I couldn't be more excited about zoning changes.

9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,340
We're going to rezone the hell out of this podcast, out of this second gate.

10
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,420
It's going to be, as Jason said, we're going to really mix up the uses over here.

11
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,740
What I want to propose for the podcast is I want the audience to sign off on approval that

12
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,240
Scott and I can talk about classic rock and roll more.

13
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,880
I want them to approve us doing that.

14
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:20,080
I want to be able to comfortably talk 50% of an episode at a certain point about

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:27,460
just maybe the guitar riff in Let Me Roll It from Wings, from the Wings album,

16
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,240
Band on the Run.

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,220
I want to talk about that.

18
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,600
It's a great riff.

19
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,120
I want to talk about it at length.

20
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,700
Yeah, I've never gotten to really air my full thoughts on how Kevin Cronin from

21
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,500
REO Speedwagon is a little weirdo.

22
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,920
I think it's going to take at least an hour and a half for me to get that all out.

23
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,640
Yeah, so that's just one of the things I'd like the audience to sign off on.

24
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,580
Jason, do you have anything you'd like the audience to approve as far as what you

25
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,160
want to talk about on the show going forward?

26
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,880
Oh, that's a great question, Michael.

27
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,920
You know, if you guys go all in on the classic rock stuff, I can snooze a little

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,060
and then chime in with the one thing where it's like, I have that album, I have that album.

29
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:09,820
Let me.

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,880
I like the single.

31
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,600
And then we move on.

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,240
I want to make it so that you can nap while doing content that people pay for.

33
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,660
Like a fugue state where I'm not like totally out of it, where like I can jump

34
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,260
into action if needed.

35
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,440
But will the listener approve Jason doing a lot less work and putting a lot less

36
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,420
effort into the podcast?

37
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,440
That's what he wants.

38
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,320
Will you approve it?

39
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,080
Will you sign off?

40
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,680
The Board of Listeners, the official Board of Listeners will sign off on all of this

41
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,300
eventually.

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,080
My good boy, good student anxiety would never let me get away with it.

43
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,600
All right.

44
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:48,980
Fine.

45
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,460
Well, then you have to think of your proposals that we put forth to the listener board.

46
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,640
OK.

47
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,340
And it doesn't have to be now.

48
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,460
Because we owe it.

49
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,200
No, we owe it in three years.

50
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,720
So we have three years to come up with the proposal.

51
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,300
Yeah, we owe the proposal in three years and we won't enact whatever changes we're

52
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,460
talking about for probably another five to ten years.

53
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,680
That's when the changes will take place.

54
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,000
They may never happen.

55
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,720
They might never end up happening.

56
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,440
Right.

57
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,260
We're talking today about things that might never happen.

58
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:16,740
Yes.

59
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,340
But there were photos released of what if they did.

60
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,240
So what we're going to do is talk about concept art and a map about a bunch of things that

61
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,220
Disneyland might do, but they might not.

62
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:35,580
So it's very relevant in terms of it all happened this week, but potentially the most

63
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,880
irrelevant episode if none of it happens.

64
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,460
Yes.

65
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,940
And we've talked about things that didn't happen before.

66
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,060
We certainly talked about the proposal for this giant, ugly hotel that they were going

67
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,300
to build where the Rainforest Cafe and the ESPN Zone sit right now in downtown Disney.

68
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,660
That is not happening.

69
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,400
No, but it is relevant to today's episode.

70
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,440
It absolutely is.

71
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,360
I'm just saying there are definitely pockets of irrelevancy.

72
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,500
We thought for a while talking about Epic Universe would be irrelevant, but now it

73
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,720
looks like that's going to proceed and they're going to restart construction.

74
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,940
Yeah, but Disneyland Forward, you know, no details, no specifics, just vibes.

75
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,300
They're vibing down in Anaheim.

76
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
They've got a handout.

77
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:21,340
We got a bunch of, they released a bunch of graphics and like one sheets.

78
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:27,840
And then there's a website that turns those handouts into like six web pages that just

79
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,400
kind of flow into each other.

80
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,100
Yeah.

81
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,820
So if you don't know what we're talking about, we're basically, Disney a couple days

82
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:40,620
ago, put forth a proposal called Disneyland Forward, which is just as Jason is saying,

83
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,640
all of these pictures and info and pamphlet information, basically asking the Anaheim

84
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:53,920
government to allow them to rezone like existing land that Disney owns.

85
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,580
So basically saying, hey, we want to be able to in the future have the ability to make

86
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,740
new rides in places that are now a parking lot, make new shopping malls in places that are a

87
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,120
parking lot and basically do whatever we want with the land we have in Anaheim.

88
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,580
We want you to sort of blanket sign off on that.

89
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,400
And to entice you, we're going to show you all

90
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,820
sorts of fancy little pictures that aren't so specific to what we might build.

91
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,300
But you can see how cool it would be if, oh, if there were four new giant lands kind of

92
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,580
hanging around the Paradise Pier at Disneyland Hotel.

93
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,520
Yeah, correct.

94
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,380
The how this came to me when I heard about all this.

95
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,300
OK, so a couple of days, the day that this all dropped, just various things work and baby

96
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,080
a lot was going on and they really knocked me on my ass.

97
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,880
And I was trying to nap and I settled down for a nap and then got a text from you guys that when the

98
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,580
info was different, this was not about zoning at the time.

99
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,600
When this all came out, there was a headline that essentially said Disneyland announces

100
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,920
Third Gate.

101
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,880
And I'm like, what?

102
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,900
I was I was mad a little bit.

103
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:11,520
I wanted I needed this nap so much that I'm like, I can't get this news, this earth shattering news

104
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,100
for me and the pie.

105
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,360
I'm like furious that there is a possibility of a third gate, not now a third gate.

106
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,860
Yeah.

107
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,740
And then as days of even as that specific day went on, it became clear.

108
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,780
No, no, no, this is not certainly not that there is not a third gate and there may not be.

109
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,240
What we might actually be talking about is expansions of Disneyland and California Adventure.

110
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,080
And mainly, yes, it is all about zoning.

111
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,540
We want to be able to not say this big chunk of land is all hotel.

112
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:45,780
We want to be able to like mix in a bunch of theme park, every possible square foot next to the hotels.

113
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,180
Everything that's a parking lot at Disneyland currently would become a theme park.

114
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,020
Yeah.

115
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,820
Well, I from my angle, what I saw, I saw Carly post the O.

116
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,020
C.

117
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,880
Register article.

118
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,880
I read the article.

119
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,480
I made a joke about it.

120
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,020
And then after that, I walked away from my computer.

121
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:07,100
I came back to a text from Mike who sent a different websites write up about it.

122
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,740
And he went, is this a joke?

123
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,680
And I went, I don't think so.

124
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,700
The newspapers have it.

125
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,200
So I was sent that article by friend of the show, Matt Cardona.

126
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,340
Yes.

127
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,700
And he and I said, oh, my God.

128
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:27,160
And I was like, I was just as frantic as you would imagine anyone who does a podcast about this would feel.

129
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,080
And I think I sent it to you.

130
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,980
I sent it to maybe one other person.

131
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,920
I probably yelled at Lindsay from the other room, like, get in here now.

132
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:44,540
And then I clicked on the article again and they had changed the headline almost immediately to something much more vague, something much less like exciting sounding.

133
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,780
Because I think they realized, OK, maybe not a third gate.

134
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,520
It looks like it's expansion.

135
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,240
Now, there's still people saying they're not official.

136
00:07:54,260 --> 00:08:01,020
Since there's nothing concrete here, nothing says you couldn't just build a third gate that way.

137
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,960
It's kind of odd, but it's not impossible that that could be its own thing as well.

138
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:13,620
Well, I think the whole thing's kind of I mean, one thing that rubbed me in an odd way is that, yeah, these these expansions,

139
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:24,400
which seem to involve like bridge or pathway, like essentially they're building bottlenecks to transport you to these new expanded lands,

140
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:33,020
which appear to connect to Disneyland and connect to California Adventure and surround the Paradise Beer Hotel and the Disneyland Hotel.

141
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:42,820
So part of what would have to make that to get this to happen, they would have to surround three hundred and four hundred dollar a night hotel rooms

142
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,840
with construct multi-year long, incredibly loud construction projects.

143
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,380
Yes, that is 100 percent correct.

144
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,440
What you're saying, which doesn't sound ideal.

145
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,860
It's not.

146
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,640
But they've done it before.

147
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:07,100
I mean, if they tore the whole pool area apart, even like, yeah, do some of the new parking situations, it's definitely happened.

148
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:16,240
And the other thing is people will keep paying for the hotels and not change their habits at all and they will not lose any business whatsoever.

149
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,040
That's true.

150
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,220
If you've stayed at the Disneyland Hotel and the Grand California,

151
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:32,060
you really get a glimpse of what how far soundproofing has come between a hotel built a long time ago and a hotel built in 1999, 2000.

152
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,740
Oh, yeah.

153
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,460
Would that a like monorail runs through all the time?

154
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:37,840
Yeah.

155
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,820
You don't hear it at all.

156
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,320
Yeah, you don't really notice it.

157
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,960
But like, oh, the Disneyland Hotel, every room kind of connects to each other.

158
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:51,920
If you use those dividers with the two doors, you can kind of hear everyone getting ready in the morning.

159
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,060
Very good.

160
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:53,520
Interesting.

161
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,080
That's a real part of the theme park experience, though, in general.

162
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:09,700
And anytime I've been to Disney World, I felt it in Tokyo that you're like, a good night's rest is probably not in the game because you will hear families scurrying down the hallway at six in the morning.

163
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,360
Yes.

164
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,060
That's just that's that's part of doing it, I suppose.

165
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:13,900
That's true.

166
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,980
I mean, if you really take advantage of everything, you're kind of exhausted at the end of the day.

167
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,260
So you sleep like the dead.

168
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,680
But yeah, you'll hear everyone making it to the elevator.

169
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,160
Yeah.

170
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,220
When I saw this, I saw the proposal, we'll talk we'll get into this as far as at least what they're showing on these pamphlets.

171
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,100
I do think this is probably their ultimate idea.

172
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,180
I don't think it's obviously finalized, but I do think this is kind of the gist of what they're thinking maybe in the next decade.

173
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,200
But I wanted to say, remember back to when we interviewed Mr.

174
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:57,660
Tony Baxter and he said, you know, I was just in a meeting and at Disney and I don't think people know how much land there actually is to be developed still for Disneyland.

175
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:08,040
And I have to wonder if this is the land they were showing, they showing in this presentation, or if there's other secret land, we're not even thinking when we look at the map.

176
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,520
I thought this exactly like, is this what Tony was alluding to?

177
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,000
You never think about this.

178
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,460
Oh, yeah.

179
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,840
All those parking lots could be you just never think because it's across the street.

180
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,140
You have to walk across the street and you don't think about that.

181
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:28,180
They're out there become weird bridges that take you over Disneyland Drive to more Disneyland.

182
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,180
You think Disneyland is all contained in the train tracks, but Star Wars already proved that doesn't have to be true.

183
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,060
California Adventure has a shape that makes no sense anyway.

184
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,960
And you know what all this would be if now Disneyland has weird like little island parts of the parks.

185
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:55,580
Disneyland now would be Universal Hollywood with the Starway, like the bizarre layout where you have to go down a bunch of escalators to get to less than half of the park.

186
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,980
That's kind of what this would be, but better.

187
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,250
Probably those bridges are going to be fine and well landscaped.

188
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:13,690
And if you look at the art, so yeah, basically the way it is on the art is that there are two like islands essentially, and one is in the now downtown Disney parking.

189
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:19,530
Like one of the Disneyland expansion would be in the downtown Disney parking right now, which is not a parking garage.

190
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,790
It's just a flat lot.

191
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:26,350
And then the Paradise Pier parking would be the California Adventure expansion.

192
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:26,850
And they're both.

193
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:31,950
Yeah, they would have to be accessed if you're in the main park from some sort of bridge because there's a road there.

194
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:37,350
But in the art, they're also showing a second Esplanade.

195
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:38,610
Yes.

196
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:39,030
Yes.

197
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,250
Notice this on the Toy Story lot.

198
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,010
Is that what you're saying?

199
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,370
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

200
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,070
Yeah.

201
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:45,390
Okay.

202
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,690
Between I see what you're saying, but the Toy Story lot does come into play.

203
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,250
It does.

204
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,730
But that's a whole another thing.

205
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,190
Yeah.

206
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:58,730
So yeah, there would be a second Esplanade, which is the entrance, entrance area by Disneyland, California Adventure.

207
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,190
There would be a second one in front of the Disneyland Hotel.

208
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:05,930
So right now where ESPN Zone, that would be another separate entrance.

209
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:13,750
So you could enter the new areas and then go over the bridge into the sort of main part of both parks after you've seen the new stuff.

210
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,350
Yeah.

211
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:22,710
It would be just like the one that exists currently where you go one way and it's Disneyland, you go one way and it's California Adventure.

212
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,730
The exact set like a mini Esplanade.

213
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:36,430
And that I think is why it can't be a third gate because if all of that land in front of the hotel was pure theme park, then Disneyland Hotel is boxed in.

214
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:36,890
Right?

215
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,030
How do you get to it?

216
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:48,110
But with this, with this entrance plaza, now you step out from your room and are just immediately in one of two theme parks and Downtown Disney remains as is.

217
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,990
Thank God.

218
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,470
That's the big headline that nothing will change about Downtown Disney.

219
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,410
Hopefully, especially not the fonts.

220
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,090
Everything will remain intact.

221
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:06,830
And well, I mean, the stuff that's already been closed will probably go, will keep, obviously that's going to stay closed because that's where the Esplanade will probably be.

222
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,150
I mean, like that second Starbucks might be going away.

223
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:14,810
I'm sure they're demolishing the movie theater and Sugar Boo is probably not going to this world.

224
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,490
No, cancel it.

225
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,030
I'm not a supporter of Disneyland Forward.

226
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,810
I want my inspirational tarps.

227
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,470
I apologize for bringing that in.

228
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,450
And the soap, that secret soap store, I think has to go probably.

229
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,370
Yeah, might have to stock up.

230
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,670
I like that soap store.

231
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:41,070
Listeners, if you want to follow like what we probably will talk about the most, what we can devise from these diagrams and the concept art, go to DisneylandForward.

232
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:41,670
com.

233
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,110
Click the tab, the drop down tab called possibilities.

234
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:54,530
And that is the big ticket on this website because there's timelines of how Disneyland got here.

235
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,230
There's limitations of what they have now.

236
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,850
There's a pen, essentially like, look at all this cool stuff we're building in the rest of the world.

237
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:06,130
But the possibilities tab is where like the meat of it is.

238
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:13,390
And then there's a leading together tab and that has all the buzzwords that a forward thinking city council wants to hear.

239
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:21,890
Union contractors, diversity hiring, environmentally conscious construction, like good paying jobs.

240
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,630
That's all on its own tab.

241
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,790
Like that's for the residents and for the city council.

242
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,130
But possibilities is where the stuff is.

243
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,970
Why did they list all that stuff and then leave in where they said blah, blah, blah, you get the picture?

244
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:35,690
Yeah.

245
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,070
It's almost like they didn't care about putting that stuff in.

246
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,010
Yeah, they did not.

247
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,090
They did not say good paying jobs.

248
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,510
If Bernie Sanders is 90 and comes and yells at us again.

249
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:51,130
I would like him to come down and supervise some of the construction.

250
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:51,650
Yeah.

251
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:52,710
When he's 90.

252
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,890
It'd be nice to see him on a ride.

253
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,710
Be nice to get a photo of him on Splash Mountain or something.

254
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,530
Or recreate the Billy Corgan Big Thunder.

255
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:02,590
Oh, yeah.

256
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,570
I smell Bernie's next meme.

257
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,030
That's right.

258
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,230
That's where I was going with that.

259
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,590
He's wearing the same jacket and the gloves on Big Thunder Mountain.

260
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,510
He did it again.

261
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,450
In the middle of summer.

262
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,330
So I guess let's keep talking about this area.

263
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,530
Well, let's pull up the art maybe.

264
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,550
Mike, you decide.

265
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,550
You take us where you want us to go.

266
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:22,950
Well, yeah.

267
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,450
Let's bring up the art since we're talking about this here anyway.

268
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,230
Yeah.

269
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:27,610
Hold on.

270
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:31,210
But I think that the map is also fascinating.

271
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:36,790
While the more fleshed out concept art is cool, the map unlocks many keys as well.

272
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,850
Well, the map is different.

273
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:49,810
This is the piece of nice looking pro-mart that's showing you the majority of changes will be, obviously, at this side, we were saying, by the hotels, by these two hotels.

274
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,850
And Jason, this is what I was saying.

275
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,030
The esplanade would be right here.

276
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,470
Right.

277
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:55,870
Okay.

278
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:56,230
Yeah.

279
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:56,510
I see.

280
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,570
Where the monorail currently lands.

281
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,630
That's not changing.

282
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,850
We're not changing the station.

283
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:06,390
So now the monorail delivers you right to the door of the other place where you enter parks.

284
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,670
And Mike, I actually have that.

285
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,530
I have that same image and I doodled on top of it, which I what I think is happening.

286
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,510
Well, then that's going to have to be the version.

287
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:16,150
Well, sure.

288
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,190
You tell us straight.

289
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,790
Like a sports cast.

290
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:19,770
Yeah.

291
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:20,930
I.

292
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:21,350
Okay.

293
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,430
Let me see if this works.

294
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,010
Okay.

295
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,230
So here is the circle.

296
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,630
Stars, circles.

297
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:37,050
I figured out how to draw in screen grab so that it was a straight line and not a horrifying murder line.

298
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:46,970
So this one at the left, this circle, this is the entry from California Adventure into this new area.

299
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:52,010
This oval is the entry from Disneyland Park into this area.

300
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:57,850
And the two stars are the Paradise Pier Hotel and the Disneyland Hotel.

301
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:04,150
This building right here is actually, I believe, the parking garage for the Paradise Pier Hotel.

302
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:13,810
What they're going to claim for this, what land they're going to take back is the symbol lot, the downtown Disney lot and the cast member parking lot over here.

303
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,190
Right.

304
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,490
Because the Disneyland Hotel still has its parking garage right here.

305
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:18,890
Right.

306
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,510
Yeah.

307
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,830
Kind of behind it.

308
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,210
Yeah.

309
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:23,750
Yeah.

310
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,210
Right.

311
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,030
And then also the pedestrian.

312
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:34,250
I was trying to figure out where's the pedestrian bridge from the Pixar Pals parking garage as well.

313
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,570
Is that in the art?

314
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:43,850
Well, I so I also grabbed the Google Maps satellite view and drew what I think is the pathways.

315
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:51,330
So here's the website diagram with the pathway and the land does follow the shape.

316
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:57,110
So it's a fun game of what's expendable in California Adventure.

317
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,010
And the answer is probably Paradise Gardens Park.

318
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,730
I think so.

319
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:12,330
But isn't there an opening by the OK, like probably where this new entrance would be is just between the end of and credit coaster.

320
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,530
And maybe there's a way to only kill half of Paradise Gardens Park or none.

321
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:17,990
Yeah.

322
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,870
But it is between there either way.

323
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:26,170
It's definitely that it's just like if anything goes because they have to create so much space for people to walk through.

324
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,930
Yeah, it's going to have to be an elevated thing to connect.

325
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:33,310
They just put a big staircase up and not get rid of a lot of the park.

326
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,350
I mean, it's going to go over.

327
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,170
Do much.

328
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:40,470
I don't think and I, you know, I'll say this.

329
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,770
I'm not going to be sad.

330
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,910
I mean, I go get water there sometimes.

331
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,570
But besides that, that can go.

332
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,430
That's OK.

333
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:48,490
Mm hmm.

334
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,210
It's better than losing a ride.

335
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,430
Well, yeah, no, I agree.

336
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,610
So, yeah, that's the entrance there.

337
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,570
I assume unless they're going to go like underground or something, which would be cool.

338
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:06,070
But I assume it'll just be like, you know, what you're walking over the street, much like the the walkway they built over on Lankersham

339
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:11,710
for to get you from the one side of the street by the train or the subway to Universal Studios.

340
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,850
There's like an elevated platform you walk across or like Vegas.

341
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:23,010
It's it'll be like hopefully like where there's escalators and elevators unless they find a way to do they can't like,

342
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,350
no, I guess the street is street level.

343
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,350
They can't do it like downtown Disney where it goes under the bridge.

344
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:30,690
Right.

345
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,970
Yeah, I think they would need to keep Disneyland Drive and build above it.

346
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:41,670
Because the the Magic Kingdom expansion, which we're looking at here,

347
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:47,630
it also appears to go above Disneyland Drive just south of Magic Way.

348
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,150
So here you can look at the Disneyland expansion.

349
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:56,870
Clearly, the Stitch parking lot does not appear to be long for this world.

350
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:01,830
And the closest part of the Magic, not the Magic Kingdom.

351
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,870
I mean, I guess the Magic Kingdom of Disneyland Park.

352
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,650
It's called Disneyland Disneyland.

353
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,810
That's the name.

354
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:13,110
But if you go straight ahead from if you were to run across that parking lot

355
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:17,610
and run straight forward into Disneyland, you hit critter country.

356
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:22,330
And I think you can lose a lot of that for a walkway.

357
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:29,850
You think maybe what you're saying is you think that where you get across the street will get rid of not the Winnie the Pooh ride,

358
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,390
but all of the stores and everything near it.

359
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:41,310
Like you would leave where currently there is a Winnie the Pooh store would now be a pathway that gets you over across the street to more Disneyland.

360
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,050
I think that's definitely likely.

361
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,190
And I think you could also lose that Pooh ride.

362
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:51,110
Like I think anything that's not like Splash Mountain is not going to go.

363
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,290
They talked about how they're going to get rid of Pooh.

364
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,390
They don't have to get rid of Pooh.

365
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,230
I will say this.

366
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,750
I go in the Pooh gift shop way more than I go on the Pooh ride.

367
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,910
I like that gift shop.

368
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,750
You're sad to lose the gift shop.

369
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,150
I am sad to lose that gift shop, but I think you're right.

370
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,090
I think that's going to have to be the spot where it starts there.

371
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,270
Wait a minute, though.

372
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,910
I'm going to bring this map back up because I had a different idea.

373
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:18,390
Like what I saw and maybe this doesn't line up with what you're saying, Jason.

374
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,050
But like to me, I look at to me, this seems like lower.

375
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:27,350
It seems like in kind of the lower third of Disneyland,

376
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:37,930
I think it's possible that actually where you exit, where you'll go to the new area is maybe between the Haunted Mansion and Pirates.

377
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,810
That like maybe some maybe the train station comes out.

378
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:48,850
I might again, I might be reading this wrong, but it seems like potentially a viable place to do it.

379
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:53,810
I don't know how you get over under the train tracks, but right.

380
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,470
Interesting.

381
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,710
I think when I was the Google Maps, I can bring up the Google Maps.

382
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,630
Bring Google Maps.

383
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,350
Let's solve this once and for all.

384
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,510
Scott, I know what you're saying on the Google Maps.

385
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,270
The Haunted Mansion ride show building is just so big.

386
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:10,330
Like I think to me, it seemed like I don't know.

387
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,290
I was just kind of eyeballing those charts.

388
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:15,170
So no, you might you might be right.

389
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,650
It's hard to say.

390
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,130
Yeah.

391
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,010
And listener, I don't know.

392
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,790
Look, pull up your own.

393
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,190
Right.

394
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,590
We're consulting them.

395
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:23,730
We'll put the we'll tweet it.

396
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:28,230
There'll be a map and there'll be concept art and you'll you'll get through it.

397
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,550
Yeah.

398
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,190
Or you'll put on another episode.

399
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:30,550
Yeah.

400
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,770
You might just put on another episode while we struggle through this.

401
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,930
So you're Scott, you're thinking like here.

402
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,050
Maybe.

403
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:38,410
Maybe.

404
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:42,850
Like like here's zoom in further if you can.

405
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:50,590
Like, OK, so and go a little bit lower right at the the the very corner of the park.

406
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,270
There's two big show buildings.

407
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,990
The one you're currently pointing to is Pirates and up there is Haunted Mansion.

408
00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:00,470
I think between those two, maybe there's enough space to build this little bridge.

409
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:04,430
But although that goes right next to the monorail track, which they're not going to move.

410
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,530
So maybe it would have to be a little country exit.

411
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:11,470
It would have to be kind of like maybe move like this unless they get rid of this build.

412
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,590
Like it would have to go like this way.

413
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:14,530
A little curve.

414
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:15,690
But that might be.

415
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:21,250
Don't you feel like all of this like this is not good for employees, I feel like.

416
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:21,670
No.

417
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,010
Park really far away.

418
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,270
So much every bit of backstage space is gone.

419
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,730
This is going to make it really complicated to work there.

420
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:29,250
Yeah.

421
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,670
That keeps happening.

422
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,270
They they demolished a building.

423
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:37,630
They're building Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway and they had to demolish a building that was being used for cast member stuff.

424
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:41,790
And like they have to like, I think they have to move the horses in.

425
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:47,450
Correct me if I'm wrong, but like horses used to be able to be like stored right behind like where Galaxy's Edge is.

426
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,190
But I believe that's not the case anymore.

427
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:52,090
I think they have to like bring the horses from a farther away distance.

428
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,290
So that's that's going to keep happening.

429
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:59,610
They are talking about doing the parking garage.

430
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:05,930
OK, so a couple of projects ago that didn't happen, they were going to do a parking garage on the other side of Harbor.

431
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:16,450
And Anaheim was very upset with them because the bridge that would have connected that parking garage to Disneyland would block off access to local businesses.

432
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,270
And they didn't like that.

433
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,910
And Disney, instead of just saying, yeah, all right, here you can go to local businesses.

434
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,110
They said, no, fuck off.

435
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:27,990
And they've learned they've learned from that because that's on the website, too.

436
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,130
Yes, that is mentioned.

437
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,330
The concept art is reused.

438
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:42,590
It's mentioned and it goes out of its way to mention working with local businesses and politicians to like the area, the Harvard area hotels and businesses.

439
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:46,750
They go out of their way to mention if we'll try again.

440
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:59,150
Well, it feels like the whole thing is kind of like like sort of kissing Anaheim's ass and kissing the local businesses as because this is all couched kind of in.

441
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,910
Look, it's been a tough year for everybody.

442
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,290
We had to shut down COVID-19.

443
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,170
We have to think about how to go forward, move forward Disneyland forward.

444
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:11,870
And the way is for you to let us put up whatever we want.

445
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:15,530
And that's going to save your city and all the restaurants or whatever.

446
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,270
Yeah.

447
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,890
Which I don't know, they might have something.

448
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:24,070
Although I do think just reopening regular Disneyland will go a long way.

449
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,770
That said, look, I don't know how you guys, but I want every bit of this to happen.

450
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,570
I am thrilled.

451
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:33,810
I want every single square foot that they're proposing to happen.

452
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:40,470
Well, I was trying to look I I was trying to figure out like sneakiness.

453
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:43,190
What's the sneakiness here for Disney?

454
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,210
Because there's always got to be something right.

455
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:51,010
So I can't really see anything because I think they still have to get a proposal.

456
00:26:51,010 --> 00:27:02,910
Like I think I saw some chatter of like, oh, you know, Anaheim could approve Disney to zone anything because they basically they want to be able to build, as I said, a hotel, a restaurant or ride anywhere on the land they have.

457
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,350
They want to blanket freedom to do it.

458
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:19,930
But I think they also need further approvals then once that happens, because I saw some people saying, well, they get the approval and then Disney just builds a bunch of hotels and restaurants and never builds another like cool new ride on this land, which I guess is possible.

459
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:24,430
But don't they then have to get more approvals once they've sort of just gotten this blanket approval?

460
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:33,210
I could be wrong unless that unless in twenty twenty three, their proposal is going to have all the rides, all the restaurants, and it's going to be a fully comprehensive.

461
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,070
And maybe that's what they're talking about doing.

462
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,270
Yeah, I mean, it's very funny.

463
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:44,270
There is a big, bold section of the website that says and Disneyland is not looking for any more tax breaks.

464
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:54,050
We're not looking for any more public funding like they go out of the way to go like this is not this is a play, but this isn't the play you're assuming it is.

465
00:27:54,890 --> 00:28:00,270
Yeah, I I'm cautiously optimistic that this is just neutral.

466
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:09,830
I mean, it's good for us if there's no more rides, obviously, but I don't want it to like, you know, hamper the city or whatever anymore than Disney.

467
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:15,530
I mean, Disney helps, but also, you know, sucks resources and they'll have tax deals in places.

468
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:20,790
But I I want to think this is maybe just sort of a neutral neutral to slightly good thing for it.

469
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:25,130
But somebody feel free to correct me if they've noticed some weirdness.

470
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,130
Nobody immediately had the argument of why this is bad.

471
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,790
I feel like somebody would have thought of it real fast.

472
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,790
I think what if it's just good?

473
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:34,810
Maybe it's just good.

474
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:41,630
Here, Mike, pull that concept back up because let's talk about it like creatively and almost.

475
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,310
We're actually really the map maybe shows you more.

476
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,730
But like what can we glean from this?

477
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:47,710
What do we know?

478
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:54,650
I think they like they left a lot of Easter eggs in this map and people noticed the Easter eggs on Twitter.

479
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:58,050
Again, this they're just showing hypothetical.

480
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,130
Here's rides we could do.

481
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,330
But some of them are so specific.

482
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:06,010
Some of them are things that exist already in other parks.

483
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:14,290
And it really gets you thinking and wondering and excited about really cool stuff that might be thrown next to that hotel over there.

484
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:23,770
First, let me say if just looking at this overhead art, California Adventure gets three lands of some kind, maybe more.

485
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,330
And Disneyland gets one.

486
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,190
Yeah, yeah.

487
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:32,030
So just the way it breaks down is that the Esplanade is right here.

488
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,710
So this is a land for California Adventure.

489
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,730
These are all California Adventure.

490
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,910
And then there's one big one for Disneyland.

491
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:44,730
So I just want to say that it seems like California Adventure might benefit more if all of this goes forward.

492
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:45,750
Very lucky.

493
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:46,350
That's true.

494
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:46,830
Yeah.

495
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:54,930
Well, look, it's smaller to begin with, but this would at least catch it up in terms of acreage or make it go over.

496
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:59,350
This thing we keep harping on that California Adventure is like the second best park in the world.

497
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,770
I think this does this bump it up to one.

498
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,970
I don't know if we beat Disney Sea with it, but I don't know.

499
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:15,510
But speaking of Disney Sea, they're talking about, as you were saying, types of lands they're building over there, over in Tokyo Disneyland.

500
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:16,470
Yeah.

501
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:23,630
And I think seemingly what that might be is less likely to be the Tokyo specific IP.

502
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:33,350
I don't think we're suddenly getting 20 years later or more a journey to the center of the Earth or the volcano or the aqua topia.

503
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,750
I don't think that's going to be it.

504
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:44,350
I feel like that Disneyland stuff up there on the right of this photo, I think it might be the new stuff going into Disney Sea, which is very IP.

505
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,710
It's frozen, it's tangled, and it's Peter Pan.

506
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:50,530
Peter Pan.

507
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,630
Peter Pan.

508
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:55,910
So again, I have my questions about Disneyland forward.

509
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,470
I don't know if I want to go Disneyland forward.

510
00:30:59,710 --> 00:30:59,730
Yeah.

511
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:04,470
And they mentioned, somebody mentioned this, when they were doing the presentation.

512
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,810
Is it in the pamphlet or was somebody just like a PR person talking about those?

513
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:10,770
Because they mentioned those are things that likely could go.

514
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:14,330
Things like this could appear in this expansion, they were saying.

515
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:21,030
Well, that's and it I think it's like, here's what we're doing already in the park.

516
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,870
And here's what we're doing at our parks around the world.

517
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,850
And it kind of that kind of goes back to someone posted.

518
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:38,930
I sent you guys someone preserved like a similar, a very similar website to this from like 99 2000 2001 of like, and here's what could come after California Adventure.

519
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:46,810
And they're showing what they have built recently and they're showing what is now the Toy Story lot.

520
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:55,490
They literally lay lit a third Disney park and then they label a chunk neck on the east side of Disneyland future parking.

521
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,770
So they were doing same shit, same shit.

522
00:31:59,070 --> 00:31:59,630
Yeah.

523
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:08,030
So I think a lot of that might have been like because I remember always hearing the rumor of a coaster based villains park.

524
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,690
But I don't know if any they didn't say anything.

525
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:18,050
They didn't know this website is one page like you can you can read it in three minutes and all you could do back then.

526
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,270
That's all you could do back then.

527
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:28,670
But it is very much the 2000 equivalent to a 2021 website where like at the bottom of each page, it just takes you to the next page.

528
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:32,390
And if you laid it all out, it would be six printed out pieces of paper.

529
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,350
It would be a square space.

530
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,730
They put up a square space.

531
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:36,590
They put out a square.

532
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:49,030
Yeah, they put out they put out a PowerPoint deck that also works as handouts to the executives who are simultaneously looking at their print out and then looking up at a screen in a conference room.

533
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:53,990
But it works for me because it has some vague what rides might be.

534
00:32:53,990 --> 00:33:06,870
And then look in all of this, the OK, you know, the main thing is if they get their way and any of this happens, no matter what the individual rides are, we're getting a major influx of fake rocks onto the Disney property.

535
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,470
That's like all there is.

536
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:09,410
And they need it.

537
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:17,170
They need like backdrops and facades to block the fact that there's like a house, you know, 10 feet away from some of these new attractions.

538
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:23,050
Yes, that struck me immediately is how much how many fake rocks there were in this art.

539
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:31,290
It's like every that's like, yeah, as you're saying, all there is, like, I guess maybe on the on the Disneyland side of things is the least in the in the art on this picture.

540
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:36,410
There's some there's like and where maybe I'm seeing like potential volcanoes.

541
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:43,270
I'm no fan of the character Peter Pan, but I but a Never Neverland mountain range with a nice lagoon around it.

542
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:46,370
That looks pretty good if that's one of the things that's happening.

543
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:57,350
And people have certainly mentioned the possibility that some of the fake some of the best fake rocks around that being the world of Pandora might be.

544
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,850
This might be our way that we get Pandora.

545
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:00,910
Yeah, Disneyland.

546
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,610
That is possible.

547
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:14,090
Yeah, a couple of the other they also mentioned the Zootopia land they're building in Shanghai as well as a possibility, which I think has less mountains and more city type things.

548
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,450
But yeah, all the stuff is on the table.

549
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:20,910
I have, of course, also seen people speculate about Wakanda.

550
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:22,490
Yes.

551
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:26,110
Yeah, because one of the overhead drawings.

552
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:32,830
Yeah, and I don't have a high up, but the one that you when you first go into the new Esplanade and you take a left.

553
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:33,970
Yeah, people here.

554
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,430
If you look on the adjacent.

555
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,890
Yeah, let me take over.

556
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:37,730
I have it.

557
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:43,110
So I think I saw Freddie Chambers caught it first on Twitter.

558
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:52,910
I'm about to Freddie from Batu and so this area.

559
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:55,250
Let me I drew on it here.

560
00:34:55,350 --> 00:35:06,790
OK, so here's Paradise Pier Hotel and this oval is appears to be an overhead drawing of like the big Black Panther statue that is in Wakanda.

561
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:15,510
And then this circle just southwest of it, it looks appears to be the Hallelujah Mountains, the floating mountains in Pandora.

562
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:24,950
Yeah, yeah, and a big old show building that probably that looks very like the space that would be required for flight of passage.

563
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:26,470
Yeah.

564
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,630
Does anything else look familiar?

565
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,290
Like, what's this bit?

566
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:34,210
What's this like Matterhorn looking thing that a bunch of tracks are going through that looks great.

567
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:34,970
Yeah, whatever it is.

568
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,470
It's interesting because on the other art.

569
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:44,630
So if you're looking at the main art, it's the thing on the left for California Adventure on that other art that looks like Peter Pan to me.

570
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:49,090
The Peter the promo art for the Tokyo Peter Pan expansion.

571
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:49,770
Yes, you agree.

572
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:50,910
Yeah, yeah.

573
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:51,210
Yeah.

574
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,910
But there's no reason that couldn't be.

575
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:59,850
I mean, it makes more sense in Disneyland, but I guess you could do it in California Adventure because California Adventure is whatever at this point.

576
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:03,990
But this looks like because there's white and it's snowy.

577
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:06,430
This looks like it could be an Arendelle.

578
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,290
This looks like it could be a frozen.

579
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:12,030
Oh, but there's not a frozen stone here.

580
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:15,430
There's not a ton of like there's not a ton of snow.

581
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,030
I think in a lot of this stuff.

582
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,810
There's a little white on top of the mountain.

583
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:23,890
But right now saying what else is it has a mountain that's snowy right now.

584
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:24,610
That's true.

585
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,330
It's got like is this a coaster?

586
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:31,070
Maybe Carly was talking about the possibility of a frozen coaster.

587
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,050
And that sounds better than the boat ride that's there.

588
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,710
And is that what we're looking at?

589
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,030
Maybe I think that's what we're looking at here.

590
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,230
And I think obviously Disney knows what they're doing.

591
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,810
They're not going to.

592
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,850
These images are not the same.

593
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:49,730
This overhead thing in the promo art are not the same things because they don't have the same details in them.

594
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:53,790
So I'm sure there's a scenario where they put frozen right there.

595
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,270
There's a scenario where they put that Peter Pan land there.

596
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:01,330
I'm sure it's flexible, but it makes sense.

597
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:06,990
I mean, it makes sense because they've been trying to get a big presence of a very popular movie in the parks for a while now.

598
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:07,890
Yeah.

599
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:14,970
And then, of course, you got to see on the other side of Disneyland and the other side of the Esplanade, possible new parking.

600
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,130
The dream will not die.

601
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,430
The dream of decades now.

602
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:21,970
Yes.

603
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,670
And that's the real thrill.

604
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:26,950
I mean, that's what we're, you know, we just we need this garage.

605
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,230
Otherwise, we can't have Nick Weiger back.

606
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:35,710
He's a great guy and a good guest, and we'd love to have him on more, but we're stuck now.

607
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:41,490
So we might not have we might not be able to have Weiger on for another like 15 years.

608
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:43,390
Yeah, this gets built.

609
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:46,930
I will say the other the orange part here, the Disneyland.

610
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:50,510
This feels like maybe Zootopia partly.

611
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:53,210
I can't tell exactly that.

612
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:59,390
It's it's yeah, it's very orange colored in the map that we're looking at if you're looking at a visual key here.

613
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,530
And yeah, I don't know.

614
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,690
It's the most question mark for me.

615
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:05,830
Okay.

616
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,090
Yeah.

617
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,170
So yeah, they mention all those things.

618
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,730
I think they probably wouldn't.

619
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:22,070
I've heard for a while they've like thought about putting Wakanda somewhere, whether it's like Animal Kingdom or an Epcot inside Wonders of Life is rumored for a while.

620
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:24,350
Yeah, that was not happening now, but.

621
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:27,430
So that would make sense to do something like that.

622
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,950
And I assume they probably wouldn't tease a new land yet.

623
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,590
Obviously, they just said things that existed.

624
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,310
I will say this.

625
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:45,650
My first thought when I saw Third Gate announced at Disneyland before people had amended that headline was my first thought was, oh, my goodness.

626
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:51,970
Third Gate means we'll at least get one original ride.

627
00:38:52,130 --> 00:39:02,010
That was the first thing I thought of because that's what we always that's what I always say is I feel like we're not going to get an original Imagineer ride until there's a full Third Gate.

628
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,270
And they have like the space to go.

629
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:06,430
All right, we'll let the Imagineers do one creative thing.

630
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,950
Because you have to, just to fill the space.

631
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:10,770
Right.

632
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:11,150
Yeah.

633
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:22,250
But I am less optimistic now that this is all just expansion that we would get like a Mystic Manor type ride or any sort of classic kind of dark ride from Disney history.

634
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:40,250
Well, I think I think some of these diagrams, you got to think how much of that was the directive of like, put some Easter eggs in there, get the Internet talking and how much was like, just draw a bunch of, you know, let's just draw a bunch of stuff that could kind of be.

635
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,670
Yeah, some of it's just kind of generically landscaping.

636
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:47,610
Some of it's kind of generic water bodies, you know, and then just shapes of buildings.

637
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:53,930
It's still possible what I'm saying, but I was thinking, oh, that probably takes the chances down.

638
00:39:54,070 --> 00:40:00,430
That probably the percentage of a chance that we'll get like an original new thing is probably lower now.

639
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,350
But I could be wrong.

640
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,090
I hope I'm wrong.

641
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,010
What you're saying?

642
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,430
Yeah, yeah, I'm not sure.

643
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:13,890
Like in order to even have a theme for a whole third theme park, like there would have to be original IP to to flesh it out.

644
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:15,090
Yeah, it just be.

645
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:19,770
And here's some ABC shows and stuff.

646
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,590
Maker Studios.

647
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:23,170
What else do they own?

648
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,850
Maker, yeah.

649
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:29,550
Yeah, so so it'll be interesting.

650
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:37,710
I'm sure obviously we talked about a lot of timing is everything when it comes to rides just because of the company's wanting to build of the company has enough money.

651
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:42,570
What movie was popular in merchandise sales in the last so many years?

652
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,570
We know Mr.

653
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:46,490
Chaypeck is big on that type of thing.

654
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:54,410
So I would love to think that the sky is really the limit to here with as far as like maybe like an alien ride or something.

655
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,910
Now that they have Fox, like could we do a Simpsons land back here?

656
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:06,690
Because Simpsons is going to run out as far as our contract universal by I think 2028 and they either need to strike up a new deal or go away.

657
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:11,610
Like I would like to think there's some curveballs coming and Wakanda is obviously a curveball.

658
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:12,850
So it's interesting.

659
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:13,630
It's exciting.

660
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:22,610
There seems to be like four ish four and a half five big plots of land that could be their own kind of spaces, be their own thing.

661
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:27,910
Yeah, I think I'd be deflated if it was different Simpsons.

662
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:32,770
I think that'd be unless it's like such a mind blow of a different thing.

663
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,270
Yeah, Simpsons world to pull from.

664
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:35,770
Yeah.

665
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:40,070
But what if it's like a more of a dark classic dark ride with Simpsons animatronics?

666
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,110
Yeah, that's pretty good.

667
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,410
Yeah, if they're real.

668
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:45,150
Yeah, if they're real.

669
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:57,190
But yeah, it would feel like a little bit of a copy unless yeah, unless they really like set out to kick the ass of universal and like developed a galaxy's edge level Springfield.

670
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:08,950
He's sort of like the like a new dad really wanting to kick the old dad in the teeth and like just like give the kid the most kick ass life ever.

671
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:14,230
Yeah, well, he's going to be courtside at the Lakers and I'm going to take him in a real jet.

672
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,950
What'd you ever do?

673
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,550
Or or they build itchy and scratchy land or something.

674
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,530
They build a little scratchy land.

675
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,710
That sounds good.

676
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:23,990
That sounds really good.

677
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:25,890
But I doubt they're going to do that.

678
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:32,630
I'm just saying I wonder I wonder if there's any chance we get something crazy like an alien's ride or something.

679
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:37,350
That's a good I had not brought Fox into consideration here.

680
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:44,130
Is that the big what is up Fox wise that I feel like Ice Age always comes up.

681
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,870
But I don't know about Ice Age.

682
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:46,550
Why are we doing?

683
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,630
Why would we do a bunch of Ice Age?

684
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:54,050
Like what is the Fox stuff that you go and aliens of great example.

685
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:58,290
But you know, do we need a night at the museum ride?

686
00:42:58,330 --> 00:42:59,370
I don't know if we do.

687
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,910
Well, what's in Fox that we will name Galoo.

688
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:03,770
You can watch.

689
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:06,030
You can see Nimgaloo on Disney Plus.

690
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,390
They do have epic.

691
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:13,390
The two weirdest things when I've been coming through Disney Plus, I was like, oh, Disney Plus is Isle of Dogs.

692
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,830
I forgot about that.

693
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:16,330
And then they have epic.

694
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:19,810
And I was like, wait, epic is what Nimgaloo is from.

695
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:20,250
Yes.

696
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:21,670
And it is on Disney Plus.

697
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:26,550
I thought about this more than most people and I have to like remind myself every time.

698
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,290
Like, yeah, what's Nim?

699
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:30,910
Who's Nim?

700
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:31,490
What's Nim?

701
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:38,290
But if I could go to Nim's house, I say I'm going to look at like whatever the biggest show building is on this map.

702
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:40,350
It's probably Nimgaloo's house.

703
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,410
It's just a walkthrough to meet Nimgaloo.

704
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,170
Yeah, three hour lines.

705
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,570
They have to build so much queue space.

706
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:53,350
Yeah, because that's going to be longer than flight of passage as far as a wait time.

707
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:55,310
Yeah, there's nothing Fox.

708
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:59,310
I mean, there's Predator, there's Alien, there's Die Hard.

709
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:01,370
I mean, there's stuff that's maybe doesn't.

710
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,910
I mean, Alien lends itself to a theme park ride for sure.

711
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:05,330
And Predator probably could.

712
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:06,450
There's something there, too.

713
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:08,790
But those aren't so popular right now.

714
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:16,350
I know they're still like talking about doing like a new Alien show with Ridley Scott, who's like, you know, 90 years old, but he keeps going.

715
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:17,870
He keeps making a movie a year.

716
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:25,890
So maybe maybe if like Disney plus does an Alien show and it's very popular.

717
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:27,070
Yeah.

718
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,890
It really is super scary.

719
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:33,570
I'd be pretty terrified of even just the one scene in the great movie, right?

720
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,570
It was always so scary as a kid.

721
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:36,550
Yeah, the scariest.

722
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:40,230
Yeah, so we'll see.

723
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:42,110
I don't know.

724
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:48,330
Hey, Marvel's publishing a new series of Aliens comics and it's getting bad reviews.

725
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:52,790
So maybe they'll turn that into something possible.

726
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:54,470
Terrible new.

727
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:56,650
You know, we haven't talked about.

728
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:57,630
We got to go.

729
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:08,230
We got to go a little bit east and a little bit south and talk about the weird little little runt land in the Toy Story parking, what is currently a mass vaccination site.

730
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:15,830
And I hope doesn't have to be for too much longer, but isn't permanently that it seems like they're going to have it all taken care of.

731
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:22,370
And yeah, so the parking lot that you don't want to be in because then I get stuck on buses and be in the parks later.

732
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,290
Maybe it's going to turn into something.

733
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:29,470
And this concept art is the most confusing because that land is not a lot.

734
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:33,790
If they put a full theme park there, that's the smallest on property.

735
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:39,050
Maybe it's maybe the smallest of any Disney park, so maybe you don't get a full theme park out of it.

736
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:48,670
Yeah, what they've done here, it kind of looks like some sort of lush vacation club or Disney Springs type environment.

737
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:49,950
It kind of seems nice.

738
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:57,390
Oh, they say that out now, like inspired by Disney Springs and like have pictures of Jock Lindsay's hangar bar and stuff.

739
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:58,570
Oh, OK.

740
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:01,370
Yeah, that's what I've that's what everyone has been saying.

741
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:07,610
It's it's like sort of their version of a fancier outdoor mall with restaurants and stores.

742
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:11,330
And I think somebody even said like if they will like will zone it.

743
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:16,830
I mean, this actually has been zoned for the third theme park for a long time, but it looks like they're not thinking of that at this point.

744
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:21,630
But they're saying like, oh, they could throw a ride of some kind in here.

745
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:24,310
They could put some sort of experience.

746
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:30,130
To go along with the Disney Springs, I don't know if they will, but that is a possibility.

747
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,990
I mean, I've always liked that idea.

748
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:37,110
And there's their epic universe.

749
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:46,550
There's there's talk of that at Epic Universe because Epic Universe is four lands and they all have to be accessed by whatever their version of an Esplanade.

750
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:50,710
But their Esplanade is basically like City Walk, a fancier City Walk.

751
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:59,430
But people are speculating that they could they're like could be just rides there, like freestanding rides in the middle of that shopping mall that you could go on.

752
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:04,470
And who knows if that'll be cut now that a pandemic happened or who knows?

753
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:10,510
I mean, the literally the language on the website is a new kind of Disney entertainment destination.

754
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:17,250
This property could be the perfect location to cater to locals, conventioneers, hotel and Disneyland resort guests.

755
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:30,510
Yeah, I think that because because it's so close to the Anaheim Convention Center, I think they're probably seeing dollar signs as far as you know, you get a bunch of convention goers leaving whatever convention they're at at 6 p.

756
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:31,050
m.

757
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:36,190
They walk over there and spend a bunch of money like that makes probably sense to them.

758
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:43,810
It's just a quick walk over there as opposed to because Disneyland's a little awkward to get to from the Convention Center at this point.

759
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:45,970
But maybe this is easier in a way.

760
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:48,110
It looks nice.

761
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:50,070
I like those little houses.

762
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:51,730
Can we live there?

763
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:53,470
Yeah, that's a good question.

764
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:56,010
I think people have speculated that could be a hotel.

765
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:59,170
But I'd like to think much like the Americana.

766
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:00,850
Maybe those are just apartments.

767
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,970
Yeah, I mean, I'm there.

768
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:05,750
I'm there right away.

769
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:06,830
Oh, yeah.

770
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:07,170
Opening.

771
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:07,550
Yeah.

772
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:07,870
Oh, yeah.

773
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:11,050
We'll we'll get the first set of apartments down there for sure.

774
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:11,510
Yeah.

775
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:12,690
Finally, the dream.

776
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:14,370
Ten thousand dollars a month.

777
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:17,350
But yeah, we're looking at our new house, gentlemen.

778
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:18,710
All three of us.

779
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:19,830
That's right.

780
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:27,670
Our significant others having left unwilling to have a baby live at Disneyland all the time.

781
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:28,730
Well, yeah, there you go.

782
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:29,910
Future PTR pad.

783
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,310
Excited to live with you guys.

784
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:37,750
And then we can because we're going to have to we're going to need proximity when all of these new lands are open.

785
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,150
There's no choice but to live there.

786
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:42,250
Yeah, no, it would be.

787
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,990
I wish you know what is the bit aside.

788
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:49,710
I wish that there were apartments and I wish I was I mean, I wish I was younger in general.

789
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:55,490
But if I was a younger man with a job, man, would that be a funny bit?

790
00:48:55,570 --> 00:49:02,710
Man, would that be great for like a year to live in the apartments above the new Disney Springs on the former Toy Story lot?

791
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:04,110
That would be fantastic.

792
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:06,870
A funny, expensive bit.

793
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:07,930
Very expensive.

794
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:10,970
Priciest bit that was ever achieved.

795
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:19,270
Maybe if maybe if it would happen 10 years ago, though, and Disney wasn't doing as well, the parks, maybe then that would be the time when I could afford it.

796
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:21,630
Although I had a lot less money probably at that time.

797
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:24,250
So, yeah, probably not a practical bit.

798
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:24,790
I agree.

799
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:33,050
But your only choice is to sneak in to like hide in a bathroom every night and sleep on top of the toilet.

800
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:35,810
So when they do the checks, they don't see your feet.

801
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:38,450
And then Disneyland's yours all night.

802
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:43,510
I believe pro wrestler Terry Funk has talked about he's an older guy now.

803
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:44,130
He's retired.

804
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:47,290
Finally, he used to do stunt work in L.

805
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:47,430
A.

806
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:49,630
to get his health insurance through SAG.

807
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:53,610
And he never paid for a hotel room because he had a skeleton key.

808
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:58,930
You just go room to room in different hotels and see which room would open up with the key.

809
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:00,710
And then you would just sleep in there.

810
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:05,050
So it's just the similar thing I would have tried to pull with a skull.

811
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:10,890
I would have an old fashioned skeleton key or I guess a skeleton key card is what the new version of that is.

812
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:12,630
Yeah, that's cool.

813
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:15,910
You definitely want like an old grimy key that looks like a skeleton.

814
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:16,590
Yeah.

815
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:22,030
But if the like the kind of thing you would put in the door was in the shape of like a skull and crossbones.

816
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:25,670
Oh, and like eyes went red once the insertion.

817
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:26,370
Yeah, that's cool.

818
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:27,490
That would be cool.

819
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:35,350
I seeing this like Disney Springs art, I was thinking, come on, throw us a bone and build a new Pleasure Island.

820
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,410
Come on.

821
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:39,390
Oh, we're just going back to that.

822
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:40,190
That's interesting.

823
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:41,210
Pleasure Island 2.

824
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:41,490
0.

825
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:42,290
Come on.

826
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:43,530
Throw us a bone, Disney.

827
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:47,450
We want the fireworks factory.

828
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:48,210
Yeah.

829
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:50,870
Mannequins, mannequins, part two.

830
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:54,790
Obviously, people are dying for mannequins and eight tracks.

831
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:56,450
Neon armadillo.

832
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:17,390
Can you imagine how excited we would be if that's how we would be at all the residents just glaring like Moe walking across the stage at the bachelor auction and a whole pissed off audience like all the residents just like it's like, guys, we're going to build 20 to 30 new bars right in the neck.

833
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:18,570
Your neck of the woods.

834
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:25,050
We're like in our mid to late 40s and like we're at mannequins five times a week.

835
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:25,790
Yeah.

836
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:32,050
Wearing like just like netting like netting shirts and just like loving it, the loving the lifestyle there.

837
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:36,130
We're wearing netting shirts like we're like 90s clubbers.

838
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:37,570
Yeah, like 90s clubbing outfits.

839
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:38,310
Yeah, like hackers.

840
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:39,810
We look like Wright said Fred.

841
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:42,090
Yeah, we look like Wright said Fred and we're there.

842
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:42,990
Shaped our heads too.

843
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:49,470
We're like old and we all have kids at that point, but we don't see them a lot because we're at mannequins too much.

844
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,810
What a time to be a lot.

845
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:54,470
What a great time it would be.

846
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:56,510
Sorry, sport.

847
00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:03,850
Would love to love to go to the baseball game, but it's it's 80s night and they're going to play.

848
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:06,690
You got the look and I gotta be there.

849
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,270
Five dollar you call it's at mannequins tonight.

850
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:10,770
Little little guy.

851
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:11,510
Sorry.

852
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:16,670
Scott, Scott, I was looking at our credit card bills.

853
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:21,390
It appears you've maxed out a card at the Spring Hill Suites, Anaheim.

854
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:24,570
Please just drive back.

855
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,410
Please just get just get a driver.

856
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:28,130
Get a designated driver.

857
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:39,210
Look, I know that I could just get bottles of liquor from a store and bring them in there, but many fridges are so convenient and fun.

858
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:45,570
And what if I want to spend $500 in tiny vodka bottles every night?

859
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,050
That's my prerogative.

860
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:51,330
Plus that one time you tried roller skating home from Anaheim and it didn't work.

861
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:52,690
You were too drunk.

862
00:52:55,450 --> 00:53:00,910
I thought my skills were sharpened from roller constant roller disc going.

863
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:07,270
My last thought for this whole thing is a concern.

864
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:08,270
Another concern.

865
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:12,510
And I'm sure you share the I hate to go out on a down note.

866
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:17,690
What does all this mean for Tomorrowland?

867
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:20,430
It means nothing.

868
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:22,250
I've resigned to it.

869
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:23,410
I know what's happening.

870
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:25,290
Yeah, I know that nothing's happening.

871
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:27,530
I know they're letting it die on the vine.

872
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:35,090
I mean, I guess if this is some sort of 10 year timeline we're talking about, Tomorrowland could still be on the table.

873
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:42,970
But wouldn't it have been nice in Disneyland forward to also throw us a bone like we are still going to be doing things in the parks.

874
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:47,950
Obviously they have to do that, but we still have a timeline as well to build rides in the park.

875
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:49,770
I guess it doesn't have to be anything they approve.

876
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:55,290
But it would be nice to see the future a little bit and say Mickey and Minnie's coming in.

877
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:57,370
Was it next year already or is it 2023?

878
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:58,630
I think it got pushed.

879
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:00,330
So it's maybe 2023.

880
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:00,870
Yeah.

881
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:04,610
Well, we will build the Avengers e-ticket that still will be coming.

882
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:09,190
And then, yes, finally we'll do tomorrow.

883
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:10,130
Like Tomorrowland.

884
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:13,250
Wouldn't that have been nice and given us a little peace of mind?

885
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:15,030
I guess.

886
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:16,310
Yeah, of course.

887
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:17,510
But I see what's happening.

888
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:18,370
They're rezoning.

889
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:20,110
They want everything to be mixed use.

890
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:25,810
I think in six years Tomorrowland is just is going to be condos.

891
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:28,890
It's going to be nice, expensive apartments.

892
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:29,710
And you know what?

893
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:30,290
Fine.

894
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:31,570
Just do it.

895
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:32,990
Get it over with already.

896
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:34,290
Put it out of its misery.

897
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:36,590
But could we live in the condos at least?

898
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:38,430
And if that's the case, then great.

899
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:43,710
If I have a Space Mountain View room, I'll pay what's an accurate number?

900
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:46,190
Seven thousand dollars a month.

901
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:47,450
Yeah, I'll do it.

902
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:48,050
Probably.

903
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:49,010
Yeah.

904
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:49,950
Seems right.

905
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:55,030
Well, I see that that kind of gives me a good opportunity to jump in.

906
00:54:55,650 --> 00:55:06,850
And I have a little game prepared if you guys like to play getting because I think we're really underselling how much corporate mumbo jumbo is on this website.

907
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:12,490
How much like marketing speak like a lot of stuff about immersiveness and interactiveness.

908
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:17,170
So this game is called Real or Fake website.

909
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:18,050
So I've come up.

910
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:25,170
I have a bunch of quotes here and you're going to tell me whether these are on the Disneyland Forward website or they are fake.

911
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:26,010
Oh, wow.

912
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:27,670
This is like the Walt game we played.

913
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:30,350
This is very much inspired by the Walt game.

914
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:30,790
Yes.

915
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:31,790
OK, great.

916
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:32,230
Great.

917
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:32,770
Oh, boy.

918
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:34,370
Let's we're going to go jargon crazy.

919
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:34,970
OK.

920
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:41,370
OK, first up, now is the time to be bold, to dream, to believe and to lead.

921
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:49,830
That seems like the sentiment of now and of like, let's get out of Covid times.

922
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:51,710
And I and plus maybe I saw that.

923
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:53,610
I think it's I think maybe that one's real.

924
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:55,910
I think I saw it as well and I believe it's real.

925
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:56,950
That is real.

926
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:57,450
Correct.

927
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:58,390
You're both correct.

928
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:00,490
OK, the second one.

929
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:15,890
It's a little wordy, but I think.

930
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:18,310
Can you read it one more time?

931
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:25,510
Flexibility in use classification will energize and diversify sector growth for the hard hit resort district.

932
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:28,390
Can you spell it?

933
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:29,830
The whole sentence?

934
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:30,850
Yeah, everything.

935
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:32,350
I think it's real.

936
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:33,290
Scott.

937
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:34,030
Yeah, I'll say real.

938
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:34,270
Sure.

939
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:35,210
That is fake.

940
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:36,370
That is nonsense.

941
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:39,750
That is a bunch of Bud's words that mean nothing.

942
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:41,690
OK, I guess sector.

943
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:43,510
I guess they don't use sector.

944
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,590
I'm on the hunt for sectors.

945
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:46,930
Yeah, we do.

946
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:54,010
They the term resort district is the official city and Disney term for that that area of Anaheim.

947
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,450
OK, next one.

948
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:57,370
It's time to look forward.

949
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:01,230
Time to turn Anaheim into Canaheim.

950
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:04,170
No, no, no, no.

951
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:05,690
That can't be real.

952
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:06,430
That's fake.

953
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:08,310
OK, yes, that is fake.

954
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:10,150
Canaheim.

955
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:16,710
Today, hotel, theme park, retail and dining are all part of one immersive experience.

956
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:18,350
I saw that.

957
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:18,890
That's real.

958
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:19,470
That is.

959
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:20,050
That's gotta be real.

960
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:20,610
That's real.

961
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:21,050
OK.

962
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:21,590
Yeah.

963
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:23,090
The next one.

964
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:28,870
Imagine the hotel of your dreams steps away from the Disney park you've always wished for.

965
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:31,010
Hmm.

966
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:38,230
I'm just I'll say fake, not because I smell a rat there, but just, you know, maybe that's the pattern.

967
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:41,250
I'm going to say fake because I don't remember seeing it.

968
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:42,350
That is fake.

969
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:46,350
Yes, I just tried to cram in as many Disney buzzwords as I could.

970
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:48,170
Imagine dreams, wishes.

971
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:49,730
OK.

972
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:52,770
Then this last one.

973
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:54,410
OK.

974
00:57:55,390 --> 00:58:05,170
Walt Disney once said the only thing I like more than a proper execution of an idea is proper planning in order to achieve it.

975
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:06,830
Fake.

976
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:10,590
I thought it was going to be the proper execution of a communist.

977
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:18,290
So if it's not that, then that's a Walt one, too.

978
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:20,130
That's kind of I'll say fake.

979
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,010
It is fake.

980
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:22,210
Yes, that one is fake.

981
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:23,110
Wow.

982
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:23,470
Wow.

983
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:25,310
Well, we had we had Walt practice.

984
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:27,250
So, you know, yes.

985
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:32,650
Well, but on the front of this website, they have weaponized a couple of things.

986
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:36,310
One, they use the Walt Disneyland will never finish.

987
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:39,150
And then there's a very funny portion of the website.

988
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:42,070
A lot of people jumped on where they said,

989
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:54,210
Unfortunately, the addition of more attractions and experiences in the future may be limited under current inflexible planning restrictions unless we remove and replace some treasured rides and attractions at our parks today,

990
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:57,670
which really has to do it.

991
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:58,450
Don't do it.

992
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:02,730
It has the vibe of the national lampoon by this magazine or the dog gets.

993
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:06,350
Yeah, I mean, it's a very mob.

994
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:06,950
It's a mob.

995
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:10,430
Yeah, you wouldn't want to see you when was he on a mission.

996
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:12,590
Go away, would you?

997
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,730
Be ashamed of something happened to it.

998
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:17,310
Be ashamed that these ghosts could finally rest, you know.

999
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:18,310
Yeah.

1000
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:22,390
Come on, and I'm City Council.

1001
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:25,450
You have at least how cold hearted are you?

1002
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:28,770
Well, they're more than you've taken a little boat around.

1003
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:30,330
You don't want to see it die.

1004
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:42,390
We did an episode about the Anaheim politics a while forever ago at this point, and the City Council, I think, is a little bit more right leaning and probably more favorable to Disney than it was at that time.

1005
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:48,030
So I have a feeling I have a feeling they're going to approve this.

1006
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:49,110
Yeah, I think.

1007
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:59,170
Thankfully, that happened already a few years ago, and a steal didn't have to be stopped because, you know, we would have been the Anaheim, the AFBI, the Anaheim FBI.

1008
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:03,170
You would have seen all our faces in the on their Twitter account.

1009
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:04,170
That's a good point.

1010
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:10,310
But if Jason does lose some sort of mayoral bid, it will have been a stolen election for sure.

1011
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:10,990
Oh, yeah.

1012
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:12,290
Yeah.

1013
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:14,570
Yeah, they can't steal it until you run.

1014
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:19,550
I mean, I can regard them all as stolen, but also we haven't filed any paperwork or anything.

1015
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:22,330
So yeah, once we do.

1016
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:23,550
Okay.

1017
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:24,350
Well, you're right.

1018
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:25,290
And once Jason.

1019
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:28,650
Wait, but Jason's the mayor of Disneyland, not Anaheim.

1020
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:30,970
Or wait, was there that thought too?

1021
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:32,930
Are we trying to do or are we just trying to do both?

1022
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:34,410
I think maybe both.

1023
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:35,450
Sure.

1024
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:38,150
I mean, you have to live in Anaheim to be the mayor.

1025
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:39,010
Probably, right?

1026
01:00:39,130 --> 01:00:39,570
Probably.

1027
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:40,330
Yeah.

1028
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:41,810
We're heading there, obviously.

1029
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:46,350
If we just get one of those Disney Springs apartments, though.

1030
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:48,530
Oh, yeah, that's true.

1031
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:49,370
Yeah.

1032
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:50,070
Yeah.

1033
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:50,630
Done deal.

1034
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:52,830
Go back and forth like Congress people.

1035
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:55,530
You can sort of like annex.

1036
01:00:55,650 --> 01:01:00,350
If you're the mayor of Anaheim, you can say, well, Disneyland's my territory.

1037
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:07,430
That's like as part of like I'll let you build the rides if I am the mayor and I get to walk around with a sash.

1038
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:09,750
Mostly by the sash.

1039
01:01:10,530 --> 01:01:10,690
Yeah.

1040
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:11,490
Yeah.

1041
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:13,970
You got a good negotiation tactic.

1042
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:15,910
So all right.

1043
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:18,390
Well, when Jason runs, we will get everything we want.

1044
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:19,810
It'll be Disneyland.

1045
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:23,910
Fast forward as forward as things can possibly be.

1046
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:27,770
And I guess you survived podcast the ride.

1047
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:29,150
The second gate.

1048
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:32,910
Yeah, I don't know.

1049
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:44,910
Here's hoping to, you know, to have the beautiful, the kingdom of Pandora, just a drive away, to have mighty Akrons in our own state.

1050
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:47,210
We can only pray for this.

1051
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:49,450
Yes, that would be a dream.

1052
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:53,530
Well, you know, real quick, what is the number one thing you would like other than like an original IP?

1053
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:57,250
Which land is the number one land you'd want of all the things they're talking about?

1054
01:01:57,310 --> 01:02:03,890
Because they also threw Tron in there as well, which I still thought was maybe going in our tomorrow land, but they threw that in as well as a possibility.

1055
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:08,390
I think it's either Pandora or Wakanda.

1056
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:13,250
Like, I think they could do some really cool stuff with place making with Wakanda.

1057
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:18,350
Yeah, maybe I'd say Wakanda because we don't have one yet.

1058
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:19,430
It's tempting.

1059
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:20,630
I mean, I'd like all of them.

1060
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,330
I'd like like Seven Dwarfs Mind Trap.

1061
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:24,950
I'd like some of that extra fantasy land stuff that they've been doing.

1062
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:30,410
But yeah, what kind of exciting to think about just because we have what is it?

1063
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:32,850
Yeah, that's probably right.

1064
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:41,270
As far as that's probably my choice as well of the stuff they mentioned other than the Simpsons land, the itching scratchy land.

1065
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:48,310
Yeah, a real itching scratchy land where the rides actually hurt you, where the blade on the way into the restaurant is very sharp.

1066
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:51,530
And Nimgaloo's house.

1067
01:02:52,350 --> 01:03:00,090
I just hope this all results in me getting to hug my best friend Nim, whose movie I've never seen and likely never will.

1068
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:07,830
Well, guys, keep it tuned here to the second gate for more bonus content, three episodes every month.

1069
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:18,490
And follow us on all the social media and check the social media if you need visual references and guides and circles and stars, because this one was this was diagram heavy.

1070
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:20,690
But that's a sign of a good episode, right?

1071
01:03:20,890 --> 01:03:22,310
Oh, we complicated episode.

1072
01:03:22,510 --> 01:03:23,230
Very complicated.

1073
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:25,050
Yeah, that's a good one.

1074
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:30,110
Less jokes, more discussion and like looking at charts.

1075
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:31,550
That's what people want.

1076
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:32,730
We knew it.

1077
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:35,430
We knew this was this is what this was going to be.

1078
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:39,690
But, you know, there's jokey ones and there's zony ones.

1079
01:03:39,830 --> 01:03:43,150
I think that's what we promised and delivered.

1080
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:44,290
Yeah, absolutely.

1081
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:49,650
And I do have to say some people did immediately send it to us and go like, can't wait for you guys to talk about it.

1082
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:51,110
So you're getting your wish.

1083
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:56,850
The funniest one was someone sent it and was like, can't wait to hear about this on podcast the ride tomorrow.

1084
01:03:56,850 --> 01:03:58,710
It is like Thursday at six o'clock.

1085
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:02,330
If we're recording Thursday at six o'clock, something has gone wrong.

1086
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:05,190
We're scrambling.

1087
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:11,670
So I like the idea that we like do it live at like midnight on Friday morning.

1088
01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:13,190
Yeah, we're live.

1089
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:13,510
Yes.

1090
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:16,330
Live broadcasting as you're listening.

1091
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:16,870
Right.

1092
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:17,290
Yeah.

1093
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:19,530
Don't try to skip ahead because it's impossible.

1094
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:21,650
So yeah, yeah.

1095
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:24,070
Sorry we didn't do it on Friday, but here it is.

1096
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:25,910
Yeah, I guess the ride forward.

1097
01:04:26,290 --> 01:04:27,190
That's all we can do.

1098
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:29,270
Try to get it out in the week.

1099
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:30,110
And we did.

1100
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:32,470
Hey, thanks for listening, everybody.

1101
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:35,470
New episode in a couple days on the main feed.

1102
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:35,970
We'll see.

1103
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:37,130
We'll listen.

1104
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:38,790
We won't see you then.

1105
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:40,630
Well, you'll be listening to us then.

1106
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:41,250
Bye.

1107
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:41,770
Bye.
