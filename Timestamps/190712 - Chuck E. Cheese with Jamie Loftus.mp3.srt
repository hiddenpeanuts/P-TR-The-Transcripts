1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Forever.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Dog.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Warning, the following podcast may contain soup being bowled for, puppets doing G-Funk,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,800
and literal explosions in a place that builds rock-o-fire explosions.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,000
Jamie Loftus joins us for a long-awaited topic.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,240
At last, it's Chuck E. Cheese on Podcast The Ride.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:52,600
Welcome to Podcast The Ride, the show where a childless person in their 30s can be a kid.

8
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,320
I'm Jason Sheridan, joined as always by Mike Carlson.

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
Yes, hello.

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,320
And Scott Gertner.

11
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,640
Sure can, and always are.

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,640
And our special guest today, one of the co-hosts of the Bechtel?

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
Bechtel.

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Bechtel.

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,080
I knew I should have checked that.

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,000
The Bechtel cast, it's Jamie Loftus.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hi Jamie.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Thanks for having me.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm so excited.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm a fan.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh, thank you.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh, thank you.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh, thank you.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We appreciate it.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And we're a fan of your work on this topic, on today's topic.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Thanks.

27
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,520
Yes, you've wonderfully condensed all of this maddening history and written some great articles

28
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,520
about it.

29
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,120
You can really identify a span of a couple months where I was very underemployed in 2017

30
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,640
based on the sheer volume of what I wrote about this topic.

31
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,640
And just wandering Chuck E. Cheese's in a blur.

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,920
Summer of 2017 was not inner personally my best, but the work was decent.

33
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,520
You made new friends at the Chuck E. Cheese.

34
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
I did, yeah.

35
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,520
I love Chuck E. Cheese.

36
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,520
Met some people.

37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,240
I wish I was like, and now we're married.

38
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,240
That would be sick.

39
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,800
Well, as we know, there's wonderful relationships that came together because of animatronic

40
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
robots.

41
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,960
This is dealt with in the documentary, The Rock of Fire Explosion.

42
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,560
They bring people together.

43
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,280
And actually, there's a perfect thing I realize we need to talk to you about before we super

44
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:31,040
dive into the topic, because it's applicable to your podcast and to today's topic.

45
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,680
So you do the Bechtel cast, which is based around the Bechtel test, which is about measuring

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,160
representation of women in media.

47
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,120
And it's mainly due to women in a movie or TV show talk to each other about something

48
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
besides a man.

49
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,160
That's sort of the main definition of it.

50
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,160
We stumbled upon something a little while ago.

51
00:02:52,160 --> 00:03:00,800
We have our own sort of theme park version of this that is based not so much in how present

52
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,760
is the character in the narrative, but it's mainly about names.

53
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:13,520
It's mainly about do female characters in theme park attractions or in themed entertainment

54
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,480
have as interesting of names as the men?

55
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,000
Because that's like a part of for the way we use the Bechtel test.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,800
That's a part of what we use to is like, do the women have names?

57
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,520
Oh, OK.

58
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,160
A lot of time.

59
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,880
That is a component of it.

60
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,440
Oh, for sure.

61
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,080
OK, OK.

62
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,240
Yeah, because ours is specifically like we stumbled upon it during the Waterworld

63
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,680
stunt show because there's like the Deacon and the Mariner.

64
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,520
And then the woman's name is Helen.

65
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,020
Helen.

66
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,560
So we have the Helen test.

67
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,000
And the more we started paying attention, the more and more we realized like, wait,

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
what's there?

69
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,160
That's Helen.

70
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,560
That character is also named Helen.

71
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,160
And Chuck E. Cheese, obvious famous.

72
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,240
I mean, it is Helen Henney, which is fun.

73
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,520
Helen Henney has a little bit of character.

74
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,560
But Henney makes it fun.

75
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,920
But if you take if you're going pure first names, Helen versus.

76
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,640
Jasper, Pasquale, Munch and Helen.

77
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,840
Helen, all the same.

78
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,240
Yeah, this directly applies to the Helen test.

79
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,640
Right.

80
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

81
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,960
This was all triangulating.

82
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,120
We had to discuss the Helen test with you.

83
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,640
Chuck E. Cheese is very guilty of like token woman character.

84
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,200
Yes, but I but there were characters that could have I think last.

85
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,160
This is we'll get into it.

86
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,920
But there were characters that were introduced earlier that I feel like could have lasted.

87
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,560
And we could have had an equal representation.

88
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:24,880
Right.

89
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,240
There should be parity in in animatronics.

90
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,640
Yes.

91
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,680
Yeah, I agree.

92
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,400
But I don't know.

93
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,560
Like it's it's a question of I've thought about this before and I haven't reached a

94
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,040
conclusion.

95
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,560
So there's nothing written on it.

96
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:45,760
But like whether we as a society are better off with Helen Henney than we would have been

97
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,400
with Mitzi Mozzarella, I don't I don't have the answers.

98
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,360
I feel like maybe if I just dismiss Mitzi Mozzarella as you know, your run of the mill

99
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,360
cheerleader, that's me being a little bit reductive of her.

100
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,280
And I would need to do more research.

101
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,920
And perhaps.

102
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,440
I mean, I hear what you're saying.

103
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,400
But like, don't you think maybe Mitzi Mozzarella would have maybe evolved also past the point

104
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,560
of seeing the characters very simple?

105
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,680
We never know because we never got to see Mitzi Mozzarella in the 90s in 2000.

106
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,680
Because everyone is munch Pasquale.

107
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,800
They've all evolved.

108
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
They've all been around now for so many years.

109
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,520
But Mitzi Mozzarella, we should say, was the female character in the Rock of Fire

110
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,960
Explosion, which was the other band that was at Chobas Pizza.

111
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,200
And at some point there was a consolidation and one got turned into the other.

112
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,520
We'll get into it, I'm sure concept unification.

113
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,600
But so there was this alternate.

114
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,840
Imagine a world without the Helen Henney that we know so well, who's so well defined.

115
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,160
But instead, she's a mouse.

116
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,760
What do we know about her?

117
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,960
We we know nothing.

118
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,600
Yes.

119
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:57,680
I mean, in the famous set of like 1991 era training videos, Helen is at best bumbling.

120
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,680
She cannot figure out the register.

121
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,080
She cannot figure out how to bust the tables.

122
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,960
Yeah, they really frame her as an incompetent.

123
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,600
Yes.

124
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,720
Whereas Pasquale is literally the master of pizza.

125
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,880
And Pasquale is care.

126
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,360
It's weird because now Pasquale is kind of the fumbling.

127
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,960
Have you seen some of the recent videos?

128
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,880
Oh, I watched a lot of them recently.

129
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,520
Yes.

130
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,560
Pasquale now.

131
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,800
I mean, I guess Pasquale, I think he's one of the most well defined characters currently.

132
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,160
Because he now is not just a pizza master and a drummer.

133
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,320
He's also a comedian.

134
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,720
He doesn't stand up at the Lafferoni.

135
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,220
Yes.

136
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,700
He's branched out, too.

137
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,060
He's trying to learn new skills.

138
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,020
He's doing new things.

139
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,220
They're really triple threat.

140
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:44,980
Yeah, he's he's emerged maybe as the most prominent character of the of the classic.

141
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,940
He's my favorite.

142
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:52,100
Honestly, I like to pick credit where it's due the Pasquale episode of crashing, whether you like it or not.

143
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,980
Pete, Pasquale, it's classic.

144
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,860
How they land that cameo, biggest names.

145
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,340
I am upset.

146
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,060
I'm a little upset.

147
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,780
I feel like there's some munch stuff, but I feel like munch isn't being explored to its fullest.

148
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,500
No, I don't.

149
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,980
Yeah, I think munch is a little bit slept on.

150
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,480
Yeah.

151
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,700
Same goes for Jasper.

152
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,620
I don't think we know quite enough.

153
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,260
Chuck, he's been rebranded too many times.

154
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,060
I've had it.

155
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,700
I've had it.

156
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,060
You had a million likes.

157
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,620
The bowling for soup guy, who, by the way, will not answer my emails.

158
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,600
Boo.

159
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,900
You're going to voice an iconic character, then you have to be the PR voice of it too.

160
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,660
How busy could he possibly be?

161
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,580
Maybe that's mean, but I wish he would answer.

162
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,460
He should answer.

163
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,140
Yeah, probably one of seven bands on a tour with Sugar Ray.

164
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,180
Yeah, he's doing free summer concerts.

165
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

166
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,220
He's got ships to play.

167
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,380
Death march of eternal free concerts.

168
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,700
Answer my emails.

169
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,820
Be careful what you wish for if you have one hit 20 years ago.

170
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,100
He's going to dox me.

171
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,060
How dare you, Mr. Bowling for Soup.

172
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,980
Jasper is my least favorite, I'll say offhand.

173
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,700
Really?

174
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,340
I don't find a lot to like about Jasper.

175
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,220
He's a country guy, that's all I know.

176
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,980
I think because of country bears and all that, I think a dog in overalls that likes country music,

177
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,940
I can't be mad at that.

178
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,820
I can't have to like him.

179
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,900
A thing that always bothered me was that it's Munch's Make Believe band,

180
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,540
but Chuck E. takes center stage.

181
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,180
Takes the lead.

182
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:39,140
Well, but Fleetwood Mac, for instance, McFleetwood's the drummer.

183
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,340
Oh wait, no, but Munch is the keyboard player?

184
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:42,660
Yes.

185
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:42,900
Yeah.

186
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,460
Uh-huh.

187
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,940
Well, then it's also a little similar to Santana, where Santana doesn't sing.

188
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,180
Right.

189
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,780
So there's actually a fair amount of music.

190
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,620
Right, there's precedent in the rock and roll world.

191
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,580
Wasn't there like a similar focus issue in the Rock Fire Explosion where

192
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,740
Billy Bob is kind of like the central guy, but the band is actually led by someone else?

193
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,060
Am I?

194
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,380
I think you're right.

195
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,500
He's like the free roaming one.

196
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,860
Oh, because Fats Geronimo is like the lead singer.

197
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,780
But like Billy Bob.

198
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,140
He's the musical director.

199
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,980
The music voice is the guy at the keyboard in both bands.

200
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,740
Yeah, but then for some reason, Billy Bob Broccoli, I'm seeing his last name is.

201
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,140
Is it?

202
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,220
Really?

203
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:36,740
Which is a reference to Robert Brock, the investor that started the pizza wars.

204
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,020
Oh, the turncoat.

205
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,260
Yes.

206
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,700
Interesting.

207
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,380
Billy Bob was the center of attention.

208
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,420
Who knows?

209
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:53,060
So you end up with the same band dynamics when one is a literally reskinned version of a previous band.

210
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,700
Yes, right.

211
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,700
So yeah, so I always liked Munch the best, I will say that.

212
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,820
I'm coming out as the biggest Munch fan, always.

213
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,460
But I am upset with what they've not done with him lately.

214
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:07,700
Yeah.

215
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,900
Well, I think there's also some, it's similar to Chuck, there is some voice confusion with Munch

216
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,540
because sometimes he's like a monster.

217
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,980
He's like, like me eat, he's a cookie monster.

218
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,540
And sometimes he's like, I'm just a guy.

219
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:21,940
Yeah.

220
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,660
I'm Munch.

221
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,780
He's thorough Ravenscroft.

222
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:31,140
With Munch and Helen, I have like McDonald's land confusion.

223
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,380
Yes.

224
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,860
It's very like Grimace and Birdie.

225
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,260
Yeah, 100%.

226
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:39,220
It's mainly purple monster and then like, yeah, chicken woman.

227
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,100
Chicken woman who doesn't get a lot to do.

228
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,060
Right.

229
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,180
Like, yeah, underdeveloped chicken woman character.

230
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,300
But at least Birdie we know was into aviation.

231
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,620
She had goggles, she had the cool scarf.

232
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,020
Yes, Birdie.

233
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,860
She wore pants, she wore overalls.

234
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,340
Yes.

235
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,060
Yeah, yeah.

236
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,100
Birdie, I think would be a little bit more in the mix in those commercials.

237
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,220
That's my memory of it.

238
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,100
I don't know if that's true or not.

239
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,340
Because she was introduced because breakfast.

240
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,900
That was like why they made the character.

241
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,700
She's the early bird.

242
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,660
She's the early bird.

243
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,220
Right.

244
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,580
To your Egg McMuffins.

245
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,140
I didn't realize how much I knew about.

246
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,780
You're in the right place.

247
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,900
Oh, this is good.

248
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,700
Yeah, yeah, I know.

249
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,700
Yeah, we're speaking the same language.

250
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,740
In terms of you mentioned the character named after Robert Brock.

251
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,620
I went down the rabbit hole of just like very quickly looking at all the ancillary

252
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,100
Chuck E. Cheese characters over the years.

253
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:37,060
And my favorites that I came across was the short-lived barbershop quartet,

254
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,740
the four little shavers.

255
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,740
Yeah.

256
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,460
They're named Nolan, O Nolan, Mick Nolan, and Curly.

257
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,300
For Nolan Bushnell.

258
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,060
The Nolan's a nod to Nolan Bushnell.

259
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,560
Yeah.

260
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,740
Co-founder of Atari, founder of Chuck E. Cheese.

261
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,220
Right.

262
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,740
I didn't know that that was their names.

263
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,620
That's cool.

264
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,380
So they only went in a handful of stores that were trying

265
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,580
an ice cream parlor concept in a corner of the store.

266
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,940
So they're like the ice cream parlor, ice cream barbershop quartet,

267
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:15,380
it's not kind of the stripes, like ferals sort of thing.

268
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:20,980
I think there's a real lesson with the story of Chuck E. Cheese about homogenization

269
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,140
and refining brands to the point where they're a little bit dull.

270
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,580
Because if you look at the early messy history of Chuck E. Cheese,

271
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,900
the first of which opened in 1977 in San Jose, California,

272
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,660
all the original ones had different showrooms and different acts.

273
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,020
And there was a rotating guest star slot.

274
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,140
And in fact, the first guest star was Helen.

275
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:50,820
But Helen stuck around and had longevity and became one of the main five.

276
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,120
But.

277
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,260
The middle of second wave feminism.

278
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,420
We can't just rule her out.

279
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,060
We need a woman who's in the workplace, right?

280
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,580
She's a skin gal.

281
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,740
Well, kind of all of the guest stars, they cycled through a lot of women.

282
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,260
I don't think there was ever any talk of there being more than one woman in the band.

283
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,300
Oh, no, no, no.

284
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,180
No, you can't have that.

285
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,980
They have the way they have.

286
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,980
I would sooner have a dog in overalls.

287
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,780
Of course.

288
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,380
Another dog and two dogs.

289
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:17,880
Second.

290
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,980
As many as possible.

291
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,820
But like, it seems like for the first five years or so,

292
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,940
there'd be these showrooms with these weird bands and this character

293
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,220
who's only in this corner.

294
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,820
Yeah, an ice cream place.

295
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,220
And this one has a lounge singer hippo lady.

296
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,460
Foxy Colleen, the Irish lass.

297
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,140
Well, our Dolly Dimples.

298
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:41,860
Dolly Dimples.

299
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

300
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,060
Dolly Dimples should still be a care.

301
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,340
This is what I was saying earlier.

302
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:51,860
Dolly Dimples, Sally Sachet, where these characters could have stood the test of time.

303
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,380
They could come back now.

304
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:53,860
Yeah.

305
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,740
Krusty the cat who was originally Chucky's foil.

306
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:57,880
Yes.

307
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,840
That was back when they were all in frames.

308
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,720
In frames.

309
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,440
Yeah, the original ones were in frames above the restaurant.

310
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,840
Because they didn't have that Aaron Fecter magic.

311
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,080
No.

312
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,240
They didn't have that pneumatic tube magic.

313
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:09,720
No.

314
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,160
Oh, is that what happened?

315
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,240
Because the characters were initially just the upper halves.

316
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,880
They were very rudimentary animatronics.

317
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,120
And then, I mean, we can tear apart the pizza wars all day.

318
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,680
Yes.

319
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,400
Aaron Fecter, thanks to Robert Brock, was funded to make this full animatronic band.

320
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,440
Because they were more fluid and they were easier to customize because of whatever the

321
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,160
tubing system that he had invented for Whack-a-Mole and then got scammed out of Whack-a-Mole,

322
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,240
even though he kind of stole it himself.

323
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,840
So he had the Tubie system.

324
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,560
And then he made this band called the Wolf Pack 5, which is really fun.

325
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,280
And there's still videos of them on YouTube.

326
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:57,800
And then Robert Brock funded, saw their Wolf Pack 5, was like, oh, this is cool.

327
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,720
And funded him to make the Rock-a-Fire explosion.

328
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,220
Yes.

329
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,840
Brock worked for the founder Nolan Bush, who was a franchisee.

330
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,440
Brock's a snake.

331
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,080
He's a snake.

332
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,120
Because he's like, oh, shit, this guy's going to blow us out of the water.

333
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,720
I'm getting in business with this guy.

334
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,920
And just copies the Chucky formula, which I always had at the other.

335
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,720
I always thought Showbiz Pizza came first and Chucky copied.

336
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,220
Me too.

337
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,560
And it's the other way around.

338
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,060
Yeah, yeah.

339
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,480
So yeah, Nolan Bushnell found Chucky Cheese with his Atari money,

340
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:35,000
looking for a way to get arcades going again and to find an excuse for you to be able to drink

341
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,560
in an arcade because that was not a like.

342
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,560
They weren't zoned for that or whatever.

343
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:45,080
So and for what are the adults doing while the kids are playing games?

344
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,200
Which they will sit and watch an animatronic band, I guess was the idea.

345
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:54,280
There was like a few examples in early Chucky Cheese's where they had like a mom's room and

346
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,200
a dad's room where they would they were just like small rooms.

347
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,640
I think it was only in a couple of locations, but they would have soap operas just playing

348
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,440
in one room.

349
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,800
And that's where the moms go and sports playing in another small room.

350
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,000
And that's where the dads go.

351
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,600
And so they can stay there for however long while their kids spend all their money.

352
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,040
You can breastfeed in one.

353
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,200
You can stretch your balls in the other.

354
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,920
There's a stag film playing in the dad's room.

355
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:26,040
Like the parents are separated while their kids play in rooms that their children are not in.

356
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,000
So neither has eyes on their on their children.

357
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,960
No kid check the system to track your child.

358
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,760
In the early days, it was just the I just remember walking in like any restaurant.

359
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,320
It was just the honor system that the child you come with is the child.

360
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,800
Yeah, honor system.

361
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,440
He's just throwing a tantrum.

362
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,480
He's upset.

363
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,280
He lost the game.

364
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,960
He's not mad because I'm abducting him.

365
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,480
That does sound a little dystopian, like a little Fahrenheit 451 of like, well, we come home.

366
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,440
There's father's room and mother's room and child room.

367
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:58,760
Right.

368
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,080
And if you don't like it, make your own room.

369
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,480
I think that that was like pre animatronic band.

370
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,920
Like while there was not much else to look at, though, like they're just like, oh, we

371
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,280
got to give them something to do.

372
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,240
So give them beer and then turn on a sport.

373
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,600
Right.

374
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,280
Do they have to tape soap operas to play at nine o'clock?

375
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,400
Was that a time when like dad might say like, I don't mind that place that Chuck E.

376
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:23,800
Cheese's.

377
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,160
That's not such a bad place.

378
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,120
We could go over there.

379
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,480
Like that was a bad like a time when maybe you could have gotten your dad more on board

380
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,880
to go because like it catered to him.

381
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,320
Like the kind of family time where you don't actually have to be together,

382
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,000
which is my family's favorite.

383
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,320
Right.

384
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:37,480
Yeah.

385
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,520
Everyone gets to kind of do their own thing.

386
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:40,680
Yeah.

387
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,960
I mean, the early days of family dining does feel like, you know how you hate your fucking

388
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,960
kids, but we all got to eat.

389
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:55,240
Here's some dark wood and some do dads and some beer like that was that is what I picture

390
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,560
early.

391
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:01,400
Ben agains and ground rounds and fiddle fat or whatever those fucking places.

392
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,720
I always wonder what the drinking cut off was in early Chuck E.

393
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,640
Cheese days because now it's too, I can say from personal experience.

394
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:09,880
Yeah.

395
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,880
You can't get more than two.

396
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:17,080
You get two X's on your hands and if you've got both X's, you're too, you're fucked up.

397
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,280
You know, you can't, you can't drink any more blue moons.

398
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,200
But I wonder, I feel like it might've been open season back then.

399
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,760
Yeah.

400
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,880
I wouldn't be surprised.

401
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,360
Also at the time I found the menu for the original Chuck E.

402
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,960
Cheese pizza time theater.

403
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,840
Soft frozen yogurt.

404
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,000
Enjoy the latest taste sensation.

405
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:45,960
Toppings include granola, shredded coconut, wheat germ, dates, chopped nuts and shaved

406
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,520
almonds.

407
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,240
So very trendy, I guess at the end of seventies.

408
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,680
We eat your seventies food was really strange in general.

409
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,000
Yeah.

410
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,320
Yeah.

411
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,800
All that weird just gelatin hanging in there is also, they had like a vegetarian pizza and

412
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,280
then a protein pizza where they just kind of doubled the cheese and then put shaved

413
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,840
almonds on top and like beef.

414
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,560
Yeah.

415
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,080
That was like almonds.

416
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,240
Yeah.

417
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,240
I was going to say like this is a weird California pizza kitchen like precursor.

418
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,120
The food has always been pretty gnarly there.

419
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,600
There are some people who will defend the food, but from my experience, it's pretty

420
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,960
indefensible.

421
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,720
The pizza is very sharp.

422
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:37,160
Like I don't subscribe to like the Shane Dawson conspiracy theories or any garbage like that.

423
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,400
Yeah.

424
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:37,640
Yeah.

425
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:37,960
Yeah.

426
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,280
Yes.

427
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:45,640
It's Shane Dawson Shane Dawson put forth the theory that they recycle their pizza that

428
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:51,240
they like easy to wrap your head around system of taking uneaten slices and reconstructing

429
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,320
them into a new pizza.

430
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,880
And that is a theory presented by one of YouTube's most popular racists.

431
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,080
A competitive area.

432
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,760
How do you keep track of them?

433
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,080
Yeah.

434
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,400
Yeah.

435
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:03,720
Yeah.

436
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,280
They have to.

437
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,840
It's the register of the top 10,000.

438
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,880
But I mean, kicking a business while they have been down for 15 years.

439
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,680
So much has fallen.

440
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,440
It actually, I think it did make me mad.

441
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,840
I think I did get to like, don't throw this on them.

442
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,800
It's me.

443
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,640
And there's all these fights happening.

444
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,000
And there's all like horrible fights happening all the time in the Chuck E.

445
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,400
Cheese's and also the misinformation that the robots are going away entirely.

446
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,040
They are.

447
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,760
I mean, they're probably on the way to it, but we've heard it said like I've seen a

448
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,400
lot of the band.

449
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,520
They're gone.

450
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,400
There's no more of them.

451
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,120
The most part, right?

452
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,360
We've asked our listeners send us pictures of the full of give us full munch.

453
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,560
I want to see the full munch.

454
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,760
There's a lot of them out there.

455
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,720
I have the full.

456
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,080
So the way to know whether you're getting the full munch or not is to know when the

457
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,480
Chuck E.

458
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,680
Cheese was opened because they're starting to remove them now.

459
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,640
It's been like two, I think like two years since they said they were going to.

460
00:20:59,640 --> 00:20:59,960
Yeah.

461
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,400
And now they're starting to remove them.

462
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,600
And then the plan is to make it like an open dance space.

463
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,640
And then they're just making that now they're just making those like short sketch

464
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,480
videos with puppets that look like the animatronics sort of.

465
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,880
And I want to know who writes the videos because I want in.

466
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,960
I watched a YouTube video of like the production team.

467
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,360
Really?

468
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,080
I'll send you that.

469
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,480
I'll find it.

470
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,520
Say who the writer was.

471
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,960
They talked to a guy who, I mean, it seems like it's all hands on deck.

472
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,240
I think it's the Muppet Workshop.

473
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,440
I think you're puppeteering in your own and you're directing it.

474
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,480
I'm going to find their LinkedIn and be like, I'll work for free.

475
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,200
I don't care.

476
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
If you're willing to move to Irving, Texas.

477
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,240
I'll go.

478
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,240
I'll be like, we need to do some work on Helen.

479
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,480
I'm uniquely qualified.

480
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,840
That's a legitimate angle, I think, to make your way in on.

481
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,600
By any means necessary.

482
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:54,840
But if the location was open prior to 1998, there should still be a full band there.

483
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,320
Post-98, they start scaling down the animatronics to just a Chucky.

484
00:21:59,320 --> 00:21:59,880
Yes.

485
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,040
Studio C, they call that model.

486
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:10,760
And that Chucky is designed by Garner Holt, a popular animatronic creator and company.

487
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,680
It's the same company that built all of the robots for the Cars ride.

488
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:22,680
And all of these really good recent Knott's Berry Farm rides where they've added and refreshed

489
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,920
robots to these sort of ancient attractions.

490
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,520
And the new robots are wonderful.

491
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,920
That's the one good thing you could say about the Studio C Chucks.

492
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,040
He made the new Chuck?

493
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,840
Oh, that's good.

494
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,600
Yeah, good company.

495
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,520
Had a really good exhibit at a museum in San Bernardino recently.

496
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,240
The Studio C Chucks are criminally underused.

497
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,280
They're just sitting there.

498
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,320
No, and look good.

499
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,600
They look great.

500
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,040
Are they taking those out, though?

501
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,640
Slowly they are.

502
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,000
Where are they going?

503
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,960
Do we know where they're going?

504
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,440
I don't know.

505
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,120
I really want to know what they're doing.

506
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,760
If they're being dismantled for parts, I'll lose my mind.

507
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,840
They have to be, right?

508
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,240
I know.

509
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,520
Hmm.

510
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,020
Yeah.

511
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,320
Or they're going in a big unmarked grave.

512
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,040
Like an unmarked robot grave.

513
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,640
Oh my gosh.

514
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,040
Did you know it happened in Nolan Bushnell twice?

515
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,400
They're burning some of the ETs to make room in the grave for Chuckie.

516
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,200
I was saying if you go to a Chuckie Cheese and you walk in and there's just screens and

517
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,160
maybe a little camera that you can be on the green screen and then a single solitary robot,

518
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,840
that is a Studio C.

519
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,600
The one if anyone pre-gamed our dynasty typewriter show at the Chuckie Cheese,

520
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,040
that one is a Studio C and the robot is still there.

521
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,440
The one near the dynasty typewriter?

522
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:40,680
Yes.

523
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:40,920
Yeah.

524
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:40,920


525
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,440
So those are the most at risk is what we're saying.

526
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:48,760
Yeah.

527
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,440
Of just taking out the one robot.

528
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,240
But if there's five robots, then you've got robot consensus and it's too hard to get rid of all of them.

529
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,320
But they're still going to try?

530
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,960
So I looked up my childhood one in Wilmington, Delaware and that had the full band

531
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,240
up at least into 2012.

532
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,320
I watched a video of the band from 2012.

533
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,560
Then I saw like a walkthrough of it in 2016 and I think it was gone.

534
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:23,320
But kept the sky tubes, had not yet removed the sky tubes, but the band was gone.

535
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,240
And that was the one I went to growing up.

536
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,240
Usually we would go if we got good report cards, we went.

537
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,560
We were good boys, so we always got good report cards.

538
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,880
And then friends birthdays, at a certain point after a few years, my mom was like,

539
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:47,720
look, we'll go to Chuckie Cheese, but can we go to a cheaper, better pizza place before?

540
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,760
Can we just eat and then we'll get you tokens, we'll play the games.

541
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,680
But I do not want to eat there, Jace.

542
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,480
I feel like me, my dad and my brother always liked the pizza.

543
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,320
I as a kid always liked eating at the place I was going.

544
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,000
It's like we're staying at the hotel.

545
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,840
Well, I want to check out the hotel restaurant.

546
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,720
I just made it.

547
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,880
It's probably a holdover from Disney of like, well, you're here.

548
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,560
You want to do the stuff that's here.

549
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,560
Yeah, I remember my dad being weirdly defensive of the pizza as well.

550
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,280
I don't really know why.

551
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,480
I don't think he liked being there.

552
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,600
Though my childhood one was closed while I was still a child.

553
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,040
I don't know if it was because it was under attended or it was like kind of like

554
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,200
not the best neighborhood or what it was.

555
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,320
But yeah, that was our good report cards.

556
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,600
We had to end up going to Bugaboo Creek, which is another.

557
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,120
You guys ever heard of Bugaboo Creek?

558
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,680
No.

559
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,840
That was, I think it must have only been in Canada and maybe like New England,

560
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,440
but it's an animatronic restaurant where the theme is Canada.

561
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:57,080
And there is an animatronic tree at the front that would greet you and be like,

562
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,680
welcome to Bugaboo Creek.

563
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,080
Sit down.

564
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,200
There's a 500 hour wait and would tell jokes.

565
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,880
And then there was like talking moose on the wall.

566
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,000
It was kind of like rainforest.

567
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,480
I think it was they were ripping off Rainforest Cafe.

568
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,960
They're like, what if Rainforest Cafe was Canada?

569
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,360
Right.

570
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,560
And that's where we went.

571
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,000
Was there a Mountie of some kind, like a Mountie robot or something?

572
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:21,160
No, the waiters were dressed as like all like lumberjack.

573
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,480
OK.

574
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,720
But there was I definitely remember there were a bunch of moose.

575
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,440
There was the talking tree because I used to be really afraid of it.

576
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,280
And there was there was a few different, but I haven't found many people who have been to

577
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,320
Bugaboo Creeks.

578
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,160
That's totally unfamiliar to me.

579
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,280
They're all gone now.

580
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,000
I think I'm wrapping.

581
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,280
I've started to not be afraid of talking trees finally in my 30s because there's a lot.

582
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,640
There's that Sanrio Puroland is very that vibe.

583
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,520
And then I remember being freaked out by them at FAO Schwartz.

584
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,360
There's a lot of talking tree animatronics out there.

585
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:52,860
Yeah.

586
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,520
I'm trying to think.

587
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,880
I mean, the scary trees on Snow White Scary Adventure, but they didn't do they talk.

588
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,480
I'm talking those.

589
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,840
You're talking about the real.

590
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,560
Hello.

591
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,000
They have kind of like apple cheek.

592
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,080
They have like big like brown cheeks.

593
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,720
There's a wizard laws talking trees to.

594
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,520
Oh, yeah.

595
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,320
Well, they grab.

596
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,360
They grab.

597
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,080
They were violent.

598
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,920
There's also there was a type of fruit snack where in the ad there was a talking tree.

599
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,240
Yeah.

600
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,280
It goes, oh, and he like rains fruit snacks from his branches.

601
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,520
You were afraid of him a little bit.

602
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,080
Yeah.

603
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,400
Yeah.

604
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,440
That's a scary.

605
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,160
There is something scary about a tree like the bark face.

606
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,600
Yeah.

607
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,200
Bark face, whatever reason.

608
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,520
Yeah.

609
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,080
Strange.

610
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:37,240
The only talking tree I ever really loved was grandmother Willow from Pocahontas.

611
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,520
My mom was great.

612
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,400
She was awesome.

613
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,120
There was like we had a I don't know what kind of tree it was outside when I was little.

614
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:49,000
And my mom went on it and like put a little smiley face on it and sharpie and was like,

615
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,600
you can go talk to it.

616
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,160
So I would just talk to a tree outside.

617
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,360
But it wasn't grandmother Willow in your mind.

618
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,960
It was just another talking tree.

619
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,680
No, it was grandmother.

620
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,160
Oh, it was.

621
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,720
My mind.

622
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,280
Okay.

623
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,320
I was loving it.

624
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:01,880
That's great.

625
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,120
Yeah.

626
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,560
I'm teaching you lessons about preserving nature.

627
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:05,800
Yeah.

628
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,360
She was teaching me about colonialism outside my house.

629
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:09,960
Wild.

630
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,360
The story of mine you watched is not true.

631
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,200
Not one word of it.

632
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:20,600
So a friend told me about this place called has anyone encountered this?

633
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,120
They were in the Midwest.

634
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,760
Similarly to Bugaboos, an offshoot.

635
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,760
Major Magic's All-Star Pizza Review.

636
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,080
No.

637
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,480
No.

638
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,920
It is a Chuck E. Cheese like that's Major Magic.

639
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,920
He's a little guy and.

640
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,040
Oh, he's a little guy.

641
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,120
He's a little Captain Crunch.

642
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,560
Little Captain Crunch guy.

643
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,120
Was that a pancake or a burger?

644
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,480
I think that's a drum.

645
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,000
I think that's a drum with a face.

646
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,480
It's a drum.

647
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:45,880
So.

648
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,400
It's got those apple cheeks I'm talking about.

649
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,920
We looked this up.

650
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,960
Hi, Jane.

651
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,840
We looked this up.

652
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:59,320
The website I found the most of the stuff about on was a man named Dennis Machine Gun Thompson,

653
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,160
who was the drummer in the MC5.

654
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,640
What?

655
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,200
What?

656
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,480
Was involved in this Chuck E. Cheese offshoot.

657
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:07,720
Yes.

658
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,000
So.

659
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,360
There is a cool.

660
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:10,600
Oh, I miss being.

661
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,720
Pizza drama.

662
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,920
There is a cool like fox girl in a pink jumpsuit playing guitar too.

663
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,280
Wow.

664
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:18,680
Yeah.

665
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,240
Here.

666
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:19,880
She's cool.

667
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,680
Oh, that's like the best of all three.

668
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,160
Whoa.

669
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,680
Wait, what is this band called again?

670
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,760
Major Magic's All-Star Pizza Review.

671
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,040
What's the name of the band?

672
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,760
Of the band.

673
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,320
I'm not sure.

674
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,360
Flash the Drummer is a guy.

675
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,360
I think that's a.

676
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,560
She's red.

677
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,600
That's what the sax player was Sergeant Pepperoni.

678
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,720
Perfect.

679
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,440
Funny.

680
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:49,960
This guy was had the title vice president of entertainment and then had to recruit people.

681
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,760
Oh, this is a real.

682
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,760
No, no, the guy from the MC5.

683
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,040
Oh, that was his title.

684
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,600
That wasn't a puppet's name.

685
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,080
OK.

686
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,680
No, I mean, the puppets were clearly military ranks.

687
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,320
Oh, yeah, sure.

688
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,440
Sergeant Pepperoni, major.

689
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,880
There's no vice president in the military.

690
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,280
Yeah.

691
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,720
So yeah, major magic's is a whole other rabbit hole.

692
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,760
Oh, my God.

693
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,720
I'm sorry.

694
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,360
Bugaboo.

695
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,480
Bugaboo Creek.

696
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,280
Bugaboo Creek.

697
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,040
I feel like my mom used to go to like a bugaboo steakhouse.

698
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,760
Yeah, that was it.

699
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,720
Is that it?

700
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,440
Yeah.

701
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,040
Yeah, they might have changed the name.

702
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,880
Maybe they changed it, but I don't remember animal cheese.

703
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,360
Yeah.

704
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,320
That's a whole nother.

705
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:27,800
So sad.

706
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,520
Major Magic, not enough to keep restaurant open.

707
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,840
The Toledo Blade.

708
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,160
What is it?

709
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,960
Roasted by the Toledo Blade.

710
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:44,840
This is also like an alternate path for you being the pizza reporter for local newspapers.

711
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,720
If only this was still needed by anyone.

712
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,200
I know.

713
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,440
If there's no longer anything to cover.

714
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,520
It's a beat reporter.

715
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:57,240
I went to a Chuck E. Cheese in Wisconsin a couple of weeks ago, and it was in pretty good shape.

716
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,680
It was a Studio C model.

717
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:08,120
But I went to my boyfriend's hometown in Racine, Wisconsin, and we found some good stuff.

718
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:16,680
This one had to have opened sometime after 1998, but they had the dressing of like,

719
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,800
they'll do like parody posters at Chuck E. Cheese sometimes.

720
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,480
And these were the best ones I'd ever seen.

721
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,960
There's an ER parody.

722
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,120
What is that?

723
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:26,680
Is it just like a...

724
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,720
It's just Chuck E. and Munch in a surgical room.

725
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,080
It's called ERRR, which I don't know what the joke is.

726
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,320
There'll be these parodies posters, and they did it for albums too.

727
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,800
The one year we were in was TV shows.

728
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,360
It seems like sometimes it's pizza puns, and other times it's about that they're dumb or fat.

729
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,320
So I regard that as like, they aren't smart like doctors.

730
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,280
They're like, errr.

731
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,080
That's what I think of it.

732
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,040
Galaxy range.

733
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,240
It's a very Mad Magazine style.

734
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

735
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,480
Of like, they're dumb.

736
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,120
You can get the word doofus or clod in there or something.

737
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,800
My favorite one is Chuck Feld.

738
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,640
We'll talk to him at Chuck Feld.

739
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,560
Yeah, Chuck Feld is a classic.

740
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,080
Chuck Feld, which is a poster.

741
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,640
He's...

742
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,320
Okay, so Chuck E. Cheese is in a blazer.

743
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,600
He looks kind of like Jerry, and he's doing standup for,

744
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,840
seemingly, the backs of the heads of human Kramer, George, and Lane.

745
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,320
Yes, he's doing standup for the cast.

746
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,280
Yes, yeah.

747
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,960
It's still the regular...

748
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,160
So these people who know their friend Jerry Seinfeld

749
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,960
today are seeing a different standup show by another guy named Chuck Feld.

750
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,360
Yeah.

751
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,480
Jerry Chuck Feld.

752
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,680
Jerry Chuck Feld.

753
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,440
Or is it Chuck E. Chuck Feld?

754
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,320
Yes, that's right.

755
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,400
Charles Entertainment Chuck Feld.

756
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,360
His, yeah, his standup pseudonym is...

757
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,480
Was there...

758
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,320
There's an X files, I think, also?

759
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,760
Yeah, the C files, of course.

760
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:49,960
Uh-huh.

761
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,000
And then, perhaps the laziest of all, Chuck Trick.

762
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,560
Oh, man.

763
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,360
Jamming together.

764
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,680
Not even like pizza trick or something, which...

765
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,880
Or like the symbol could be in a pizza, not even that.

766
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,400
If we're in the area of the parody posters,

767
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,800
I have a little bit of stuff prepared.

768
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,600
We can keep jumping around the history and whatever,

769
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,760
but so those are the TV posters.

770
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,480
I remember being around ones in...

771
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,640
My childhood one was in Northridge, California,

772
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,000
and they had a lot of classic album covers.

773
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,500
Oh.

774
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,640
They had Yellow Submarine Sandwich,

775
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,520
their insert of Beatles cartoon style,

776
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,000
Saturday Night Retriever.

777
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,520
Is that a night fever?

778
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,680
Oh, do you have these ones that my childhood one too, yeah?

779
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,480
Okay, yes, yeah.

780
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,680
I loved the...

781
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,040
I legitimately have very fond memories of seeing...

782
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,760
I was probably acquainted with, for example,

783
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,960
Braun in the USA.

784
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,460
Braun.

785
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,360
I think I knew that before I had ever seen the cover of Born in the USA.

786
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,720
I think similarly Bad Dog,

787
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,160
where Jasper is presented like Michael Jackson.

788
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,280
Michael Jasper.

789
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,080
Michael Jasper.

790
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,920
That's one joke to it.

791
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,400
That's pretty good.

792
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,600
They wish they thought of that.

793
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,600
But the Flabby Road, another one,

794
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,760
because a lot of the song parodies also,

795
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,720
they'll just talk about being fat and the pizza makes them fat,

796
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,400
which is a strange message in your pizza restaurant.

797
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,960
But the one I legitimately like a lot,

798
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,240
I really like this,

799
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:25,960
is a...

800
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,280
And it's a deep cut for them to be parodying,

801
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,560
is a parody of Iron Butterfly and Agata da Vita,

802
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,440
and they make it I've agata da pizza,

803
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,000
and the artist's not Iron Butterfly, but Italian pizza guy.

804
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,240
That's thoughtful.

805
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,440
Yeah, that's good.

806
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,680
They really went one step further with it.

807
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,360
And I love these album covers and they've always made me so happy.

808
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:53,880
And I've always thought they needed to exist in other...

809
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,680
It pains me that they stopped doing this in a certain era,

810
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,920
so you don't get any past 1990,

811
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,760
or there may never be a new one again.

812
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,240
And they stay with albums you might know,

813
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,160
and I always thought it needed to cut deeper.

814
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:07,880
So this is...

815
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,480
Mike, we just talked about you just resuscitated your Twitter account,

816
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,960
the topical genie from the Aladdin show at California Adventure.

817
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,400
You were doing that in 2010, 2011.

818
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:25,560
I had this idea about doing new Chuck E. Cheese album covers in 2008.

819
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,200
So I'm gonna show you a Photoshop that I made in 2008,

820
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,280
and I finally have a place for it.

821
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,920
I was just like, how about artsier album covers?

822
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,440
So let me show you this here.

823
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,400
This is Chuck E. Sane.

824
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,800
It's kind of...

825
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,880
It's an Aladdin Sane where he's Chuck E. as the Bowie stripe.

826
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,120
I'll post all this on Twitter.

827
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,520
It's a little scary, isn't it?

828
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,560
I would see a vaguely androgynous Chuck.

829
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,000
And I would have been like, you would have been like,

830
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,120
that was in the restaurant.

831
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,160
I've been like, oh yeah, yeah.

832
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,880
Yeah, I wasn't even trying to go too far beyond

833
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,160
what the kind of thing they would actually have.

834
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,160
This they probably wouldn't have because it's a little too sexualized.

835
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,720
But I was just thinking about the greatest album covers of all time.

836
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,640
There's the Cars, Candio.

837
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,160
And I've turned that into the Hens Pizza O.

838
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,280
We're looking at Helen in kind of a body stocking,

839
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,320
lying on top of a big slice of pizza.

840
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:17,880
Right, right.

841
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,440
Iconic.

842
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,760
And then this was this one I just made the other day

843
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,440
just to keep this trend going.

844
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,720
But here, because they never went metal.

845
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,400
So what I made is Pasqualica, Master of Pizzas.

846
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,720
And this is a graveyard with many pizzas

847
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,640
and the disembodied hands of the master, Pasquale.

848
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,960
So what I'm saying is I'm going to post these on the Twitter,

849
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:49,400
but I would there's lots of great artists out there listening to the show.

850
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,160
More of these, please.

851
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,880
I don't have a catchy name or a hashtag for it.

852
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,200
I mean, maybe it's just Chuckie covers, just hashtag Chuckie covers.

853
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,400
But I want to see more.

854
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:05,480
Like if our feed could be full of classic album covers or TV,

855
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,360
if you have a good Chuck Feld idea as well.

856
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,800
And this isn't a contest.

857
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,680
None of these assets have to be legally clearable.

858
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,120
Just send like, let's all share some Chuckie album covers

859
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,720
since they aren't making these things anymore.

860
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,400
Yeah, I was also going to say like, don't limit this to great artists.

861
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,920
If you suck, let's do it anyway.

862
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,000
Your first day of art.

863
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,320
Yeah, please.

864
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,520
Like we'll see any.

865
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,200
Yeah, actually, I perhaps might prefer the worst or the rough draft.

866
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,960
It doesn't matter.

867
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,440
Oh, yeah.

868
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,360
Let's get these moving.

869
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,320
Let's get a listicle.

870
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,960
Yeah, I recall seeing I recall seeing because they had like,

871
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,280
you know, they had the channels you would watch.

872
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,240
They would have TVs playing and it would just be a loop of entertainment.

873
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,680
Sometimes featuring a character named mouth or.

874
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,400
Oh, yeah.

875
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

876
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,240
I remember.

877
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,280
I remember mouth.

878
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,920
Very unpleasant, like fucking rocky horror mouth.

879
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:03,960
Yeah.

880
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,560
And I remember not caring for that video loop at all.

881
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,240
Because there were games around, there were big robots,

882
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,480
but there was this loop of comedy and then mouth.

883
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,520
A lot of tugging on your mom's leg.

884
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,640
Mommy, it's mouth.

885
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,480
Mommy, you want to go home?

886
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,200
It's mouth.

887
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,760
Did they play at the one I went to when I was a kid,

888
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,840
they played a lot of old Pink Panther cartoons.

889
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,640
That was like.

890
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,120
Interesting.

891
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,680
Something they would play between animatronic shows.

892
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,960
And that was that was probably the first time I would have seen those cartoons.

893
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,400
I guess they played cartoon.

894
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,800
They did play cartoons, but I don't have a memory of what they were.

895
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,480
But they would be breaks.

896
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,760
I remember in between.

897
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,080
Yeah.

898
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,080
Like their spot, their content.

899
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,880
Now it's music videos that they play between their content.

900
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,680
And it's like music videos that they seem to have licensed in the mid to late aughts.

901
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,760
Like at least 10 years ago, because.

902
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,280
Like real music videos.

903
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,080
Yeah, there's one I remember the last time I was there there.

904
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,880
Because they only have like 45 minutes worth of them.

905
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,200
And then it goes back to Vanessa Carlton, A Thousand Miles, which is a song from 2002.

906
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,320
Yeah, very old.

907
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,200
I was going to say Michelle Branch.

908
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:08,520
Yeah.

909
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,480
Vanessa Carlton.

910
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,440
I was going to say very similar.

911
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,120
Yeah, it was similar at the same time.

912
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:14,840
Yeah.

913
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,040
Who bestank the reason?

914
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:17,800
Is that in there?

915
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,480
That would probably line up.

916
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:20,920
Maybe.

917
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,480
Oh, at the movies?

918
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,160
The fun one?

919
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,800
Well, they did the smooth criminal cover too.

920
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,280
Well, yeah.

921
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,720
I don't remember at the movies.

922
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,160
Movies was the name of the song, I believe.

923
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,720
Oh, OK.

924
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,840
They were dressed like the Ghostbusters at it.

925
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,160
Yeah.

926
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,560
Sweet.

927
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,160
They would talk about going to the movies.

928
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,720
We had the best day dressing up like Ghostbusters.

929
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,800
Boy, being an alien at a farm is a dream.

930
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:49,880
Maybe they just didn't license music past bowling for soup at their peak.

931
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,600
Maybe they just used all his connections.

932
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,440
He's like, yeah, I know Vanessa Carlton.

933
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,280
I'll hook you up.

934
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,160
I'll hook you up.

935
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,320
That's what you get when you're in business with bowling for soup.

936
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,200
I was watching the Tonys a couple of weeks ago, and they're like,

937
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,160
coming up after the break, David Byrne and Vanessa Carlton.

938
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,280
And I'm like, what?

939
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,360
What is this combination?

940
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,520
And they were presenting an award.

941
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,760
The reason is David Byrne is doing a one-man thing on Broadway,

942
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:21,800
and Vanessa Carlton is taking over as Carole King in the Carole King music.

943
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,440
Wow, really?

944
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,240
That's kind of cool.

945
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:23,720
Yeah.

946
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,520
I should like that.

947
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,160
Good for her.

948
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,360
Good for her.

949
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,280
I kind of like A Thousand Miles.

950
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:28,920
I do too.

951
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,480
Yeah.

952
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,360
I'll also come out.

953
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,480
This is going back to, I shouldn't just be equating them, but Michelle Branch.

954
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,520
I like that.

955
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,440
I want to come out in favor of that Santana song.

956
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,320
The Game of Loves.

957
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,280
I was just about to say I like that song.

958
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,800
Pro Game of Loves.

959
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,400
I'm a big fan of that song as well.

960
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,440
A little bit of this.

961
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,160
Wah wah wah.

962
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,360
I think I'm an everywhere man myself.

963
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:49,960
Everywhere?

964
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,440
I think that other one is better.

965
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,480
You're into me.

966
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,360
But I'm all right with it.

967
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,160
I'm all right with it.

968
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,040
You guys ever have hit clips?

969
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,760
Wait, the sense familiar?

970
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,920
That's not the thing you got from McDonald's, is it?

971
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,440
They had them at McDonald's at one point,

972
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:09,480
but it was like a little tiny USB looking thing that you could plug into a fake boom box,

973
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,960
and it would play exactly one minute of a hit song.

974
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,480
It was only a minute.

975
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,760
I remember each one had one song, but I thought it was a full slam.

976
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,760
No, it was just a minute of a song.

977
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,680
And we would get, because my family couldn't afford the current ones,

978
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,520
we would get one minute of ABC by the Jackson 5.

979
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,960
They made vintage ones too.

980
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,680
And then Sugar Ray would be on sale, so we have those ones.

981
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,180
Sure.

982
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,160
Bad news, guys.

983
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,680
We're pricing it down.

984
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,920
They're going down to $149 from $209.

985
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:41,880
Wow.

986
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,800
These are the things that are going to make us, that already are making us sound old.

987
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,360
And they're so bizarre.

988
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,600
Our parents were pretty clean.

989
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,640
We used to have records.

990
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:59,960
We would download 45 second real player clips of songs from MTV.com.

991
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,720
You could listen to songs in CD quality.

992
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,680
No, no.

993
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,840
We had to listen to a scratchy clip.

994
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,200
Scratchy Lady Marmalade.

995
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,120
Boy, those are the days.

996
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,920
You were talking about the loops.

997
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,960
Oh yeah, I was just saying, I don't have a good memory of those.

998
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,520
I don't have any fondness for them in my brain.

999
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,520
I think there was just too much stuff I liked better, but a lot of it didn't stick with me.

1000
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,440
They are all on YouTube.

1001
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,440
There is so much, in talking about tackling a Chuck E. Cheese episode,

1002
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:42,200
I just had to ignore Giant Swaths of Stuff, because it would take full days to watch all

1003
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,600
of the material that's been archived on YouTube.

1004
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,520
It's a ton, and I would get no pleasure or enjoyment.

1005
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,720
That is almost any of it.

1006
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:56,120
Yeah, it's crazy to me how thorough the programming was at the restaurant,

1007
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:03,240
at its peak, where they would make a new hour-long show every single month for a long time.

1008
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:11,640
I guess this would have been post them reskinning the Rock of Fire explosion,

1009
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,800
but there was a while where there was a new show every single month,

1010
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,880
and then I think it went a seasonal show, and then it just was like eternal,

1011
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,560
just the same Vanessa Carlton music video.

1012
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:28,600
But they used to program new stuff all the time where they would play different songs,

1013
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:33,160
and then it was just, and the Rock of Fire explosion was doing the same thing when they

1014
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,080
were trying to stay in competition with each other.

1015
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:40,200
So there's all these long ass, it's archived on, I forget what the website is,

1016
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,760
but I think it's like a Rock of Fire explosion fan site,

1017
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:48,360
where there's a lot of the hour-long programs archived.

1018
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:56,120
It's that mixed media where this stuff has always been confusing, where sometimes it's puppets,

1019
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:00,280
and sometimes it is people in suits, and then sometimes it's footage of the robots who you're

1020
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,880
watching right there, but in other cases it's a robot like the Studio C Chuck doesn't look like

1021
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,040
the one that's on the screen, and that doesn't look like the one that's outside, because that's

1022
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:15,000
the Alvin and the Chipmunksified, the bowling for soup one. I swear there are

1023
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,480
vantage points you could have in a Chuck E. Cheese where you're looking at five different

1024
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,560
iterations of Chuck E. at once.

1025
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:26,520
There's a lot of cognitive dissonance for it. I must be confusing, I remember as a kid being

1026
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:33,080
like, wait a second, Chuck E. is there and moving, and then Chuck E. is also on stage,

1027
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,840
and then you just have to reconcile with that. I feel like that doesn't usually happen.

1028
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,240
In play, you're only supposed to see one character at a time.

1029
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,000
Yeah, Disney is very strict about that.

1030
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,720
That's a no-no. If you were taking a photo with Mickey and you saw him walk out of an exit,

1031
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,360
that would freak you out.

1032
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:54,920
Yeah, but Chuck E. Cheese, the second you walk in the door, you could be looking at three or four

1033
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,960
different media.

1034
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:03,560
He's on the screen as the puppet, he's a walk-around character, but there's a robot of him in the back.

1035
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:09,480
There's art of multiple kinds of him, and he'll be on a machine looking different than he does on

1036
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:09,880
the wall.

1037
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:15,480
He's also sitting in the little car ride nearby. There's so many of him.

1038
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:20,840
They could also show that there's a 40 years of Chuck E. thing they're showing now, which has

1039
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:26,120
all the old clips in it. Can you imagine how confusing that would be for you as a kid?

1040
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:34,040
There is a really good shirt that they were selling. If you get an XL

1041
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,320
t-shirt at Chuck E. Cheese, because they don't make them for adults, but that will about fit me.

1042
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,800
They had a great line of 40th anniversary merch. I got it all.

1043
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,480
Oh, really? Oh my God, I need to look this up. Is this on eBay? Can I look at this now?

1044
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:54,600
My favorite was a red t-shirt that said 40 years of Chuck E. and showed you every iteration of

1045
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,640
Chuck E. all the way up to 2017.

1046
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,760
So that's like 19 varieties.

1047
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,920
Back when he was still a rat, they changed his damn species.

1048
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,400
Oh, yeah.

1049
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,440
They literally define him as a mouse now.

1050
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,040
And that at the very opening of the company, I found this interesting.

1051
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:19,800
It was originally going to be called Coyote Pizza, and then Nolan Bushnell was informed the

1052
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:28,360
costume he bought was a rat, not a coyote. And his pitch for like, okay, we can fix this.

1053
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
The name now, it's going to be Rick Ratt's Pizza.

1054
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,960
Yeah, Rick Ratt.

1055
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:42,840
The company, the board went, no, no, it is not going to be Rick Ratt Pizza.

1056
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,000
Rick Ratt is so funny.

1057
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:52,760
He definitely had his eye on a different prize because the quote he says when asked about,

1058
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:58,840
why did you pick pizza to serve? He said, I chose pizza because of the wait time and the build

1059
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:06,680
schedule. Very few components and not too many ways to screw it up. Now that is a man who makes

1060
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,560
computer things talking about food.

1061
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,520
That's a programmer's approach to a restaurant.

1062
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,080
That is a normal way to talk about food.

1063
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,720
Little room for error. Very few bugs.

1064
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,520
Don't you think hot dogs would have been better?

1065
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:28,200
Well, so they did serve hot dogs for a little while. And in the infamous 1991 training videos,

1066
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:34,280
they show you how to make the hot dog, which is you take a sheet of tin foil, you wrap the

1067
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:39,880
bun in half the tin foil, then you put the hot dog on the other half, and then you put that on a pan

1068
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:46,360
and put it in the pizza oven. I have never seen a baked hot dog before. But then in the video,

1069
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:51,880
they very gingerly then put it in the bun and present it on a plate with one mustard,

1070
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:58,680
one ketchup, one relish, and a bag of Lay's. And it is a beautiful presentation of a hot dog and chips.

1071
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,520
Beautiful presentation.

1072
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,000
Ray has never uttered until this moment.

1073
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:08,360
Right now they're really pushing their salad bar, which I would not recommend.

1074
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:16,360
I would recommend the lunch buffet. They're trying to basically make it like a Panera bread

1075
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:23,080
with a dance floor where they have solid Wi-Fi now. They have coffee all day. They're putting

1076
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:27,240
in electrical outlets to encourage. I think that's the new soap opera sports room. It's like,

1077
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:33,080
oh, you can come here and do your stuff while your kids are losing their minds on the dance

1078
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:40,840
floor or whatever. But they have a daytime Monday through Friday open buffet for eight bucks.

1079
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,360
That's decent. The salad bar, don't touch it. Scary.

1080
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,120
Does the buffet have pizza in it then?

1081
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:53,640
Yeah. It's like pizza, cinnamon sticks. There's a couple different options. And then you get a

1082
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:58,360
drink with it and then you just refill until there's too many families there and you start

1083
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,240
to get uncomfortable. I shouldn't be here.

1084
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:07,080
But it did seem like on their earnings report or company history, they're trying to get

1085
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:12,760
adults without kids. They're trying to get that arrested development kind of older millennials.

1086
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,480
And remove the robots out of their minds?

1087
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,760
That's what I don't get.

1088
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:22,200
That's the reason an arrested development person would... Look, there's fucking lines for

1089
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:29,560
four hours to get into a brand new bar with a robot performing called Oga's Cantina. That

1090
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:35,720
should teach him something. Maybe just what they need to do is invest in better robots.

1091
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:42,280
I want to see Chuck and Munch and Pasquale and Helen and Jasper with all of the super hydraulics

1092
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,320
of Rex.

1093
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:48,520
So has anyone seen this 30 minute commercial for the endless salad bar?

1094
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,200
Yes, the ASMR video.

1095
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:55,800
Yes, it's a yoga ASMR kind of new age thing. And it's 30 minutes long.

1096
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,240
I am aghast. My mouth is wide open.

1097
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,760
Weird that companies are getting into ASMR now.

1098
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:08,600
Yeah, it's a couple years. So I'll play a couple... I watched a few minutes and honestly,

1099
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,280
I was like, well, kind of funny.

1100
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:10,840
It's cute.

1101
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,400
Yeah, it's kind of cute.

1102
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,120
Are you done crunching?

1103
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,480
Chuck E. Cheese.

1104
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,200
This is all of us tonight. We have the sound of sleep we've ever had.

1105
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,960
Listening to a peaceful voice talk about Chuck E. Cheese.

1106
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:46,600
They just switched the advertising company that they work with. So I think that they're

1107
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:51,640
trying to be like a fun brand now that will like, I don't know, what was the brand that

1108
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,880
threatened to commit suicide or something?

1109
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,600
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

1110
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,000
There was a brand that, yeah, said that they were going to...

1111
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,160
Stakehams is very online.

1112
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,120
Stakehams did something...

1113
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,480
Rebbes was talking to somebody.

1114
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,040
I think it was Sonny D.

1115
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:10,760
Sonny D. Yeah, Sonny D was like, I don't know how many more days I'm going to have like this.

1116
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,200
Yeah, Sonny D was like extremely depressed.

1117
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:20,600
Yeah, and Hostess was like, no, come on, we're here for you. And Wendy's... It's a dark world.

1118
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,400
Darkest timeline.

1119
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,360
Oh yeah, Sonny D said, I can't do this anymore.

1120
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:35,080
And Round Table Pizza wrote back, kill yourself.

1121

Everything, it's Crest replied.

1124
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,600
I hate...

1125
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:54,440
I like to imagine that as two people in the same office just like logging. They're in different

1126
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,400
hoot suite windows just tweeting each other.

1127
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,360
Just reading passwords.

1128
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,080
Uber eats at few occasions.

1129
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:02,120
Having a breakdown through brand accounts.

1130
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,080
Moon Pie replied.

1131
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,720
That's what I'm thinking of, that Moon Pie's got involved.

1132
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,560
Oh God.

1133
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,920
What's happening?

1134
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,160
Yeah.

1135
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:11,800
I don't know.

1136
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,080
I miss when it was robots instead of...

1137
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:18,040
Yeah.

1138
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:18,440
Snarky people.

1139
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:23,240
Bizarre live corporations yelling into our pockets.

1140
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:29,880
I appreciate that Chucky has remained fairly uncool consistently throughout the history.

1141
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:41,320
Yeah. Their attempt at cool was he skateboards and even then has a helmet and pads that restrict.

1142
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,760
He's such a nerd.

1143
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,280
He's so safe.

1144
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:51,560
Skateboarding in the very flat parking lot, like mile long parking lots that are next to Chucky

1145
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:51,960
Jesus.

1146
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,640
The most dangerous version of him was the grifter rat.

1147
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,120
The cigar chomping...

1148
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:58,840
The joysy.

1149
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,720
The cigar guy.

1150
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:00,840
The joysy rat.

1151
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,640
Yeah.

1152
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,800
Yeah. Ricky. What's his name?

1153
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,440
Rick Rat.

1154
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,000
Rick Rat.

1155
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,720
Yeah. That was a scary...

1156
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,560
Here I am, Chucky Cheese.

1157
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:18,680
I've realized that the voice of that early Chuck that I do is...

1158
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,360
Or that we were both doing...

1159
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,160
Is it Jay Leno?

1160
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:21,960
Yes.

1161
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:22,360
Yeah.

1162
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,480
Precisely.

1163
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:30,120
But then I was thinking about that and realizing there's some crossover there because think about

1164
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:39,320
it. He's like the entertainer traversing the country. Every little podunk town, he's there.

1165
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:44,920
He's entertaining people. Another guy comes along and it's thought that maybe they can

1166
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,400
coexist.

1167
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,440
Oh, right, right, right.

1168
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,760
And then he crushes the other one.

1169
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,240
Right.

1170
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,040
Sends him packing. He's not around anymore.

1171
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,400
Billy Bob just wasn't selling the pizzas.

1172
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,640
That's what it boils down to. He wasn't bringing in the numbers.

1173
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,400
Fats just wasn't as good of a bandleader as Munch.

1174
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:11,240
Chucky Cheese hiding in a closet to listen in on the unification talks.

1175
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,560
That's the way they had to rebrand him into this little child skateboarder mouse.

1176
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,600
He could not be an entertainment sleaze.

1177
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:25,400
But Billy Bob's a family guy. I wish him well. Do you want to put me on the marquee?

1178
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,480
I guess. All right, I guess. Okay, I'll do it.

1179
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,840
Yeah, I'll do it if you want me to come down. If you want, look, it's not up to me.

1180
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:31,640
I'm around here.

1181
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,400
I hadn't thought about it that they're exactly the same.

1182
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,320
They're this. Exactly the same.

1183
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,520
Equals Chucky.

1184
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:45,800
Real quick, back to the food. My sister was the only one in the family to ever have a birthday

1185
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:49,960
here. And it was a breakfast birthday because I think it was cheaper.

1186
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,400
It was a little cheaper because most kids did the same thing.

1187
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:01,800
I think one friend had a McDonald's birthday and it wasn't even at a McDonald's with a play place,

1188
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,560
which was insane. So you just went?

1189
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:10,120
Of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was still McDonald's. It's still the best place

1190
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:15,400
other than Chucky Cheese or Discovery Zone. But I was just going to say the breakfast was

1191
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,760
just French toast sticks.

1192
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:24,520
That doesn't sound bad. I'd rather, if I'm going to eat there, go with something they can't really

1193
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:28,840
get wrong. But was that just like cut a pizza with syrup on top?

1194
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:34,600
It was just, yeah, no cheese. It was just crust. Crust sugar.

1195
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:42,200
The salad bar prep videos from the 90s. There's a very funny moment in one of them where they're

1196
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:46,200
like, here's how you cut this and here's how long you can leave these out. And they're like,

1197
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:52,040
and don't forget the garnish. Use lots of kale around the containers as the garnish.

1198
00:55:52,920 --> 00:56:00,280
It's all these wilted looking vegetables and then giant stalks of kale, a food everyone now knows

1199
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:05,800
and has strong opinions on. But that was the most healthy thing was the garnish.

1200
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:11,000
It's all this kale. No one's eating it. It's just there for decoration.

1201
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,360
Love it.

1202
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:18,280
Also that garlic, they would brush everything with this garlic spread and the how to make it.

1203
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:27,880
It's like, take your jug of liquid margarine. If I walked into a friend's house now and was like,

1204
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:31,880
why do you have margarine in the fridge? I don't think I've ever met.

1205
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,960
I love the demos of how to put the costume on.

1206
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:36,920
Oh my God.

1207
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:42,280
You just watch a bunch of teenagers struggling with it. They're like, keep the head clean,

1208
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,320
which certainly has never happened. Clean with 409.

1209
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:48,920
Yeah, it was 409. I wrote down some of the instructions when we find them.

1210
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:52,600
Oh, great. I'm on the website looking at jobs.

1211
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,200
Please, by the end of the episode, you get hired. You do a virtual chat interview while we're talking.

1212
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,840
All right, she's a general manager.

1213
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:08,040
Oh, entertainment experience. That's great. Our middle name is entertainment.

1214
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:15,080
To clean Chucky, 409 or similar cleaner should be used on the face, hat or toes.

1215
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:21,960
Any upholstery cleaner like Woolite should be used on the fur. When you put Chucky away at night,

1216
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:27,480
spray a little disinfectant in the head to keep it fresh. Hands, vests and body can be machine

1217
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,480
washed in cold water at the lowest setting. Vests can be air dried.

1218
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:38,600
That never once happened. No one kept the head fresh for the next person to wear it.

1219
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:43,640
It was good that most of the stuff was machine washable, except at the very end of one video,

1220
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:51,560
they're like, Helen's dress must be dry clean only. Everything machine washable except this one piece.

1221
00:57:51,560 --> 00:58:00,760
Also, like putting a big mascot uniform in a washing machine. Could that keep it looking good?

1222
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:07,240
Like that's not a place for something like that. Yeah, I don't understand like where.

1223
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:12,040
What's a big enough. Whose job is that to do? Do they have them backstage? I'm guessing.

1224
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,040
Oh, yeah. Go to the laundromat.

1225
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:19,000
We're taking. I think it's laundromat. Yeah. And sit on top of the machine for a while.

1226
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,840
Insane. So in those same videos, in the 90s ones,

1227
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:28,920
the guy hosting them is a guy named Todd Horchner. And I watched a bunch of those.

1228
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:35,960
And then I watched a video from 2007 and I did a double take because the guy in the 2007 video,

1229
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:42,760
it says Todd Horchner. And I'm like, he looks 20 years younger. He looks younger in 2007.

1230
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:48,360
And then I found his LinkedIn. He was the head of training at Chuck E Cheese for 25 years.

1231
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:56,440
So he was a company man. He stuck it out and looked great in the 2000s. Now I think started

1232
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:02,040
his own consulting company. I got a little taste of Todd Horchner and Munch interacting.

1233
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:17,880
Oh, fine. That's that regular guy. Hey, Todd.

1234
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,720
Yeah, yeah. Just a loud man.

1235
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,600
What do you prefer, do you think, with Munch's character?

1236
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:26,120
I think I like loud man. I think so. I agree.

1237
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:30,760
Like you expect it's the first choice to go me want pizza, but.

1238
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,880
And that's still pretty grimacey too. Oh, yeah.

1239
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:37,320
Oh, yeah. You could go the other way where he's like dumb and slow.

1240
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:42,840
But yeah, I kind of like, yes, Todd, more information, please.

1241
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,720
You should voice Munch. Yeah, come on.

1242
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:54,040
That would be an achievement. Yes. How do I audition for that? Are you on a part of the

1243
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:58,680
website? Are they hiring for Munch right now? I was looking at jobs in Irving just to see,

1244
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:03,000
if there's any creative positions open. It looks like they're filled right now,

1245
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,920
but I'll wait it out. The first time I went to Chekichi, because I originally went

1246
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:15,240
as for a goofy piece I was writing when they first made that kind of tone deaf bizarre

1247
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:22,360
announcement that adults can go alone now. So I was like, all right, I'll go. And I went to

1248
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:29,560
one at the Eagle Rock Mall nearby, and that is a studio C, which I didn't even know what that

1249
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:37,000
meant then. The days of ignorance. I was a fool. But Obama was still president. It was wild. But

1250
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:45,160
I went and I met because I was, you know, like one of the it's mostly like nannies and kids

1251
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:52,360
and then me. And there was a guy there who was troubleshooting the arcade games because it

1252
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:56,680
wasn't super busy. And then he did a little bit of maintenance on the animatronic. And he was like,

1253
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:02,200
an older guy seemed very friendly. And then like spotted me alone. And like, you know, some clock

1254
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:06,760
me. I was like, Oh, what is going to happen? And then he just, he just left a fistful of tokens on

1255
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:12,280
the table. And he was so, and this was like right before they switched from tokens to play passes.

1256
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:18,440
So tokens were still 20 summer 2016. So I guess I was ready about this for a full year anyways.

1257
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:27,800
The the and then I ended up talking to him for a little bit and his job was to to do maintenance

1258
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:35,960
for every animatronic in like the bottom half of California. Like he there's so and he'd been he'd

1259
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:41,480
been working for Chuck E. Cheese for I want to say at least 15 but possibly longer. He had at one

1260
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:49,080
point been the manager of the Chuck E. Cheese in Vegas. And he was just like the stories I could

1261
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:56,520
tell you. And it was like, he is like, it was too much. I like he left the state. It was too much.

1262
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:02,680
And yeah, they allowed gambling at that one. I really want to go to the Chuck E. Cheese in Vegas.

1263
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:07,160
It's a little off the beaten path. So I didn't get to go. They should do like how they have that like

1264
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:13,560
Taco Bell Cantina. They should do a Chuck E. Cheese on the strip. Like with a bunch of fun,

1265
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:19,640
colorful drinks. Margaritas. Margaritas. No kids. And then the class in the classic and then like

1266
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:25,800
Rick Rad in there. Yeah, so fun. Maybe bring Rick Rad back. People would like that. Yeah, if this

1267
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:32,440
brand was smart at all, they would at least in one place like have a destination like old school,

1268
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:38,440
like using original assets, original videos. We know they have all of it. And it's Vegas is the

1269
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:44,040
place I think. Hell yeah. Vegas is the place for you. Taco Bell is like starting a hotel. Yeah, I see.

1270
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:51,800
Yeah, I'm down. Are you trying? I'm gonna try. I signed up for email notifications. How much is

1271
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:56,520
it? It's like a regular hotel reservation, right? Comparable to Palm Springs. It's like $2 a night.

1272
01:02:56,520 --> 01:03:03,240
$300 a night or something. Oh, that's a lot. Well, you know, put on a credit card, see what happens.

1273
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:08,680
Yeah, money isn't real. It gets paid for by someone. Actually, but it's in the middle of August.

1274
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:17,320
So that's off season for Palm Springs because it's technically so hot. So I guess you're paying a

1275
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:24,440
little bit of a premium for the pop-up aspect. Right. Yeah, but seeing like really good working

1276
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:30,840
animatronics is unlike Disney Universal is rare. They had, was it last year they had

1277
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:37,400
the Rockafire with Deadpool, which I was conflicted about. Yeah. But it was like, yeah, I mean,

1278
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:46,040
they only had two songs playing, but to see really well, like working, Billy Bob and Mitzi was there

1279
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:52,680
too. Yeah. But like then Deadpool, of course. But it was good. I was like, whoa. Like, so just if you

1280
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:57,480
saw like pristine Chuck E. Cheese characters, classic looking characters, that's going to

1281
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:03,640
trigger something in your child brain. But it's got to be originals and Chuck has to be in the hat.

1282
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:10,280
Bowler hat, vest, red. He has to be shady. You have to be suspicious of him. That's the fun. Cigar.

1283
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:17,000
He's poisoning his lungs. You have to feel unsafe around him. Yes. The Neil Hamburger style tuxedo,

1284
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:22,120
like wrinkled tuxedo. Yes. If he were a human man, you shouldn't trust him. You wouldn't want to

1285
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:27,240
spend time around him. That's the one I want. The Rockafire explosion. Also, they had like another

1286
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:34,200
weird encounter with like a questionable, but they did. They did something with CeeLo like during.

1287
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:40,280
Yeah. CeeLo. Right. Right. Right. Yeah. And they're in Keanu. The. Are they? The Kean

1288
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:45,960
Peele movie. I didn't know that. It's not much of it, but they're like in a warehouse with them.

1289
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:51,000
So. Gotcha. Well, they'll pop up in various things and there's been a couple of music videos,

1290
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,640
Mayor Hawthorne, one of my favorite guys, did a video with them. And it's never clear whether.

1291
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:59,560
I guess there's multiple ways you can either participate. You can get Aaron Fector involved,

1292
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:04,280
the inventor, or you can go to one of these places like in Mississippi where a guy is just

1293
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:10,600
keeping a perfect replica of one. Our friend Doug Jones went and had a very bizarre time.

1294
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:17,800
We talked about that in an episode, but. That's so cool. Yeah. So they're around,

1295
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:21,880
but so what's it? Well, maybe we should talk about that copyright thing. A lot of like if you watch

1296
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:26,600
the documentary, if you watch the documentary, the Rockfire Explosion explains all this. And

1297
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:33,480
there was also this really good podcast recently, Slate's Decoder Ring, the name of it. And they

1298
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:38,360
broke down a lot of this stuff. But so the the divide, we were starting to say Brock is the name

1299
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:44,120
of the guy. Robert Brock. Robert Brock, who was like going to he was like a holiday investor and

1300
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:49,480
he was going to open a bunch of Chuck E. Cheese's. Yeah. And Fector started getting

1301
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:55,400
ANSI to like get the contract and maybe have his own original band put in instead of Chuck E.

1302
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:59,320
Cheese because they were more experimental at the time. They'd have Dolly Dimples, the hippo lounge

1303
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:03,960
singer. There'd be weird other stuff. We don't even talk about the king. That's all we'll talk

1304
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:08,040
about. We still have that to get all that stuff to get at least read some descriptions of characters.

1305
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:16,360
Yeah, but yeah, but so the base history, Brock breaks off with Fector, makes a new place,

1306
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:23,480
show biz pizza place as opposed to Chuck E. Cheese pizza time theater. And these places end

1307
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:29,400
up in a bitter competition. Immediately gets sued. Yes. Right. Right. Yes. And it's like over two

1308
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:34,280
years of them in court before it's settled at the peak of both businesses. It's tons of money.

1309
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:40,440
Insane. And they would open down the street from each other. Yeah. It was, it was a war.

1310
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:45,240
And there was a solid two years where both businesses were turning a profit. And then,

1311
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:49,320
you know, that's stopped. Because they wore each other into the ground. They opened at an

1312
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:55,080
unsustainable pace and were suing each other. They both built each other up to just immediately

1313
01:06:55,080 --> 01:07:02,840
collapse because there was just hollow cores. So there was, it hit a breaking point where the only

1314
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:10,040
way is to propose a merger of the two businesses that were, that had been suing each other.

1315
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:14,520
So what's so strange is that Chuck E. Cheese was first show biz pizza ripped them off,

1316
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:18,680
but show biz pizza kind of swallowed Chuck E. Cheese. Yeah, they were in the better state

1317
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:25,000
financially when the merger happened. But Chuck E. Cheese had the brand recognition. So keeping

1318
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:31,000
the band made sense. And there was a time, a la Leno Conan, we tried to coexist.

1319
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:40,440
One can do the 10 slot and one could do 1130. And they, so there's ads where it's Billy Bob and

1320
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:44,760
yes. And you would go to the restaurant and not know which you were going to see.

1321
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:51,320
So an unbelievably confusing brand. But what an exciting time. That would have been so cool.

1322
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:55,320
You know, like you, I would be like, oh my God, it's like a different, it would be so,

1323
01:07:55,400 --> 01:08:01,400
it would be thrilling. Yeah. Yeah. Would there be just two show biz pizzas, like in the same half

1324
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:06,280
mile from each other? Maybe you went, but one would be Chuck and one would be because ours was show

1325
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:10,440
biz first. And then they obviously rebranded to Chuck E. Cheese. I don't remember. Do you guys know

1326
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:16,840
these yours was showbiz first? Yes. I don't, I don't ever remember the rock fire being in there.

1327
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:21,560
I never saw them. I don't think I ever saw them with them until like a decade ago. Yeah. Mine was

1328
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:27,960
a pizza time theater that had the other rooms. So it also had my, the one I grew up with had the

1329
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:35,320
King, the Elvis, the beach, Bowser's the musical and, and the Beagles, the dog Beatles. They all

1330
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:39,960
at various times were in my childhood. That's unbelievable. Jamie, do you remember? I'm trying

1331
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:48,440
to figure it out. I show, I show biz pizza closed forever a few months before I was born. So I

1332
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:54,680
definitely never went, but I'm trying to figure out if my location was ever, I don't know. Yeah.

1333
01:08:54,680 --> 01:09:01,880
I want to, okay. So mine was a show biz pizza in Brockton mass. A show biz pizza was at the

1334
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:08,200
West gate mall. They turned it into a Chuck E. Cheese. Oh, the area grew too violent. No more fun.

1335
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:13,640
Oh, that's what happened. It closes entirely. Yeah. I guess, well there's, yeah, one of my,

1336
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:18,040
like the, another childhood one of mine became part of a dead mall, the fall broke mall, which

1337
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:24,440
now is back together, but became an empty. Oh, thank God the mall is okay. Yeah. Did yours ever

1338
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:30,440
recover or is Brockton? West gate mall is, is yeah, no West gate mall is alive and well. My brother

1339
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:37,320
worked at FYE there until that closed. So my Chuck E. Cheese, I only remember Chuck E. Cheese there.

1340
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:42,680
I never remember show biz pizza, but for a while it was like a real catnip for me because two doors

1341
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:48,680
down was a comic book store. So like good report cards come around. I'm like, like a pig and shit.

1342
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:55,720
And then the comic store closes. Chuck E. Cheese keeps going. When I'm in high school, a different

1343
01:09:55,720 --> 01:10:02,040
better comic store opened there. And the day after my senior prom, you know, everyone's still hanging

1344
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:09,000
out. Like we too far away from the beach. We were like, what do we do? And that's some, some that

1345
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,920
weekend to the consensus. Let's go to Chuck E. Cheese. So we went to Chuck E. Cheese and this is,

1346
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:20,840
this was how cool I was. I was like, can I sneak away to the comic store for a little while? No,

1347
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:26,360
I probably shouldn't. Should I sneak away from my friends to go look at comic books? No, I'll just

1348
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:30,920
keep hanging out at Chuck E. Cheese. That's fine. So you didn't do it. I didn't do it. No. What a

1349
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:37,640
choice you face. What a choice. Yeah. So I had my eye on the prize. It was really like focused on

1350
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:43,560
high school graduation activities. I'm like, I got my driver's license. I guess I can come back

1351
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:51,320
to the comic store another day. I'm on the retro pizza zone boards right now. And there's someone

1352
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:56,920
who visited a lot of Chuck E. Cheese's in the early 2000s and writes a very depressing description

1353
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:03,400
of my Chuck E. Cheese in its last. This is not how I remembered it, but I'm sure this was an adult and

1354
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:09,960
they had a more objective perspective. But they said, I visited once in October 2002,

1355
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:15,720
Brockton. It was very, it was a part of a mall. It was very tiny. To say the least,

1356
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:20,200
my mom was worried about driving to this particular location because Brockton was not a town she was

1357
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:26,760
familiar with. And she said it was considered a tough city. I visited and was disappointed in the

1358
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:32,200
store size, the condition of the show, a two stage so tiny that the characters were crammed together

1359
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:38,360
literally on top. That is true. Munch was almost dead except for a slow head twitch. Helen's mouth

1360
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:46,200
was shut and her eyes were closed. Jasper's back head was on the stage with his hat dangling off

1361
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:52,920
and Pasquale only moved his mouth. So I guess it died a really slow death.

1362
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:59,000
Pasquale had signed a document saying unplug me if I, my wish is to not be kept alive.

1363
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:05,720
Is there a good resource for all the Chuck E. Cheese's that you're looking at?

1364
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:11,880
I'm just on the retro pizza zone message board. So I don't know if there is like a pizza zone.

1365
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:15,960
I think that that's the website that does most of the archival stuff of the old shows and stuff

1366
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:20,360
like that though. I think that this is about as close as it gets. I think I had searched that site

1367
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:27,800
to find out that the Northridge location was a pizza tie or as they say, like yes, Northridge

1368
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:33,320
was a PTT and it became a phase three. Like there's all this crazy terminology, which I'm

1369
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:39,960
happy to know now. I'm sorry about the decay, but in your mind, none of that's true. They're all

1370
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:46,520
more alive than ever and a child's brain processes trauma in wild ways. And I remember it being,

1371
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:53,400
you know, a little small, but beautiful describing a town in Brockton, Massachusetts as a tough town.

1372
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:59,160
I just imagine like whitey bulger waiting at the city limits. Like you're coming into my town.

1373
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:04,600
I beat up the Chuck E. Cheese. Be careful. Brockton mass rules. People are the haters.

1374
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:10,920
They're just, they're just upset. Yeah. Retro pizza zone is called the city of champions.

1375
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:16,520
Rocky Marciano is from there. Wow. Yeah. We got a 50 foot bronze statue.

1376
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:24,760
The 50 foot Marilamon row and pump spring. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a long distance relationship,

1377
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:29,560
but they make it work. Yeah. Ups and downs, ups and downs.

1378
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:37,800
So the two chains are coexisting, but at a certain point it comes to a head and there can only be one

1379
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:44,360
and partially because they own the copyright to the Chuck E. Cheese characters, but not to

1380
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:50,920
the rock of fire. And they offer Aaron Fecter a deal, which is let us take, let us take the

1381
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:58,040
characters because there's no other plan and we give, we'll give you nothing for it. And at least

1382
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:04,600
that's how he describes it. And he was, he just thought it was a raw deal and that he was going

1383
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:09,400
to do something else with the characters to keep them alive and that they would have a life in

1384
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:17,560
movies or TV. And so he said no, which just led to that all of the rock of fires were dismantled

1385
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:23,640
and turned into munches make believe band because they, because they were not, they were still the

1386
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:30,440
pizza time players. Right. Right. Right. Phase three as my store was described is when they

1387
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:35,720
became full bodies, no longer in the frames and all of the characters. So like Fats Geronimo is

1388
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:42,840
at the keyboard. He was stripped of his gorilla pair and turned into munch. And Mitzi becomes

1389
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:49,000
Helen, which is a really disturbing one because she's like, she's got like breasts. It's weird.

1390
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:54,600
Like when they, when they strip her down, like, like the skeletal version is really bizarre.

1391
01:14:54,600 --> 01:15:01,080
It is very, cause it cuts off after the titties. It just is like titties and then skeleton.

1392
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:08,520
It's very, very jarring to look at. It's somebody's like really bizarre erotic art. I do feel like

1393
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:14,600
there are like nipples too. I think they like for some reason, like, or at least very pointy breasts.

1394
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:20,680
Sure. Yes. You're just like, what, who you can, I have a guess at the gender of the designer.

1395
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:25,720
It is insane. A lot of body horror themes on the show.

1396
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:31,640
Yeah. Will Smith, Jeannie. What is the, what is phase five?

1397
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:37,640
I don't know offhand. Cause I'm, I was phase five. Yeah. I was phase.

1398
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,160
You're all about to witness a great becoming.

1399
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:49,400
In phase five, they all like on fire. Yeah. In phase five. I show you my true form.

1400
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:55,240
Yeah. Streamwood was, was the one on Barrington road. Streamwood.

1401
01:15:55,240 --> 01:16:02,920
Yeah. That's the town. What a weird town. That sounds like a one season Fox show about a town

1402
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:09,720
with a lot of secrets. Wait, phase five circles of light. Do you know what that means? No,

1403
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:14,120
that sounds like Chuck E. Cheese kills God. Like that sounds like.

1404
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:23,640
Me now. I got the pan. I got to figure this out. What does that mean? Circles of light phase five.

1405
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:28,440
I think I've seen like a lot of light shows that like, I don't know why they think like, yeah,

1406
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:33,640
kids want, want dance floors and light shows. It's like kids always like robot, like robots

1407
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:38,920
haven't gone out of fashion. I don't know. I think the kid that the consensus was with like,

1408
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:45,720
it sounds like they thought that the robots that were there were scary to kids and which is like,

1409
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:51,720
not unreasonable. And that it would have been too expensive to replace them with better robots.

1410
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:55,960
Sure. That's probably right. I was more scared of the walk around characters,

1411
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:00,920
but I'm wondering how much ground did they lose in the late nineties to laser tag slash go kart

1412
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:06,840
places? Oh, that's a good point. I don't know. There's, I've heard Nolan Bush now that he did

1413
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:11,560
an episode of, it was like a business podcast. Oh, is that how I made this? I think it's called

1414
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:19,800
or I don't know why I have a lot of money. No, he's, he's with, he's with us. Okay. I think this

1415
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:25,560
came out like last year, but I think his, if I'm remembering correctly, it was his working theory

1416
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:32,120
that like the business slowed down because they were banking on people coming back to the restaurant

1417
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:37,960
very frequently when people would only come like a few times a year for report cards. And so they

1418
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:42,120
ended up losing money when they weren't making a new show every month. Cause people would be like,

1419
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:47,960
well, I already know what that is. I'm not going to go. And so like when they couldn't like keep up

1420
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:53,160
the hype of like, it's just not a place you would go every week. So then they started to lose steam

1421
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:58,600
or that's his theory. That happened. There was just an article about that. The San Gabriel valley,

1422
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:03,000
where there's a lot of, uh, uh, Chinese, like Chinese food restaurants that have been there

1423
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:10,760
forever. Um, these massive dim sum places could not keep up because they were, it was, it was places

1424
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:17,880
where large, uh, weddings or, or birthday, large parties was the core of their business. But then

1425
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:23,320
like middle of the week, people aren't throwing events of that size. So then having to keep that

1426
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:28,760
much like food and different kinds of meat on stock, like operating costs just add up.

1427
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:35,080
Right. Yeah. It's just an occasion place. So they have not yet cracked having young

1428
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:41,240
professionals go work there on laptops and only get coffee. They'll get there and then they'll

1429
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:47,560
rue the day they got rid of the robots. I'm hoping they're still in Pasadena. I went to the Pasadena

1430
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:54,280
one. They have a beautiful full band still operational. I went on my birthday in 2017,

1431
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:59,880
but I don't know if it's still there. Here's my, I'm not totally sure. My pitch for that is maybe

1432
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:07,000
like if you want to have us go during the day, you change Chuckie's clothes, give him, I know

1433
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:13,640
it's going to be a similar face, but at least give us a bowler hat and a vest and we'll fuck,

1434
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:19,800
we're idiots. We'll go right up there and see it. Why do we like the bowler hat? Uh, it's cause we

1435
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:24,680
saw it when we were kids. That's all it is. I mean, mostly, but I think also it's a more interesting

1436
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:29,480
feeling like old timey choice, which is always, I just respect Laudville. So that's why I like it.

1437
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:35,880
I mean, that's where it all goes back to that. You know, everything's an acceptable answer.

1438
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:40,040
I have phase five here, but that's like really what the newer version is called. So I guess

1439
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:44,360
they're just saying that they're that it's rock and roll Chuckie at my stream would Barrington

1440
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:49,640
road Chuckie cheese. Sorry to hear that. Sorry for your loss. Do we know what were the last place

1441
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:54,840
to have bowler hat Chuck was? I don't think we know that. I don't know. Could there be one

1442
01:19:55,480 --> 01:20:01,240
in America that like kind of, they just ignored what they were supposed to do and they forgot

1443
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:07,800
existed that does have bowler hat Chuckie cheese. There's gotta be some like rogue locations that

1444
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:13,080
have just been forgotten even to the company. Why would we throw this out? It works. Why would we

1445
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:16,840
throw it away? Cause that's all these unification, all these training. They were like,

1446
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:25,160
if it's bad, throw it in the garbage. Right. It's a very, very early nineties world of plenty sort

1447
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:30,120
of field. And they're not really thinking about reduce reuse recycle back then. No. At the very

1448
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:35,160
least there would be maybe the old suit lying around somewhere in someone's back of their

1449
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:41,080
restaurant. Yeah. Maybe international. There's, there's a lot of them international in Australia.

1450
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:49,880
His name is Charlie cheese because they did not like the, uh, the, uh, colloquial, uh, version of

1451
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:56,200
vomiting down the Chuck. That's more strongly there. More strongly. So they will throw up cheese.

1452
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:03,080
We'd be remiss if we didn't talk a little about the full name, which is Charles entertainment.

1453
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:07,480
Geez. Right. Uh, facts that apparently people did not really know. And it sort of like caught

1454
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:12,520
internet fire a couple of years ago. Yeah. It was a hashtag viral story,

1455
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:17,320
which they check. He cheese manages to do that every once in a while, which is another thing.

1456
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:22,120
I think they're cluelessness with their own audience and that like all of the interest with

1457
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:29,240
this place is like be semi ironic people in their thirties. Uh, uh, like how most, you know,

1458
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:36,600
fucking marshals doesn't have stories, uh, going viral, uh, once a year, twice a year

1459
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:41,640
in marshals is dreams. They're going to have to start threatening to kill themselves.

1460
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:46,600
Like all the other cool brands every now and then I see a post about marshals and it's like,

1461
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:53,080
look how old these truffles are, like, look how old these perishables are. I love, I love it.

1462
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:58,760
Now it's so bad. Now that it's like, it's just so much exhaustion with like brands trying to be

1463
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:04,040
cool that when you just see them like blowing it, you're like, awesome. Like, great. That's

1464
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:09,720
what you've been doing. You're supposed to do that. Show me a listicle about like bowls. I don't care.

1465
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:19,320
I, um, wait, what does the other middle name too that we haven't, uh, or the full name, uh,

1466
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:23,640
which is even more delightful to me than Charles entertainment cheese, the squally pea pie plate.

1467
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:31,160
Yes. And it's, but then also his origin is that Chuckie discovered him in the kitchen playing

1468
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:37,160
drums on pie plates. So there's both those things. His last name is pie plates, but also

1469
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:44,040
he was playing drums on the pie plates. So it's a little cloudy maybe. Oh, can it be, but also it

1470
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:49,240
could be, but it is both on that has, that is Canon. So it's both, but I forgot this whole thing.

1471
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:56,200
I just found, did you guys catch the pretty recent backstory of Chuckie cheese? Like another, maybe

1472
01:22:56,200 --> 01:23:01,080
related to what you talked about, but like I read this whole book that they recently put out

1473
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:07,560
about how Chuckie was an orphan mouse who he lived in an orphanage and he would sing and he was sad

1474
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:13,000
because, because he was an orphan, nobody, he, his favorite song was happy birthday. He was Oliver

1475
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:19,080
twist. No, his own birthday. So nobody could ever say, I did not come across this for him. Uh,

1476
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:24,760
but he taught himself to sing and every birthday was his favorite song. And he moved, he, okay.

1477
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:31,560
Very, very important information. He was very good at singing and also got really good at Pong and

1478
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:40,600
he won $50 in a Pong contest at the orphanage. And that was enough for him to catch a bus to go,

1479
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:47,720
start residing in New York city. Why didn't he just sneak into a pipe in the bus? Because he is

1480
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:54,440
a mouse. I couldn't tell you he knew, but he paid, he's a good boy. He paid the ticket $50. He went

1481
01:23:54,440 --> 01:24:01,640
and lived. He also really liked pizza. So he went to live above the squalies, pizzeria, and then

1482
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:06,680
showed up. Like was, he was caught in the kitchen and Pascual was going to like get him, like kill

1483
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:12,680
him. And then he started singing and he thought, Oh, that's well, I shouldn't kill a singing mouse.

1484
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:19,080
So then he, I feel crazy saying, but I swear they put this out. Where is this? Where is this?

1485
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:24,360
What is this book? I'm trying to find it. Chuck E. Cheese Pascualy backstory. I love this.

1486
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:31,560
Also wait, I'm sorry. I missed something big. He grew up at St. Marinara's orphanage.

1487
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:38,920
That's good. I like that. Also this is the business insider, the website where I found this,

1488
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:42,600
makes the point of the book has no author.

1489
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:52,520
Um, well he, he gave it to us. The book has no author. He's just passed down. Yeah. Yeah.

1490
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:56,760
Um, but squalie was so shocked that he dropped his rolling pin. A mouse that can sing in my

1491
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:03,080
restaurant is saved. I'm gonna make you a star. So he set up a restaurant, immediately called it

1492
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:07,800
Chuck E. Cheese's. Right. It was just Pascual's pizza place. He's like, nevermind. It's Chuck E.

1493
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:12,120
Cheese's now. And everybody like big grand opening. Everybody comes see the singing mouse.

1494
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:17,720
He'd never sung in front of a crowd before. So he buckled everybody booed and left.

1495
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:23,480
This is like M and M in eight mile. Yeah. The first time he tries to battle rap.

1496
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:27,720
I mean that, I wish they kept modernizing it because we could have had a post-grips that

1497
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:35,880
Chuck mile. Yeah. Somebody make that please. Um, and it's in his case, it is pizza sauce,

1498
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:42,920
not mom's spaghetti. Right. No, no, I would say it's no spaghetti is available. But anyway,

1499
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:46,600
people started leaving. They changed the name of Pascual. He changed the name of the restaurant

1500
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:52,600
to be his name. Everybody left boo. And then what, and then he like noticed a kid and started

1501
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:57,400
singing happy birthday to him late. And then everybody filed back in. It was like, ah, cool.

1502
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:02,280
Let's stay here. Right. So Chuck fucked up. He didn't do, but this is a whole other.

1503
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:08,440
Chuckie cheese clearly different than Rick rat. Rick rat. Yeah. 200 year old mutant.

1504
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:13,640
Well, yeah. Abuses his talent. This child sweet Chuckie is that's the new,

1505
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:18,520
yeah. That's the new origin of Chuckie essentially. Yeah. That's from like five years ago.

1506
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:25,160
Right. Wow. I like, yeah, that there's some sort of like Chuckie, maybe like Rick rat died in some

1507
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:31,400
like freak accident and Chuckie saw his opportunity to like really sure. He took his name.

1508
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:37,080
John Draper, Dick Whitman. Yeah. Rick rat is the Dick Whitman character.

1509
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:45,000
Or no other way around. Yeah. Yeah. Rick rat is. Oh, we're saying he stole the story of any

1510
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,960
invented this bullshits story. The cat or whatever is the brother who's like, it's you,

1511
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:55,480
you're Rick rat. It's like, I don't know. Forget about it. Here's $10,000. Here's $10,000.

1512
01:26:56,360 --> 01:27:02,280
Crusty the cat hangs himself in his flop house. That's why he didn't keep being in the band.

1513
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:07,560
Yeah. This is a dark re-imagined. Like if this was a movie, it would be just called Chuck.

1514
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:15,160
Yeah. Why is, and maybe somebody found this and I didn't, has there ever been talk of a real TV

1515
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:22,040
show or movie? Cause there's those that we watch that directed DVD or directed VHS. There's a

1516
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:26,840
couple of those. A Chuck E Cheese in the Galaxy. From like what, from what like years?

1517
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:37,160
There is a movie from 1999. Oh. That is entirely digital environments. That's also about an orphan

1518
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:43,000
and Chuck needs to do a race in outer space to pay for. I'm trying to remember.

1519
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,840
I remember. Medicine.

1520
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:45,400
What? Sauce?

1521
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:48,840
This guy is really sick.

1522
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:54,200
We're going to give you a transfusion. Put sauce in your body.

1523
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:59,240
The healthcare system's fucked up. We need to raise money and a race.

1524
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:02,840
But so there, I mean, you're, well, you're proposing here, say what you were saying and I will

1525
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:06,200
ready my material about Chuck and the, your Chuck E Cheese in the Galaxy.

1526
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:09,080
Okay. Yeah. Okay. Good. Good. Yeah. Cause I'm basically like.

1527
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:10,440
Longest episode ever.

1528
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:15,400
There is so much content still being produced and we'll get to that. Maybe that's the last thing.

1529
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:16,440
Sure. Yeah. We'll start driving.

1530
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:21,800
As I found, I'll tease it now. I found a new and maybe you've, there's an album

1531
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:28,280
worth of songs made in the last few years. A full, I have it on, I put on Apple music.

1532
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:34,600
It's a free download off of their YouTube. And there's others, other music videos and stuff

1533
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:40,120
of things that I'm also fascinated with. But for some, for a company that makes so much content

1534
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:45,960
and for a character that so many people know and is easily identifiable, why would they never

1535
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:52,520
have attempted to make a real TV show or a real movie? I mean, it's honestly, you just shit it out

1536
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:58,040
like the Sonic movie or Alvin and the Chipmunks. Like who cares if it's good or not? Like I would,

1537
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:04,200
I'm surprised that it's never happened. I think in the nineties, there was for a very

1538
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:11,800
brief period and even if you could work around it, you get away with it. There was the idea of

1539
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:17,640
shame in children's that are like, well, we can't, it can't be a commercial on the other hands.

1540
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:22,840
So Mac and me. Yeah. Mac and me and Mac tonight. And it's all this fucking annoyed,

1541
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:26,280
like all this fucking kids. Oh yeah. There's video games. Yeah. Right. There's video.

1542
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:32,360
And there's, there's Chucky cheese video games as well. There's a we Chucky cheese game,

1543
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:38,440
which we have to find somewhere and play. I watch a little of it. It's kind of like you're in the

1544
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:43,560
play room. Like, and then there's mini games and like, it's just Chuck and Munch and kind of basic.

1545
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:49,320
Yeah. But fun. They did one. Yeah. Before you pull out the music stuff, there's one thing.

1546
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:57,800
There's like a weird fact about Robert Brock, who we mentioned earlier. So Robert Brock has,

1547
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:02,680
there is a lasting impression that if you drive around any like major area with

1548
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:10,440
office parks, Robert Brock is there present there because as we said, he was a holiday in franchisee.

1549
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:16,760
He was like a business guy. Franchising things was his business. One of his business was the

1550
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:23,800
residence line of hotels that was bought and is now residents in by Marriott. So you see like any

1551
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:30,120
extended stay hotel, like he was one of the first guys doing that. If you see residents in by

1552
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:39,160
Marriott, that's Robert Brock. His body's very nice. I hope he's burning in hell. He started a war.

1553
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:44,680
Well, you're an extended stay, you're an extended stay person. Yes. Exceded stay suites. You don't

1554
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:50,920
like residents by Marriott. Brand loyalty. Yeah. Let me jam through my material on Galaxy 5000.

1555
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:57,000
It's just two quick clips. Really this film is kind of a proto speed racer. It's a race and it's

1556
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:08,120
all digital environments. But with the component of there's some romance in this film. There is,

1557
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:14,600
so all of the characters that we know, except Pasquale is a human being in this very disturbingly,

1558
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:20,680
but the rest are all mascots and their mouths do move. And so- Well, like a human man, no head?

1559
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:27,560
Yeah. He's just a guy with a mustache. Oh, I hate that. He looks like Captain Lu playing Mario.

1560
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:32,760
Right? Exactly. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So it's all really strange and disturbing. They're getting

1561
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:40,280
ready for a race and there is, they go to space and find a human woman who wants to mount Chucky

1562
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:48,120
very badly. And there's a lot of weird like, like Chuck and Jasper eyeing this, this woman as, you

1563
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:53,800
know, as she stays away and like, like, you know, she bends over and picks up a handkerchief and

1564
01:31:53,800 --> 01:32:01,240
they like, eh. Where is this available? YouTube porn. I think it was a prize. I think is what

1565
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:06,680
how you were originally giving it away. Cool. Yes. It would know we've got enough tickets. You

1566
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:10,600
could watch Jasper awful. A human. It was playing in the dad room.

1567
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:16,120
On Galaxy 5000, uncut in the dad room.

1568
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:24,440
Okay, guys, make sure your dumb wife's not around. There's a tastefully cut one in the mom room.

1569
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:29,800
Yeah. Very fade to black. Yeah. Leave it to the imagination.

1570
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:39,160
It's almost sexier that way. But the Chuck impression that I do is very much from this

1571
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:44,040
and this interaction where the human woman is making Helen very jealous.

1572
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:48,360
Bye, Chuckie. I was going to see if you'd come to the soda shop with me after the

1573
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:54,840
qualifier tomorrow, but I didn't know that you were taken. Oh, you mean Helen?

1574
01:32:56,440 --> 01:33:00,920
She's just a friend. You know, she's like one of the guys. Right, Helen?

1575
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:12,040
She hates that. Oh, that is so many different levels of what is that background contacted me.

1576
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:19,640
I really should have prepared you for this. Yeah, she thinks that they're dating. This is

1577
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:26,200
oddly akin to Mickey Minnie Kermit Miss Piggy, though the terms are unclear and the woman seems

1578
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:30,920
to want to be in the relationship much more than the man. But that's like Chuck doesn't even

1579
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:36,120
isn't remotely aware that they're an item. No. And it's just right in front of her like,

1580
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:43,160
yeah, look at that ass. And but then cut to later, I'm doing everyone a favor by only playing these

1581
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:47,480
things. These are kind of the only entertaining things in the Galaxy 5000. But then there's a

1582
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:54,200
song where you get to go to the aforementioned soda shop, which is a giant space dome. And from

1583
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:59,240
there, Helen sings a song venting her frustrations. And here's here's a little taste of that.

1584
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:16,200
Could you say that I'm just one of the guys?

1585
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:33,800
This is her hopelessly devoted to you. Oh, very much. Oh, absolutely. That's totally what it is.

1586
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:39,000
Oh, my God. Could you say that I'm just one of the guys?

1587
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,800
Oh, I love that. What is that change? What is that key change?

1588
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:52,200
The phrasing is the phrasing. Let's let's bectal test this.

1589
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:58,280
There's not another woman for her to talk to. Well, I guess there's human women. Yeah, they're

1590
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:03,320
fighting about a man record. Now that I know this exists, I'll do a full watch and report back.

1591
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:06,760
If it does, you know, it's a flawed metric. It's not perfect.

1592
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:15,640
Yes, the pining for and during that song, she's on top of a space dome watching Chuck fix so

1593
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:22,440
strangely proportioned computer car. She doesn't even like come to bed with her or whatever. She's

1594
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:32,440
just like, I got to work in the car. Well, Jay Leno parallels. Oh, no, poor Mavis singing this.

1595
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:41,320
Great. Maybe it's just watching this YouTube video every day. Why does he hang out with Kevin

1596
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:55,960
instead of me? So on board for a Mavis music. I want to touch his tonight show money. He says I

1597
01:35:55,960 --> 01:36:05,640
can't. I know as my college commencement speaker. His whole speech was Jay's top 10 Hollywood tips.

1598
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:17,960
It was a list. Oh, flagrant. That's insane. That's so great, though. That's the only way that this

1599
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:25,640
parallel doesn't work is that Chuck didn't like rip off all of his material. But Rockefeller was

1600
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:31,080
the rip off. But you might say they kind of did the more like creative kind of like that's what

1601
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:35,240
the crazier stuff like we are really a fan. We haven't taught. We haven't talked about that,

1602
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:40,760
that there are there's the community that thinks it's blasphemous when we say and I like the

1603
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:44,520
Rockefeller characters, but I have much more affection for Chuck E. Cheese. But I think that

1604
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:50,760
is a really aggressive statement to some fans of Rockefeller who were like there were by far the

1605
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:56,920
better band. Yeah, band wise, people really stand. Yes. Well, I think that that was Aaron

1606
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:02,120
factors fault, though, wasn't it? Because he was he like he had like an opportunity to include them.

1607
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:08,680
But then, like I do remember some this might have been in the documentary, but he said something like

1608
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:14,120
but I saw such potential in that, like he valued the IP over the invention. And that was like his

1609
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:22,040
fatal mistake is these are going to be movies. So he had I do this and then there were no,

1610
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:26,040
no, they just I mean, the reason I value one over the other is just because I know them. I never

1611
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:31,880
get to really see the Rockefeller explosion. Videos don't really tell you everything as Doug

1612
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:37,560
himself tells us. You had to have seen it. You had to be there and he to go see the band had to drive

1613
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:42,760
to Mr. Rural Mississippi. That's amazing, which I guess we all need to do. I guess we need to do it.

1614
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:48,280
Have but I know I think I might I might agree. I might like them more. I just didn't have them

1615
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:52,600
around. They weren't there for me the way Chuck and Pasquale were. Yes, I agree. Yes. And there

1616
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:57,320
wasn't a purple character, which I always like. I do. I do like purple. Although, yeah, fat seems

1617
01:37:57,320 --> 01:38:02,520
cool to that was probably cool in this slate podcast that just came out. Aaron Vector himself

1618
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:07,960
is comparing the two and he says something like it's it truly is like, you know, because they're

1619
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:14,760
similar bands. But to me, you'd have to be a just, you know, total dumb, dummy idiot to think that

1620
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:20,200
the Chuck band is better. But I don't know. I guess he's like really he's yeah, he thinks you

1621
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:26,040
are a moron if you like Munch's make a band more. I like that there's a Beatles Stones thing about

1622
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:31,960
them. Yeah, like which it's a very much an individual or reflection of you more so than

1623
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:40,760
and apparently far in the distance, an MC five. Oh, yeah. In its own little ecosystem. Strangely,

1624
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:46,600
like the little cult one. Yeah. That, you know, it's like I'm more off the beaten path. Sure.

1625
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:52,600
Those line up exactly. Yeah. Yeah. What do you got, Mike? Because we're at risk of a three.

1626
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:57,400
Oh, yeah. I mean, there's let me zoom through here because so there's a lot of modern stuff.

1627
01:38:57,400 --> 01:39:03,640
We'll post we'll post photos. I do want to talk a little bit more about like Sally Sashay, but

1628
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:08,520
that's OK. I mean, you can look her up and we'll do a full character study of Sally Sashay later.

1629
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:14,360
She's the skunk. You know what? I'll read her bio. I'm not. I'm just saying let's be done before.

1630
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:19,720
Yeah, that's fair. No, I understand. She was often. She was often. She was often called the

1631
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:24,200
beauty from Biloxi and she was also dubbed the disco skunk. The character often

1632
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:31,560
was. Character often poked fun at her perfume and and she was confused at how someone who would

1633
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:37,000
make your ears feel so good but can make your nose feel so bad. Sally was rather sassy and wouldn't

1634
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,960
bite back at Chuck E. Cheese's insults and defend her singing. Again, this is what I'm saying. Why

1635
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:47,880
isn't Sally Sashay in the mix now? I was like, I feel like she's the more complex female character.

1636
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:53,720
I completely agree. She sounds like she's got more agency than than Helen. Yes, poor Helen.

1637
01:39:54,840 --> 01:40:05,160
How could you say I have no agency? It's more like Mae West kind of like. Yeah, Madame Oink,

1638
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:12,840
the piggy from Paris. She was a guest star. She was sultry and spoke in a thick French accent.

1639
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:19,000
She was in the frame, right? Yes. Yeah. Also apparently Jasper flirted heavily with all of

1640
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:26,840
these. Yes, that's yes. Foxy Colleen, the Irish lassie. The Irish lassie, yeah. She was in multiple

1641
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:32,520
show tapes. She was sweet in nature and was known for singing traditional Irish folk songs.

1642
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:40,200
This is this is so much erasure taking place. All the all the all the male

1643
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:46,120
male band members get to stay. Yes, it's true. I guess that that's a point against the Rockafire

1644
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:52,280
explosion. If they retrofitted everything, it seems like Chuck E. Cheese's had a wealth of female

1645
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:59,640
characters to pull from, but only one robot with titties. Is that why they had to pick Helen?

1646
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:04,680
Oh, maybe it's a practical. It's a practical reason. Yeah. Yeah, maybe because there were not

1647
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:11,640
like female robot bodies. But the original Helen, if you look up on one of these sites,

1648
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:17,960
now I understand the name. Helen Henney was clearly supposed to be a play on Helen Reddy,

1649
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:24,280
because she was a she was a real like folk singer. She was like much like much skinnier and like long

1650
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:30,920
hippie hair. So she may have been like more of a Joan Baez or something. I don't know. I don't know

1651
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:37,000
what she was like and what she sang about, but I think she may have been a little more like thoughtful,

1652
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:41,960
poetic. That was the idea. She was a feel like Joni Mitchell or something. Yeah, I think so.

1653
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:46,920
And there was that one summer where Helen sang the It Don't Worry Me song from the end of Nashville

1654
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:57,000
and everyone's screaming about who fired the gun. God. I would like to, I would love to program.

1655
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,040
I will say I do know that reference. I know exactly what you're talking about. I know you do.

1656
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:05,480
I would love to program the Chuck E. Cheese robots to sing the songs from Nash,

1657
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:10,680
from Robert Altman's Nashville. You bought the band. If I bought the band. Side note really fast,

1658
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:16,040
also these are robots that never got built who got left behind. Because clearly Helen,

1659
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:20,440
if Helen Henney was a parody of Helen Reddy, I think they were going to make that more of a

1660
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:26,120
thing that the guest stars would be a play on a character on a real singer that you know, which

1661
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:36,920
always current that CEC and who could be more current in 1977 than Elton John and Glenn Camel.

1662
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:42,920
That's good. I like that. I hear that new Bruce Springsteen record is real heavily Glenn Camel.

1663
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:53,960
Yeah, Glenn Camel. Yeah. Bruce Skunkstein. Yeah, sure. And those there's no pictures of those.

1664
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:59,160
No, those never got built. Those never existed. There was like a PR material saying when Camel

1665
01:42:59,160 --> 01:43:04,680
is coming. That's a let down. Imagine going back being like any day now.

1666
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:13,640
Child is calling the restaurant. Like, hey, is Glenn there? The us of 1977. That sounds like it

1667
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:18,920
would be like if they did like one of the live characters that that would be a two person suit

1668
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:23,960
to Glenn Camel. Probably. Yeah, you'd have to one person would have to be his ass.

1669
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:32,520
Gary looked in that hump. Yeah, for sure. So yeah, as I was saying before, the current Chucky

1670
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:38,600
YouTube is very active. Yes. They posted two days ago, five days ago. Five days ago is when that

1671
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:44,120
salad bar thing came out. Wow. Like that's new. And they are very active. There's these cute little

1672
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:52,840
I got push notifications on. There's these cute little puppets they use now. And there's a lot of

1673
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:57,000
there's a lot of first of all, dances. I won't we won't get into them, but they make up a lot of

1674
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:03,400
dances. I think that's just a prep for the for the new stuff. Yeah. Trying to like, I mean, look,

1675
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:08,520
and just the drawing, they're all so much sexier than they used to be. This is like, I mean,

1676
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:15,080
they're like CGI. Yeah, those are the CGI versions. Yeah. Yeah. Current Munch is real creep. I don't

1677
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:21,320
like I don't like Current Munch at all. No, boy. He's got the sonic teeth. Yeah. So let me start.

1678
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:27,720
Munch is sliding into some DMs that he should not be a little too horny. I don't know.

1679
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:35,160
Let me start. Let me start with this. So this is an example of one of my favorite

1680
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:44,920
new Chuck E. Cheese music videos. This is called Rockin' Robot. And Chuck, look at the outfit Chuck

1681
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:51,160
is wearing. Someone describe it. It's like a big it's like an open red hoodie and a chain.

1682
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:57,160
What was there a style equivalent? Yeah, I'm trying to think what how you would describe it.

1683
01:44:57,160 --> 01:45:02,200
It's like a sleeveless sweatshirt. I'm ready to get into I mean, I feel like this is almost an

1684
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:11,080
attempt at some sort of hype beast aesthetic for Chuck, which I'm ready for. Yeah, good next

1685
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:17,160
evolution. Yeah. So this is a taste of what they're doing now. He does have that Xan.

1686
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:55,160
This is like some Silicon Valley pro stem bullshit.

1687
01:45:55,160 --> 01:46:02,120
This would inspire a young Aaron Fector today.

1688
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:14,120
I'm going to fast forward real quick to when the robot gets built in this video and you'll have

1689
01:46:14,120 --> 01:46:20,680
we'll link to this video and there it is. And the robot is terrifying. So I'll fast forward here.

1690
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:28,200
It's playing air guitar or something. Do you think he dabs?

1691
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:36,760
This robot has titties too. He kind of looks like the fish from the shape of water.

1692
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:42,600
Oh, like with a tic tac for a head. I do like the ski board solo.

1693
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:55,320
He said his dad is like twenty five.

1694
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:14,200
Why did this little boy give the robot such a sculpted chest? I don't know. It's again. Yeah tomorrow's

1695
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:23,880
The parents are really proud this Chucky cheese used to encourage you to go into the career of being a dirtbag entertainer

1696
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:26,680
performing for kicks

1697
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:30,200
Yeah, I ran a cabaret. I kind of like the

1698
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:35,240
The Chucky cheese youtube channel, I I like it. I do I like it too

1699
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:41,320
They're churning out content all the damn time. Yeah, it's a fun thing to wake up to

1700
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:47,080
There's a lot of you'll watch new ones as they do like recall any you've seen lately all of them

1701
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:52,920
They're doing some like videos with helen. They'll make comedy videos with pasquale where

1702
01:47:53,540 --> 01:47:55,540
Establishing shot the laffaroni

1703
01:47:55,620 --> 01:48:00,900
Pasquale is always headlining in hotel pizza buns. I like I mostly watch the pasquale videos

1704
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:05,620
There's uh, there's a rip off of deep thoughts with jack handy with munch

1705
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:10,020
Which I don't love which is a weird reference to be making

1706
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:11,060
Yeah

1707
01:48:11,060 --> 01:48:19,700
Well, there's a show loop from a few years ago with the don parto and intro impression introduces pasquale p pizza

1708
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:27,140
Uh hell in any what pie plates I want to make sure you have a new blood in the writing room

1709
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:36,820
So yeah, so there's an l but that is not rock and robot does not appear on the new album, okay

1710
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:42,660
Which is funny because i'm looking at my apple music in the first two it's prince's originals then the munch's make-believe band

1711
01:48:43,140 --> 01:48:45,140
songs in the key of

1712
01:48:45,860 --> 01:48:47,460
e

1713
01:48:47,460 --> 01:48:48,660
Yeah, okay

1714
01:48:48,980 --> 01:48:54,580
Yeah, yeah, that's mike in a nutshell if somebody needed to like just found your phone and needed to write a report about you

1715
01:48:56,420 --> 01:49:01,540
Yep, oh the third thing is patton's greatest speeches very strange very strange

1716
01:49:03,060 --> 01:49:05,060
Patton all right. So

1717
01:49:05,620 --> 01:49:09,460
You'll notice like on this. I won't play all the songs, but a lot of the songs are

1718
01:49:10,660 --> 01:49:14,420
Parody or inspired by like let me get here

1719
01:49:14,420 --> 01:49:16,420
Here

1720
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:24,420
Don't stop so you get enough seemingly and then the chorus is very much like thrillers like it's clearly

1721
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:30,680
Michael jackson is not cancelled in the turkey cheese. No, no, it's too hard to do this song is called. Let's have a party

1722
01:49:38,260 --> 01:49:40,260
This is what timberlake does

1723
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:47,460
Now is he still the singer

1724
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:02,500
And then we have me and my friend

1725
01:50:05,860 --> 01:50:07,860
Oh, hey, this is familiar

1726
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:16,900
Just

1727
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:40,260
They even do the ding

1728
01:50:44,420 --> 01:50:46,420
Just like his name

1729
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:56,980
I mean, this is great. I love this. I'd rather listen to this than uh

1730
01:50:57,540 --> 01:51:04,740
Fucking kids bop where they like actually they take the real song right ripping it off, but they have a song by there's some innovation here

1731
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:11,380
Yeah, yeah, helen has still make it its own thing. Yeah, helen has uncle helen's game in time. Oh game in time

1732
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:13,380
Yeah, i've seen that video

1733
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:16,500
High score

1734
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:30,740
Right another yeah

1735
01:51:44,420 --> 01:51:46,420
Do

1736
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:11,140
That's it's always a good time by owl city. Yeah

1737
01:52:15,060 --> 01:52:17,060
It's always a good time

1738
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:26,040
So they got that so now I like most of this album is there one song I might call problematic

1739
01:52:26,820 --> 01:52:33,460
Yes, it wouldn't be this has been a problematic episode in a little ways. It's called dad try to order a third

1740
01:52:35,620 --> 01:52:38,740
It's not so bad, but maybe I mean you tell me

1741
01:52:39,780 --> 01:52:41,780
You tell me and you'll know

1742
01:52:42,740 --> 01:52:44,740
You'll know exactly what

1743
01:52:55,860 --> 01:53:01,320
I won't even well, I will say it. It's called another chuckie day. So here we go

1744
01:53:08,580 --> 01:53:10,580
That kind of problematic

1745
01:53:11,940 --> 01:53:13,940
Here

1746
01:53:24,420 --> 01:53:30,260
Head on back down. I won't stay in bed, but I found that I just came dally as my day begins

1747
01:53:30,340 --> 01:53:32,980
I got to be a chuckie jesus hanging with my friends

1748
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:38,340
Hop out of bed like a kangaroo. I just make it through all the morning things they got to do

1749
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:42,660
I brush my teeth till I get them both shiny even soaking in the bathtub is where you go

1750
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:50,900
Pizza was the case they gave them

1751
01:53:50,980 --> 01:53:53,460
The next thing you know, I got to go because I

1752
01:54:05,140 --> 01:54:07,140
The guy from bowling for soups

1753
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:13,540
It's reese really the one he could have gotten in there and said i'm gonna pass on that one

1754
01:54:13,700 --> 01:54:20,580
Yeah, I mean it and now try listening to that one bowling for soup song after like hearing any of these chuckie

1755
01:54:21,140 --> 01:54:28,600
It's like so him it's wild right? He's barely changing his voice, right? Oh, he was kind of whiny already springsteen

1756
01:54:32,580 --> 01:54:36,980
Yeah, that was yeah, uh, that's like a cousin of that boys of summer song

1757
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:41,700
Right, so there is another chuckie day

1758
01:54:42,340 --> 01:54:47,540
Lottie dotty chuck likes to party. I have some bad news too chuckie is cancelled pasquale

1759
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:52,980
Unfortunately the famous videos where pasquale teaches you how to make pizza were filmed at the chuckie cheese location

1760
01:54:53,540 --> 01:54:57,720
In texas in a town known as white settlement, texas

1761
01:55:01,460 --> 01:55:06,420
Did not change that name in the night, I don't know has that been changed maybe yeah, let me look that up

1762
01:55:07,300 --> 01:55:10,440
Yeah, i'm gonna roll over to white settlement

1763
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:12,440
Man

1764
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:16,520
Laura ingram just like nodding her head like this good it's tight

1765
01:55:19,320 --> 01:55:23,020
No, it's still oh my still a city in texas

1766
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:29,160
Well, we ended on a dark note I guess uh, well so you talk about the fights

1767
01:55:29,720 --> 01:55:34,040
We talk about all the fights that happen there. Um, one of my favorite facts about chuckie cheese

1768
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:37,820
I learned uh chuckie only went non-smoking in 1993

1769
01:55:38,700 --> 01:55:45,840
Which I guess is about when most restaurants did but in a corporate history it said they did see a drop in business

1770
01:55:47,260 --> 01:55:48,460
I guess

1771
01:55:48,460 --> 01:55:53,900
I think everywhere was slowly starting to go and everywhere did see a drop in business and then rebounded

1772
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:59,980
But that was also made me laugh because that the same year they went non-smoking was also the year they introduced kid check

1773
01:56:00,380 --> 01:56:06,700
Which is the blacklight the hand stamp where they stamp the kid's hands and the parents hands and they have to match

1774
01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:10,940
Before you can leave which is there to this day, which is there to this day

1775
01:56:11,020 --> 01:56:16,540
Don't worry about it. If you're a lone adult you don't need to get stamped. You just get a stamp for fun. Yeah

1776
01:56:19,820 --> 01:56:22,940
Yikes, um, I just I like that if you

1777
01:56:23,820 --> 01:56:24,780
type

1778
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:26,940
Chuckie cheese into youtube you get

1779
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:33,180
Current cute puppet videos about building robots that are a little well done. You also get bizarre

1780
01:56:34,140 --> 01:56:39,900
Charisma charisma free training videos from 1991 you also get some of the scariest fights

1781
01:56:41,340 --> 01:56:45,500
On camera like it's such a wide breadth of content

1782
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:50,220
The one I have so many clips from the fights in march a fight at a pittsburgh chuckie cheese

1783
01:56:50,300 --> 01:56:56,540
I don't know what year it was chuckie cheese involved up to 50 people after an argument between a one-year-old's parents escalated

1784
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:58,140
Oh

1785
01:56:58,140 --> 01:57:04,720
There's only so many people inside a chuckie cheese at any given time which means the one-year-old could have gotten involved

1786
01:57:07,420 --> 01:57:09,420
Don't talk to my parents like that

1787
01:57:11,420 --> 01:57:14,620
Motherfucker sprayed milk in my eyes. You're trash you're trash

1788
01:57:15,980 --> 01:57:19,660
It's like hair yankings that are so like the fights get

1789
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:27,020
Bonkers and another chuckie cheese in brookfield wisconsin two women were arrested following a mass brawl involving 20 people on july

1790
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:32,860
27th the brawl was sparked according to the police by one child taking too long to choose a toy

1791
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:41,740
I don't know the galaxy 5000 doesn't look good to me. It looks like it might be a problematic

1792
01:57:45,420 --> 01:57:48,380
Also, but then you have to with these fights keep in mind that as

1793
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:55,740
Yeah, 50 people are all fighting and deep in the background the trusty munches make-believe band is performing

1794
01:57:56,380 --> 01:57:58,540
Like like none of it's happening. They're like

1795
01:58:03,340 --> 01:58:08,300
They're bar band veterans they've seen everything they don't care they're not even just especially the vegas ones

1796
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:13,180
Yeah, I don't know that like good wi-fi is gonna help the idea of like

1797
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:19,980
Suburban parents just begrudgingly sitting there with a strong wi-fi connection on instagram

1798
01:58:20,140 --> 01:58:25,100
Just like getting mad at their neighbors like I can't believe they got a boat like yeah

1799
01:58:25,980 --> 01:58:32,460
Gassed up, but like whatever suburban parents do on the internet. Oh, she said what I gotta go to the next door

1800
01:58:32,540 --> 01:58:35,180
I'm gonna do some posts on next door and citizen

1801
01:58:35,580 --> 01:58:39,980
There was this is my lab. This is the last one I want to read from there was an abc nightline

1802
01:58:40,460 --> 01:58:46,300
Story about it and it said it had become uh chuck e cheese had become a hot spot for violent brawls between adults

1803
01:58:46,700 --> 01:58:53,100
And they happen mostly at birthday parties police have been called to one location in pennsylvania 17 times in 18 months

1804
01:58:56,140 --> 01:58:58,780
Yet brockton gets the rap as the rough area

1805
01:58:59,260 --> 01:59:06,300
Yeah, it's ridiculous bring back the brockton chuck e cheese bring back whitey bulger at least stuff was organized

1806
01:59:06,860 --> 01:59:09,180
Yeah, let's bring whitey bulger back to life

1807
01:59:10,220 --> 01:59:13,020
Rocky marciano only fought when the bell rang

1808
01:59:14,780 --> 01:59:18,540
Uh, well now some towns are asking chuck e cheese to step into the

1809
01:59:18,860 --> 01:59:25,580
Ring amid pressure from local politicians some chuck e cheeses have stopped serving alcohol and added security guards who carry pistols

1810
01:59:29,180 --> 01:59:35,180
You have to have an armed man or woman holy arm the bots arm the bots

1811
01:59:36,620 --> 01:59:38,620
Reach for the sky

1812
01:59:39,980 --> 01:59:42,460
You're gonna fight me here i'm gonna give you some lead

1813
01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:48,780
Or yeah arm the arm the walk around chuck he's got a little gun

1814
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:55,580
I wonder if they have I wouldn't I okay. How surprised would you be if the walk around chuck had like a knife?

1815
01:59:56,380 --> 02:00:00,940
Not at all. I would not be surprised if they had if they had a knife for their own safety

1816
02:00:01,100 --> 02:00:05,660
Yeah, what if he used it like to cut pizza also? Yeah. Oh that's cover. Yeah

1817
02:00:06,940 --> 02:00:08,940
It says pizza

1818
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:14,140
For pizza for nothing else. Yeah. Yeah, that's a fine

1819
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:20,460
But like walk around chuck e doing that like fake, you know would do the split sometimes do the like almost split

1820
02:00:20,780 --> 02:00:24,380
Yeah in those videos just like doing the split and their gun goes off

1821
02:00:27,180 --> 02:00:30,700
My favorite part of the walk around chuck e is if you watch, you know

1822
02:00:30,700 --> 02:00:35,660
Because he'll come out once every like 15 minutes or something. I'll count down to it in the restaurant

1823
02:00:35,900 --> 02:00:41,660
He'll come out he'll do his bit children will chase him around the restaurant and then he'll you know

1824
02:00:41,660 --> 02:00:46,700
I like the two seconds that chuck he thinks that he's no longer inside of the people and he drops the act

1825
02:00:46,860 --> 02:00:53,340
You see the shoulders fall and you just see someone like go back to just take the head off for 10 minutes

1826
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:55,340
wait

1827
02:00:55,340 --> 02:00:56,700
Anytime

1828
02:00:56,700 --> 02:01:03,020
Anytime you see like a performer switch. I that's my favorite thing. I'll never forget the the time I saw

1829
02:01:03,820 --> 02:01:09,500
Uh in storyland in new hampshire when I was little uh, cinderella on a smoke break and that like

1830
02:01:10,300 --> 02:01:12,300
Fucked me up. Oh, yeah, that's yeah

1831
02:01:12,620 --> 02:01:20,140
And my mom was like she's just like me like she was really trying to be like she smokes misty menthol 120s as well

1832
02:01:20,780 --> 02:01:22,780
Oh, man

1833
02:01:26,380 --> 02:01:32,860
Just to give everyone a heads up if you were wondering are there posts of concealed carry advocates may

1834
02:01:33,020 --> 02:01:37,420
That chuckie says please no weapons in our store. The answer is yes

1835
02:01:41,020 --> 02:01:44,540
A right unexercised is a right denied

1836
02:01:47,020 --> 02:01:49,660
Says this one says munch

1837
02:01:52,380 --> 02:01:58,800
A right on exercise here's a here's a new story on guns.com

1838
02:01:59,680 --> 02:02:01,680
No

1839
02:02:02,640 --> 02:02:08,000
Some guys just pumping their fists a decade ago going like yes, I got the I got guns.com. Yes

1840
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:12,980
For more information about my thoughts about freedoms and liberties

1841
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:24,480
Wow, yeah, I don't know what a place what an evolution the pizza wars came and went before any of us were born

1842
02:02:25,120 --> 02:02:26,000
and

1843
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,040
now we're left with just one hub for

1844
02:02:29,680 --> 02:02:36,400
Uh hair pulling and gun violence and inedible food. I wonder do we think there could be another pizza war?

1845
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:44,320
Like very famously like professional wrestling is we used to have monday night wars and now there's a new company that's going to challenge them

1846
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:46,960
Very soon and there's going to be more war like

1847
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:50,400
Wars are great when they're not real wars

1848
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:58,400
Sure, yeah business wars are fantastic fun to watch because the only losers are people who have money anyways

1849
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:05,440
So it doesn't matter low stakes. Yeah, I would love I would love for there to be more pizza wars

1850
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:13,120
I feel like if there was like a very modern version of chuckie cheese. Yes, cool. Like if they made it like a

1851
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:18,240
Not laser taggy, but like they have all those vr experiences now

1852
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:26,000
Yeah, gaming arena is a phrase i've heard a lot lately. I don't i'm afraid to inquire more

1853
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:32,160
Dave and busters has been around for a long time. Obviously, that's the adult version of it, but there's got to be some way

1854
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:36,160
To do a more modern version for aimed more at kids

1855
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:41,120
well if we also it'd be great if there was a re schism and like we start if we

1856
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:46,320
Became chuckie cheese franchisees and switched it back to the bowler hat and he's with rad now

1857
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:49,360
And then that grew and other people were with us and others were against us

1858
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:54,800
But there's another some of the chuckie cheeses all split and all press is good press. Yeah

1859
02:03:55,600 --> 02:03:58,160
Could we are you a gun chuckie cheese or not?

1860
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:01,360
Well, we'll have to be a gun chuckie cheese

1861
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:05,040
I think because we just have to get more people in and that'll be at a track that'll be part of it

1862
02:04:06,160 --> 02:04:10,880
Bring your gun put it on the table. We don't care. Uh-huh. Yeah rick raps got four of them

1863
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:14,720
And then we will just go against the corporate

1864
02:04:15,120 --> 02:04:23,040
Mandate and change all the things and we can bring back the sky. What's her name sachet skunk? Oh sally sachet sally sachet. Thank you

1865
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:27,760
Yeah, absolutely. Yes, we can just start throwing the elven sky each bowser's are back

1866
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:34,080
Yeah, if we round up all the like new the the animatronic people and get let's get factor back on board. You're back in hey

1867
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:42,480
Storm in the country company factors. He's still in florida with the animatronics and now he helps throw he he is a thriving youtube channel

1868
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:50,720
And he has he lets people do birthday parties kids from orlandale can do five nights at freddy's themed birthday parties

1869
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:58,320
The haunted animatronics factory, right? Oh, yes. That was a big resurgence for them was five nights for freddy

1870
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:02,080
Yeah, a big hit. I don't know if that movie is actually going to happen or not

1871
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:08,960
But it would be I feel like the animatronic they would they they will rue the day the animatronics left if that ever worked out

1872
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:11,600
Right. Yeah, they'll be so relevant again

1873
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:15,040
Yeah, and erin's factory is the place to make it

1874
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:20,000
I mean it is pretty much doing fine except when everything exploded because he was inventing a

1875
02:05:20,620 --> 02:05:22,620
experimental fuel called

1876
02:05:22,700 --> 02:05:24,700
Carbohydrillion

1877
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:27,700
That sounds like um marvel

1878
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:36,100
Throw some words scary words invented carbo carbo hydrillion

1879
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:40,880
Write it down. It's got to be printed an hour ago

1880
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:49,600
There's a lot of there's talk now there's been talk but there's now another article a round of articles about toys of rust coming back

1881
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:55,920
Oh, but there's a little talk. Yeah already. I mean everything is just a big shell game toys of rust basically

1882
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:58,560
bane capital saddled it with

1883
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:01,440
So much debt even though it was making money

1884
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:05,840
It couldn't pay off of its debt and then everybody from bane capital just made a ton of money

1885
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:11,520
Then they still own everything and they just could like it's just they're waiting for the right time to go back

1886
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:16,480
So they didn't lose so much money that it's all just a business. All everyone's a big crook. Anyway

1887
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:21,520
They're talking about so nobody ever lost love or faith in jeffrey

1888
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:26,000
No, people love jeffrey. The only people that got hurt were the employees of toys of rust

1889
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:31,920
Like the people in charge all made a lot of money and then yeah, yeah, it sucks

1890
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:35,440
But anyway, they're talking about bringing toys of rust back, which I think it will

1891
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:41,600
They're they've already rebranded as jeffrey's toy box and there's weird kiosks and croakers

1892
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:45,200
So like what they're just already trying to get some money

1893
02:06:46,080 --> 02:06:50,240
